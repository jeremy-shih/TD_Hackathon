[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Mr. Wit Davis, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary for FLIR Systems.","Thank you. Mr. Davis, you may begin.","William W. Davis","Good morning, everyone. Before we begin this conference call, I need to remind you that other than statements as to historical fact, statements made on this conference call are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on our current expectations. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, believes, estimates, and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. All of these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Please refer to the press release we issued earlier today for a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecast. The forward-looking statements we make today speak as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","Let me now turn the call over to Earl Lewis, Chairman and CEO of FLIR Systems. Earl?","Earl R. Lewis","Thank you, Wit, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to FLIR's Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. In the fourth quarter, we earned $0.52 per share on revenues of $386 million. And for the year, we earned $1.45 per share.","2012 proved to be a demanding year for many of our businesses. However, we used this difficult environment to improve our business. We focused on building a strong backlog of orders from a global base of customers, shifting selling efforts from Europe to the Far East and reducing our tax rates and our overhead cost in a meaningful way. We have rationalized our operating centers, improved our gross margins and introduced strategic pricing and many efficiency improvements in our businesses.","In addition, we have lowered our equity capital and acquired 2 accretive, highly strategic businesses. These changes will create operating leverage that positions us for a more FLIR-like performance in 2013.","Some of these actions helped us in the fourth quarter, where we reduced our SG&A spending by 11% compared to last year. Our Commercial Systems division had its highest operating margin in nearly 10 years, and our Government Systems business increased its margin sequentially for the third quarter in a row.","Our business continues to generate significant amounts of cash, with Q4 operating cash flow approximately 150% of our net income and nearly 130% for the year. We used this cash to invest in our long-term future as a company, as well as return capital to our shareholders through the repurchase of 4.5 million of our shares during the fourth quarter, which brings our total repurchase for the year to 10.5 million.","Additionally, we closed on the acquisitions of Lorex and Traficon during the last 2 weeks of 2012. We are excited about both businesses, Lorex with their consumer retail Internet and professional distribution and high-volume product development capabilities; and Traficon for their strong presence in traffic monitoring systems and image analytics. We expect these acquisitions to both be accretive in 2013.","We believe that 2013 will be strong from a cost and profitability perspective, and we're very optimistic we will see a return to top line growth as we introduce new products and continue to increase the value-to-price ratio of our technologies. While our commercial markets have been impacted by some of the macroeconomic factors that are illustrated by housing starts, unemployment and industrial production, we see signs that stabilization has begun and are hopeful for a modest recovery.","Government Systems backlog is stronger than it was a year ago, and we continue to see good opportunity pipelines for our products, especially in the advanced security applications around the world.","Today, we announced our outlook for 2013. We are expecting revenue between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion for the full year and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.56 to $1.66.","I'm going to now turn the call over to Andy Teich, who's going to discuss the performance of the Commercial Systems division. Andy?","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Earl. The Commercial Systems division finished the fourth quarter with a 5% decline in revenue compared to the prior year. Division operating margin increased over 1 percentage point year-over-year to reach a record high of 30%. This is a result of focused efforts to maintain gross margins and control overhead cost.","Regionally, the Asia region grew 5% when compared to the fourth quarter of last year. However, our Americas and EMEA regions declined 3% and 13%, respectively.","Revenue in the TVM and Raymarine segments declined 5% and 7%, respectively, versus the fourth quarter of 2011. These declines were driven primarily by weaknesses in the EMEA region. Both segments increased their operating margins both sequentially and versus the prior year as we controlled overhead and selling expenses.","Overall, Commercial Systems division bookings dollars for the quarter were up just over 1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. The Americas and APAC regions grew their fourth quarter bookings dollars 7% and 12%, respectively. But that growth was offset by the EMEA region, which declined 11%.","Full year 2012 bookings for the division were down 3% versus 2011, again, with EMEA driving the decline.","Fourth quarter bookings dollars in the TVM segment increased 2% over prior year. TVM's Thermography line of business saw bookings dollars grow 6% in the fourth quarter, the first year-over-year growth in the Thermography business since the third quarter of 2011. Also, the fourth quarter represented the highest-ever bookings dollars quarter for the Thermography business. The primary driver of the Thermography bookings growth in the quarter was strong demand for our premium line of cameras, largely driven by demand for our new T-Series of products.","TVM's Cores & Components bookings dollars grew 13% compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Strong growth in uncooled cores, including our Quark core, was partially offset by weakness in our higher-priced cool cores. All 3 of the cores' geographic regions posted double-digit bookings growth over the fourth quarter of last year, with Asia Pacific growing nearly 30%.","Bookings dollars in TVM's security line of business declined significantly compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. Approximately $8 million of this decline was attributable to activity in Q4 of 2011  for oil platform security and border programs that did not reoccur in 2012.","That said, the total number of units booked in the security line of business grew 30% and hit an all-time high. This demonstrates the evolving nature of our security business, where a growing percentage of our sales will be coming from uncooled cameras and the business becomes less dependent on higher-end security projects for things such as border security, all while maintaining our gross margins.","The addition of Lorex will be another step in this direction as we are actively investing to significantly reduce the cost, and thus enable, wide adoption of thermal imaging. Lorex's do-it-yourself camera systems, along with their integrator quality systems, will provide an avenue to integrate these increasingly affordable thermal technologies into a very large number of sockets.","As Earl mentioned, the addition of Traficon represents another important strategic step for FLIR. Prior to the acquisition, we had a small but rapidly growing traffic business within our security line of business. Given the considerable opportunity we see in furthering thermal into roadway monitoring markets, we intend to create a new line of business called FLIR ITS, or Intelligent Traffic Systems, that will be focused on this effort.","Both of these acquisitions ultimately support our strategy of creating a fully-automated thermal and visual security camera product family that can be used in a wide variety of consumer and industrial applications.","To that end, our low-cost, high-volume, next-generation camera core development has been progressing well. This development should enable an order of magnitude in cost reduction and a similar order of magnitude increasing unit volumes. This development, which has been ongoing for 2 years now, will allow us to begin shipping a new class of products in early 2014. We expect this development to allow us to both leverage the price elasticity in our existing markets and to explore several new applications where high-resolution imaging is not necessarily needed. These applications include low-end security, Personal Vision Systems, building control, automation and transportation systems.","TVM's Maritime business saw a 30% decline in bookings during the quarter. This dropoff was primarily due to a tough comparison to Q4 last year, where we booked an unusual number of our high-end Voyager systems. Stripping out this effect, the Maritime business bookings dollars grew in the high-single digits.","The Personal Vision Systems line grew year-over-year bookings dollars over 40% and bookings units over 60% during the quarter. All regions contributed to this growth, but the products sold particularly well internationally. For the full year of 2012, PVS was our fastest-growing line of business, and we're very enthusiastic about new products that are under development to further penetrate the first responder, outdoor enthusiast and other consumer markets.","Raymarine bookings dollars declined 1% versus the fourth quarter of 2011. Bookings to OEM boat builders again declined, as the demand for new boats continues to be soft, but this channel was offset by stronger demand for Maritime electronics wholesalers. Raymarine's EMEA regions bookings declined 9% in the quarter, which was partially offset by 5% growth in the Americas and double-digit growth in Asia Pacific.","The introduction of the a65, a67 and e165 helped drive multifunction displays bookings growth during the fourth quarter, and we are looking forward to shipping our Draganfly MFD for the freshwater market to bolster our product offering and reach a broader spectrum of boaters.","That concludes my summary of the Commercial Systems business, and I'd like to now pass the call over to Bill Sundermeier, who will discuss the results of our Government Systems division. Bill?","William A. Sundermeier","Thanks, Andy. During the year, we made a series of difficult decisions to rightsize our operations and reduce costs. These actions helped offset lower revenue during 2012, but also positioned Government Systems for operating leverage in the future. As procurement sluggishness continues, we're watching the U.S. Defense budget situation closely and are hopeful for better resolution to clear up the uncertainty that overhangs our business. In the meantime, we have conservatively aligned our business to reflect a cautious view towards the U.S. budget situation for 2013.","In Q4, divisional revenue declined 4% versus the prior year, which represents our best performance since the fourth quarter of 2010 when you exclude the newly acquired ICx revenue in that quarter. As expected, bookings were below revenue, given the seasonally slow fourth quarter, but were higher than the fourth quarter of 2011 by 9%. For the full year, bookings in the division were up 8% over 2011.","Backlog ended 2012 at $356 million, which represents a 13% increase over last year.","Operating margin for the Government Systems division continue to improve sequentially, reaching over 28% in the quarter, highlighted by a record operating margin in the Integrated Systems segment and stable sequential margins in the Surveillance segment.","The Surveillance segment finished the quarter with backlog of $261 million. Surveillance book-to-bill of 0.8 was the highest fourth quarter ratio since 2008. Our international markets contributed 55% of Surveillance segment bookings in the fourth quarter, as our initiatives to build out our worldwide sales staff bear fruit.","The largest order in the Surveillance segment during the quarter was for over $17 million to outfit the fixed-wing aircraft of the Afghan Air Force with several of our Star SAFIRE III gimbals. We also won a $12 million contract to support the Brazil police force's security initiatives for the upcoming World Cup and Olympic Games. We were awarded a $4 million award to outfit Canada's Special Operations Command with technical thermal scopes. A $3 million award for our Star SAFIRE HD systems for the Turkish Land Forces shows our growing presence in Turkey, which historically has been a sole source market for another company.","These orders are an example of how our customer and countries list continues to expand as a result of our diversifying sales organization and a growing set of high-quality, high-value products. This has been a key element of our strategy, and we will continue to invest our own dollars to innovate cutting-edge products and to build out our global reach.","While the presidential election and sequestration dialogue impacted the pace and timing of RFPs, schedules and orders from Surveillance's U.S. customers, we were able to book awards that illustrated how ISR products remained a mission-critical, force-multiplying solution. For example, we won a $10 million contract from the Marine Corps for our Recon man-portable imaging units. We also booked a $5 million with the U.S. Navy for gimbal systems for use by the Navy's specific fleet. Additionally, the Army MEDEVAC program again showed to be a key customer of our long-range thermal imaging technology, with an order worth over $3 million.","The Detection segment ended the year with $24 million in backlog and finished 2012 a different business than it was when the year had begun. During the year, we consolidated Detection's operating footprint from 7 locations to 3 and added new management to advance CBRNE technologies to improve productivity and expand worldwide distribution.","We also drove down the amount of low-margin contract R&D in the Detection segment by $17 million during the year, which was the reason segment revenues were down, but is consistent with our strategy to focus our sales and engineering workforce on products rather than cost-plus R&D.","Bookings activity during the quarter included over $2 million in orders for our IBAC air monitors from several customers in the U.S., India, China, Russia and Germany. We received several orders for our Fido explosive detectors, a large percentage of which were from the U.S. Army under our program of record. Detection's radiation products continue to sell into many international markets, and the technology is involving and opening up some new, interesting applications.","Our goal for the Detection segment for 2013 is to improve profitability by leveraging an improved cost structure, expanding international distribution, further decreasing the amount of contract R&D in the business and introducing new, higher-margin products.","The Integrated Systems segment had its best quarter from a revenue and profitability standpoint since we acquired the business as part of our 2010 ICx acquisition. Revenues more than doubled compared to Q4 of 2011 and operating margin reached 16%.","Integrated Systems finished the year with a backlog of $71 million. Significant orders during the fourth quarter included a $7 million booking from the Qatar Ministry of Defense for 3 of our new MVSS trucks, which is the international version of our MSC surveillance system.","Integrated Systems also booked an airport security project with the City of Vancouver airport that continues our momentum in the advanced security systems for integral entry points around the globe.","On the software side, the segment continues to prove its command and control system capabilities, with the nearly doubling of its orders over the prior year, including a project for the Los Angeles Metro Transit Authority.","During the quarter, we also began shipping our DRC chemical warfare detection units under the $27 million order received from the U.S. Army in Q3.","That concludes my comments on third quarter. Tony Trunzo will now review the fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results in more detail.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Happy to do that. Thanks, Bill. Third quarter consolidated revenue was $386.4 million, 5% lower than the fourth quarter of 2011. International revenue is 53% of the Q4 total, compared with 49% in the fourth quarter of 2011, and was 49% for the year, the highest proportion in more than 10 years. Sales to the U.S. Government represented 28% of total revenue in Q4, compared to 24% of total revenue in the fourth quarter of last year. The Lorex and Traficon acquisitions, which closed on December 20 and December 28, respectively, did not contribute any revenue in Q4.","Consolidated Q4 gross margin was 51 -- 53.1%, compared to 55.5% in the fourth quarter last year, and consolidated operating margin of 25.9% was 1.2 percentage points lower than Q4 of 2011. Lower gross and operating margins were attributable to the Surveillance segment, which posted Q4 income of $45.3 million and segment operating margins of 33.2%, 7 percentage points lower than Q4 of last year. Less favorable product mix comprised almost all of the decline, as operating expenses were down from last year.","TVM segment operating income of $61.6 million was down 2.5% from last year, but segment operating margin improved 80 basis points to a record 34.2%, due to a 9% reduction in operating costs.","Raymarine earned $1.2 million in operating income for the quarter, compared to breakeven last year, due to an 18% reduction in operating expenses.","Integrated Systems segment operating income was $3.9 million, up more than 150% compared to last Q4, due to much higher revenue, partly offset by lower gross margins.","The Detection segment reported $300,000 in operating income, a $1 million improvement from last Q4's operating loss of $700,000.","Overall, selling, general and administrative expenses declined by 11% compared with Q4 of last year. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation in the quarter were $121 million, down 8% from the prior year.","For the full year 2012, consolidated revenue declined by 9% to $1.4 billion. TVM segment revenue declined by 5% to $628 million and represented 44.7% of total revenue for the year. Raymarine revenue was $158.2 million compared with $171.5 million in 2011. Surveillance segment revenue of $486.4 million represented a decline of 16% for the year. Detection contributed $63.3 million in revenue, down 21% from last year, due to much lower contract R&D revenue. Integrated Systems reported a 27% increase in revenue to $69.5 million. International revenue represented a record 48.9% of the 2012 total, continuing a 4-year upward trend, while sales to the U.S. Government represented 26.6% of the annual total, the lowest percentage since 2003.","Full year gross margin was 52% compared to 53.7% last year, largely due to fixed-cost absorption and mix changes in Surveillance.","TVM reported 2012 operating income of $171.3 million, down from $194.7 million, and Raymarine segment operating income declined by 6% to $11.2 million for the year. Surveillance segment operating income was $160.2 million compared with $208.5 million in 2011. Detection posted operating income of $1.1 million compared to a loss of $5.6 million in 2011, while Integrated Systems operating income tripled to $5.2 million. 2012 EBITDA plus stock comp was $387 million or 27.5% of revenue.","Full year selling, general and administrative expenses were 21% below 2011, reflecting substantial cost reductions across all operating segments. We expect to continue our focus on reducing costs and improving efficiency in 2013 and beyond.","Our tax expense in Q4 was $19.5 million or 25 -- excuse me, 20% of pretax quarterly income. And for the full year, our tax rate came in at 22.8%. The fourth quarter tax expense reflected downward adjustments to the full year based on reconciliation of estimated tax expense booked in the first 3 quarters of the year. Going forward, we expect our tax rate to be approximately 25%.","Cash provided by operations for the fourth quarter was $112.9 million, equal to 146% of net income. For the full year, cash provided by operations was $285.5 million and 128% of net income, both records for FLIR.","During Q4, share repurchases totaled $85.2 million, capital expenditures were $18.9 million, and we invested $105.9 million in 2 strategic acquisitions.","Our year-end cash balance of $321.7 million leaves us with ample flexibility to continue to invest in our business, return meaningful capital to shareholders and make strategic acquisitions, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit rating.","During Q4, we purchased 4.5 million shares of our stock at an average price of $18.84 per share, including a 3 million share block transacted privately at $18.55. For all of 2012, we repurchased 10.5 million shares of our stock at an average price of $20.47 per share.","Yesterday, our board approved a new authorization for the purchase of up to 25 million shares over the next 2 years. We expect to utilize a portion of this authorization during 2013. But as always, the actual amount of any repurchases are dependent on the prevailing share price. Of note, since inception in 2003, we have repurchased 47 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $16.44, representing a program to-date internal rate of return of 26%.","As Earl stated earlier, we announced our revenue and earnings per share outlook for 2013 today. We currently expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.6 billion, reflecting an increase of between 7% and 14%, and earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.56 to $1.66, representing an increase of 8% to 14%.","This outlook assumes some modest recovery in the global economic outlook, as well as approximately $100 million in revenue from Lorex and Traficon. We see continued risk in our government markets, but are encouraged by the growth trends in both bookings and backlog.","Finally, we announced a 29% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.09 per share, reflecting our continued confidence in FLIR's future. It's actually $0.09 per share per quarter. This increase represents a modest payout ratio of approximately 20% and keeping with our view of the dividend as one component of a larger strategy whereby we position the payout ratio at a level that provides ample funds for strategic growth and share repurchase.","The first quarter dividend will be paid on March 8 to holders of record as of February 19.","This concludes the summary of our fourth quarter and annual financial results. I'll now turn the call back over to Earl.","Earl R. Lewis","Thank you, Tony. In the fourth quarter, both our divisions grew their bookings compared to the prior year, with Government Systems leading the way with 9% growth. Total company backlog is $64 million higher than it was at the end of 2011. This was in the face of global -- governmental budget cloudiness and significant economic uncertainty. We operate our businesses by managing those things that we can control, things like productivity, pricing, overhead costs, facilities and the like. I commend our people for doing just that, and in turn, establishing a business that is very well positioned for continued competitive financial success. We welcome the employees of Lorex and Traficon to FLIR, and we look forward to 2013.","And with that, operator, we'd like to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Noah Poponak of Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So can you tell us what's in the 2013 guidance for continued share repurchase going forward?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. We won't tell you the exact number, but we have some in our budget, planned purchases. We, of course, haven't established the budget based on a lot of purchases because we don't know what the price will be, but we did put some in.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So it's not just the new authorization divided by 2, given that it's 2 years. It's not that?","Earl R. Lewis","No, no. We wouldn't do that, no.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, appreciate the comment that the guidance assumes a modest improvement in the macro and continued risk in government. I don't know if you'll get as scientific as telling us the specific organic rates for each segment that's in the 2013 guidance, but maybe if you could just give a little bit more color on what we should be looking for there?","Earl R. Lewis","Well, in our internal thinking relative to growth, it's not a big number in either segment. We're not planning on a lot of growth in either one, frankly. But that's for budgeting purposes, that's to put together our cost, to put together our plans. I think we're relatively conservative in our estimate of the growth. I mean, you can do the numbers as well as I can, Noah. We've got $100 million coming out of acquisitions, and what we did this year, and you can interpolate, and you're less than 10%, that's for sure, on existing businesses.","Operator","Our next question is from Jeremy Devaney of BB&T Capital Markets.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Looking at the margin, segment profitability jumped around quite a bit over the last couple of quarters. This quarter, we saw segments all profitable for the first time sequentially. Can you take us through where you see Detection, Integrated Systems and Raymarine operating margin going forward?","Earl R. Lewis","Well, in our thinking, they will improve slightly next year -- this year. Not giant, but they will all improve slightly. We entered 2013 with a very good, I think, cost background. So we anticipate, with not a lot of growth on the top line, some improvement.","Anthony L. Trunzo","And Jeremy, the -- it's Tony. The one segment that's probably going to be most challenged in terms of improving the margin percentage is Integrated Systems, because we've got some margin challenges in a couple of the programs there. Having said that, margin dollars should grow meaningfully because we see pretty good revenue growth in that segment, given the backlog it has.","Earl R. Lewis","What Tony is referring to is we had, actually, an inherited part of our backlog when we bought ICx, that we had at a relatively low margin. We'll have to ship that during the year. That's the one exception to the -- my comment I made.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","That's the R&D work that they used to do, I'm assuming. Moving on, though, and looking at the U.S. Government business, in particular. You guys continue hitting singles and some doubles in there, but there don't really seem to be any needle-moving programs that are driving the business.","Are there any re-competes in FY '13? Or are there any programs in excess of $10 million scheduled to end in '13 and are there any programs that you're currently tracking in excess of $50 million? And then also, what does your guidance incorporate in terms of any DoD CR and\/or sequestration taking effect?","Earl R. Lewis","Bill, why don't you tackle that? I just have a general comment. In terms of large programs, J2 is a very large program, and we don't know exactly whether it will get funded this year. The MSC program is well over $100 million, of which we know we have roughly $30 million so far. I'm very hopeful that whatever comes out of Washington, although we haven't built it into these numbers, will involve additional border security, where we have, as I mentioned a $110 million current IDIQ, $30 million that we ship in the first half. Bill, you want to comment on additional big programs?","William A. Sundermeier","Sure. We're currently tracking opportunities that are greater than $10 million and fewer in the greater than $50 million category. So there are still some large programs out there. Earl is talking about programs that we have in hand with large IDIQs like MSC. But there are some new programs out there that we're tracking which are definitely greater than $10 million in size and multiple. But we've really looked at this year very hard and been very conservative, assuming that we're probably going to be under a continuing resolution for this year. It's going to make procurement sluggishness continue, and we'll see what happens with sequestration. But we've tried to build a large amount of conservatism into our model, given that we're going to have a lot of headwind this year as well.","Earl R. Lewis","I don't think there's anything in our planning this year that's a $50 million contract.","William A. Sundermeier","Not that we expect to happen, to make this [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Ciarmoli of KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe just to stay on that topic of the contracting environment. What's the level of IDIQ contract exposure you have? I kind of ask that in the context of, if sequestration happens or the budget really gets tight, it seems like those contracts are going to be more vulnerable because there's no termination fees associated with them. So you assigned -- if you could maybe just us walk through your probability of assessing execution on those contracts in this environment?","Earl R. Lewis","Just a general comment, I'll let Bill talk. But none of -- no IDIQ contracts in our backlog. The only thing in our backlog would be, where we have truly an order that isn't cancelable, I'll put it that way. So the question is what additional funding might we get against some of those orders. I don't think we've factored a lot of that into our planning for this year. We factored some, for sure, but not a lot. Bill, you want to comment?","William A. Sundermeier","Sure. The -- when it comes to IDIQ, you said tracking total size of that, we don't -- and we told you -- don't have that here, we can get that for you. But in this case, as Earl said, we don't count that IDIQ quantity, and there are very few that we're anticipating on add-ons in the IDIQ space. What's fascinating is a lot of our IDIQs are in the area of security and Department of Homeland Defense as compared to pure military, which, I think, has a much more capable way of surviving through this as compared to a military IDIQ.","Earl R. Lewis","I mean, just in general, our philosophy on this is that buying ICx, et cetera, was to get into more the security side of chem, bio, for example. And I think that -- my thinking, anyway, is that, that has a higher probability of continuing to be purchased as it's essentially antiterrorist-type equipment as opposed to some offensive military equipment.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, that make sense. That make sense. And then maybe one quick one for Tony. What -- I may have missed this. What's the expected free cash flow conversion for '13?","Anthony L. Trunzo","We should see cash flow from operations be somewhere in the same zone, I would think, that it is this year. We don't typically guide to that. This year, we converted cash flow from operations compared to net income at a 128% rate. That's been as good as it's been for FLIR. I think we'd like to see it be up in that same range again in 2013.","Operator","The next question is from Peter Arment of Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just maybe a question for Bill, I guess. Everyone is focused on your overall kind of government exposure, which -- could you remind us, I think the last quarter was down to something like 29% to direct DoD. But what I'm more interested in is most of the cuts seem to be targeting the Army. So how do you split your mix with the company?","William A. Sundermeier","Actually, the DoD piece in Q4 was 20% of total revenue.","Earl R. Lewis","We failed miserably to penetrate the Army.","William A. Sundermeier","We have really focused in the last year or so to get broad, and we have a very strong order book this year internationally. So we've heavily factored our U.S. DoD business and expect lumpiness in that space. And so we've been really pushing more into federal DHS in the U.S. as well as international markets. So the way we're going to stay on top of this is to bring things abroad and cover any gaps that we might have in the U.S. DoD space.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on Lorex and Traficon. If we look at these markets, when do you see thermal technology really being adopted in a larger -- on a larger scale in these markets?","Andrew C. Teich","Jim, it's Andy. So on Traficon, it's pretty much right away. We're selling -- we developed last year a camera specific to the traffic market and they're being deployed. You'll see many of them in the state of California, where we all are today. And those are being integrated today, together with Traficon, what they call VIP, their video image processing platform. Down the road, in the fall of 2013, you'll see a product get released that will be an integrated thermal plus Traficon back-end video analytics processing system, all-in-one package, which is the way the Europeans tend to like to buy the product. In the U.S., it's typically split cameras and back end processes are separate. Relative to Lorex, that's going to be a longer-term effort, and you will first see thermal deploy under the -- what is now known as the Digimerge brand, which is Lorex's integrator class or professional-grade, install product. Those will come out under the FLIR brand and that will be in Q3 of 2013. You probably won't see a Lorex branded product with thermal in it until likely the second half of 2014, when the low-cost sensor development that I spoke about in the prepared comments becomes available.","Earl R. Lewis","Andy, just a quick second, explain why it's better for traffic.","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, it's really a -- it's a very compelling value proposition there. Today, in traffic, the common solution is to use visible cameras. And visible cameras have issues with sun glint, sunrise, sunset, fog, haze, shadows, headlights. Those are all issues. And the other thing that's becoming quite prevalent and will be a vector that we'll pursue are bicycle detection and pedestrian detection. And California has got a particular initiative going on in that area right now. All of those things are much easier to do with thermal because you don't deal with color, you don't deal with effects of sun glint, sunrise, sunset, obscurants, all of those things go away. You've got a black and white image that's very easy to do analytics on. So I think the group of engineers that we've gotten [indiscernible] right now with the Traficon team are very much looking to develop, looking forward to refine those algorithms for thermal cameras.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And my impression was video-based detectors, it really is -- the penetration has been relatively low for traffic management. It's still -- the ITS market, I think, is still relatively small. I mean, do you have -- would you be willing to give us a sense of how big a market opportunity you think this might be, looking out 3 to 5 years?","Andrew C. Teich","Yes. I don't have specific numbers, but I can tell you what you see when you travel around the world. The use of video at intersections is much more prevalent on the West Coast than it is anywhere else in the U.S. as an example. But if you look at where I come from, Portland, Oregon, or you look in California here, they're quite prevalent. And everything new that's being done is being done with video detection, because it just makes a lot of sense instead of cutting up roads and putting loops in, which are not terribly reliable technologies. And of course, there's also a green element relative to those, because getting vehicles to move in a more fluid and efficient way through intersections reduces idling time at stoplights and so forth, so there is a good angle there on that. The good news here and what you really alluded to is that the penetration rate is still quite low. So the total opportunity, I think, is significant as intersections are developed or upgraded around the world. And that's just one piece of Traficon's business. They also have a segment they call AID, which is automated incident detection, which is highway monitoring for a number of different things, looking for accidents, looking for debris in the road, looking for wrong way travelers on the road. And again, that's much more prevalent in Europe right now, but will become much more broadly used in the U.S. And then you add to that things like imaging in tunnels, which is quite prevalent. And then you've got crosswalk control, which is also another area.","Earl R. Lewis","One other I kind of like is monitoring for animals, which is a big cause of deaths. And in fact, it's the #1 cause in some of the Scandinavian countries, where you can actually align a number of infrared cameras along the side of the road and tell if there's an animal ahead of you. All of these things are, as you point out, future businesses that are pretty good, we think.","Operator","Our next question is from Jonathan Ho of William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just in terms of the $100 million in revenue from acquisitions, could you give us a rough sense of how to think about operating margins for 2013 related to these businesses?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Sure, Jonathan. It's Tony. The -- I think the Lorex numbers were publicly available. That's a fairly low-margin business. They're going to contribute to preponderance to the revenue. They're going to be a fairly low-margin business. Traficon is a software and middleware business and has meaningfully higher margins. It's a 20% of the total -- actually less than 20% of the total of the 2. The 2 acquisitions, for the year, we expect to add a few pennies per share to earnings. So they will, even after taking account of the amortization of the acquisition intangibles, they'll be accretive to earnings this year, but the operating margin is going to be meaningfully less than what you see from the rest of the business. As we move forward, and Andy was just talking about getting thermal technology into Lorex, that should help to lift those margins over time because it will be a significant differentiator in the market. But you're not going to see a lot of that in 2013. It still going to be a pretty low-margin business.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just along the lines of that question. Roughly, what percentage of revenue now will come from non-infrared and non-CBRNE businesses? Just as you guys have added, in terms of distribution capability, just wanted to get a sense from you guys in terms of what portion of the businesses are sort of these non-core products at this point?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Well, it'd be Lorex, Traficon, most of Raymarine and $40-ish million worth of test and measurement sales that's reflected from the Extech acquisition from 2007. Pretty much everything else has a thermal imager on it or a CBRNE piece of equipment on it.","Earl R. Lewis","And all these acquisitions are really meant to increase thermal sales. So they'll start out slow. But hopefully, the percentage increases.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","I guess, Earl, your opening remarks, I wasn't sure if I heard you correct, but it sounds like you're alluding to selective pricing power in different areas. Is that correct?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. We took a good hard look at a lot of our products in the second quarter or early third quarter and did find some areas where we thought we could have some price increases that we started to see a little of that in Q4. And we think we'll see a little more of that next year, it'll come through.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. You don't necessarily care to mention those areas?","Earl R. Lewis","No, I probably don't.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then guys, other contractors certainly are seeing in front of the potential DoD sequestration, some order softness. As you guys here, into February, are you seeing that all thus far or nothing really incrementally negative for you in terms of DoD orders?","Earl R. Lewis","Definitely, we haven't seen a lot of DoD orders so far this year.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Quillin of Stephens Inc.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Andy, could you talk a little bit about the outlook for automotive night vision just over the next few years in terms of the number of OEMs and maybe the chances of getting designed into more mass-market automobiles?","Andrew C. Teich","Sure. So Tim, a couple of things that are going on there. First of all, 2012 was a tough year. In fact, Q4 of '12, the auto business was down by about $5 million for us. So it was -- given that the overall cores business was up, we had to make that up elsewhere. 2013, we have a new OEM coming online, that's Daimler in the S Class, and that will start production in the second half of the year. So we won't see any meaningful effect from that in the first half. There'll be some shipments in Q2 that will start to ramp production there. That's the new Night Vision 3 product. It's unlikely that there will be any other OEMs that will come online in 2013. We may pick up some other Asian lines in 2014. And when I say we, I mean Autoliv. But that's yet to be determined. So they're working a number of different prospects there. I think the thing that's interesting here is that the Night Vision 3 brings 2 fairly useful features into the product line. First is animal detection, which we have not had in the past. And the second is a spotlight function, that automatically directs a LED spotlight from the vehicle to the object that's detected on the side or in the road, which both alerts the driver visually to that and alerts whatever the object is. If it's a person or an animal, they've got a spotlight shined at them so they know that there's a vehicle approaching in a more meaningful way. And I think that from a user perspective, that's going to add to the value proposition of the product. We also hope that prices come down in that market. We've continually reduced our cost, and we hope that, that gets reflected at the vehicle level.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","That sounds very interesting. And then just generally, can you all talk about other acquisitions you might consider? And you've had these series of acquisitions that help open up new vertical markets for you or further penetrate vertical markets. Can you talk about anything else that are opportunities for you to get deeper into through acquisitions?","Earl R. Lewis","No. We did just acquire 2 businesses that we now have to integrate and fix and do a better job with. We do believe that Raymarine, by the way, is now a lot more stable and producing good results. And ICx looks like it's coming around now, so it's moving definitely in the right direction. We've tackled 2 more. And as of right now, I don't see us making an acquisition in the first or second quarter of this year, Tim. Maybe third quarter, fourth quarter, we might. But right now, I wouldn't suggest anything for us in the immediate future.","Operator","Our next question is from Paul Coster of JPMorgan.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Tony, I wonder if you could just tell us whether the Lorex and Traficon businesses contribute meaningfully to either backlog or visibility?","Anthony L. Trunzo","No, there was -- they brought $5-ish million of backlog with them. The Lorex business carries very little backlog. Traficon has a little bit. But as I said, it's a relatively small revenue generator. I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question...","Earl R. Lewis","Well, the visibility. Yes, we see it as roughly $100 million, as we've said, in additional revenue in 2013.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Andy, these businesses, the newly acquired ones, are going into some fragmented markets. I know in traffic violations and road safety camera operations, it's a fairly -- there's a cluster of companies that dominate in managed services and similarly in home security solutions. What's the go-to-market strategy for these businesses? And what is the synergy that FLIR brings to the table in terms of channel?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, first of all, let's talk about traffic. In the traffic case, we don't have -- there's no managed services type of business there that we are engaged in, nor are we involved in law enforcement violation detection and enforcement at all. This is all relative to automated incident detection and what they call stop bar monitoring, which are the cameras that go at intersections. There, you're selling to an integrator and an integrator is selling to a municipality. Traficon has -- is a very well-known brand in that space and is a leader in the space and has a, quite a good distribution network. I would say the only area where Traficon was probably a little bit weak is in the U.S. and frankly, that's where we're strong, because we've been selling traffic cameras there, thermal traffic cameras there now for a couple of years and have developed a pretty strong distribution channel there. So the synergies between the 2 organizations there, I think, is quite strong. And Traficon will roll into our -- be part of the CVS organization, which rolls up into TVM. Moving over to Lorex, there are 2 pieces to Lorex. There's the consumer piece, which is online, big-box, wholesale plus, Costco, BJs, Home Depot, things like that. That's an area where we're not present, for the most part, for FLIR, but we want to be present long term. So there's -- we're quite interested in having that knowledge base come into the company. The second is online. It's the fastest-growing piece of Lorex's business. They've done an outstanding job there. They have a direct link between their online system and SAP, which is the ERP that we're running off of. So we'll carry that back into FLIR. And then the other piece of Lorex is Digimerge, which is a traditional self-integrator business. And interestingly there,  there are kind of 4 large security distributors in the U.S. And today, FLIR is aligned with 2 and Digimerge is aligned with 2, and they're not the same ones. So it now gives us essentially an avenue to use all 4 of those major camera distributors across the FLIR and Digimerge alliance. So I really like the synergy there. Lorex and Digimerge do nothing internationally at all. They're completely North American-based businesses. So as we've done with Extech, we'll carry them over internationally using our existing international distribution network.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur of CRT Capital.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Just a quick question about the weighting of revenue and earnings. For the year, can you talk about, traditionally, you've been back-half weighted in terms of your earnings. Can you talk about how you look at first couple of quarters of 2013?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Well, if you look at our outlook for this year compared to last year and look at the performance last year, the comp that is probably going to be the best, where you're going to see the biggest growth, is going to be Q2. Because Q2 last year was clearly our weakest quarter. But there's no -- other than the typical seasonality in terms of earnings per share, there's no back-end weight to our outlook. In other words, we're not, we haven't said today that the first half is going to be weaker than the second half relative to its, sort of the historical seasonality of the business, and I think that's right. I think when you look at percentage growth quarter-over-quarter, Q2 is going to be the best one that you'll see. And the other ones will be more modest.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can you say the same thing about revenue then too?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes. I guess you can.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, they'll track. They both track, sure.","Operator","The next question is from Jeremy Devaney of BB&T Capital.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","We were just talking about Lorex a little bit, and you continue driving towards high-volume, low-price tag sensors. And I was just curious, this appears to be a bit of a commoditization of your technology. I'm wondering if you could discuss what kind of barriers to entry you have in place to protect your market position, how you maintain or expand margin in those end markets where price or cost is key to customer adoption?","Earl R. Lewis","Boy, you got an hour? Golly. Yes, Andy, you're going to have to talk about that, but each market is different. Just in general, our idea has always been, still is today, that very high volumes of infrared detectors and cameras across multiple channels will be helpful to us in protecting our overall market share and growth in the future. So as we add on distribution, essentially what we've done with these 2 acquisitions, we will also add on significant amounts of revenue of detectors and cameras that are made with infrared equipment, which will, as I think we've pointed out before, continue what we believe is this virtuous cycle to go through every market. Andy, you want to give it a try?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, I think one thing is just to talk about at the top level, I don't feel like thermal imaging technology is commoditized at all at this point. This is very early days in this technology. Microbarometers are probably easier to build than they are to get high-quality imagery from. So even nat-set [ph] barometers are fairly difficult to build. It's a complex MIM structure. But beyond that, the process of calibrating a microbarometer, getting a very high-quality image out of it, in an expeditious way in the manufacturing process is difficult. And it's covered both by intellectual property and trade secrets that FLIR holds. To that end, on the intellectual property side, we've been very aggressive in developing intellectual property over the last 12 months in particular. We have filed a number of patents that we filed in the last 18 months that's been significantly higher than what we had done historically to help protect our technology. And the other thing that's important here is volume. This is a semiconductor process. And the more you build, the less expensive they are. And you want to be the leader on the volume side. And today, we have almost a 3x advantage over anybody else in the market and we intend to maintain that gap.","Earl R. Lewis","That's been our strategy. It continues to be our strategy. And I think the commoditization issue, yes, we understand how Lorex cameras today are -- can be viewed to a certain extent as more commodity. But when they become infrared cameras, they join a new group, if you will. It certainly isn't commoditized. And there, you differentiate and get better prices, et cetera.","Operator","Our final question comes from Peter Skibitski of Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","On your Surveillance outlook for 2013, are you basically thinking U.S. down, Europe down and maybe Middle East and Asia offset. Is that kind of the ballpark there?","Anthony L. Trunzo","For the whole business?","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","For the Surveillance business, correct.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Just for Surveillance. We haven't typically gone there.","Earl R. Lewis","For our total business, we're still thinking Europe will be on the lighter side, and U.S. will be a little bit better and the Far East would be even better. I think that's in total across our company. We do have detailed plans that would go into Surveillance and where we think it will come from. I don't have that handy though. But overall, clearly, we've invested a lot of money this year, 2012, in the Far East, less in Europe and a little more in the U.S. in terms of developing additional channels, additional sales folks. And we haven't really pointed out, I think our R&D was almost 10% of revenue in Q4. It was fairly high, and that's kind of given us some momentum as well on new products into next year, this year.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Can I sneak in one last one? On thermography, the sales declined in the fourth quarter there. Is that the continuing things, like predictive maintenance and advanced R&D systems?","Earl R. Lewis","Those are all very high-end systems that slowed up. But I'd be remiss in not pointing out that our order entry actually was up significantly compared to the year-ago Q4. We took down backlog fairly aggressively a year ago. This year we didn't, so we actually saw some very good signs of increasing orders in our Thermography business.","Andrew C. Teich","We had an all-time high in terms of orders also.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Is the housing market recovery helping that in terms of the home inspection items?","Earl R. Lewis","It will. Whether we can actually pinpoint that or not, I'm not sure. But clearly, we do think that our orders increase when homes -- when the housing market gets better.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","Earl R. Lewis","Well, just thank you all for listening, and we actually are looking forward to this year. It looks like we feel like we've done the right things to prepare for it. We feel like we may have a little wind behind our back compared to last year, and we're looking forward to sharing with you some good results in 2013. Thanks for listening.","Operator","Thank you.

Andy?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you Todd, and thank you everyone for joining us on FLIR's third quarter 2015 earnings call. With Todd and me today is our COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; Chief of Product Strategy, Jeff Frank; and SVP of Corporate Development, Shane Harrison.","Additionally, I would like to introduce our new CFO, Amit Singhi who joined FLIR in August after spending 21 years at Ford where he most recently was the Head of Finance of their global aftermarket parts and service business. We're thrilled to add Amit to the team, and look forward to leveraging his experience in financial reporting, operations, planning and strategy.","I'll start the review this morning of the quarter with Slide 4 of the presentation. We reported third quarter revenue of $382 million and earnings per share of $0.52 which includes a $0.12 per share resulting from a GAAP required reversal of a tax reserve that was determined no longer necessary. Compared to the third quarter of 2014, revenue grew 2% while EPS grew 41%. Excluding restructuring charges and the discrete tax item, third quarter EPS grew 3%.","Foreign exchange continued to be a headwind on revenue in the third quarter. On a constant currency basis, Q3 revenue was up 6% as a strong U.S. dollar resulted in a $14 million reduction in reported revenue. Third quarter operating income excluding restructuring charges was $76 million up 3% over the prior year. Net income in the quarter was aided by the $17.4 million discrete tax item previously mentioned.","Our restructuring efforts that began at the end of the 2013 have led to improved profitability, with year-to-date earnings per diluted share excluding restructuring charges and the Q3 2015 discrete tax item increasing 13% versus the first nine months of 2014, and adjusted operating income growing 14% versus the first nine months of 2014.","Since last quarter, we've introduced several new products in many of our markets. To highlight a few, first, in our Instruments segment, we introduced the T1K series of uncooled high-definition thermal cameras, which effectively created a new upper corner for our Instruments segment value ladder.","Also introduced in the Instruments segment were two new additions to the FLIR branded Test & Measurement product line. The CM174 clamp meter and the MR176 moisture meter each featuring Lepton thermal imaging sensors to deliver our highly differentiated infrared guided measurement on two tools that are main stays for electricians and building professionals.","And in our detection segment, two new ground breaking products were launched, the Fido X2 explosives trace detector brings our advanced chemical detection technology down to a new more accessible price point, and demonstrates a new DNA for our detection product lines which feature modern ergonomic industrial design, a simple intuitive user interface, and lower cost to manufacture.","Detection also introduced the Griffin 410, our newest portable mass spectrometer used for detecting explosives, drugs, chemical warfare agents and environmental pollutants actively in the field rather than waiting for samples to reach the lab.","Moving to Slide 5. In our earnings release today, we updated our outlook for 2015. As a result of soft demand in Europe and in some of our Instruments and maritime end markets, as well as currency impact on profitability, we now expect revenues to come in between $1.52 billion and $1.57 billion for the full-year and earnings per diluted share excluding restructuring to be in the range of $1.76 to $1.81, which includes both the previously mentioned $17.4 million discrete tax benefit in Q3 and an estimated $12 million after tax gain on an investment expected in Q4.","Excluding the restructuring costs, the one-time tax item and the investment gain, we expect fully diluted EPS to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.60. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share, which will be payable on December 4 to shareholders of record as of November 20.","I'll now pass the call over to Amit to review the third quarter financial results. Amit?","Amit Singhi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Andy. Good morning. First of all, I wanted to mention that I'm very excited to join the FLIR team. It's a great company with fantastic technology, products, and people positioned at an inflection point with significant long-term growth potential, very happy to be here. The following discussion on pre-tax operating results for the third quarter and year-to-date excludes restructuring expenses, which totaled $0.3 million and $1.1 million in 2015 and $4.1 million and $16 million in 2014 respectively.","On Slide seven, you'll see a summarized income statement. Despite currency headwinds, our revenue, operating income, operating margin, and EPS improved year-over-year. Third quarter consolidated revenue was $382 million, an increase of 2% compared to the third quarter of 2014. Our surveillance, OEM and emerging markets, security and detection segments reported increases of 5%, 3%, 22%, and 7% respectively in year-over-year revenue.","Our other two segments reported year-over-year decline with Instruments down 9% and Maritime downs 13%. As we've noted earlier in the year, these two segments are most heavily impacted by currency fluctuations. Adjusting for currency impacts, Instruments and Maritime would have shown year-over-year revenue declines of 3% and 4% respectively, driven by competitive pressures in Maritime and market softness in Europe and Latin America. On a unit volumes basis, Instruments and Maritime grew 62% and 40% respectively. Overall revenue would have shown a year-over-year increase of 6% on a constant currency basis.","Regionally, U.S. revenue grew 12% year-over-year. Sales to the U.S. government increased by about $2 million or 2% and represented 21% of total revenue in Q3 for both 2015 and 2014. International revenue was 43% of total revenue in Q3 2015, compared to 49% last year. For the first nine months of 2015, revenue was $1.119 billion, a 2% increase over last year. On a constant currency basis, nine months revenue would have been up approximately 7% year-over-year.","Consolidated Q3 gross margin was 47%, a 2 percentage point decrease compared to last year, primarily driven by gross margin deterioration in the Security segment due to product mix, as well as overall changes in segment mix and the negative impact of changes in exchange rates.","Operating income and margin improved slightly year-over-year despite adverse currency effect. We reported a tax benefit of $1.9 million in the third quarter, primarily due to a $17.4 million favorable discrete tax item related to the release of a previously recorded tax reserve. We continue to expect our 2015 effective tax rate to be approximately 24%, comparable to 2014 excluding discrete tax items from both years.","Excluding restructuring charges, net income was $73.7 million, an increase of 31% over last year. And earnings per fully diluted share were $0.52 in this year's quarter, an increase of 33% over Q3 of 2014.","Excluding restructuring charges and the favorable discrete tax items mentioned before, net income was $55.9 million, flat compared with the prior year and earnings per fully diluted share were $0.40, an increase of 3% over last year.","For the first nine month of 2015, operating income was $213.4 million, representing a 19% margin compared to 2014 operating income of $187.8 million or 17% margin.","Net income for the first nine months of 2015 were $172.3 million, representing a 23% increase over 2014. Earnings per diluted share of $1.22 for the first nine months of 2014 was a 26% increase year-over-year.","On Slide eight, you will see that we closed the third quarter with cash of about $525 million, a decrease of about $35 million during the quarter as strong operating cash flow was more than offset by investing and financing activities to improve overall shareholder value.","In the quarter, we improved our accounts receivables and payables. Inventories increased due to new product introductions in Instrument and Maritime segments, as well as seasonality in the Security segment. We've begun implementing detailed plans with each of our segments to accelerate our progress on inventories and expect to improve our metrics over the next year.","Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $73.6 million or 101% of quarterly net income as reported. For the first nine months of the year, our operating cash flow was $197.5 million or 115% of nine-month net income as reported. Our cash flow from operations improved year-over-year due to improved net income and better working capital management.","We had capital expenditures of $19.4 million in the third quarter and returned $15.4 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We also spent $62 million to repurchase approximately 2.2 million shares of stock during the quarter under the two-year 15 million share repurchase program that we announced in February. We will continue to assess the repurchase of our shares in the future with the level of activity dependent on relative value and other uses of cash, including M&A opportunities.","This concludes the summary of our third quarter and first nine-month results.","Let me now turn it over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights for Q3. Tom?","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Amit. You will see a summary of our segment operating results on Slide 10. The third quarter consolidated segment operating income grew 1% over the third quarter of 2014, while segment operating margin remained level with the prior year 24%, excluding restructuring charges.","The negative operating leverage that resulted from softness and the Instruments and Maritime segments revenue was offset by improved profitability in our government businesses. Total order backlog increased by $31 million to $568 million, which is a 6% increase over the second quarter of 2015.","Moving to Slide 11, during the third quarter, Surveillance segment revenue increased 5% year-over-year to $131.6 million, as growth from our land and Maritime product offerings more than offsets smaller declines in airborne and integrated system product offerings.","Surveillance segment operating income of $40.1 million excluding restructuring charges increased 19% versus the prior year, which represents a 350 basis point increase in the operating margin, driven by a combination of increased revenue and reduced operating expenses. Surveillance backlog increased 10% over Q2 to $340 million and bookings of $166 million, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3.","Bookings improved compared to last year as demand from customers in the Middle East and slight growth in the U.S. offset a weak European region. During the quarter, the Surveillance team won a $50 million IDIQ contract from the U.S. Navy to supply the second generation Combatant Craft Forward Looking Infrared or CCFLIR2 were used by the U.S. special operations command.","Imperative to winning this award was our ability to quickly design and demonstrate a fully functional system during the bid process. Great example of how our commercially developed, military qualified, or CDMQ operating model provide the competitive advantage.","Turning to Slide 12, Instruments segment third quarter revenue decreased 9%, compared to the prior year, finishing at $74.8 million. Growth was seen in our science, fire fighting, and test and measurement products. However, it was not enough to overcome the combination of a $6 million foreign exchange headwind, reduced capital spending from the oil and gas industry for our optical gas imaging systems and softness in our higher end tomography products.","Instrument unit volume shipments increased by 62% in Q3 as compared to the prior year and approximately half of the total unit shipped during the quarter were Lepton based. This increase in unit volumes represents a significant expansion of the user base for thermal imaging. Operating margin, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, dropped 340 basis points, to 29%, as a result of the revenue decline, and flat operating expenses for the quarter.","As Andy mentioned, we recently introduced a new flagship product, the T1K series of professional thermal cameras. As you'll see on Slide 13, the T1K brings together, high-definition thermal imaging, the most advanced thermal image processing software, with our UltraMax and MSX technologies, as well as our new OSX, high-precision ultrasonic driven optical system. We began shipping T1K units to customers during the fourth quarter.","We also introduced, two new FLIR branded test and measurement products, the CM174 all-in-one clamp meter for electrical professionals, and the MR176 imaging moisture meter for building and remediation professionals. Both products are similar in form factor to the tools professionals currently use. But they also incorporate a Lepton sensor to provide Infrared Guided Measurement or IGM, a solution that allows the professional to find problems by visualizing temperature anomalies.","Slide 14, summarizes the results for the OEM & Emerging segment, where third quarter revenue increased 3% versus last year to $51.4 million. Improved shipments of thermal imaging cores, more than offset the $4 million of revenue headwind from foreign exchange, and the divestment of our OCG business in Q3 of 2014. Excluding these two items, segment revenue was up 12%. OEM & Emerging operating margin, excluding the impact of restructuring charges improved 200 basis points compared to the prior year to 28%, primarily due to reduced operating expenses.","During Q3, we introduced the FLIR Vue PRO, for the UAS market. The Vue PRO, built on the successful small format, easily integrated Vue platform, and adds thermal video in 14-bit still imagery, as well as Bluetooth connectivity to ease pre-flight configuration. The Vue PRO is most suited for applications such as agriculture, security and solar panel inspection.","Turning to Slide 15. The Maritime segment finished the third quarter with revenues of $38.9 million, which was 13% below the prior year. This business has significant exposure to currency movements and as a result the segment saw a $4 million of foreign exchange headwind in the quarter.","On a constant currency basis, revenue declined by 4%. Multifunction display unit volumes increased 40% during the quarter as compared to the prior year and part due to an increased penetration in the fresh water market with the Dragonfly product line. Raymarine, MFDs now support the integration of FLIR's AX8 thermal imager for continuous monitoring of critical electrical, mechanical equipment during the voyage. The Lepton based AX8 provides the user with MSX imaging to provide more detailed imagery, as well as providing both visible and audible alarms from conditions exceed preset thresholds.","Our thermal maritime product revenue was up in the quarter. Foreign exchange and increased price competition of Raymarine's in-markets negatively impacted the segment. Maritime operating income was $1.8 million in the quarter down $2.8 million from Q3 of 2014. Profitability was negatively impacted by both currency and pricing pressures.","On Slide 18, you'll see our security segment results. Revenue continued to grow in the segment, up 22% year-over-year reaching $59.3 million. Strength in both Lorex and FLIR-branded visible systems drove this growth. Security operating profit was $7.2 million up 3% from the prior year. Operating margin declined 220 basis points, the result of lower gross margins due in part to greater penetration in the retail market of the Lorex products.","During the quarter, we announced the FC ID line of thermal bullet cameras as shown on Slide 19. Featuring our TAU thermal core, these cameras are equipped with our proprietary onboard video analytics that automatically and reliably detect humans, vehicles and other objects, significantly enhancing the capability of the world's most popular thermal security cameras. The market is becoming increasingly aware of the significant advantage thermal imaging provides for accurate and reliable video analytics.","During the third quarter, unit volume shipments of Lorex and FLIR Visible imagers increased 30% as compared to the prior year and unit volumes for FLIR thermal imagers increased 50% over the prior year.","On Slide 20 is the summary of the Detection segment's third quarter. Revenue was $25.8 million, which was up 7% over the prior year. Revenue from both the radiation and handheld explosive trace detection product lines doubled in size compared to the prior year, which was partially offset by a planned reduction in non-strategic contract R&D revenue. Operating profit grew 26% as gross margins improved with better product mix and lower product costs.","Detection backlog finished the quarter at $72 million, which was down compared to the end of Q2, as we began shipping against the $51 million DR SKO order that we received in March of this year. Also in the last few weeks, we introduced two significant new products in the segment. First the Fido X2 is our latest handheld explosive trace detector that uniquely offers high sensitivity of a broad range of chemicals used in manufacture of homemade, commercial, and military explosives, and does sell at a price that will allow more law enforcement first responder professionals to benefit from this life saving technology.","Also in Q3, we introduced the new Griffin 410 portable gas chromatograph\/mass spectrometer that is designed to provide in-field lab quality chemical detection with its ruggedized and transportable form factor.","That concludes my summary of the segments' third quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Tom. While the third quarter came in below our expectations, we saw many reasons for enthusiasm for the future. First and foremost, our product teams continue to introduce cutting edge and market creating products across our various product line value ladders. Lepton continues to be a key component creating differentiated solutions in many markets. In this quarter, we introduced the ninth and tenth new products utilizing our revolutionary Lepton sensor. As a result of this innovation coupled with our selling and marketing investments and our initiatives to reduce our operating costs, growth and profitability has improved significantly with revenue on a constant currency basis growing 7% and operating margin up 200 basis points year-to-date.","Our government businesses have responded to cyclical spending softness by focusing on our unique CDMQ model and the recent CCFLIR2 and international program wins are good examples of how we can be successful with the strategy. Additionally, our product volumes continue to grow at a very strong pace, which is helping to build brand momentum and further reduce cost by leveraging our vertically integrated capabilities.","That concludes our comments on the third quarter. We'll now ask the operator to open the call up for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for holding. It is now time for question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Thank you. Hi, Andy. How are you?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good, Saliq.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","One of the questions that I have for you was, you had mentioned that inventory was up by about $67 million during the quarter. What is the product composition of the increase in the inventory? Has it been largely the newer detection products or is it some of the legacy solutions that you were previously selling?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, the increase comes from three areas, two are related to new product developments and those are in the Instruments and Maritime segment. So, both of those areas we've had a fairly strong cadence of new product developments towards the end of the quarter and as a result there was an inventory build-up to build the initial stocking inventories of those products as they go into distribution channels. The third area is related to the security business, that's a fairly cyclical business, we were pretty strong sell-through in Q4 in that business, particularly at the retail outlet standpoint and as a result we've got a fairly strong build of inventory as those products go into the channel.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","And the second question that I have for you was the two new detection solutions that you had just introduced recently and I saw this at the most recent security conference at the West Coast. Was this a byproduct of you reaching out to the customers and trying to push a solution that you believe they needed or did they come to you and said hey these are our needs we believe we're missing this when we're out there out in the field. How do that come about, the introduction of the solutions?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Those are good questions. We always develop products based on feedback that we hear from the customer base. There's also an element of innovation that comes from our engineering teams that we utilize to enhance the products. One of the other things that's unique about these new products that are coming through detection and I mentioned it in the prepared comments is that these are the first products that really represent a very strong injection of FLIR's DNA from a industrial design standpoint, from a user interface standpoint, and from a efficiency of manufacturing standpoint.","If you look at these products, particularly the Fido X2 is a great example of it. There is a situation of product where you'll see a very strong correlation from an industrial design standpoint to the products that are on our Instruments segment. We've also really innovated this product in terms of ease of use. These are products that get deployed in the field typically with users that may not have a lot of training in this.","We went quite a long way in this product to embed training materials into the product, videos, and so forth that explain how the product is used and also have a very intuitive operation of the unit such that users can use it without a training. Also, that particular product represents a lower price point, so we expect to be able to address a larger portion of law enforcement oriented customers with that products given the lower price point and the value proposition that it provides.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Yes. Good morning, Andy. Andy, could you give us a little more detail what you're seeing in Europe. I mean sequentially its \u2013 it was down year-over-year it's down, I mean obviously excluding FX, I know there was pressures there but what are the kind of challenges I guess you're seeing is just the overall slowness in the end market or is it just something structural going on?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thanks, Peter. It's a good question. One of the things that you'll note in Europe is that the majority of the downturn that we've seen from a revenue perspective in Europe is driven by the currency exchange that we've seen the fluctuations in the currency rates. If you look at our businesses from the standpoint of the businesses where we're well established, we saw a decline there that was pretty consistent across all of the segments. So, it's a double digit decline in the low 20% range that we saw in Q3 on a revenue basis. And again very closely tied to what we saw in terms of currency fluctuation. In the areas where we don't have an established business in Europe, we're actually seeing growth. So we've had a fairly strong push of our security products, both at the retail level under the Lorex brand and at the professional level under the FLIR brand, and there we're actually seeing growth, but it's off of a very small base.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Got it. And then if I could just ask one follow on regarding Lepton. I think, you said 10 products that are now shipping and it sound like it's 50% of the instrument volume is based on kind of Lepton. What was kind of the overall plan at some point, is it going to be based on, you've rolled out 20 products and we begin to see a more material impact on the top line? I mean, how should we be thinking further rollout of Lepton? Thanks.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Lepton really has a \u2013 we have a three-pronged approach with Lepton. One is what you've seen quite a lot of is the injection of Lepton into our existing market verticals. And the initial products that were launched into Lepton verticals, there were some overlap with existing products if you look at a product like C2 for example, it had some overlap with the product like our E4 series and that is addressing a similar application base with a different form factor.","What's interesting that's happening now with Lepton is the more recent products that have been introduced are really creating completely new categories. So the new class of what we call IGM, Infrared-Guided Measurement products, where we're injecting Lepton technology into traditional test and measurement products like electrical, clamp meter, or a moisture meter. Those are going to address really a new customer base that I don't think was considering the use of thermal imaging at all and we have fairly high expectations relative to the performance with those products.","Existing products, I mentioned previously products like C2 and the TG135 are doing very well. So the unit volumes there have actually exceeded our expectations and as was mentioned by Tom, it's about 50% of the total volume that we have in the instrument space. We got a couple of areas also with Lepton where \u2013 there in the other segments. So in Maritime for example, we talk this quarter about the AX8 product which is creating a new Lepton based engine monitoring product for boats, that's a very tight integration with the Raymarine network and Raymarine MFD system.","And again, I think, it's a really strong value proposition because an overheating situation, potential fire in an engine room and boat obviously is a major concern to boaters and having that capability of detecting those kinds of situations before they become a big problem is a really key value proposition.","And then the last area of course is, we've created a new price point in the firefighting market with Lepton with K2, that's a product that hasn't started shipping yet, but we'll start shipping here on the next couple of weeks. We've got a nice already selling the units in to distributors, there they'll be delivering in Q4. And then of course we've also launched products into the security space that are just now starting to get traction that are Lepton based.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Thanks. We have \u2013 it looks like the outline of a two year DoD budget agreement, I think it will be good for you guys in terms of visibility. You had a good growth quarter in Surveillance, good backlog quarter, any sense of getting closer to the trough there on an annual basis? And I was wondering if you could help us with Surveillance in the fourth quarter whether or not you thought it will be up sequentially or not.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So there I agree with you, Pete. It's nice to see the progress that's been made in terms of a budget. It's an environment that we very much would like to be sailing into. Q3, we had stronger DoD bookings than we have had historically and it was encouraging to see that.","And I would also say that the general vectors that we're seeing from DoD purchasing behavior are encouraging for us. We're seeing increased activity in the product categories that we're strong in. So Tom mentioned this a little bit in his prepared comments, but in the Maritime space, in the land space, and in handheld instrument space for our surveillance products we're seeing demand build there and a scenario where we're quite strong. We've invested pretty heavily in product development in that area over the course of the last couple of years and we believe that our CDMQ model is producing products that are pretty strongly differentiated in that space and...","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Right.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...we're seeing some good traction there. The recent CCFLIR2 contracts went for example the IDIQ that we mentioned today is a good example of a nice contract that we won there with a differentiated CDMQ-based solution. Tom, you want to add any comments about Q4, how Q4 is looking for Surveillance?","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","We have a normal seasonality to the surveillance business. We obviously have government purchasing for the U.S. coming in Q3 for the bookings. We typically see strong bookings. Q4 benefits from those bookings and we'll see that normal seasonality of revenue increase. In terms of comparison to prior periods in our bookings, we're encouraged what we're seeing currently, but I don't think we can call a long-term trend at this point. We are thrilled that there seems to be resolution on the DoD budget.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. One other thing, Pete, I don't think we'll see Q4 revenue for Surveillance be up versus prior year. We had a very strong Q4 last year. We had big shipments of MSC products and LTV vehicles into the Middle East. So, there were \u2013 that was an order that we received back in Q1 of 2014, so we've got a pretty tough comp there, but I think it'll still be a good quarter for us.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay, understood. If I could just do one follow-up on Europe in Instruments. Just wondering that you guys on the ground over there, you've got new products rolling out. Do you get the sense that there people are very worried about the global macro backdrop? Do you get the sense that there is more headwind in Europe or do you think you can stabilize things over there with the new products coming out?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, I think it's more so the latter. Certainly there was a headwind there, but we're going to see less of a headwind from a currency standpoint in Q4. The relative change Q4 over Q4 is certainly less significant than we've seen in the first three quarters of the year from a currency standpoint.","And the second thing is that we do have a lot of new products that we're launching and we've worked hard in terms of developing new channels for those lower cost, test and measurement oriented products. So those are going to be addressing new markets. The other thing that we've got going in Europe is also launch of the T1K. So, I mean it is \u2013 it's a turbulent market and we've had some headwinds there, but I really expect us to see the situation stabilize in Q4.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jim A. Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you. Just with respect to the implied guidance for Q4 revenues, the range that you're providing, I guess it's not all that dissimilar from what we've seen from you guys in previous years, but I wonder if you could just help us think about maybe what some of that major variables that might contribute to this range, both at the high end and low end?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Sure. So, a couple of variables there. I mean, one is book and bill. We don't have a huge book and bill requirement in Q4, but in the areas that I would say that we are \u2013 that are being conservative about are relative to the Maritime and Instruments segment, where we did see some pressure in Q3. So, we're looking at that conservatively and expecting that we're going to continue to see those pressures in Q4.","The other variable that we deal with is in Surveillance and it's related to the challenges of executing revenue that we have in the backlog and that usually revolves around customer acceptance issues, payment issues and licensing issues. It's nothing new for us. We've been \u2013 this is an environment that we live in every quarter and we manage quite aggressively, but it is a variable in the business.","Jim A. Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Andy, just a question on gross margins. Given the new product rollouts and given in light of what you're going to be introducing, how might we be thinking about your gross margins going forward?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think gross margins you're going to continue to see gross margins on the 48% to 50% range. The new products that we're launching support historical gross margin levels. So, there is no issue there. The issue that we see with gross margins tends to revolve around mix both within a segment and between the segments. So we do have some of the segments which on a general level produce lower gross margins \u2013 I'm sorry, I mean security produces lower gross margins on the visible-based products. The nice thing that we're seeing in security though is an increased cadence in our thermal business, so that business continues to grow both from an overall revenue standpoint and a unit volume standpoint. But again, that's the \u2013 the primary mix is run \u2013 the primary changes are driven by mix change within a segment and mix changes between the segments in our total business.","Jim A. Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Quillin with Stephens, Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. There is always a certain amount of constructive cannibalization in your business where your price points are coming down and that might impact the high end products. I'm just wondering in the Instruments business right now where we will see volumes up 60%, but revenue down. If you're seeing any greater degree of cannibalization because of the relatively rapid uptake of the Lepton-based products?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Hi, Tim. So, it's an interesting term that you use constructive cannibalization because I do look it at that way. The lower cost products that we're introducing in the Instruments segment I think are necessary for two reasons. Number one is that there will be competition in the low-end space. We've got a technological advantage with Lepton, but there are other technical solutions out there, so we're going to see lower price products that are going to enter that segment over time and I think that we need to lead that charge rather than follow it and that's a general strategy that we have here in the business.","As I'd mentioned earlier though, some of the products that we have launched that have lower ASPs are \u2013 have more overlap with existing products versus some of the more recent product that we've launched. I'm very encouraged by the significant increase in unit volumes because this does two things. Number one is it builds the base of people understanding the value of thermal imaging in general. And we found a general trend that once people start using thermal imaging that over time they have a desire to move up that value ladder and get a greater capability.","The other area is that by deploying these technologies into the trades through these test and measurements products, we're building brand awareness significantly for FLIR. And I think that ultimately, not only does that help the insurance business, but it helps our other businesses as we get into consumer spaces and maritime space and in the security space, that combined with the efforts that Travis' group is doing, is building overall brand awareness for the Company, which we expect is going to benefit unit sales across each of the segments.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then on the security business, it's hard to complain too much about a 22% growth quarter, but it is the slowest growth quarter over the past six quarters and revenue was down a little bit versus the second quarter. Where there any pockets of weakness in the security business either geographically or by product line? Thank you.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Well, there is some lumpiness in that business, Tim, relative to revenue execution. And it's all on the thermal side. If you look at the growth from the retail perspective, the business did quite well. And really the change that you're seeing in the growth rate is just driven by the major programs that we get in that business, what we call infrastructure class programs that are thermal product related and there is just some lumpiness in that business. We're very well positioned in that space. And frankly I think the things that are going on in the world drive a greater need for perimeter security and situational awareness in outdoor environments. And we've got the broader suite of products of any company in that space in the thermal spectrum and we continue to innovate with new product developments. The products that were just released this quarter are F-Series ID and the F-Series R products are both new products that are going to drive volumes and adoption in the security space. So I'm feeling pretty good about what the mix and the growth rates look like for that business for the future.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Andy, could we just go back to the gross margins, I mean this was the lowest I think gross margin you guys have ever put up, I mean, even with a stronger performance in Surveillance. I guess as we look forward and you guys see more commercial and more retail, how do we get comfortable thinking that the gross margins are going to hold steady here? I mean it seems like they'd be on a course to continue to track lower and lower? Can you give us any comfort as you can kind of hold these margins in that range?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, so I'm going to have Tom answer the first question and just talk about what we saw in Q3 and then I'll come back and talk about the longer term view.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Well, I think that the question in general was a longer term question, what's the trend going to be in gross margin so what do we think? So if you look and Andy spoke to the mix and you saw \u2013 you heard the comment about the security area that there was lower margins. I am actually thrilled with the roadmap we have for execution and security, and currently \u2013 let me say the amount of differentiation and the technology we will be bringing to the marketplace and the product lineup will have the ability to increase our gross margins in that area over the longer-term. So, I think that's one key piece.","I think, the other area in Maritime, there was clearly FX which I think is something that hit us particularly hard in the quarter, but again in that marketplace, we also penetrated the low-end. The longer term, we're going to have to create product differentiation in a very price competitive market. I think the current situation is not sustainable for the \u2013 overall in that marketplace where it's price competition. It's going to have to be won by product differentiation and that's something we do very well.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Michael, I'll add just three points to this relative to the long-term perspective, I think it really comes down to these things. Number one is the injection of thermal technology and that's really what Tom is alluding to in the Security space. But, when we inject thermal into a product class, we have the ability to drive the traditional gross margins that we've had at FLIR.","The second issue is differentiation in the products and we've got a very strong focus on differentiation through video analytics and image processing within our products, and you see this very strongly I mentioned in \u2013 the T1K has got a very high level of video processing, it's going on inside the camera that creates a very strongly differentiated output in the premium segment. But we also see this in the security space, product like the FCR and the FC ID are products that have processors inside them that are doing video analytics to create a differentiated value proposition there, which are going to support the higher price points and higher gross margin margins.","And then, the last area is relative to new categories and this is something as a Company we've been very focused on creating new product categories. And one of the benefits of creating a new product category is that you typically operate for some period of time in that category with a lack of meaningful competition and that allows us to drive appropriate gross margins in that segment.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then, just one last one. I don't think you guys called it out. I may have missed it. Can you just talk about, how your business has been performing in China, maybe some trends there?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So, if I look at China from a couple of different perspectives. First, I can look at it from a bookings perspective is on an uptick. Year-to-date bookings in China are actually only up a couple of percentage points but Q3, the bookings were quite strong. They were just shy of 30% and we've got a pretty good forecast for Q4 for bookings in China as well and that's based on traction that we're getting there primarily in the Instruments, OEM and Maritime space. We've been adding sales resources in China to drive that growth as well.","If I move over to a revenue perspective, the overall growth rate is sort of in line with the rest of the business. It's high single-digits and within that same range year-to-date, but as we drive those higher bookings increases that I spoke about previously that will allow us obviously to drive the revenue up.","I think the real big issue for us is China is still a pretty small piece of our total revenue. We don't do any revenue to speak of in the government oriented businesses, of course, in China due to export regulations. So it's really more about our commercial and industrial businesses. Well, it's a small piece of our revenue today. I think it presents a fairly significant opportunity for the Company and it's an area where we're focused. We're not seeing any of the sort of effects that you see in the news in terms of downturns of the demand in China that has not manifested itself in our bookings or revenue profile to-date.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just wanted to talk a little bit first about the Marine segment and maybe what you're seeing from a pricing competition standpoint. And do you actually see that stabilizing sort of in the near-term or this is going to continue now that you've entered into this more competitive segment?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I may have Tom respond to that.","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Yes. In the near-term, I think you will see a very price competitive marketplace and there is also \u2013 the lower end products will become more and more featured. You're seeing a migration off of some of the more sophisticated systems into more simplistic systems because they are meeting the need. I think that's the short-term view of it. I think the longer term I would also go to kind of the products that we've been introducing and we're trying to introduce best of class products that are differentiated. We introduced new sonar line. We've introduced a TP370, TP470 and TP570, which gave best of class performance and that's the kind of thing that's going to take us out of a price war into a product differentiation war and that's where we're going to find our success.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then can you give us maybe an update in terms of what's happening with the automotive OEM opportunities and maybe some of the new platforms that you guys have potential with?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, there is not a whole lot that we can provide publicly on that. We have spoken earlier about that we will be debuting on a new Cadillac platform that will be coming out either later this year or early next year. There are still a number of OEMs that are in the hopper that we can't speak publicly about yet, but I'm encouraged about the long-term adoption in that space. The value proposition is still quite good and I think that having another manufacturer and OEM out there with the product feature, and particularly an American brand like Cadillac, is going to help to continue to drive awareness and motivate other manufacturers to join the fray of offering this feature.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just lastly as we talk about sort of Lepton going into these adjacent markets particularly in Instruments, can you talk about where we're in terms of global distribution and are we going to start seeing this show up more in big box stores? Is this going to be hardware specific retailers? I just want to get a sense of where you're targeting the distribution and sort of the progress there.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Jonathan. The new products that we have just recently launched where you have Lepton embedded in these test-and-measurement products as an IGM feature opens up really a different type of distribution channel for us. And it's distribution channels more in line with what you just mentioned, distribution organization is focused on the trades, and that's everything from dropper type distribution center all the way through to a home improvement type of retail outlet.","We have more products to come in that area. So we haven't let up at all on our cadence of product development in the instrument space utilizing Lepton. And many of those products are on the drawing board will find themselves in more retail oriented distribution spaces. So we're encouraged about bringing that technology to the consumer level user as well.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","A couple of follow-ups on cash flow. CapEx looks like it's up over 20%-plus year-to-date, despite the fact that you guys have done some consolidation. So, I am wondering what's driving that and is that kind of the level of growth we will see for the full year? And when does that slow or decline? And I just was wondering if someone could talk about free cash conversion if you can get the one-time or exceed one-time for the year and kind of what your go forward targets are? Thanks.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I'll handle the first question about CapEx and then I'll have Amit talk about free cash conversion. The increase in CapEx spending is really driven by the fact that we've got a new facility that we are just completing in Santa Barbara. So, we moved from a multiple leased facilities in Santa Barbara to a single owned facility there, which included moving our fab, our development foundry which is just a fairly expensive project.","The ultimate intent of that puts all of our operations there in a single building, consolidating from five separate buildings there. It lowers our overall expense on an annual basis as well. The depreciation expense versus the rental expense and obviously it's a much more modern facility and we expect to be able to get the stronger yields out of our development foundry there as a result of having a new facility. So you'll see that CapEx taper off as we go forward. That was really a spike.","We also built and just completed this summer a new factory in Estonia and that's reflected in the CapEx spending as well, but again it's a great platform for low cost labor, very high-quality output there. Many of our new Instruments products are coming out of this factory that's based in Tallinn. And it has a lot of capacity for expansion, and we expect that we'll be moving some other product lines into that factory in the coming 12 months to 24 months. Amit, you want to talk a little bit about cash flow?","Amit Singhi - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So, yes, thanks, Andy. So, in terms of free cash flow, you'll see that last year, quarter three, we were about $20 million free cash flow, we had about $15 million of CapEx. Obviously, that improved significantly this quarter to almost over $50 million. And obviously, the use of that cash will depend on our investing and financing activities.","As we look forward on the free cash flow, as Andy mentioned, the capital spending will probably taper off a little bit. It'll still be at a decent level; both based on the changes that we're making, but also internal investments as we look at new R&D opportunities, and as the net income improve. So going forward, the free cash flow should be a little bit of an improvement from where we are in this quarter.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. I guess since I'm the last one, I'll ask one last one, how is the M&A pipeline?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'll let Shane talk about that.","Shane Harrison - Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy","Not a lot of updates yet, Pete. We're casting a wide net. We're pretty excited about the opportunities we have in a lot of the segments. So, we're talking at various levels with a lot of different companies across all the segments really. So hopefully we will have something to update you with in the coming quarters, but it's kind of more the same. It's a lot of discussions; M&A is an art, not a science always, so it's a lot of \u2013 keeping a lot of irons in the fire, and there's a couple of good ones that we're pretty excited about. But again, nailing down timing can sometimes be very difficult, especially on a call like this. So, keep \u2013 stay tuned.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Got it. Thanks so much guys.","Operator","Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back to Andy Teich for closing comments.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great, thank you. Well, our Q3 results were somewhat below our expectations. I'm pleased with our continued progress on developing new markets for our sensing technologies, making our products smarter and easier to use and continuing our leadership in building awareness of the benefits of thermal imaging on a global basis. We're on a path that will lead to continued long-term growth and profitability.","Before I close, I do want to underscore my appreciation for continued hard work and dedication that is exhibited by the more than 2,800 FLIR employees around the world. We're making great progress in our vision of being the World's Sixth Sense.","And with that I'd like to thank you all for joining us today.","Operator","This does conclude today's teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As are reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Todd DuChene. Please go ahead.","Todd DuChene","Good morning, everyone. Please note that our earnings press release and presentation slides referred that will be referred to on this call are available under the Events & Presentations section of flir.com\/investor.","Before we begin this conference call, I need to remind you that statements made on this call, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on our current expectation.

We believe that non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of our core ongoing operating results and facilitate consistent comparison of results over time. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning.","Let me now turn the call over to Jim Cannon, President and Chief Executive Officer of FLIR Systems. Jim?","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Todd, and thank you everyone for joining us for FLIR's third quarter 2017 earnings call. With Todd and me today are Shane Harrison, our Acting CFO and SVP of Corporate and Development; Travis Merrill, the President of our Commercial Business Unit and Frank Pennisi, the President of our Industrial Business Unit.","Overall Q3 was a strong quarter with 15% revenue growth, gross margin improvement and 17% growth in operating cash flow versus prior year. All six of our segments grew their revenue and operating income over the prior year. Bookings in the quarter led to a finishing backlog of $709 million, the highest level in FLIR's history.","I'll start the review of the third quarter on Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $465 million, which was an increase of 15% over the third quarter of 2016 and 8% on an organic basis.","Our commercial products revenue grew 20% over the prior year and our government products revenue grew 8%. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income grew 16% and 14% over the third quarter of 2016 respectively.","Segment growth was broad and segment level operating margin expanded approximately 30 basis points. Now this growth was offset slightly by increased corporate expenses and higher tax rate. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.52, which represents 8% growth versus last year's adjusted EPS of $0.48.","Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter at $709 million up $63 million or 10% over the end of the second quarter. Our performance in Q3 was ahead of our expectations, due partially the revenue that was pulled in from Q4 as shipment in some of our businesses were accelerated by customer requirements.","Consequently, we continue to expect full year 2017 revenues to be in the range of $1.775 billion to $1.825 billion and have narrowed our expectations for adjusted EPS to be in the range of a $1.83 to a $1.88. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, which will be payable on December 8 to shareholders of record as of November 24.","I want to remind everyone of our operational realignment. As we discussed in September and as shown on Slide 4 beginning on January 1, we will begin reporting in three business units rather than six segments. Streamlining the operations in this way is expected to reduce our complexity, improve our agility, unlock synergies, increased team collaboration and enhance management focus.","It will also better enable our strategy to fuel, to feed and to focus our businesses. It's my goal that this leads to improved ability to grow and create sustained shareholder value.","This leads me to the next Slide that shows our operational task and purpose. Our task is to consistently exceed shareholder commitments with integrity and our purposes and entity is to innovate the world's sixth sense in order to save lives and livelihood.","We'll operate with these in mind at all time and we will drive our strategies with the intention to succeed in the eyes of our customers, our employees and our shareholders. One of my primary goals in my first months at FLIR was to develop a better articulation of our core values so that they're actionable, more aspirational and can be better owned by our employees.","On Slide 6, you'll see the results of this effort, which are the following core values, be ready, the bold, be brave and be ambitious. First is be ready, which speaks to prioritizing speed and agility in reacting to an ever-changing technology landscape.","We'll be bold and that we'll pioneer and innovate to continue pushing the boundaries of what's possible both in our technology as well in our daily operations. We need to be brave in our actions to exhibit the utmost integrity and ethics in our daily decision-making not usually but always.","And lastly, we will be ambitious with the will to win, a tenacity to find the best ways to accomplish our tasks and collaborate with the utmost respect for our teammates and our customers.","These core values will serve as the standards by which our people operate and behave at FLIR. We expect our teams to feel accountable for upholding these values each and every day and by doing so, we expect to see tangible results in our business performance.","On Slide 7, you'll find an overview of our continuous business improvement initiative that we're calling The FLIR Method. While implementation will begin this quarter, this is a long-term investment that we expect will better enable organic growth, increase our profitability and generate excess cash to utilize in ways that enhance shareholder returns.","Each of our business units will have dedicated FLIR method leaders at various facilities globally who will lead the focus on enhancing our productivity, refining our product pricing strategy, standardizing our core business terminology to better share best practices globally, implement expanded talent development programs, boost our acquisition and integration processes and continue to develop world-class products that exceed our customer's expectations.","During my first few months as CEO, I've seen firsthand the strength of our technology. The power of our innovation engine and most importantly, the quality of our people. The FLIR Method will become the way we strengthen all functions of our business through a persistent journey that will be a key component of our culture.","I am confident that a global focus on continuous improvement in all aspects of our business will fuel the innovation engine for future growth, continue to raise employee job satisfaction and increase shareholder return.","And on the subject of innovation, let me now briefly about some of our new products that we've announced since our last earnings call. First turning to Slide 8, our security segment introduced a new thermal bullet camera called the FLIR FB-Series Okay., which is specified for perimeter security applications to the tech potential intruders in total darkness and for its sunglass, smoke dust analyte fog.","In August, our outdoor and tactical systems business within surveillance, launched a line of thermal rifle scopes, that are based on our new Boson camera core called the ThermoSight Pro Series.","The OEM and emerging segment announced a new drone camera for use in commercial applications called the FLIR Duo Pro R. This is a hybrid sensor systems that allows the operator switch between visible and thermal in-flight and features onboard GPS, motion, environmental sensors to enable high fidelity geo-tagging for mapping purposes.","In Maritime, we introduced the latest version of our lighthouse software, which enhances numerous mapping, data logging, data streaming and image display functionality to this already well-received operating system that's used in our multifunction displays.","And this month, our Instrument segment released our newest lineup of Infrared Guided Measurement or IGM test and measurement meters the DM 166 the DM 285 and the CM 275. Each of these tools used by electricians and trade people have the unique addition of thermal imaging, which allows for more efficient scoping and detecting of problems, making their jobs easier.","In this week, our Detection segment announced their latest radiation detector. The identiFINDER R440, the R440 is a revolutionary small radioisotope identification device or an RIID that offers unmatched combination of sensitivity and accuracy that allows responders to detect and identify radiation from long distances and with high accuracy.","I'll now as Shane to review the third quarter financial and operational highlights, Shane?","Shane Harrison","Thanks Jim. On Slide 9, you'll see our third quarter financial results. Please note with the exception of cash flow, all these financials are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the filed appendix.","Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $465 million a 15% increase compared to the third quarter of 2016 and as Jim mentioned an 8% organic growth rate. Adjusted gross margin was 49%, about 70 basis points higher than last year, driven by acquisitions and improved manufacturing cost.","Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 22% about 20 basis points lower than last year, mainly due to higher R&D spend relative to the prior year. Adjusted net income for the third quarter of 2017 was up 11% to $72.7 million and adjusted EPS was $0.52 per share, 8% higher than last year.","Net income was negatively impacted by a 370-basis point increase in our effective tax rate versus last year to 26.2%. Due to our current expectation and geographic mix of taxable income, we now expect our full-year adjusted tax rate to be approximately 25.5%.","Quarterly cash flow from operations was 143% of adjusted net income or $104 million, which was $15 million higher than the prior-year. Through nine months of 2017, operating cash flow was 116% of adjusted net income.","During the third quarter, we fully repaid the outstanding $86 million in borrowings under our revolving credit facility and returned $21 million to shareholders in the form of dividends. Despite these uses of cash, we increased our cash balance by $33 million to $437 million at the end of the quarter.","Geographically, revenue increased 9% in the U.S. and 27% in Europe. We saw weakness in the Middle East region due to slower activity in our Surveillance segment. Revenue to U.S. government was 25% of total revenue and it increased 4% versus the prior year.","Moving into segment details on the right side of Slide 9, revenue and operating income increased across the Board. We did experience reduced operating leverage in the form of higher corporate spend, the result of increased legal costs and increased compensation accruals.","Digging in on the segment a bit more, you will see on the left side of Slide 10, a summary of surveillance in the third quarter results. Third quarter revenue for surveillance was $146.8 million up 8% from the third quarter of 2016. Airborne and man portable products were particularly strong, compared to the prior year and the addition of the UAS business added inorganic revenue growth all partially offset by a decline in our land products due do a difficult comparison in the prior year.","Operating income for surveillance was $44.9 million up 8% over the prior year with consistent operating margins. Surveillance bookings grew to 33% during the year due to a $75 million order we received from the U.S. Army for gimbels to support their EOIR Force Protection Program, a variant of the RAID program.","This helped drive surveillance and book-to-bill ratio of 1.45 times and increased backlog 21% quarter-over-quarter to $395 million. Not included in this backlog, but notable nonetheless in October, our UAS business receded a $7 million order from the Australian Army for our Black Hornet Nano UAS Solution, a key stone win for this next generation personal surveillance and reconnaissance solution.","On the right side of Slide 10 is a summary of the Detection segment, which saw third quarter revenue grow 19% year-over-year to $31.4 million. Timing of deliveries under the DR-SKO program and increases in our radiation and ChemBio products drove the increase, which was partially offset by softness in explosives detection products.","Operating margin improved 180 basis points to 28%, a result of higher revenue on the operating expense base. Detection finished the third quarter with $78 million of backlog, which was down $8 million from the end of Q2, due primarily to the shipments of DR-SKO under the previous order.","Partially offsetting the backlog decline was another large order from the United States Department of Homeland Securities Domestic Nuclear Detection Office for our R300 Compact Spectroscopic Personal Radiation Detectors.","Moving to Slide 11, instruments revenue of $91.4 million was up 11% over the third quarter of 2016. Broad product line growth drove this increase with particular strength in both volume and premium handheld plant predictive maintenance cameras as well as growth in our automation cameras.","Instruments operating profit in the third quarter increased 7% from the third quarter of 2016 to $29.6 million or 32% of revenue. The results for the OEM and emerging segment are shown on the Slide 11 as well.","OEM and emerging third quarter revenue was $87.2 million, increasing 39% over last year. The acquired integrated imaging solutions line of business was the driver of this growth. Organic revenue was slightly up due to higher sales of UAS cameras, mobile accessories and Lepton cores offset by slower cooled cores revenue.","OM and emerging operating profit grew 30% year-over-year to reach an all-time quarterly high of $26.9 million, operating margin of 31% did decline 200 basis points versus the prior year, due to higher operating expenses, primarily related to product development and yield improvement initiatives. Order backlog and OM and emerging increased 2% during the third quarter to $162 million.","Moving to Slide 12, on the left side, you'll see security segment revenue of $65.7 million was up 16% compared to last year's third quarter. Securities LOREX business grew significantly due to sell-ins of our new 4K Ultra HD bundle and our wire-free camera system to two major retailers, some of which was revenue pushed in from Q2.","We saw significant growth in LOREX web channel as well. FLIR-branded Professional Visible Security solutions grew 12% year-over-year, while thermal security products were flat to the prior year. Security operating income grew 36% to $6.5 million year-over-year due to the strong topline and a reduction in operating expenses.","In the quarter, we restructured the security segment to improve their selling function, their R&D strategy and reduced SG&A by approximately $1 million annually. A portion of these segments will realize in the third quarter.","Maritime segment revenue was $42.3 million, up 4% versus the prior year, despite the negative impact of Hurricanes in the U.S. market. New products drove broad growth across the Raymarine business, which was partially offset by weakness in thermal cameras due to increased customer vetting processes.","Maritime operating income grew 42% to $4.5 million or 11% of revenue. Stronger gross margins mix with controlled operations spending resulting in another quarter of operating margin improvement, this time by 280 basis points compared to Q3 of 2016.","That concludes my summary of the financials and the segments. I'll now pass it back over to Jim.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Shane. This was a very favorable third quarter with strong topline results, good organic growth, gross margin improvement, cash flow well ahead of net income and the largest backlog our history. I am proud of the team's ability to post results like we did in the quarter, especially in light of the change of leadership and the reorganization of the business, but I am not satisfied and will not be satisfied unless we keep this momentum going.","We expect to be able to deliver the revenue and EPS results that we've guided throughout the year with this quarter's performance. The fourth quarter poses some challenges as we saw some revenue pulled out of our plans in Q4 and into Q3 and we also expect pressure in our retail security business.","But we're up to the task of growing this company while creating meaningful shareholder value as we do. Please note that we're planning and Investor event in the second quarter in New York, so that we can meet face-to-face to present our vision and longer-term strategies in this regard. Details on the event will follow in the coming weeks.","And as we announced on Monday, after a thorough search, we've hired a new Chief Financial Officer. Carol Lowe, will be joining us on November 27 as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, coming from the multinational industrial companies there where she was their Chief Financial Officer. We're excited to have Carol join the team as she brings a solid skillset and deep experience in corporate finance, accounting and operations.","I want to thank Shane Harrison for his ongoing leadership, hard work and dedication to our business. Shane took on the added responsibility, the Acting CFO in addition to his duties leading IR and M&A while onboarding a new Chief Executive Officer. Thank you, Shane.","As I started off the call saying, we're in the midst of implementing new methods, procedures and thinking at FLIR that believe will make this great company even more efficient, even more focused better able to exceed customer expectations and at the end of the day, more valuable to our shareholders.","I am excited to continue to work with our over 3,500 team members to bring these to life that we even more effectively innovate the world's sixth sense to enhance perception and awareness, so our customers can save lives and livelihood.","I'll now open the call up for questions and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question today is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Ricchiuti","Thank you. Good morning. The question I have, first question is on the OEM and emerging segment. I think you mentioned that the organic revenues were up slightly. I don't know if you can maybe give us a little bit more specific about or what that growth was?","And then the question I have is this, I believe you're coming up on the anniversary of the Point Grey acquisition and wondering how we should think about this business over the next couple of quarters? And I'm wondering if you're anticipating perhaps some seasonal weakness also in the Industrial Machine Vision business, which is by all accounts been pretty strong throughout the industry anyway. So maybe we can just start there.","Jim Cannon","Yeah sure. Absolutely. So, our OEM and emerging business did grow modestly organically. Now you got to remember last year there was a really big comp, because they got a large Northrop Grumman order last year. So, to be able to meet and comp that was quite an compliment for the team.","And as you know, our IIS business or Point Grey will last itself in November. We'll mark the one-year anniversary of that acquisition being complete and we have to say we're absolutely thrilled with the performance of that team and the growth that we've seen in that business.","Now we think that some of that growth will slow a bit as in the past two quarter and particularly we've had some really strong performance, but we're very bullish about the machine vision space, the addition to the Point Grey it's synergies with Thermal, the development of new products that that team has underway, again encourage us a lot about the OEM and emerging sector as we go forward as well as continued efforts in that core business.","Automotive for example a lot of work and effort underway and enthusiasm and opportunity in that part of the segment as well team's work and hard on it and we continue to see strong work out of the core customers we've had there for some time, but I can't enough positive things about the team at Point Grey, IIS as we call it now.","And as we mentioned in November it will mark the one-year anniversary we continue to see or expect pretty strong growth from that team.","Jim Ricchiuti","Okay. Thanks Jim. Just on the instruments business, this is my last question and I'll jump back in the queue. You had good quarters of solid growth there and I am wondering as it looks like you're benefiting from a stronger lineup of products, but I am also wondering if you're seeing stronger market demand in general, is this the case where you're getting better market conditions, may be taking some market share back and just getting the benefit of the new products?","Jim Cannon","I would principally say it's the benefit of the lot of the work that the team has done around new products. Now the markets are strong, but the teams work very hard for the better part of the year to introduce a whole series of products, gas finder, that IGM instruments that I mentioned earlier, some volume products as well and you're going to continue to see the team in instruments on their front foot with product innovation.","There is a lot more to come in the future. So, we're really seeing the benefit of these products beginning to hit the market. Now we've had an sort of a strong sell-in to begin with that might taper a bit as we go forward, but the feedback that we're getting from users is that the products really are introducing some great new capabilities.","Jim Ricchiuti","Okay. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Sir.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question today is coming from Asher Carey from Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Asher Carey","Hey. Good morning. I was wondering if you could describe back to the organic side some of the drivers and what you're seeing in that part of the business? Is there any way to parse out that 8% organic growth particularly and how you're viewing it being driven by government versus commercial, thanks?","Jim Cannon","Well, we don't walk in detail our organic growth and exactly the drivers of where it's coming from. As I mentioned earlier, our overall growth, our commercial products grew by 20%, our government products grew 8%.","We are seeing as we mentioned growth across all the segments this quarter, which is the first time in recent history we've had all segments demonstrating growth and fueled by a whole host of things in many of our businesses like instruments as I mentioned or Maritime.","We've got new products hitting the market. Axiom Pro for Maritime hit, we mentioned Lighthouse. We've got great 3D fish finders to the Maritime team. It's got a bevy of products coming to the market. Instruments we mentioned, detection and surveillance really had great orders quarter. We had a book-to-bill of about by 1.45 for surveillance business, the largest of which and you may have seen the announcement was for the EO\/IR FP program, which is a very -- or extension of the RAID program for $74 million.","Now we shipped just a tiny bit of that. We got some lead time issues in the supply chain that we've got prime if you will. You're really going to see the benefit of that begin to come really in the first quarter and first half of 2018.","Asher Carey","Great. Thanks Jim.","Jim Cannon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Ho","Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color in terms of the magnitude of orders that you received early from the first fourth quarter and maybe what segments you're selling to?","Jim Cannon","Yeah there was probably about $15 million of revenue that came into the third quarter that we expected would go in the fourth and the bulk of that more than half of it was DR-SKO in our Detection business.","You know that DR-SKO business is lumpy. We can't always predict when the customer needs those products. It's a critical product. Obviously, it faces a very real threat in the world that we operate in but I will say with DR-SKO, we actually added to the backlog in the third quarter.","In the second quarter, we had ending backlog for DR-SKO around $40 million. Now it's about $50 million that's got to be delivered over the next 18 months or so, but of the $15 million, the lion's share by far was the DR-SKO that got pulled in the third quarter.","Jonathan Ho","Got it. And then as a follow-up, can you maybe talk a little bit about the pressure that you're seeing in the retail security business, just given the new product launch? Was the benefit this quarter largely just channel stocking and that maybe dissipates a little bit?","Just wanted to get a little bit more sense around what's happening there?","Jim Cannon","Well Q4 is typically a stronger quarter for our retail business, but we mentioned the pressure because in the third quarter, it was artificially high. If you remember back in the second quarter, we highlighted timing of a load into retail customers for our security businesses that came out of the second quarter that we expected to get in the third quarter and indeed that happened.","In July, we had a fantastic month for our Retail Security business. So now as we go into the fourth quarter, if we look at run rate, that will fall out.","Jonathan Ho","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Saliq Khan","All right. Good morning, everyone.","Jim Cannon","Good morning.","Saliq Khan","Hey Jim. For the Surveillance sector, useful talking about the $75 million contract that you guys received back to September for the U.S. army. Can you us some more details on the timing of the realization of the entire revenue stream and also the margin profile?","Jim Cannon","Yeah absolutely. So again, it was about a $74 million I think $74 million and some change if you will. A few units have shipped. We did have material to get, I think about $4 million of that out in the quarter.","As we look in the fourth quarter now, we got to read from our supply chain or couple of long lead time items that we've got to get that's really going to be our governor for the fourth quarter. So, there is a bit of a bubble there, but that should be fully primed as we go into the first quarter of 2018.","The delivery is expected to happen by the end 2018. So, it's an 18 month or by the end of 2018 we expect to have all those units delivered and it's a real testament to the quality of our products and it's somewhere we're really proud of, it somewhere we're very passionate about.","Again, I've only been with the business for I guess four months now, but at AUSA, just recently got a lot of really unsolicited feedback from commanders in the field and soldiers that recounted experiences at four operating bases or cops where they had that rate programmer or EO\/IR FP towers to really help them detect threats at great distance.","So, it's a product and capability we're very proud of, but to answer your question, really through 2015 is the future delivery cycle.","Saliq Khan","Okay. And then it's good to see the security was back up again this quarter and Shane had mentioned something about the selling strategy being improved. Can you highlight what happened in the strategy that led you to a 16% incline year-over-year?","Jim Cannon","Well, the biggest thing in the third quarter that drove the growth as I mentioned was the orders that we expected in Q2 that fell into Q3 that drove that retail business, but we reorganized the business as you know into government defense, industrial and commercial business.","Travis Merrill, who is the president of that commercial business unit now that also had our intelligent traffic systems business in it and others is highlighting synergies that we have among the team and some of those are commercial synergies where our business development teams can work together more closely, can collaborate on unique projects with customers and there is a lot of work happening around product innovation back in the core thermal side of the house.","I mentioned the Series 0 product that we've launched that really is great for primers security, can see through obscuration at distance etcetera and you're going to see continued innovation across the Board for security as well as thinking about different ways to go to market and partner with various channel partners.","Saliq Khan","Okay. One last question on my end, which is you mentioned the word innovation and FLIR continues to be very innovative across all different product lines. However, you also mentioned earlier was you seeing ongoing pressure when it comes to retail portion of security.","So, while thinking about the future and as you go into '18, you go from six segments down to about three units. How do I think about the retail portion of security within your overall portfolio going forward?","Is it still going to become relevant? Is it becoming less relevant? What will your strategy be?","Jim Cannon","That's a good question. Well here's how we're approaching that. As I mentioned on last earnings call, my focus is been coming on Board, identifying value, figuring out how we organize around it and then putting the right operating rhythms in place to make sure we execute to it.","So, I've been moving down that roadmap and most notably the reorganization of the business, the establishment of the three business units is doing just that and we've implemented new rhythms across the company, business cadences to make sure that we execute.","And on go post door objective is by the next earnings call, we will clarify exactly what that strategy is. Travis Merrill who's been in the role for about a month now, has that right at the center of his roadmap of things to do to articulate a very concise strategy for not just the retail security business, but our security business on whole.","Now I do believe FLIR in the long term has a right to play and have compelling technologies in the security space. Even though there are a lot of lower cost thermal cameras that come on to the market, when you think about critical infrastructure, when you think about power plants or airports or data centers etcetera, the kind of technology that we can bring together is absolutely compelling in that space to differentiate. We're going to continue to do it.","We are working hard in the retail space and have introduced new bundles and products there as well, but the question you bring up is the question we absolutely intend to answer on the next earnings call. Travis and his team are working on that right now.","Saliq Khan","Great. Thank you, Jim.","Jim Cannon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question is coming from Drew Lipke from Stephens Inc. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Lipke","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question.","Jim Cannon","Sure Drew.","Drew Lipke","Jim, you talked about putting a dedicated FLIR method employed each segment and then you mentioned refining your product pricing strategy. I was curious if you can maybe elaborate on that a little bit more?","Jim Cannon","Absolutely, the FLIR method is something I'm really excited about, really passionate about. It's going to be our way to drive continuous improvement in the future and there is always rooms to improve. The outputs of the FLIR method, obviously our task and purpose etcetera, but we want to drive organic growth, we want to improve margin and we want to improve capital efficiency.","So, if we look at the levers or the tools that are going to be a part of the FLIR method, better pricing is a part of that. There are few ways that we can affect gross margin. Working on continuous improvement, driving productivity programs, engineering or designing to value our products certainly is one, but another is making sure that we have very effective pricing strategies that win in the market, win for our customers and maximize shareholder value.","So, introducing professional pricing disciplines across the company and pricing tools will be a part of the FLIR method along with dozens and dozens of other tools like lean Six Sigma etcetera, etcetera, with the intent that the measurable output is driving that continuous organic growth, improving margins and capital efficiencies.","Drew Lipke","Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe sticking on that capital efficiency theme and this could perhaps be a better question for the incoming CFO, but FLIR historically is operated with a pretty under-levered balance sheet. You're essentially net debt free today.","I'm just curious what's your stance and approach to may be optimal debt levels as it relates to both M&A opportunities and returning cash to shareholders?","Jim Cannon","Sure. As I mentioned on the last call I believe in a balanced capital allocation strategy. So, you're going to see us always considering dividends, making sure we have the right amount of debt and conservative in that regard, acquisitions, and we are an acquisitive company.","I see acquisitions as a central part of our growth portfolio going forward. We're very active in that regard as I come on Board and we're forming the strategy, as well as buying back shares etcetera. So, you're going to see us continue to be balanced.","Now last year I think at this time, we repurchased some shares. We then worked for several quarters to build up the capital that we had available for an acquisition that didn't come to fruition. You saw us pay down some debt, of course paid dividends consistently.","But you'll see us have a balanced approach, but I'll ask Shane to maybe elaborate a bit on that question.","Shane Harrison","Sure. Drew, we've been a fairly acquisitive company. We intend to be -- continue to be acquisitive. So, we want to have that firepower let's say on the ready for when we want to do deals. How far can we take it, it's basically investment grade rated. we like being investment grade rated. We can leverage that in a lot of different ways across our company.","But if the right deal comes along, there is a chance that we could take it above 2.5 times, but we just haven\u2019t seen deals like that. So, where we sit today is still looking and I've been spending a lot of my time trying to rebuild our pipeline from M&A and by rebuild we've kind of processed through a lot of the deals especially in 2016.","We did four of those deals. So, we intend to be doing some more acquisitions. So, we want to make sure we have the bandwidth to do that and that's part of the reason we did pay down that revolver. There was a couple other reasons like swap gain that we realized and a couple other reasons, but yeah, we like having that bandwidth and that's hasn't changed over these last let's say six months.","Drew Lipke","That's helpful. Thanks. I'll keep it at just two.","Jim Cannon","Thanks Drew.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. Jim maybe and this might be kind of two questions rolled into one, but can you give us the puts and takes on the revenue guidance for the fourth quarter?","We've got just about two months left here. $50 million to pretty wide range and maybe does that range tie into what's going on with the defense budget with the continuing resolution. Maybe just bridge us the puts and takes to the low end to the high end of that guidance range?","Jim Cannon","Sure, well stated with third quarter performance. We think that we've secured what we've guided throughout the year. Now we didn't narrow the revenue range. We narrowed the EPS range and we've got some big lumpy pieces of the business that could come in the fourth quarter and that's why we didn't do it.","We mentioned DR-SKO. Now some of that came into Q3, but we built the backlog actually. Again it's $50 million as opposed to $40 million. How much of that happens in the quarter, right now it\u2019s a bit of a unknown as well as I mentioned the EO\/IR FP program. We're working on some supply chain issues to be able to drive as much of that as possible. But again, some uncertainty in that and those are pretty big numbers that does lead us to that wider range.","Now as I mentioned, I'm proud of our Q3 performance, but not satisfied. We want to do all team to make sure we maximize our effort here in the fourth quarter. And also, I think I've got one quarter now into it. So, I can still use the new guide card. Full marks on the job.","I wanted to be a bit conservative about how much we show up in that guidance because I have all of one quarter's experience. That said, Q4 typically is a bigger quarter for us and we've got everything pushed in as hard as we can obviously to maximize our results for our shareholders.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. No, that's good. That's help. I appreciate the conservative and maybe just one more on margins, down year-over-year and certainly I am not going to ask for an outlook on 2018 or margins or anything else, but I heard higher legal some R&D restructuring yield savings, some accruals.","It sounds like there's a lot weighing on that margin. How should we expect the operating margins to trend going forward and obviously you guys are sharping the pencil, looking at the strategy, trying to grow organically. Just any more color on what to expect from margins?","Jim Cannon","Sure, if we look at our adjusted operating income, that 20 Bps of pressure that we had really as we mentioned came from corporate and it came from R&D and legal expenses or I'll say legal investments.","Now the R&D piece, we've got some things we're really excited about. Some technologies that are going to take some time to incubate and I mentioned the concept of the business that I approach that is fuel feed focused and that's one part of the business that we're going to continue to feed as we have some technologies we want to develop over time and more to come on that.","With the legal expenses, a lot of it was around compliance and training and making sure that we have the best processes people in place to ensure that we're always compliant and we have and are recognized as being world-class in that regard with export controls etcetera.","So, I really look at that as an investment in the business and something that's necessary in this work that we do. I mentioned our is to help our customers save lives and livelihood and part of that is not just our compliance, but our moral obligation to be the best company in the world that's safeguarding this technology to make sure it doesn\u2019t go into the wrong places.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. Thanks Jim. I'll jump back in the queue here.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Sullivan","Hey. Good morning.","Jim Cannon","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Sullivan","Can you just expand on some of the opportunities for the Black Hornet just as we come up on annualizing that acquisition as well? I know the Australians plan to equip almost every combat too with the Hornet. I think domestically the Marines just completed a big UAS exercise, but can you talk about how that maybe performed in the marine exercise and maybe how that may matriculate into contract dollars at some point?","Jim Cannon","Josh, the problem we've got is I don't know if we have enough time of the day for me to talk about my enthusiasm and opportunity for the Black Hornet. It's an acquisition that as I mentioned is about a year old, but I think it analyzes itself in November.","We've seen obviously a lot of interest with soldier-borne systems, with big army special operations command, the Marines as you mentioned and foreign militaries, Royal Marines, the French Army, the Norwegian Army, various units have used it and it's been fielded pretty extensively in combat environments.","And so, we've gotten a lot of feedback from users in the field about things that they want, features that they want to add etcetera. Now we're already on Black Hornet 3 from the original Black Hornet now it's got even more capability, it's got modularity to it where you can change between cameras, the EO\/IR, the battery is detachable etcetera, etcetera.","We're really excited because this is something that will change the tactics and techniques and procedures at the individual fire team or squad level and we're team now and are already developing roadmaps for what's next.","We're not satisfied just with its current capability and I don't want to go into great detail about what that capability is on this call for obvious reasons. But as we think about what next-generations and when we think about the needs of the soldiers, our teams are racing to develop additional capabilities because this is a product that increases situational awareness, it saves lives on the battlefield full stop and we can point to a lot of examples of how that happens.","The biggest opportunity though that we can highlight is soldier borne systems. This has been used by small units for some time, by special operations forces that initially adopted it. Soldier borne systems would be a large fielding to conventional maneuver forces and we're in the throes of working through that opportunity. There have been some flows already.","We're really proud of how Black Hornet performed, but we won't be satisfied with Black Hornet until it reaches it -- I'll say we'll never be there will never be satisfied because A, it can always push the envelopes of what's possible.","The fundamental premise of land warfare made contact with your smallest possible element and right now that's a soldier and we would rather be a Black Hornet. I could go on and on about this but I am afraid we'll take up everybody else's time Josh.","Josh Sullivan","Okay. I know. I'll ask political day on it, but I'll movie the next question over to IIS. How was the penetration of FLIR products into Point Grey's offering progressing? And then I guess secondly, do you see any areas of technology holes that you want to fill in machine vision maybe into the future?","Jim Cannon","The IIS business has grown a lot, but really what's grown is its core technology. Now it's introducing new products around this core technologies, new and improved, but the adoption of thermal at IIS, I'd think it's been mediocre.","There's been some opportunity they\u2019ve developed for certain. We do think that there is future potential for that. That's a synergy that we stated with the acquisition and we'll continue to focus on, but there principally came from the core technologies and their our own organic innovation.","Josh Sullivan","Got it. Thank you.","Jim Cannon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Noah Poponak","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Jim Cannon","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Jim, recognizing you've announced a segment a re-segmentation of the business, in the current segment form, which of the six operating segments do you think is unlikely to have its piece of organic revenue growth accelerate in 2018 versus '17?","Jim Cannon","Well, right now we're in the midst of going through our 2018 operating plan. We went through the first iteration that we're getting the bottoms up view by the businesses looking at their backlog, their sales forecast etcetera.","The second round of that happens actually in two weeks. So, I think it will be a bit premature for me to state that at the segment level or even the BU level right now because frankly we're just now going through that diligent as part of the 2018 operating plan.","Noah Poponak","Okay. I guess I was looking -- I am looking less for forecast by segment or anything like that and more top-down if I'm crazy in my model telling me that if there's at least a scenario, it's in the scenario analysis that actually every segment could have its piece of revenue growth accelerate next year either because of the end market tail ends or because of just the way the year-over-year comparisons shake out?","Jim Cannon","Well, that certainly our intent and the biggest thing that would point to that is our backlog, it's $709 million. We went back as far as 2007 when the company again was much smaller on whole and this is all-time record backlog and we made that same statement the second quarter, but we increased the backlog significantly from the second quarter into the third quarter.","And the backlog items that are in there, the biggest pieces like I mentioned the EO\/IR FP program we know that delivers in 2018 as well as several others also in 2018. The work has been done on instruments, the work that's been done at Maritime and it's not done.","The work that's been done IIS and security to develop a bevy of new products, they'll get into a full year run rate in 2018 where we didn't have that full year run rate in 2017. So certainly, organic growth is a principle objective for the company.","Noah Poponak","Good. The Middle East weakness you called out in surveillance, do you have a view based on actual order input or just based on the lapping the -- annualizing the start of that decline, do you have a view when that stops and that geography within surveillance can at least flatten out if not start growing again?","Jim Cannon","I think in 2018 we had a really big comp, the Middle East was a strong region for our surveillance business last year. Timing of orders etcetera can be difficult to forecast in that region for certain, but if I look at the business development activities there, if I look at the coating activities, the universe of potential opportunities we're going after, that's actually increasing.","Now the timing of when those opportunities really realize and become an order, that's difficult certainly for us to predict. We hope that that begins to happen as we close the year go in and through 2018, but the softness principally right now is again lapping a precut tough comp.","We see a lot of activity in that region but the timing of which is difficult to predict.","Noah Poponak","Can you remind me the first quarter that you faced that level of the tough level.","Jim Cannon","You know when that would be Shane. We had something we might have to get you an answer after the call.","Shane Harrison","Q1 was a really tough comp. Q3 also was a tough comp. It's choppy Noah as you know, it's big orders that we get. Deliveries get choppy, but if you look at on a trailing 12-month basis, yes, it's been a very difficult comp and it's a couple of big orders that we got last year.","Noah Poponak","So, as you move into '18 that sort of reset.","Jim Cannon","Right.","Noah Poponak","Got it. If I could sneak in one more, just on the surveillance margin, a supercritical input into the model given it's the largest segment and if that business can grow with defense getting better you just naturally mix up, nice to see it back in the 30s Jim, I am sure you've studied the history of that margin at much different volume levels.","So, I guess with it now poking up about 30 again I'm curious if you have a view on what the right long run three to five sustainable surveillance segment operating margin is?","Jim Cannon","Well as you mentioned it levers and de-levers nicely with volume. Right now, we've got this Q3 ending backlog of almost $400 million, $395 million that's about 21% increase in the book-to-bill in the quarter was 1.45. I think that where it is now is probably where it\u2019s going to continue to maintain itself.","We also need to make some investments in that business and are making investments in that business to ensure that our technology stays on its front foot. So, there is a lot of work that we are doing there now that you're here throughout 2018 the result of.","But I think where again where it's at now in the 30, low 30 range is we grow is probably where it's going to hold itself.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thank you.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Noah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up here? Jim just more on the Army EO\/IR contract, I heard you guys mention rate a couple times. Is this -- are these products satisfying incrementally new demand? I would have through there is so many of those gimbels out there in the field that there would have been more repair or do you just simply replacing or upgrading.","Can you just give us color on what's going on from a demand perspective?","Jim Cannon","Sure, this is a continuation or you can think of it as a continuation of the RAID program. It's been renamed the EO\/IR FP the Electrooptical Infrared Force Protection Program. And it's not replacing and it may in certain discrete circumstances replace a unit that's out there etcetera, but it's really additional need that they for this product.","It's got great capability what it enables our war fighters to do to detect threats, identify threats at great distances, all over the world in some very, very harsh conditions is a testament of the hard work of the team that put it together. So, this is additional demand that the military has for force protection.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Jeff Kessler","Thank you. Thank you for taking and thank you for taking my question. I want to just quickly ask a question about technology and the application technology, that is you've had obviously the left in core out there for some time when we supplanted or let's just say complemented by other core like the Boson core, which has become obvious a staple.","What in terms of core development are you doing right now and what markets are specifically going or in general going to be impacted by new core development that you're doing? What types of product and in which segments are we should be watching to see some of these new core developments?","Jim Cannon","Well, as you mentioned, Lepton has enabled so many products and applications across all the segments. Black Hornet for example as we mentioned earlier have Lepton, a host of instruments product have Lepton. Boson is really important across all of our business as you know as well.","Smaller, more capable and always that size, weight and power matter. Jeff, you'll forgive me if I don't go into a lot of detail about what we're doing about future core technology development. Suffice to say no one intended at our core is the development of the best our cores in the world.","And so, our team in Santa Barbara is working very hard always on improving the capability, the fidelity, the size, weight and power etcetera and as they do that as you stated across all of our segments, that has application.","If we think about UAS for example and I mentioned the new dual product with visible light and IR that we introduced for commercial UAS applications is we can continue to increase the fidelity as well as the size, weight, power that has countless applications for firefighters, for first responders, for critical infrastructure inspection etcetera, etcetera.","But I'll stop short of given frankly any real detail about the effort underway there if you'll forgive me.","Jeff Kessler","Okay. My assumption is that you will in the next couple of shows may be year -- half a year out to a year out we will be seeing some new products from these core development you're doing right now.","Jim Cannon","We're constantly innovating our core. So yes.","Jeff Kessler","Okay. Okay. Great. We'll talk later about that. Thank you very much for answering the question.","Jim Cannon","Okay. Thanks Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Jim Cannon","Again. I want to thank you all for joining the call. I especially want to thank the FLIR team over 3500 teammates that work so hard to accomplish our task, to exceed shareholder commitments with integrity and are so very proud of our purpose, to innovate the world's six senses our customers can save lives and livelihood. Thank you all so much and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time and have a wonderful day.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Wit Davis, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary for FLIR Systems, Inc. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.","William W. Davis","Good morning, everyone.

The forward-looking statements we make today speak as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","Let me now turn the call over to Andy Teich, President and CEO of FLIR Systems. Andy?","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Wit, and welcome to FLIR's Second Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. With me on the call today is our CFO, Tony Trunzo; Bill Sundermeier, the President of Government Systems; and Tom Surran, who I'd like to welcome in his new position as President of our Commercial Systems division.","In the second quarter, we reported revenue of $389 million and earnings per share of $0.35. This represented a year-over-year increase of 15% in revenue and 30% in earnings per share. Organically, revenues increased 6% over Q2 of 2012, which represents the first quarter of organic growth since early 2011. The additions of Traficon and Lorex to TVM and significant deliveries in our Integrated Systems segment drove the top line increase, while margin improvement in Commercial Systems positively impacted earnings.","Total company backlog increased to $528 million on a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 as we saw the highest quarterly bookings in nearly 5 years. Additionally, we reached an all-time high in quarterly operating cash flow, with $134 million generated, and when coupled with $150 million we added under a new 6-year term loan, our cash balance at the end of the quarter was nearly $500 million.","Commercial Systems revenue was up 17% in the second quarter, the best performance in 5 quarters. We still face a challenging macro environment, however, particularly in the high-end science and predictive maintenance markets.","Our Government Systems division had very strong bookings during the quarter, particularly the Surveillance segment, which increased backlog by nearly $24 million over the end of the first quarter. While bookings were good both domestically and internationally in Q2, we remain cautious regarding second half U.S. DoD bookings due to continuing risks associated with sequestration and the continuing resolution. However, we expect continued strength internationally, as well as from non-DoD customers in the U.S.","Our international business development team has done a very good job identifying and capturing meaningful bookings throughout the world. We continue to progress well in the development of our next-generation high-volume low-cost sensor technology. We are achieving our technical milestones on schedule and are now focused on manufacturing and supply chain development. We expect to have the first products featuring this technology next year.","The fundamentals in some of our markets are improving, while, in others, they remain relatively challenging. Overall, we anticipate slow improvement. With this economic environment, we will continue to focus on innovative product development, marketing communications and operational execution. We are developing efficiency initiatives that are expected to improve our operations and position us for scalable growth.","Taking into consideration our first half results and forecast for the second half of the year, we are maintaining our outlook for the full year 2013. We continue to expect between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of revenue and earnings of between $1.56 and $1.66 per diluted share.","With that, I'll now let Tony review the second quarter financial performance. Tony?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Thank you, Andy. Second quarter consolidated revenue was $389.3 million, an increase of 15% compared to the second quarter of 2012, the first quarter of organic growth since Q1 of 2011. Commercial Systems division revenue in the second quarter increased by 17% to $221.8 million.","The Thermal Vision and Measurement segment posted second quarter revenue of $175 million, an increase of 23% compared with the second quarter of last year. Lorex and Traficon, 2 businesses we acquired late in 2012, both performed well and accounted for $31.6 million of TVM revenue in Q2. Organically, TVM was up fractionally, as slightly lower revenue from the thermography and security lines of business was offset by good growth in the OEM and maritime systems businesses. Raymarine revenue declined by 1% compared to Q2 of last year to $46.9 million.","Government Systems Q2 revenue was $167.5 million, an increase of 13% compared to $148.5 million in the second quarter of 2012 due to a $21.2 million increase in the Integrated Systems revenue to $34.5 million as a result of significant MSC and DRC program deliveries. Surveillance segment revenue was $118.6 million, down 1% from Q2 of last year and the best year-over-year change since Q4 of 2010. Detection segment revenue was $14.4 million, a decrease of 9% from last year due to a $1.8 million decline in contract R&D revenue.","International revenue was 45% of the consolidated total in Q2 compared with 55.1% last year. U.S. government revenue increased by 52% to $114.8 million due to MSC and DRC deliveries, as well as improved U.S. shipments in Surveillance and TVM. Commercial Systems international sales made up 52.5% of its consolidated revenue in Q2 compared to 62.9% in Q2 last year due to the recovery of U.S. OEM deliveries from a soft Q2 last year, as well as the impact of Lorex, which is mostly U.S. revenue at this point. 35.2% of Government Systems revenue came from outside the U.S. compared with 45% last year. Total sales to the U.S. government were 29.5% of the total in Q2, up from 22.4% of the total in the second quarter of last year.","Consolidated gross margin was 48.8% for the second quarter compared with 50.3% last Q2 despite a 1.7-percentage-point negative impact from lower margins at recent acquisitions and a 2.7-percentage-point negative impact from Integrated Systems. TVM margins increased by 6.6 percentage points on an organic basis.","Consolidated operating income was $70.3 million, an increase of 16% compared with the second quarter of last year, and operating margin was 18%, similar to the 17.9% in Q2 of 2012. Second quarter operating income in Commercial Systems was $48.1 million, an increase of 45% compared with Q2 of last year. TVM posted $41.8 million of operating income, up 53% from last year, while Raymarine operating income of $6.3 million represented a 10% increase from last Q2.","Government Systems operating income was $36.7 million for the quarter compared with $39.4 million in last Q2. Surveillance segment operating income was $35.3 million, down 13% from last year, while Detection swung to a $1.3 million operating profit from a $1.8 million loss last Q2. Integrated Systems was breakeven compared to operating income of $300,000 last year.","Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock compensation in the quarter were $92.6 million, a 12% improvement from Q2 of 2012. Our tax provision for the quarter was 24.7% of pretax income, and we continue to expect a tax rate of approximately 25% to 26% for the full year, excluding the R&D credit for 2012 that was recognized in the first quarter of this year.","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $134.3 million, equal to 268% of net income and easily a quarterly record for FLIR. Inventories declined by 7%, while accounts receivable declined by 9% in the quarter. We repurchased 636,000 shares of our common stock during the quarter, including 286,000 shares delivered to us in early April to complete an accelerated share repurchase program. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 4.5 million shares at an average price of $26.05 per share. Q2 capital expenditures were $10.6 million.","As Andy mentioned earlier, we have reaffirmed our revenue and earnings per share outlook for the full year 2013. In Q4, we expect to have approximately $3.5 million in transition-related expenses associated with the payment of retirement benefits. In addition, we are reviewing our global operations for further efficiency opportunities, and it is likely we will take a modest restructuring charge in the third quarter to account for the cost of any such changes. Any restructuring charges in Q3, as well as the Q4 onetime retirement benefit costs, are excluded from our outlook for the year.","This concludes the summary of our second quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to discuss the Commercial Systems Q2 performance in greater detail. Tom?","Thomas A. Surran","Thank you, Tony. The Commercial Systems division finished the second quarter of 2013 with a 17% increase in revenue and a 45% increase on operating profit compared to the prior year. Organically, the Commercial Systems division was flat in revenue, but increased operating margin by over 6 percentage points versus last year.","We saw strong revenue growth in our OEM line of business, and this includes our Cores & Components and automotive products, as well as in the maritime product line. There was continued softness in Thermography, particularly in EMEA and in Japan, where an ownership change in a key distributor disrupted order flow. Margin improvement was due to higher production unit volumes, which improved overhead absorption, as well as a better product mix. The success of our vanguard freshwater Dragonfly product helped Raymarine offset softness in the Americas and EMEA regions. Lorex and Traficon came in slightly ahead of the revenue budget and both were profitable.","Commercial Systems division Q2 bookings increased 19% over the prior year and organically grew low-single digits. TVM bookings increased 24% over the prior year, while Raymarine bookings declined less than 1%. TVM's Thermography line of business saw bookings dollars decline nearly 10% from a year ago as European end markets continue to lag. However, we have seen good results from our shifting of sales resources from EMEA to higher-growth markets. For example, Thermography orders in China increased over 20% during the quarter.","The introduction of our K-series firefighting camera has gone very well, and we are investing and building out the distribution channel for this highly valuable, life-saving product. In fact, we recently won a competitive tender for over -- nearly 100 cameras for a European customer. Looking forward, our customers continue -- can expect to see exciting new products and an increased focus on building awareness of the benefits of thermal imaging.","TVM's OEM line of business grew bookings dollars nearly 10% year-over-year, driven by strong order activity for military OEMs for our cores. Booked units in OEM increased over 20% compared to the second quarter of 2012 due largely to increases in our automotive line of business. The rollout of our thermal imager in Mercedes 2014 model year cars contributed to this growth.","Security line of business bookings increased organically by over 40% versus last year and nearly tripled when including Lorex. For the first 6 months of 2013, security bookings are up over 60% organically versus the first 6 months of 2012. Several large border security orders aided this performance.","Lorex outperformed our expectations with good growth in their professional grade line of cameras, which we have now migrated to the FLIR brand. We also saw strong sales of Lorex's new IP-based full HD security systems to retailers such as Costco. Lorex continues to bring new products to market, and we remain excited about the opportunities their products and distribution channels will bring us in the future.","With our December acquisition of Traficon integrating well with our thermal traffic camera business, we are encouraged by the prospects of penetrating the worldwide smart traffic market. Our intelligent traffic systems line of business had bookings revenue growth of over 30% compared to the pro forma second quarter of 2012, which includes both FLIR's traffic camera business and Traficon's results prior to our acquisition. Large projects in Russia and Singapore account for much of this growth.","TVM's maritime business bookings were up nearly 40% compared to Q2 of 2012. This growth was broad-based across all regions and was driven by both our light commercial customers, as well as the initial deliveries of our fixed MD-Series camera and our high-end MV- and MU-series multi-payload marine vision systems.","The Personal Vision Systems line of business was flat on bookings basis compared to last year. The PVS Americas region grew bookings nearly 20% year-over-year. However, softness in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions offset this growth. Unit orders for our popular PS-Series camera increased nearly 40% versus last year.","Raymarine bookings dollars declined 1% versus the second quarter of 2012, mainly due to a tough comparison in the Asia Pacific region related to a large order in China last year. Bookings in the EMEA region were down 1% versus last year, the best rate we've seen in more than a year. These declines were offset by a 9% bookings growth in the Americas region. The launch of our Dragonfly sonar GPS unit impacted Raymarine's bookings positively, and the product has proven to be a successful entry into the freshwater boating market, with the photo-like sonar capability of its DownVision technology.","We recently announced several other new products which feature our DownVision technology. The CP100 black box sonar unit brings DownVision capabilities to network Raymarine systems, and DownVision technology is also now available as an embedded option for our a Series full-featured touchscreen MFDs. We have additional product targeting the freshwater segment under development. Our recently introduced Evolution autopilot with its unique auto-calibration capability and our premium glass bridge gS series MFDs are also both doing well. We will be introducing several new products in the near future that will showcase our technology, quality and performance lead over competition.","That concludes my comments, and I would like to pass the call over to Bill Sundermeier, who will discuss the results of our Government Systems division. Bill?","William A. Sundermeier","Thank you, Tom. Government Systems division revenue was up 13% versus second quarter of 2012, and we ended the quarter with backlog of $339 million, $5 million higher than both the previous quarter and the previous year. As expected, quarterly operating margin was negatively impacted by product mix as much of the increase in revenue was derived from initial MSC deliveries to the U.S. border patrol and essentially, no margin. We will complete deliveries under this portion of the contract in Q3, and we expect any additional orders to carry better margins.","The Surveillance segment grew backlog 8% over Q1 of this year, finishing with $269 million. U.S. government bookings grew nearly 20% over the prior year as lower DoD orders were offset by much stronger order flow from other U.S. federal agencies. Bookings activity from non-U.S. customers grew 30% versus Q2 of 2012, and the percentage of our orders that came from outside the U.S. reached 45% of total bookings in the quarter.","The largest order in the quarter for the Surveillance segment was $23 million from the U.S. Coast Guard to outfit their H-60 and H-65 helicopters with our midsized Talon gimbal system. With a low total cost of ownership, quick delivery capability and a highly configured solution for the intended mission, this product highlights the benefits our customers can gain from our Commercially Developed Military Qualified model. We also received 2 large orders totaling $26 million from the U.S. Army for gimbal systems for their MEDEVAC helicopters. One of those orders was delayed order from Q1 while the second was quickly received follow-on for $7.5 million.","Order activity in the Middle East was robust as well. During the quarter, we received a $16 million order for our Recon handheld thermal systems from a U.S. ally that is a long-time customer of FLIR. We also booked a $9 million order from another Middle Eastern country for several of our Star SAFIRE gimbal systems, a $7 million order for our remote weapon station thermal imagers for another critical U.S. ally in the region and a $4 million order from the UAE for our Recon handheld.","At the Paris Air Show in June, we demonstrated the Star SAFIRE 380-HDc gimbal, a revolutionary, new high-definition imaging system designed for airborne applications that has market-leading size, weight, power consumption and ground clearance. We have seen strong interest from many customers and expect this product to be an important driver of bookings in 2014 and beyond.","The Detection segment finished the quarter with $23 million in backlog, largely unchanged from Q1 of this year. We received a $2 million order from a Middle Eastern country for our new Fido X3 handheld explosive detectors, as well as a $2 million order for our identiFINDER radiation detectors from U.S. first responders, European and South American environmental monitoring agencies and a border patrol agency in Asia. Orders for products represented over 70% of the Q2 bookings dollars as we continue to reduce Detection's exposure to low-margin contract development work. And 50% of those product orders came from international markets. Margins and costs continue to be a focus on the Detection segment, and thus far this year, the business is ahead of the plan for profitability. We're continuing to focus on improving margins in this segment.","Integrated Systems backlog declined by $18 million during the quarter due to significant shipments of MSC systems to the U.S. CBP for the Southern border. The final units under our initial order from the MSC program have been shipped, and we expect to recognize revenue for these units in Q3. We are encouraged by the customers' response to the MSC thus far. Our product, technology, service and delivery capability positions us well for further programs for the U.S. border initiative, as well as numerous opportunities that exist outside of the U.S. In addition to MSC, the Integrated Systems team delivered several DRC systems to the U.S. National Guard civil support teams, completed a project for the Nevada test range that generated nearly $5 million of revenue and booked nearly $3 million in maritime security products during the quarter.","That concludes my comments on Government Systems second quarter. I'll pass the call back to Andy","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Bill. I've had the opportunity to visit many of our operations, particularly in the Government Systems division, over the past 60 days and have come to more fully appreciate the depth and breadth of FLIR's technologies and capabilities. I also see opportunities to improve our operations and more efficiently deploy our resources to benefit all of FLIR. And I've seen the enthusiasm, dedication and skill of our employees who really make it all happen. These visits have me more excited than ever about the opportunities ahead for us. We are uniquely positioned to continue to lead our industry, innovate exciting new technologies and bring them to market and provide exceptional returns to all of our stakeholders.","With that, I'd like to open up the call for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","I just want to ask you on the macro. It's interesting that you said, it sounds like China orders were up pretty good and Europe was still down a little bit. It sounds like almost the macro is switching a little bit with the Europe flash PMI improving, it came out yesterday, and China maybe starting to deteriorate. Are you guys seeing that at all as we head into the summer months here? Is Europe actually picking up? And is China deteriorating for you? Any early signs there?","Andrew C. Teich","So we have not seen any deterioration in China, and I think that -- I saw the same indications that you did, Pete. But I think that, that market is so nascently tapped in terms of the market potential over there. And with our shift in moving sales resources out of the EMEA region and into a region such as China, I think we've still -- we're still going to see growth there irrespective of what's going on in terms of the macroeconomic activity there. The one area I think -- and we haven't seen much improvement in the Thermography segment in the EMEA region. I'm going to have Tom comment on what's going on in the Raymarine business in the EMEA region because I think we've seen a little bit of a pickup there.","Thomas A. Surran","Not material. I would say that it's executing according to plan. That's about it, we haven't seen a big step-up.","Andrew C. Teich","Yes. I mean, at least the -- in terms of the quarter, the decline sort of leveled off.","Thomas A. Surran","That's right. So at the end of the second quarter -- we saw some weakness in the first part of the second quarter, and this back half of the second quarter, it seemed to improve in EMEA. And right now, we're executing according to plan.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then I wanted to switch to corporate expenses. I guess post Traficon and Lorex, this $14.5 million or so, is that kind of the new run rate for corporate expenses, that $14 million to $15 million type of range?","Andrew C. Teich","Pete, the big variable in our corporate expenses tends to be legal expense, and that was a little higher than budget in Q2. It's probably going to run a little higher in Q3 and Q4 as well. I think you can expect somewhere in that zip code in the next couple of quarters. The other variable that comes in there is bonus, and that will bounce around a little bit based on how we're tracking for our performance parameters. When you look at the, what I'll call, controllable pieces of corporate spending, i.e. the accounting, the IT, those kinds of things, expenses are well controlled. They're actually down sort of mid-single digits from what they were last year, and I expect that trend to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Quillin with Stephens.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","With regards to the MSC program, can you give us a sense of the magnitude of the third quarter shipments just in terms of revenue contribution versus this quarter? And then when you say that margins should improve with additional orders there, what kind of magnitude are we talking about? Is it always going to be lower than corporate gross margin?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Well, MSC in Q3 will be about half of what we shipped in Q2. Sean, do you have the...","Sean Jordan","That's $8 million to $9 million -- it's about $9 million.","Anthony L. Trunzo","About $9 million in Q3. And of course, those will continue to go out with little or no margin. But subsequent orders which we would receive from that program are international. We're going to certainly try to push back towards our typical margins in that IS space, which have tended to move towards 38% and higher.","Andrew C. Teich","Tim, I'll mention a couple of other things about that program. These remaining deliveries that we have in Q3 complete the first tranche of deliveries, and we are anticipating receiving another contract award on this. That subsequent contract award should come in at slightly higher prices due to the terms that were in the contract. The other issue is, is that we have opportunities within the product construct there to increase the level of FLIR content. There are some components of that system that are not currently manufactured by FLIR but could be manufactured by FLIR. And we believe that, that has benefit to both FLIR and to the customer, and we're working with the customer there to make those changes because, again, those would be bidirectionally beneficial. The combination of pulling out the amortized R&D that was in the deliveries, this first tranche of deliveries, plus picking up potentially more FLIR content and a little bit higher pricing will all push the margins up. The margins are never going to get to the kind of margins that you see -- traditional surveillance margins because there are a lot of bought-in components in that product. But when you flip to international, as Bill mentioned, the international margin is actually going to be quite good on that, and we have already sold some -- we have not delivered yet, but we have booked some units, international variant of the MSC. We call it the MVSS, and we've seen pretty good interest for that product internationally. So we think it has a good future. And then the last thing is, with the border patrol reform act that's in Congress right now, we think that we -- that, that product has some promising future for it.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then second question is regarding the proposed or a planned restructuring charge in Q3. I just wondered if you can give a little bit more details about what that might involve and what you hope to accomplish?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes, we're still framing it out, Tim. I mean, as I indicated, any charge associated with it is going to be pretty modest. But basically, we're looking at finding ways to streamline some of our operations. There are opportunities on the manufacturing side to get better at our manufacturing and give some lift to the gross margin line. And there is still some back-office consolidation work that we can do as well, and I think we're going to be looking in those areas to generate some savings.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I guess this question is for Tony. Tony, you had a nice tick-down in terms of overall inventory levels. I know this has kind of been something you've been focused on and trying to improve the overall turns. Is there anything -- can you give some more color there? Or was this just kind of a one-off this quarter?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Well, we're all hoping it was not a one-off. A couple of things about it. I mean, it was a nice decrease, but we're still not even back to our own peak in terms of what our inventory turns have been. If you go back a couple of years, we turned our inventory globally about 2.5x. Turns today are still about 2x. The improvement was isolated in a couple of segments. There were a couple of segments that did not make a lot of progress, so I think there is still some meaningful opportunity there. Tim asked a minute ago about restructuring. I think I don't know if there's going to be restructuring associated with it necessarily that will be transparent to you guys. But from a supply chain standpoint, we think there's opportunities to do things better there that can probably give some structural lift. Frankly, I think, this quarter, I hope that part of the improvement was a response to the fact that we now have cash flow from operations as one of the metrics in our annual incentive plan for all of our employees. And certainly, in my travels around the company, I've seen people respond positively to that, they know that it's part of the incentive plan, and people are more focused on it. So I think it's a good start, but there's $100 million in inventory opportunity that is simply the delta between where our turns were in the first part of this year and where they were at their peak back 3, 4 years ago. And I'd like to see us in a position to harvest that over the next 4 to 6 quarters.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's great color. If I could just ask one unrelated to Tom. Tom, the predictive maintenance market had been soft. What do you think we need to see just to get that back? Is that just overall manufacturing activity? Or what -- could you give us any more color there?","Thomas A. Surran","One, yes, sure, there's still some economic delay in Europe, but beyond that we're working on a new generation of products that we'll be bringing to the market in the second half of this year, early 2014. So the capabilities of that product are such that we are going to also spend resources on communicating the benefit they'll bring to our customers, and we're very enthusiastic about what it will do for our business.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I just wanted to again go back to the issue of gross margins. On the acquisitions you talked about, I think a 1.7-point hit from, I'm assuming, Traficon and Lorex. How do you see that playing out over the next couple of quarters? Is there going to continue to be some drag there? How soon could we see some margin improvement in some of those acquired businesses?","Andrew C. Teich","Jim, it's Andy. I think that what's really going to drive margin improvement in those businesses is going to be the injection of thermal into the businesses. The margins within Traficon are actually pretty good today. There are some improvements that can be done in terms of G&A spending there, and that's one of the issues that we will address here in H2. Relative to Lorex, though, that's a business that is primarily Asian-sourced product and resold, the margins are not terribly good there. There, again, we can pick up some improvement on the G&A line, but ultimately, the plan for Lorex will be to inject low-cost thermal technology into those products, which will differentiate them significantly enough that we can derive higher margins from them. That won't happen until -- the latter part of 2014 is probably when you'll see the first emergence of that. In the meantime, we're also -- we mentioned in the prepared comments that we've seen some growth on the professional end of Lorex product group. Those products are currently branded under the FLIR brand. They carry a little bit higher margin and -- but it's a small piece of the business today. As that grows, that will allow us to see some margin improvement there as well. But this is really a 2014 phenomenon and slow growth from that point.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And Andy, I just want to go back to your comment that you made, I think, in the initial presentation, where you talked about fundamentals improving. And I wondered just if you could elaborate a little bit more on the markets, either the product areas or the geographic areas where you're seeing that improvement.","Andrew C. Teich","Well, the U.S. is -- from a geographic standpoint, that's the primary area where we have seen some improvement in the Raymarine business and the TVM segment. And in the GS segment, relative to U.S. federal, bookings have been doing pretty well. We're cautious about that, though, because we also are concerned about what's going to happen in the DoD segment in the second half, so we're being conservative on that front. The APAC region looks like it could show some promise for the second half of the year. I don't have much hope for the EMEA region performing much better in the second half of the year. We could see some improvement also in the manufacturing sector. As Tom mentioned, we've got some products that we'll be launching in the second half of the year in the TVM segment that we think will stimulate some additional activity globally. And when we launch those products, we'll shift some spending from R&D to marketing communications to support those product launches.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with CRT Capital.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I have a question -- a couple. I guess I can narrow it down. R&D trends on the year and maybe talk about sequestration impacts in the second half of the year to guidance. If sequestration was -- yes, didn't take any impact, how much would you see revenue higher? And how much have you accounted for in sequestration? So the R&D question and the sequestration question.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Brian, it's Tony. I'll take the R&D question, and then I'll let Bill comment on sequestration. The R&D spending has been kind of in that 8% to 10% range. I don't think in the short term you're going to see much variation in that. We've got a pretty clear plan for what we want to execute on in the second half of this year. The project list is pretty well established. We have some products that we're focused on getting completed. We have some new technologies that we've talked about that we're focused on, on getting completed. So I don't think you're going to see a lot of variation in the R&D spend relative to revenue. Going forward, as the company grows a little -- as the company sees more organic growth, you could see that percentage come back down to the lower end of that 8% to 10% range that we've talked about for a long time. It's been in the lower end of that range during robust growth periods in the past, and I think that's possible that you could see that, but not for the second part of this year. Bill, you want to...","William A. Sundermeier","Sure. Brian, it's Bill. With regards to sequestration, we have seen a general order slowing here with the U.S. military. As we went into this year, we anticipated about a 20% decline in U.S. DoD orders, and it's actually been slightly worse than that. But our U.S. federal business has offset that, and we've had pretty good order flow in Q2. And our international orders have been pretty good at offsetting that as well. So as our outlook, we look in the next half of this year, we're still continuing to look very conservatively at U.S. military spending and see that to continue, but remain cautiously optimistic that our CDMQ model really embodies a fiscal responsibility that hopefully will win out in the long run.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to understand -- first of all, around the Mercedes product launch, what was the initial reception and what are your thoughts around what the potential take rate could be for this product?","Andrew C. Teich","I'll comment on this first, Jonathan. The one thing that I find differentiating about the Mercedes launch is that this was the first product to come out to include this feature, the dynamic spotlight feature, and it really adds a level of usability for this product that wasn't there before. So what that does is when a target is detected, either a person or an animal -- and that was another feature that was added in this revision of night vision 3 was animal detection. But whether a person or an animal is detected by the system, it's then illuminated by this spotlight, which is pointed from the front of the vehicle. So it both alerts the driver to the object that is in front of them, and also, if it's a person or something, they know that the vehicle is coming and sees them because the spotlight illuminates them. So I think that's a differentiating function that we feel good about in terms of delivering added user experience. Tom, you want to talk about what we're seeing on the. . .","Thomas A. Surran","Yes, without getting to the specifics of the Daimler shipments -- or the Mercedes shipments, what we did see in the second quarter as we've commenced shipping to Mercedes is strength year-over-year, significant strength in our automotive, so much so that it actually made up for the softness in the first quarter. And as we look to the back half of this year, we see continued growth.","Andrew C. Teich","And I think that's also a positive thing from the foundry perspective, is that it moves significantly higher volumes through the foundry and gives us a little more absorption there as well.","Thomas A. Surran","Yes, significantly higher.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just in terms of the Raymarine business, just wanted to understand whether you're actually seeing much of a pickup at this point. I know the macro has still been tough. Boating shipment has still been tough. But are you starting to see any inflection points? And perhaps a little bit more color on the freshwater introduction as well.","Thomas A. Surran","Yes, the freshwater introduction has gone extremely well, so we were very pleased with that. The orders for it outstripped our ability to deliver the Dragonfly. That was one of the products we carried significant backlog into Q3. What we have seen -- normally, there's a seasonality that is really strong Q2. What we've seen so far is a fairly good start to Q3. So we have been encouraged by that. It may be weather patterns where we saw a late start to the season. But right now, the end of Q2 and the start of Q3 were good.","Andrew C. Teich","I would just add to that, that the Dragonfly is a product that we're really excited about. Not only did it bring in this new DownVision capability, which has been very well received by the market, and even to include markets like law enforcement, where they're looking for things in the water. It's an impressive capability. But I'll add to that, that we challenge the team with some very aggressive goals on the cost front and on the usability front in terms of presenting a very simple but powerful user interface. And the team, the Raymarine team did an outstanding job of delivering against this. This unit is aesthetically pleasing. It's got the unique mounting capabilities. It's very bright. It's very easy to use. It has a new lever -- level of graphical user interface for our products, which has been very well received by the market from a usability standpoint.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe this one for Bill. If you could just help us understand -- the MSC program, clearly a nice contributor now. Sounds like you're looking for more orders. But how does this program sort of interact with the integrated fixed tower that's out there for the U.S. border? I mean, could this be complementary to that or will that be a headwind for this potential program for you guys?","William A. Sundermeier","That's a good question. IFT and MSC certainly are going to have to work together for CBP as 2 different methods for border patrol. But I don't see -- and if you look at the immigration reform packages coming out, there are different line items and have different procurement dollars and requirements behind them. So I don't really see it as a headwind. As a matter of fact, the MSC capability and being able to be mobile and adaptive as compared to a stationary position, with -- our experience out there with the existing fixed towers, the folks on the other side figure out where they're at and how far they can see and work their way around them. And we believe that our mobile capability is much better capability in being able to deploy it wherever the target is and wherever the threat is. So I don't see them -- they are complementary and there's -- certainly that and the immigration reform budget today have complementary line items.","Andrew C. Teich","I would just add 2 other things to that, Michael, is that MSC is fielded now. It's a complete fielded solution that is deliverable today. And I think that when the funding starts to flow on this program that, that's what the border patrol is very likely to gravitate towards, something that they can apply funding to and get deliveries quickly on. And that's where we stand with MSC. And I'll underscore Bill's comments about mobile versus fixed. We've had a lot of experience doing border patrol on the eastern European border and their mobile solutions have won out hands down. And for just that reason that Bill stated, is that people figure out where the fixed towers are and they just don't go there anymore, and it's a big border. The mobile towers can be moved around easily, and they also have a much higher level of serviceability because when something fails, they can bring the MSC vehicle back in for service, whereas an IFT has to be serviced in the field. And I think those are strengths for our product solution.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then maybe just one more. On the guidance, you talked about the conservatism with sequestration, but you've got a pretty substantial EPS ramp in that second half of the year versus first half. I mean, you talked about being optimistic on U.S. Where's the conservatism built into that sort of EPS ramp? I mean, it seems like if sequestration doesn't play out, you might even have some more strength. So just trying to understand the confidence, I guess, in that second half ramp.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Sure, yes. Mike, it's Tony. If you look at our Q2 outlook for this year compared to last year, it's actually for fairly modest growth. It's basically for, at the low end, a little lower earnings and at the high end, a little better earnings than last year. You got to remember Q4 is always our strongest quarter. We expect that to be the case again this year, so that part of the ramp is fairly standard. When you look at the amount of growth we saw in the first half compared to the second half from an EPS growth standpoint, H1 of '12 to H1 of '13 in percentage terms is meaningfully higher than what the outlook suggests for H2 of '12 to H2 of 2013. The contours of the guidance, it's still a $0.10 range, and it's a $0.10 range for a reason. There's risk in the government business associated with sequestration. Q2 was very good from an order perspective, but we're not all that optimistic that we're going to see the typical Q3 bump that a cop's business and a CDMQ business like ours typically sees. So I think we're a little cautious about that. And from the standpoint of the commercial businesses, we -- as Andy and Tom explained, we don't see a lot of growth there. So when you kind of wrap it all together and put a bow on it, it's a flattish outlook compared to the second half of last year. And given the dynamics in the business, we think that's reasonable. I wouldn't put it in the conservative or the aggressive camp. I think that $0.10 range encompasses the zone of risk pretty well.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Gesuale with Raymond James.","Brian Gesuale - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Looks like a lot of the indicators are rolling positively here for you. Wondering, Andy, maybe if you could tackle the volume question. It appears that you guys are ramping up volumes nicely, and some of the businesses you're in, over the next 12 to 18 months, will see further volume increases overall for the company.","Andrew C. Teich","That's true. Our strategy here is to develop sockets for sensors that we build. And the acquisitions that we've made recently all support that strategy of creating sockets for thermal sensors that represent significant volume capabilities. There's work to do in order to actually enable those sockets because many of them require a much lower-cost sensor. Many of them require some level of video analytics to deliver the proper value proposition to the user. And the 2 recent acquisitions that we've done, of Lorex and Traficon, were done specifically to enable those 2 things. And the teams are working hard on making that happen now. This is a big area of focus for Tom in his new job. And we expect it to manifest itself in an increasing volume.","Brian Gesuale - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Great. Are you -- do you have any percentage terms that you can share with us? And maybe any multiyear goals in terms of how you want the volumes to expand over time? Just any color you can add there.","Andrew C. Teich","Well, we haven't quantified that yet. I mean, we have seen -- and as were mentioned in Tom's comments, we've seen significant growth in volumes particularly on the uncooled side. And that's frankly what I'm really focused on. I don't think the volumes in our cooled business, on the high-end business, are going to increase significantly. They'll probably be flat. We're focused on the uncooled opportunity in terms of growth. Obviously, the new low-cost sensor that we've talked about a bit, it will likely have some very high volumes associated with it when it's deployed through these channels. We aren't quantifying that just yet, but safe to say that we think it's significant. There's also the opportunity to sell uncooled more aggressively into the gS channels. So it's a thing that Bill and I have been discussing quite a lot with his business development team. We think that there are good opportunities to sell more uncooled into the military and also to sell existing CS product into military and paramilitary accounts, both in the U.S. and internationally. So we'll be focused on that in the next 6 months.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Just to get some more color on a couple of things. It sounds like security bookings, as well as maybe cores, were way up this quarter. I think you said security revenue was flattish. So given the bookings trends, specifically in security and cores, kind of organically, are you expecting revenue in those units to be up nicely in the second half of the year?","Thomas A. Surran","Yes, so in the case of security, we are -- the bookings came in. We'll be delivering on some of the larger orders that came in. During Q2 -- during the second half of the year, we should have those contracts, for the most part, completed. We will not see quite the level of growth we saw -- I mean it was exceptional growth that we saw so far. We were very pleased with it. That's probably too high of a bar to try to maintain for the balance of the year, but we are encouraged by continued growth in the security business.","Andrew C. Teich","So 2 other things on that, Pete. One is on Security, that business can be lumpy based on the cooled portion of that business. So we had some nice bookings come in, in Q2 for cooled border patrol, international border security business. And we have not seen that for a while. That's been pretty dry for quite a long time. So we'll turn that into revenue in the second half, and that's where we'll see the growth that Tom talked about. I expect the uncooled business will continue to kind of grow at the pace that it has been growing at. You also asked about the cores business. I think that's where we have the biggest risk and where we're being cautious about the second half. There's a pretty big component of the cores business that is driven by U.S. DoD spending through partners such as Northrop Grumman, AeroVironment. And we -- while we did receive orders from some of those customers during Q2, we think that the second half could be slower than usual, and that will affect revenue at some level as well.","Operator","Our next question is also a follow-up question from Tim Quillin with Stephens.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. One, is your intentions for capital allocations in the second half of the year buybacks versus keeping powder dry for acquisitions? And the second question is in the Thermography business, and I understand, especially in the predictive maintenance world, where that's -- there's some challenging macros, but in an area like building diagnostics, where you have a pretty strong value proposition and maybe not the penetration levels that you should have, in addition to shifting resources geographically like Europe to Asia, are you also able to shift some resources to maybe generate some awareness on some of those type of products?","Anthony L. Trunzo","So Tim, it's Tony. I'll take the first part, and then Andy will take the second. There's -- globally, there's no shift in our priorities from a capital allocation standpoint. We're going to continue to look to find opportunities to take capital off the table where it's appropriate. We spent a fair bit of time as a team, over the last several months, continuing our discussions around getting our returns on equity back up to the 20%-plus level, and I think that's clearly a priority for us. Part of that is going to be through being more efficient in getting margins up. Part of it is going to be through taking some capital off the table. We're going to obviously continue to generate capital. There's no -- I would say there's no shift. We weren't as aggressive in Q2, but we had a big Q1 in terms of share buyback. And you'll see it bounce around quarter-to-quarter based on what we see from a potential priority standpoint and also valuation. We're not going to be buying a little bit of stock every day just to get the capital structure right. We'll buy it when we see opportunities. So I wouldn't read anything into the fact that the Q2 was light other than we had other priorities going on, and I would expect that we're going to continue to put a meaningful proportion of our capital deployment against share buyback. Andy, you want to. . .","Andrew C. Teich","Sure. Yes, Tim, on the -- relative to the Thermography, TM and building diagnostics segment, there's a couple of things there. One is, as Tom mentioned, we've got some new products coming in the second half of the year that will be targeted at the building diagnostics segment. We've seen a good opportunity there in the HVAC segment, and we have been doing pretty well there, but I think that there's significant opportunity for growth there. It's very nascently penetrated today. And specifically, as we develop products that have some bespoke features for that segment. And then marketing communications targeted at that segment and training targeted at that segment through our ITC division, I think, will all help to drive growth there. We've said many times in this market that the 2 levers that we can pull on in terms of driving growth in this are price and awareness. We will be addressing both of those things with these actions. And specifically on the awareness side, that's an area where we do need to focus more investment, and we will be doing that, as I've mentioned, developing an organization such that we can flex between engineering and marketing spending when we do it. We're sort of exiting a phase of fairly high R&D activity relative to these new products and then we'll enter a phase where we'll focus more on marketing communications. And the team is ready to execute on that.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up question from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to go back to some of the commentary around MSC, and it sounds like you see the potential for follow-on business there. And you also commented about getting perhaps more FLIR-related content into that. Can you talk a little bit about that? And secondly, is there an opportunity to perhaps become a little bit more vertically integrated? Or are there any areas where you might be able to acquire some of the technology that's going into this?","William A. Sundermeier","Sure, Jim. It's Bill. In the area of MSC, we're quite vertically integrated. We build the entire thing, and really, the biggest pieces of that puzzle are Star SAFIRE 380-HD system, which provides the fantastic long-range imaging and a radar system that's on there. And for all of our international shipments, we incorporate a really great radar that's produced by our group in Surveillance. And what we'd like to do is be able -- that radar is really coming on strong and providing great capability and be able to add that to the system for the U.S. And that would be able to be serviced in the U.S. and provide jobs in the U.S. So I think that there's some great advantages to putting that on the system as well. From a service perspective, of course, that just is fantastic for us and for the CBP. So provided it's a great, tightly integrated solution, but the software, the major systems, we build the whole infrastructure there. And there's just some of the minor components that we outsource, so we're quite well integrated into that solution. And as we export those, we'll continue to grow in that business segment.","Andrew C. Teich","One other thing, Jim, that we will be pursuing in that space, and that's related to the display and the man, machine interface. Those units have a couple of fairly high-end displays in them presently, and we've got a real strength in that area, obviously, with Raymarine, that are -- that produces high-volume, low-cost field rugged displays with a great user interface, touchscreen user interface. So over time, we'll be developing a solution there that not only will lower our cost, but will significantly improve the usability experience from a user perspective. I think the border patrol operators are really going to like what they see there when they -- when we deploy this touchscreen capability.","Okay. With that, I'd like to bring the call to a close. I do want to thank the employees at FLIR, not only on their performance in Q2 and in supporting the leadership transition that has taken place here at the company. But also I have to say that in the last 60 days, Tony and I have been maintaining a very aggressive travel schedule, visiting the different sites amongst FLIR to better understand the businesses, the technology, the integration opportunities and also to communicate the vision for this business for the future. And I have to say that the reaction that I've seen from the employees has been outstanding. They've been very enthusiastic, extremely supportive. A lot of people coming in with very good ideas for growth and innovation, and it's a collaborative effort that I'm seeing from the FLIR employees on a global basis, that I'm very encouraged to see. And I think it's going to support the vision for growth of this business in the future.","So with that, I'll say thank you for your attendance, and we'll see you next quarter.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference.

Andy?","Andy Teich","Thanks, Todd. I\u2019d like to everyone on the line to FLIR\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Tony Trunzo; COO, Tom Surran; Chief of Product Strategy, Jeff Frank; and Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill.","This morning we reported fourth quarter revenue of $434 million and earnings per share of $0.51. Revenue increased 9% versus the fourth quarter of 2013 with year-over-year growth in five of our six segments.","Operating income grew 28% compared to Q4 of 2013, adjusting for restructuring charges in both periods and one-time items in Q4 of 2013. Earnings per share grew 49% over last year, when you exclude the restructuring and one-time charges. The growth and profitability was a result of the topline growth, 150 basis points improvement in gross margin and nearly flat operating expense base.","For the year we returned to positive organic revenue growth for the first time since 2010, while increasing our earnings per share 14% over 2013. 2014 represented a significant year for FLIR in the thermal imaging industry.","Early in the year we launched our revolutionary new low-cost thermal imaging camera cores Lepton and the world's first truly consumer-oriented thermal camera the FLIR ONE. Both products represent significant technological milestone that will enable broad market growth as thermal imaging technology becomes prevalent in everyday life.","Our product innovation engine continued to produce good results in 2014, with the introduction of more than 20 new products, many of which established wholly new categories.","This kind of pioneering has been our strategy for over a decade and while we have been very successful at driving the adoption and affordability of thermal technology, we believe there remains a tremendous amount of opportunity ahead of us.","Already this year we've introduced new products that leverage our core technologies and bring differentiated capabilities to existing and new markets. At the 2015 Consumer Electronics Show for example, we introduced the next-generation of FLIR ONE, which offers four-time higher thermal resolution, smaller size and weight, and much broader compatibility across multiple Apple and Android mobile devices.","We also launched the world\u2019s first fully-integrated super-slim pocket-sized thermal imager the C2, which is targeted at building inspectors, contractors, realtors and other tradesmen.","Our Maritime business continues its drive in the first water, recreational fishing market with the launch of a new series of lower cost dragonfly multifunction displays. These units feature our award-winning down vision sonar capability and offer a new retail opening price point to Raymarine.","Our Surveillance segment recently began volume shipments of our new CDMQ 380-HDc and 280-HDc stabilized multi-sensor gimbal systems, which fully optimize size, weight, power and range performance by leveraging FLIR\u2019s unique vertically-integrated technology.","Our Detection segment will begin addressing much larger markets for their life saving technology by introducing new products that have unmatched value to price ratios. And our Security business will continue to fuel its high growth rate with the introduction of several new products in both the visible and thermal spectrum that will further differentiate FLIR\u2019s offerings in the consumer, professional and infrastructure segments of this business.","Today we announced our outlook for 2015. We expect revenues of between $1.55 billion and $1.6 billion for the full year and earnings per diluted share in the range of a $1.60 to a $1.70. This range incorporates our current views of currency rates for the year.","I will now pass the call over to Tony to review the fourth quarter financial results. Tony?","Tony Trunzo","Thanks, Andy. The following discussion of pretax operating results for the fourth quarter excludes restructuring and one-time costs totaling $31 million in 2013 and restructuring costs of $963,000 in 2014.","The discussion of full year results excludes $31 million of restructuring and other one-time items in 2013 and $17 million of restructuring costs in 2014. All 2013 numbers reflect our new segments structure that was implemented in January of 2014.","Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $434.4 million, an increase of 9%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2013. The increasing strength of the U.S. dollar during the quarter impacted revenue growth in Q4 as revenues on the constant currency basis increased by approximately 11%. Sales to U.S. Government represented 19% of the total in Q4, compared to 18% of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year.","Consolidated Q4 gross margin was 49.4%, a 1.5 percentage point increased compared to last year. Consolidated operating margin before restructuring was 20.3%, compared with 17.2% in the fourth quarter of last year.","Segment level SG&A declined by 8% in Q4, due partly to the benefits of last year's business restructuring. Corporate administrative costs were higher due to expenses related legal matters, including legal costs related to a litigation matter where we received a favorable jury verdict during the quarter.","Net earnings excluding restructuring costs were $73.5 million, an increase of 48% and earnings per fully diluted share were $0.52, an increase of 49%. For the full year 2014, consolidated revenue increased by 2% to $1.53 billion.","Surveillance and Detection segment revenue was down 7% and 5%, respectively, compared to 2013, but our other four segments all reported revenue growth led by the security segment which saw our revenue grow by 27% to $179.1 million. Consolidated gross margin for the year was 49.1%, 30 basis points less than in 2013 due to the higher proportion of security revenue and somewhat lower margin.","The segment level operating expenses declined by $9.6 million or 2%. Corporate expenses for the year were up 29% in the legal costs associated with several significant litigation matters which should not have material impact in future quarters.","International revenue represented a record 50.1% of 2014 total while sales for the U.S. government represented 20.3% of the annual total, the lowest percentage since 2000. Our tax expense in Q4 was $10.3 million or 12% of pretax quarterly income as we benefited from the release of approximately $9.4 million of tax reserves associated with our Raymarine acquisition in 2010. For the full year, our tax rate came in at 20%.","Inventory levels declined by $22.7 million or 7% during Q4 while accounts receivable increased by $60.8 million. As a result, cash provided by operations for the fourth quarter was $62.8 million or 86% of net income.","For the full year, cash from operations of $226.2 million would equal to 113% of net income well below prior year. We made significant progress in reducing inventory in 2014 but accounts receivable growth due to substantial late quarter deliveries and collection delays in certain international locations were disappointing.","These issues were largely combined to our Surveillance and Detection segments and we do not anticipate any issues with ultimate collectability. We should see a meaningful drop in accounts receivable during Q1.","In Q4, we purchased 2 million shares of our stock at an average price of $31.64 per share. For all 2014, we repurchased 4.2 million shares of stock at an average price of $32.81. Today, we announced a new share repurchase program that authorizes the repurchase up to 15 million shares over the next two years. For 2015, we expect to continue our long-standing approach to buyback whereby repurchase activity is governed by our view of relative value and expected capital needs in M&A opportunities.","As Andy stated earlier in the call, we currently expect revenue for 2015 to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion in earnings per fully diluted shares to be in the range of $1.60 to a $1.70 representing growth of approximately 11% at the midpoint. While we anticipate stabilization in our government markets, we expect the continued strength of the U.S. dollar to have a negative impact on revenue and profitability throughout 2014.","At current exchange rates, the stronger dollar would reduce our 2015 revenue growth by approximately 3 to 4 percentage points. We also announced the 10% increase in our quarterly dividends to $0.11 per share, reflecting our continued commitment to appropriate capital deployment that includes the combination of direct and indirect return of capital by dividends and share repurchase along with continued capital investment and M&A.","This concludes summary of our fourth quarter and annual financial results. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights for Q4.","Tom Surran","Thank you, Tony. During the fourth quarter, we saw solid topline growth that was broadly driven across many of our businesses. This revenue growth combined with improved gross margin and lower operating expense resulted in a significant improvement in segment level profitability with consolidated segments, operating income reaching $115 million excluding restructuring charges, up 37% over Q4 2013. This represents a 26% operating margin which is 550 basis points improvement over Q4 2013. Total order backlog reached $547 million and is 12% higher than last year. ","During the fourth quarter, the Surveillance segment grew revenue of 8% year-over-year to $150.1 million as a result of the significant increase in our integrated systems product line. These product offering provides sophisticated multi-sensor capabilities with rapid deployment and ease-of-use previously unavailable to customers. This gain was partially offset by reduced activity in our web insights and manned portable products.","Segment operating income of $43.8 million, excluding restructuring charges, increased 48% versus the prior year, which represented 790 basis increase in operating margins, driven by improved gross margins and 15% lower operating expense. Segment operating margin of 29% is the highest since late 2012.","Surveillance order flow was also improved year-over-year growing $10 billion or 11% over Q4 2013. Surveillance 12 months backlog reached $295 million and is up 5% over the prior year. While we did see increased order flow in United States with a notable order for our TALON gimbals from the U.S. Army, order delays with some Middle East opportunities kept that region relative flat versus the far year.","In the fourth quarter, we received a large amount of sub $10 million orders compared to last year, which is becoming a consistent trend in something that fits well with our commercial off-the-shelf operating model in the government markets.","Instrument segment Q4 revenue grew 2% over the fourth quarter of 2013 to $103.5 million. While there is a significant growth in our test and measurement products as well as continued growth in our automation line of businesses, these gains were offset by declines in the building and predictive maintenance market.","Operating income for instrument segment grew 7% over Q4 2013 with an operating margin of 34%, excluding the impact of restructuring charges. This improvement was the result of both higher revenue and reduced operating expenses.","The growth in the test and measurement product line was driven by the successful launch of TG165, our Lepton-based thermal imaging spot temperature tool. This product was introduced in the third quarter of this year but significant shipments did not commence until the fourth quarter.","At CES last month, we continued our trend of revolutionary product introductions when we launched our FLIR C2, the first fully integrated pocked size thermal camera focus on the building, HVAC and maintenance professional markets. This ruggedized and ultra slim thermal camera offers our patented MSX image enhancement and features our Lepton camera core inside. Units of the C2 will begin shipping to distribution this month.","OEM in emerging segment revenue grew by 8% over the fourth quarter of last year to $58 million, despite a $4 million headwind from the divestment of our OCG business this summer. The year-over-year growth was driven by strong results from the uncooled cores product lines in addition of the mobile product category with our FLIR ONE product. Operating income improved dramatically in the quarter increasing 75% over the prior, excluding the impact of restructuring charges, reaching $18.9 million.","Driving this improvement were 630 basis point increase in gross margin in part due to the elimination of the OCG product and that 13% deduction in operating expense. At the Consumer Electronic Show, our mobile products group introduced the second generation FLIR ONE smart thermal camera accessory to outstanding customer feedback and media coverage.","The latest FLIR ONE is offered in versions for both the Apple and Android phone. While being substantially smaller than the first generation FLIR ONE offering, this version still features its own internal battery and incorporates a visible camera to enable the same MSX image enhancement features that consumers love about the original.","This new version also incorporates automated temperature calibration which provides reliable and continuous temperature measurement without user intervention. We are planning to commence shipment of the second-generation FLIR ONE within the first half of this year.","The Maritime segment was our only segment that reported either drop in revenue or operating revenue in Q4. Revenue was down 6% to $40.1 million and operating income fell 39% to $1.3 million, excluding restructuring charges.","The revenue decrease was in part due to industry wide aggressive holiday pricing promotions in the U.S. market as well as the inability to meet the significant demand for the new high performance MU MV thermal imager. Operating margins were down as a result of the revenue weakness, as gross margins and operating expenses were comparable to the prior year.","At CES in January, Raymarine significantly expanded its line of freshwater fishing electronics with the introduction of seven new models in its Dragonfly product lines. Two of these offerings will be priced below $200, including the Dragonfly 4 DV, the world\u2019s first recreational sonar below $200 to use wide spectrum CHIRP DownVision sonar imaging technology.","Also added to the Dragonfly lineup was the Wi-Fish and the Dragonfly 5 Pro models, which stream live sonar images via Wi-Fi to Android and Apple mobile devices using the new Raymarine Wi-Fish mobile app.","The security segment had another quarter of significant growth with revenues increasing 35% to $56.4 million. Lorex-branded product revenue was up 24% versus the prior year due to an expanding retailer footprint and a strong holiday season for our direct-to-consumer ecommerce site.","Our FLIR-branded thermal products grew 72%, as compared to the prior year and unit volumes were up 62%. The combination of our long-standing prowess and thermal security cameras combined with the full line of visible camera has proven quite successful, yet there remains tremendous room for growth in the $15 billion security equipment market.","As a result of the increased revenue and increasing gross margins and controlled operating expenses, operating income increased 85% over the prior year to $10.3 million excluding restructuring charges. We look forward to introducing some very innovative new products during 2015 that will create further momentum for the security segment.","Detection segment fourth quarter revenue of $26.2 million increased 19% versus the prior year, due primarily to the shipment of low-grade initial production units of the DR SKO Program. During the quarter, we received our first full rate production order for the DR SKO Program, totaling $27 million.","Detection operating profit of $5.2 million was more than doubled that of Q4 2013, excluding restructuring charges. As a result of the cost savings, we\u2019ve been able to realize in the reorganization of the segment\u2019s operations during 2014.","That concludes my summary of the segment fourth quarter. I will now pass the call back to Andy.","Andy Teich","Thanks, Tom. We are pleased with results of this fourth quarter and year. Our 2014 results are indicative of our ability to execute against our key strategic initiatives. During the year, we further reduced the cost to produce thermal sensors, which allowed us to break new ground on price and generate accelerated demand.","The introduction of the Lepton thermal camera core has changed the way the industry thinks about size, weight, power and the price of thermal technology. And it enables us to produce products that address new markets or create new categories in existing markets.","In our government business, we continue to drive technological innovation under our CDMQ model to fuel growth in the U.S. and internationally, where we feel we have a significant competitive position. We remain committed to being the leader in CDMQ products for demanding high-value applications.","Operationally, during the year, we completed a company-wide realignment and restructuring that not only has meaningfully reduced our cost structure but has also improved the way we develop and sell our products. We also invested in our marketing organization to strengthen our brand and increased overall awareness of the benefits of our technology in a wide range of applications.","With these actions, we believe we've created an organizational structure and capabilities that position us very well to growth in each of our markets, identifying and attack new application and reach our vision of becoming the world\u2019s sixth sense.","That concludes our comments on the fourth quarter. And we will now open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Ricchiuti","Hi. Good morning. A question on Raymarine. Andy, would you expect these products to be shipping for the seasonally strong period of the quarter, or is this the catalyst that we might see to get that part of the business moving?","Andy Teich","Yes, Jim. They will be shipping. So they are filtering into distribution right now. It\u2019s primarily a retail distribution channel for these new lower-end products but we are doing our retail fill right now.","Jim Ricchiuti","Okay. And if I could just ask one other question. Just in the past you have seen a sequential decline in revenues in the 12% or so range if we go back historically. Is there anything about this quarter that would suggest something other than that?","Tony Trunzo","Jim, it is Tony. I can\u2019t give you an exact percentage reduction. But typically and I think in almost every case, Q1 revenue and earnings tend to be less than Q4. We get seasonal strength in our instruments business because of the Q4 sell-through and typically Surveillance is meaningfully stronger as well. Raymarine will offset that a little bit, as Raymarine has a much stronger Q1 than it does Q4. So, our maritime business tends to do better in Q1. But overall there is -- I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect what we\u2019ve seen historically, which is a tick down from Q4 to Q1.","Jim Ricchiuti","Okay. Thanks a lot. I will jump back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Arment","A question on the defense-related on the -- the delays that you saw in the Middle East with some of those orders, was it oil related or is it just timing on that? I wonder if you could clarify that first.","Andy Teich","Yeah. I think it\u2019s probably, mostly is driven by timing here. I think that there is going to be some effect from lower oil prices but generally, I think the demand there is driven by requirements either from platforms that have been acquired or from just the regional instability driving some of the border demand in the region.","Peter Arment","Okay. And then if I could just ask a follow-up, Tony. On the EPS guidance, just to clarify, you were getting -- the last -- the second half of 2014 you were getting a pretty substantial restructuring savings. You didn't have as much in the first half. So, I mean is there a way to be thinking about that that is a tailwind that is going to continue in 2015 of course? But it seems like your guidance is only up low single-digit if you are looking at it on a pro forma basis. Am I looking at it the right way, if you could just clarify that? Thanks.","Tony Trunzo","I\u2019m not sure how you get low single-digits, Peter. In aggregate, yes, we will see more savings throughout 2015 than we saw in 2014 from the restructuring. The further we get away from the actions themselves, the harder it gets to tease out exactly what those savings. But I think it\u2019s reasonable to expect that we will see more savings in 2015 than in 2014. I\u2019m not sure how you go about pro forma-ing that. At the midpoint of -- what we don\u2019t expect in 2015 are meaningful restructuring charges. We will have a little bit just because some of the stuff requires that it be posted in the period if the expense is actually incurred and you can\u2019t accrue it upfront.","But we don\u2019t anticipate those costs to be meaningful at all in 2015. You saw them come down fairly dramatically in Q4 and I think that will be even lower in the quarters of 2015. But I think it should be a pretty clean look in 2015 and excluding the 2014 restructuring charges, but looking -- effectively looking at them is a bit of a headwind because with 2015 -- at the midpoint, we are looking for about 11% to 12% earnings growth and I think that\u2019s actually a pretty good apples-to-apples analysis.","Peter Arment","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question.","Pete Skibitski","Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.","Andy Teich","Thanks, Pete.","Tony Trunzo","Thank you.","Pete Skibitski","I guess maybe for Tony. Tony, on the FX headwind for 2015, should we think about that primarily impacting instrumentation, or is it meaningful back to the other commercial businesses as well?","Tony Trunzo","Actually, Pete, the biggest impact is on our maritime business. We have -- we tried to do some analysis around this. And I think we\u2019ve gotten to a pretty good place from a segment standpoint. Couple of things, couple of dynamics in maritime, all of their non-U.S. sales, which is north of 60% of the total, are in currencies other than U.S. dollar. That\u2019s not true in all of our other segments. For example, surveillance has a lot of non-U.S. sales, but virtually everything they sell is in USD. So they don\u2019t have the headwind that a lot of our other segments don\u2019t have the headwind that this maritime does on the revenue line.","Additionally, our contract manufacturing arrangements in the maritime business are largely in USD. So we don\u2019t have the natural hedge on the expense side that we do with a lot of our other segments. So maritime is going to be -- based on current rates maritime is going to see the strongest negative impact on a percentage basis, followed by instruments which will see a larger number of a headwind on a revenue side in terms of absolute dollar, but as a percentage it looks like it would probably be meaningfully less.","And then the other segments really don\u2019t have a lot of impact that all tends to be there is some at the revenue line, but when you flow all the way through the EBIT, the impact in the other segments isn\u2019t that dramatic at all.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. That makes sense. And just as a follow-up on security. I mean, it almost looks like you guys can\u2019t keep product on the shelf and security. Is it -- so I am trying to remember what you guys said in prior quarters, is it mostly better distribution, is it new products or other stuff, and kind of how much tailwind you guys have in the segment going into 2015? I am wondering if we have a tough comp now or are you just really disrupting the space and then going to have a tailwind for long time in security?","Andy Teich","Yes, Pete, this is Andy. The segment continues to do well and it\u2019s really a combination of all of the things that you mentioned. We have expanded retail distribution under the Lorex brand. We\u2019ve expanded our distribution into the professional enterprise and integrator space under the FLIR brand of visible spectrum.","And then the real star of Q4 frankly was the growth in thermal and that\u2019s driven by new product launches. So we\u2019ve launched new products at somewhat lower price points and that\u2019s driven significant increases in volume. And really for 2015, we expect that market to continue to grow quite nicely and there we\u2019ve got significant product launches that we\u2019ve planned for announcement as well. Tom, maybe you can talk little bit about some of the differentiation things too.","Tom Surran","Well, before I go there, I would say we have geographic expansion that will be occurring, as we take our commercial class products into the international markets. So that\u2019s something we are excited about. In terms of the products, we are going to be introducing a number of products, probably don\u2019t want to premature enough them, but we have quite a bit that will be coming out with here in 2015 that we expect will be continuing to drive revenue growth.","Pete Skibitski","All right. So you guys are thinking that maybe this might continue to be your fastest growing segment in 2015?","Andy Teich","Yes. It will be.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. Thanks, guys. I will get back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Quillin with Stephens Incorporated. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Quillin","Hey, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. First, I was just wondering if you could talk about gross margin and operating margin targets that you might have for 2015 and longer-term. And then if you could quantify the impact of unusual legal expenses or nonrecurring legal expenses in the quarter?","Tony Trunzo","Sure. Tim, its Tony. I will take a shot at those. So the single biggest factor for us in gross margin is mix, because we do have some parts of the business that are lower gross margin. The Extech branded test and measurement piece of instruments is lower margin. Maritime is a bit lower margin. And the low end, do it yourself security business, the Lorex business is lower margin.","On bias the margins in the short term are going to look like they are stable just because of that mix. It really doesn\u2019t have anything to do with product level margin shift. It\u2019s really going to be -- it\u2019s really mix related. We are going to always work to improve our product level margins and I think there is some work underway there now. I wouldn\u2019t expect in 2015 that you would see a dramatic change in margins upward as a result of that just because you are going to have a headwind with respect to mix.","Operating margins over time should tick up. And into the question Peter asked earlier, we won\u2019t have a little bit more restructuring savings this year than we have last year and that should provide a little bit of a lift at the operating margin line. And as you guys know, we obviously are consistently working to try to grow our OpEx at a slower rate than revenue. A little bit of a challenge this year because of a revenue headwinds associated with the strong U.S. dollar, but a return to organic revenue growth like we saw last year and likely anticipate this year should help us in that respect.","As regard to the legal expenses, we commented this morning that the unusual piece of those was approximately equivalent to what we saw in terms of a pickup from nonrecurring, from discrete tax items. So you are looking at high single-digit millions in total related to those matters, Tim.","Tim Quillin","Okay. And just one follow-up if I may, maybe for Andy, but could you talk about the pace of Lepton product introduction, so you had a handful of nice products that came out in 2014. Should we expect it to be a bigger number across all of your segments in 2015? Thank you.","Andy Teich","Yes, Tim. One of the strategies that we mentioned is that we feel that there is a home for Lepton in each of our segments within the business or certainly within five of the six of the segments from the business would certainly be logical candidates for the utilization of the technology. So we have R&D efforts going on in each of the segments relatively to Lepton product developments. And I do expect that you will see more launches in 2015 than we had in 2014.","I am happy with the start that we had in 2014, though the products that we did develop and have launched in 2014 and we\u2019ve already launched one here in 2015 the C2 -- and well actually two of the C2 and the second generation FLIR ONE. The initial response to those two products has been quite good.","Tim Quillin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey, good morning, guys. Nice quarter. Tony, maybe just some housekeeping on 2015. In the earnings guidance, what sort of the buyback that\u2019s implied and what\u2019s the tax rate?","Tony Trunzo","Tax rate is going to be around 24% plus or minus.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay.","Tony Trunzo","There is minimal impact of buyback during the year. We do anticipate being in the market depending on what the -- what valuation looks like, but the impact of share repurchase is going to be -- unless there is some fairly dramatic change in valuation metrics, the impact to share repurchase during the quarter is going to be minimal with respect to earnings.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay. So even though you guys want to complete this, I guess, to two-year buyback, we shouldn't expect sort of half and half, should just kind of assume it\u2026","Tony Trunzo","Yeah. And as regard the size of the buyback maybe I\u2019ll take the opportunity to comment on that. Our last buyback was authorization was 25 million shares over two years. And we actually only utilize about 41% of that, we bought back a little more than 10 million shares over that two-year period.","And those 10 million shares, there was a meaningful chunk of them that represented some pretty specific discrete opportunity to get stock at where we deem to be pretty attractive valuation. If we see the stock become inexpensive again, we would certainly be much more aggressive in the market.","But I wouldn\u2019t want to leave the investment community to think that we sort of under any circumstance are going to complete 15 million shares over the next couple years. Its design to give us flexibility in the events that we see a significant change in valuation, but it\u2019s not designed, is what I would consider to be a goal for the next two years.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the end markets, I know you don't really guide on segments? But Surveillance, do you think you could actually be up year-over-year and then Europe was down, I guess, close to 20% sort of, if you can kind of give us some expectations there?","Andy Teich","So relative to Surveillance, I don\u2019t think that we can necessarily call a bottom in the business yet. It -- we were pleased with what we saw for bookings in Q4, but we still see it as a somewhat of a volatile segment relative to demand. So I think we\u2019ll have a better feel for that perhaps when we get through -- half way through the year.","In terms of Europe, Europe was soft for us in Q4. And at this point, we don\u2019t see much of an indication of that improving in the near-term, so we certainly tempered our expectations relative to European revenues in our 2015 budget.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. Thanks, guys. I will jump back in queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Ho","Hey, guys. I just wanted to start out with sort of the new form factor for the FLIR ONE second-generation. Can you maybe give us a sense of how you think this could impact the trajectory of the FLIR ONE? Is this going to be meaningful in terms of revenue for the product? Are we seeing sort of, with that strong reception, maybe more buying activity? Just want to get a sense from you how you think this will impact the trajectory.","Andy Teich","Yeah. There is a lot of discussion about the form factor, which one is better, is the case better, is the dongle better, which is what we call that form factor. We chose to go with the dongle because we could do the review size. It\u2019s not saying that we won\u2019t ever come back with a case offering, but we\u2019re excited more about the features that we\u2019re bringing to this new generation of product and we think that\u2019s what will actually be driving the sales.","We think that there our people who clearly like the dongle form factor, its portability, the ease of attachment. So, clearly, it is something we\u2019re positive about, we like. And we think though that it\u2019s really the form -- the performance of this unit that\u2019s really going to drive the adoption.","Jonathan Ho","Got it. And then as we look at sort of the new consumer product categories that you guys are targeting, I mean can you give us maybe a quick preview on which ones excite you the most? Or maybe not specific products, but in terms of the opportunity set or the challenges that you would be tackling where you see the most opportunity there?","Andy Teich","Sure. Jonathan, it\u2019s Andy again. Certainly, the thing that we like about FLIR ONE on the consumer space is that we expect to see new applications come from the deployment of that product and we\u2019ve already seen that with the first generation of FLIR ONE and the second generation opening up a significantly broader base of platforms so the product can operate with we think will also bring in new application.","So, I have to say from an excitement standpoint, that\u2019s one that probably excites me the most just because it opens up a broad based of the potential for new applications to be discovered as we get user feedback on the product and as developers develop new applications for product.","The other products in the consumer space, the other two that we launch for example at CES, the Dragonfly series in the Raymarine space. That\u2019s an existing application of freshwater fishing market that we think we bring a new level of functionality to that market, which is going to drive growth. The imaging performance of our down vision -- chirp down vision sonar is really pretty amazing. We hear a lot of people say it is like having a camera under the boat. So it\u2019s turning sonar data into visible imaging basically.","The other one is a C2 and while I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say this is a pure consumer product. It does have some transition in the consumer market. It\u2019s a product that has a consumer form factor, a consumer price point and we\u2019re targeting at -- primarily at the home inspection market and we think that could span everything from contactors to tradesman to real estate professionals, to low-level home inspectors.","And I\u2019m pretty excited about the new form factor there as well. No one has built a thermal imager in the super slim format and it plays to the strength of Lepton. And it plays to the strength of our MSX algorithm, which really produce a very consumer-friendly image on that product.","Jonathan Ho","Got it. And just the last one on the thermography side. As we think about sort of the spot pyrometer replacement that you guys came up with, can you talk a little bit about how that\u2019s impacting the market? Is there any potential for cannibalization of your low end products? I mean, it seems like it is a different form factor in use case. But I just want to get a sense for how you see those unit volumes ramping over time, are you seeing sort of broader distribution? Just maybe a little bit more detail on the growth opportunity.","Andy Teich","Sure. Jonathan, I\u2019m glad you ask about what the product that you are referring to is called the TG165. And I probably would have put that as one of the product that I was most excited about. And if you look at how it\u2019s been received by the marketplace and you can look on sites like Amazon.com about how people and customers are receiving that product, it\u2019s very positive.","In terms of -- one of the things you mentioned there is this is a product for those that don\u2019t know is a $500 price point. And it\u2019s not a pure thermographic imaging camera. It\u2019s basically a thermal image with the spot temperature measurement in the center. And so it\u2019s a different value proposition but it clearly, we think reaches a new customer base as our price point and we hadn\u2019t seen the cannibalization.","So, we actually saw and what was our low-end Exx product line, which is probably where we would see that cannibalization, we actually saw increased volumes. And one of the things this is going to create additional awareness that\u2019s kind of a starter product for looking into thermal imaging but clearly there is capabilities as you step up through our product line that is still there. So we haven\u2019t see it. It\u2019s been extremely well received and it\u2019s one of the one that I probably would have picked for most exciting.","Jonathan Ho","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Saliq Khan","Great. Thank you. Good morning guys.","Andy Teich","Good morning.","Saliq Khan","I'll be speaking on behalf of Jeff Kessler as well. Just a couple of real questions that we had for you. First one being is, the percentage of the government revenue that we are seeing from you guys, that certainly increased year-over-year. How are you dealing with or how are you changing the business planning processes to account for the changing government budgets?","Tony Trunzo","Go ahead, Andy.","Andy Teich","Yeah. Saliq, I think our government percentage declined year-over-year slightly and was actually at a lowest point since -- that we\u2019ve seen since 2000. However, we\u2019ve got a presidential budget proposal that\u2019s in -- that shows an increase and certainly we like the sign of that. We\u2019ll see what gets proved and where the specific spending gets approved. But at this point, we are being pretty conservative in terms of our assumptions and the change of the mix of our DoD revenue base.","Saliq Khan","Great. And the other thing would be is, you're seeing a lot of investments that you have made, certainly the Lepton over the past year. In speaking with your current clients, are you getting a sense that there are a lot more budget contest going forward or are they open to making larger purchases as well?","Andy Teich","Well. So Lepton, really is a completely different value proposition in terms of price and performance relative to our existing cores and components business. So I think we are really talking to a whole new class of customers there. Some of the large automation companies, for example, have expressed a strong interest in integrating Lepton and to process control application.","We\u2019ve also seen Lepton be very successful in the UAS\/UAV market. So I think there we\u2019ll see nice growth in Lepton revenues in 2015. As we\u2019ve mentioned before on this call, it\u2019s a fairly long sale cycle because you\u2019re dealing with an OEM component that has to get designed into a product and qualified and tested and then brought to market. But I\u2019m confident that we\u2019ll see a nice increase in revenues coming from the Lepton in \u201815.","Saliq Khan","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question.","Pete Skibitski","I wanted to follow up with one of Jonathan's earlier questions on FLIR ONE, guys. I know your expectations for the first generation of FLIR ONE were pretty low. It sounds like for this new one that will start delivering this year that maybe you have higher expectations with a lower price point and wider distribution. Is that fair? Are the expectations higher this year? And do you have any kind of meaningful amount of revenue for the new FLIR ONE in your 2015 guidance?","Andy Teich","Sure Pete. I\u2019ll handle first part of this and then I\u2019m going to flip over to Jeff to talk a little bit about, what\u2019s different about FLIR ONE and what we\u2019re doing there. Certainly, the revenue expectations for FLIR ONE second generation product are meaningfully higher than we had with the first generation FLIR ONE. I still don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a huge needle mover for FLIR from a revenue standpoint.","The reality here is that the FLIR ONE is a product that we have launched to drive awareness in the market and to seek out new application for the product as well. It\u2019s performed very well in that regard in terms of the awareness building that has taken place. And maybe after Jeff comments, I can have Travis comment on that as well. But I think we\u2019ve got Jeff. Why don\u2019t you talk a little bit about some of the things that we are doing with the second generation FLIR ONE.","Jeff Frank","Hi, Pete. This is Jeff. The sell-through to the existing FLIR ONE continues to remain relatively strong, but the introduction of the second generation FLIR ONE with the much, much broader market ability to achieve the full iOS platform and the Android platform really creates a whole new universe of users for them.","And I think where we are seeing probably the biggest impact in that at least the near term is the developer momentum that\u2019s starting to build around that. We\u2019ve started to sponsor some programs around developer events. We have done two recently, one up in the Bay Area and one with the [UC] [ph] system.","These things are like hundreds of innovators that focus on our technology over a week and we\u2019ve seen a lot of really great ideas start to emerge out of these events and we\u2019re also starting to see now few apps that are in the Apple approval process. So we expect that with this much broader -- if you could imagine if you are a third party developer having universal customers that is the entire iOS and Android community that the opportunity for creating a market for your apps is much, much stronger. So we are expecting to see quite a bit of uplift in that.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. Yes, we just need a killer app, right?","Jeff Frank","We hope so. We keep looking for it.","Andy Teich","Pete, I\u2019m also going to have Travis\u2019 comment a little bit on awareness building because I mentioned that\u2019s really what this product was all about.","Pete Skibitski","Thanks, Andy.","Tony Trunzo","Hi, Peter. I think as I talked about a little bit on previous calls and we\u2019ve reiterated throughout the life of this product that really is one of the strategic objectives of FLIR ONE and we felt very good about the exposure that we\u2019ve gained to a whole new class of customers. We have seen over a hundreds of millions of impressions, media impressions over the course of 2014 as the results of FLIR ONE. And by and large, those are the people who had never been exposed to the FLIR brand or to thermal imaging technology.","So we feel like that\u2019s opening up an entire new market and obviously broader brand awareness. But we are very excited about the next generation of this and given the broader platform compatibility of the device. The opportunity for that heightened awareness is even greater than it has been in the past. So we\u2019re very enthused and still committed from a marketing perspective of using this as an awareness building to not only for this category but for all FLIR branded products.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. Got it. Very good. I appreciate that, guys. And just the last one maybe for Andy. Andy, how are you guys seeing the M&A environment currently?","Andy Teich","Well, so it\u2019s something we\u2019re going to looking much more closely at in 2015. We just finished the rather extensive strategic portfolio review at the business and have identified the areas that we feel offer the strongest growth for the business. And I think that the M&A will become an important part of our strategy to augment those growth areas in the next year or two.","Pete Skibitski","Thanks, guys.","Operator","At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing comments.","Andy Teich","Great. Thank you. So in closing, I would like to thank the nearly 3000 FLIR employees around the world for their thoughtful dedication and development during the year. We continue to have a significant opportunity ahead of us and I look forward to what 2015 will bring to the company. Thank you all for joining the call. We\u2019ll see you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a great day."],"9334":["FLIR Systems (NASDAQ:FLIR) Q3 2012 Earnings Call October 25, 2012  8:00 AM ET","Executives","William W.

Third Quarter 2012 Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Wit Davis, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary for FLIR Systems, Inc. Thank you, Mr. Davis. You may begin.","William W.

The forward-looking statements we make today speak as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","Let me now turn the call over to Earl Lewis, Chairman and CEO of FLIR Systems. Earl?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, thank you, Wit, and thanks for everyone for joining us this morning. Our third quarter revenue and earnings were in line with our expectations. In Q3, we improved our margins compared to last quarter and produced a significant increase in our backlog from strong order entry. For the first time, all 5 of our segments were profitable. During the quarter, our Government Systems division improved operating margins and significantly increased its backlog compared to the second quarter. Our Commercial Systems division experienced a slowdown as a result of tightened private sector capital budgets. However, it still managed to improve operations both year-over-year and compared to the second quarter due primarily to cost-containment initiatives.","Total company backlog increased over $65 million from the end of Q2, driven primarily by our Surveillance and Integrated Systems segment. We maintained the same operating cash flow as in third quarter of 2011 despite the softness in revenue; and year-to-date, we have generated $45 million more in cash from operations than during the first 9 months of last year.","Our portfolio approach to capital deployment continued in the third quarter, as we invested $42 million back into the company through R&D and capital investments and returned capital to our shareholders through a $0.07 quarterly dividend and repurchased nearly 2 million shares. We look forward to the fourth quarter of 2012. The challenging macroeconomic environment will likely continue to impact growth across our company. We continue to see revenue about flat compared to Q4 of '11, but earnings per share should be up slightly. As such, we are tightening our previous outlook for 2012 to revenue between $1.4 billion and $1.45 billion and earnings per diluted share of $1.42 to $1.47 GAAP.","We announced today our agreement to acquire Lorex Technology, a leading provider of home security surveillance systems that can be installed by the consumer. They are also an emerging provider of video surveillance equipment for larger-scale professional installations. Lorex will expand the product range in our commercial security business, add high-volume product development knowledge and offer key channel experience and direct consumer marketing. The acquisition, which is for a total cash purchase price of approximately $60 million, is expected to close by the end of the year. We expect Lorex to add to net income in 2013.","One of our core strategies is continuously lower the cost of ownership of thermal technology. And today, we see the opportunity to accelerate the pace of thermal innovation, affordability and awareness through some specific R&D programs that we've been pursuing for not [ph] a long time. We'll be bringing to market thermal detectors that have lower costs and lower -- and are smaller than today's thermal detectors. These products will increase our industry-leading product volumes, and Lorex should be instrumental in our efforts to bring this technology to consumers in the security market.","Andy will now provide you a summary of the Commercial Systems division's Q3 performance. Andy?","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Earl. The Commercial Systems division finished the third quarter with an 8% decline in revenue compared to the prior year. Despite this top line decline, division operating margin grew slightly year-over-year and was up significantly compared to the second quarter of 2012, as we continue to focus on cost and on rightsizing the organization for the current environment.","While the Americas region grew during the third quarter, the European economic downturn and the weakening of the euro versus the U.S. dollar continue to impact our international business. Revenue in the TVM segment declined 7% compared to the third quarter of 2011 but grew 5% sequentially while also increasing backlog by $9 million, driven by a strong bookings quarter for our Cores & Components line of business.","Revenue from our Raymarine business declined 11% year-over-year, with the expectedly slow EMEA region being offset slightly by a relatively strong quarter for the Asia-Pacific region. While the third quarter is the seasonally slowest quarter for Raymarine, the business was able to produce positive operating income despite the revenue declines.","Turning to the third quarter bookings activity. Total Commercial Systems division bookings were flat compared to the third quarter of 2011. TVM bookings dollars increased 2% over the prior year, while Raymarine bookings declined by 11%. The division saw the Americas and APAC regions grow bookings dollars 6% and 9%, respectively, but that growth was offset by the EMEA region, which declined 16%.","TVM's thermography line of business saw bookings dollars decline 11% from a year ago, as industrial capital spending cutbacks and a weak building market negatively impacted the business. During the quarter, we moved our Swedish thermography operations to a new building that is being shared with a Government Systems division's Swedish operations. The move did cause some disruptions in the quarter that affected cost and deliveries but will result in greater efficiency and lower occupancy cost going forward.","TVM's Cores & Components bookings dollars grew nearly 35% compared to the third quarter of 2011. As we expected, some of the orders were pushed out from Q2 came to fruition during Q3, while some remained for Q4. All regions showed strong growth.","The security line of business bookings declined 17% compared to last year's Q3. Two sizable oil refinery orders in our EMEA region last Q3 made for a difficult comparison for this year. Weakness in both the Americas and EMEA regions were slightly offset by strong growth in the much smaller APAC region. As Earl mentioned, we're excited about the acquisition of Lorex and the effect it will have on our security business. The near-term benefits we expect to garner from this acquisition are an extension of our product suite in the security and surveillance market, the synergies of adding thermal imaging to Lorex's emerging Digimerge brand, a professional security-grade security systems and the addition of FLIR's international distribution to Lorex's strong North American presence.","Additionally, as we continue to aggressively lower the cost of thermal imaging technology, we're excited to integrate a broad consumer distribution capability that currently sell hundreds of thousands of cameras per year through top retail and e-commerce portals. Ultimately, we intend to leverage that experience across several of our commercial lines of business, as we continue to develop low-cost, high-volume, consumer-oriented products.","TVM's Maritime business had bookings growth of over 5% despite the very difficult boating sales environment. While the EMEA region was flat compared to last year, the Americas and APAC regions grew despite a difficult comparison that included some large cruise ship orders last year. Accounting for all maritime-related thermal cameras from both the FLIR and Raymarine brands, growth continued during the third quarter with bookings dollars increasing 15% over 2011.","The Personal Vision Systems line of business continues to do well, posting year-over-year bookings dollars growth of nearly 40% and booking units growth of over 110% during the quarter. All regions contributed to this growth, as our distribution network continues to grow on a worldwide basis even as many emerging regions remain underpenetrated.","Raymarine bookings dollars declined 11% versus the third quarter of 2011, largely driven by declines in orders in EMEA, as boat builders in the region continue to be severely impacted by the weak economy. While APAC showed high-single-digit growth in bookings, the Americas region was slightly down during the quarter largely due to retail channel softness.","During the fourth quarter this year, we will begin shipping several new products that continue the evolution of the Raymarine product family, including the all touch a65 and a67 multifunction navigation systems, the e165 widescreen multifunction display and the i40, i50 and i60 mid-tier and entry-level instrument range. We will also be introducing in the fourth quarter our first freshwater product that will open up the small market -- small boat market for Raymarine, a market that has proved quite resilient in the cyclical downturn.","While better than Q2, these results are well below what we know the Commercial Systems division can generate. The steps we had taken over the past few months to increase efficiencies and reduce cost structures helped us improve margins during the quarter to a level near our historic levels. We will drive through this global economic slowdown and continue to compete aggressively by focusing on developing cutting-edge products, leveraging our considerable cost advantage and utilizing our established and growing market channels to take advantage of the huge commercial opportunity that exists for thermal imaging.","With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Bill Sundermeier, who will discuss the results of our Government Systems division. Bill?","William A. Sundermeier","Thanks, Andy. Government Systems division revenue was down 14% from the prior year but was up slightly sequentially for the second quarter in a row. Bookings were strong during the quarter, finishing with nearly $210 million in order value and a book-to-bill ratio of 1.4. The division finished Q3 with its largest backlog since 2010, growing $58 million over the second quarter to $392 million. Our focus on growing backlog has proven successful in this tough procurement environment and we believe demonstrates the value of our unique approach to government markets.","Operating margins for the Government Systems division improved slightly over the second quarter, driven largely by profitability improvements in both Detection and Integrated systems. The Surveillance segment finished the quarter with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3 and contributed $40 million of the backlog increase over the previous quarter. Order activity consisted of year-end spending from U.S. customers and also some good activity in Europe and the Middle East. On the U.S. side, we won a total of $26 million in contracts with the Navy's Navigational Thermal Imaging System, or NTIS program, for our BRITE Star gimbal system. The U.S. International Guard awarded us $15 million in contracts for upgrades to their fleet of helicopters. We continued our success with the U.S. Army's MEDEVAC helicopter platform with a $9 million order for our Star SAFIRE II system.","Our presence in the unmanned aerial vehicles space continue to build with the receipt of several orders totaling over $6 million for thermal systems to be used on the U.S. Military's Fire Scout UAV. We also won a $5 million order to outfit U.S. Customs and Border Protection with high-definition imaging systems for their helicopters.","International markets represented nearly 40% of surveillance bookings in the quarter with particularly strong activity from Europe and a consistent pace of activity from customers in the Middle East. The Netherlands Army awarded our U.S. operations orders totaling $11 million, and the Danish Navy and Air Force placed sizable orders for our newest 380-HD gimbal systems. In the Middle East, we booked another $11 million order for 380-HD systems to 2 separate air forces and another $3 million for the Jordanian Armed Forces for ground-based systems. Additionally, we strengthened our long relationship with the Japanese Coast Guard by contracting to provide them with $4 million gimbal systems for their helicopters.","The Detection segment ended the third quarter with $24 million in backlog. Orders for our Fido explosive detectors from India and multiple orders for our radiation detectors from China represent important strategic wins that will help us grow in key emerging international markets.","During the quarter, our Fido NXT was ordered by several agencies in the U.S., including the Air Force and National Guard, and we also shipped several dozen Fido units to Pakistan. We have also been successfully testing our solutions for building an infrastructure biothreat security for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, which we are hopeful will lead to product sales next year.","During the quarter, we consolidated our radiation line of business into our factory in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, closing our manufacturing operations in Germany. Restructuring activities resulted in charges of approximately $0.5 million in the quarter, but the changes are expected to improve our long-term performance and profitability.","Integrated Systems finished the third quarter with an all-time high backlog of $79 million, adding $17 million to the balance after a record booking and revenue quarter that yielded a book-to-bill of nearly 2.0. Order growth was driven by several key wins, primarily the receipt of a $27 million initial order under an $88 million IDIQ award for domestic response capability kits, or DRC, for the use by the National Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction-Civil Support Team. This award and initial order are important in that they are a result of our extensive development work with the Defense Department's CBRN Dismounted Reconnaissance Systems program.","Additionally, we received a $5 million contract from the U.S. Air Force Nevada test range to integrate an advanced surveillance network that includes our CERBERUS MX systems. Also during the third quarter, we received confirmation from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection that our MSC system was accepted, and we are eager to begin production and shipments starting in the first quarter of 2013.","That concludes my comments on the third quarter, and Tony will now discuss the financial results in more detail.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Thanks, Bill. Third quarter consolidated revenue was $332.2 million, a decrease of 11% compared to $371.3 million in third quarter of 2011. Commercial Systems division third quarter revenue decreased by 8% to $181.2 million. The Thermal Vision and Measurement segment posted third quarter revenue of $149.5 million, a decrease of 7% compared with the third quarter of last year. The thermography line of business represented the entire decline in TVM, as industrial, building and predictive maintenance markets continue to struggle in a weak global economy. Geographically, EMEA was the weakest region, down 20% compared to last year.","Raymarine revenue declined 11% to $31.7 million, with virtually the entire decline accounted for by a 19% drop in EMEA revenue. Government Systems' Q3 revenue was $151 million, a decline of 14% from $174.9 million in the third quarter of 2011. Surveillance segment revenue of -- was $115.9 million compared to $139.8 million in Q3 of last year, with the entire decline attributable to lower U.S. Government revenue. Detection segment revenue decreased 27% in Q3 to $15.4 million. The 2 large transactions were delivered in 2011, and there was reduced contract R&D work this year arising from the closure of several facilities. Integrated Systems segment revenue in Q3 was $19.7 million, a 42% increase from last year, as deliveries under the follow-on CLS FPS program began. International revenue was 44.2% of the consolidated total in Q3, similar to the third quarter of 2011's 44.7% of revenue.","International sales made up 47.2% of Commercial Systems' consolidated revenue compared to 54.8% in Q3 last year, reflecting commercial weakness in Europe, while 40.7% of Government Systems' revenue came from outside the U.S. compared with 33.2% last year as U.S. deliveries declined. Total sales to the U.S. Government were 27.6% of the consolidated total in Q3, down from 32% of revenue in the third quarter of last year.","Consolidated gross margin was 52.2% for the third quarter, 2.2 percentage points lower than last year, due to lower absorption of overhead costs partly offset by a better product mix. Consolidated operating income was $74.2 million, a 13% decline from $85.4 million in the third quarter of last year. Third quarter operating margin was 22.3% compared with 23% last year, as lower gross margins more than offset a 14.9% reduction in operating expenses. Third quarter operating income in Commercial Systems was $43.3 million or 2% lower than last year. Despite lower sales, operating margin improved to 24% largely due to improvements at Raymarine.","TVM posted $42.9 million of operating income and an operating margin of 28.7% compared with $47.2 million and 29.3% last year, as a nearly 2 percentage point drop in gross margin more than offset an 11% reduction in operating expenses.  Sequentially, TVM operating margin improved by nearly 10 percentage points from Q2 to [ph] a $6.5 million reduction in operating expenses and improved product mix. Raymarine Q3 operating income was $400,000 compared to a loss of $2.8 million in Q3 of last year due to much lower operating expenses.","Government Systems' operating income was $41.7 million for the quarter, a 23% decline from last Q3. Surveillance segment operating income was $39.2 million compared to $51.9 million in Q3 of 2011, as an 8% drop in operating expenses was more than offset by lower revenue and a 1.1 point decline in gross margin. Surveillance operating margin was 33.9% in Q3 compared to 37.1% last year. The Detection segment operating income of $1.1 million and Integrated Systems' operating income was $1.3 million in the quarter.","Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock compensation in the quarter were $95.2 million, and EBITDA margin was 28.6%, just slightly below Q3 of last year. Interest expense during the quarter was $3.1 million, an increase of $1.6 million from last year due to a full quarter's expense associated with the $200 million and 5-year notes we issued in August of last year.","Our tax provision for the quarter was 27% of pretax income versus 29.3% last Q3, excluding discrete items including the release of reserves and expiry of statutes, which reduced tax expense by $5.2 million in Q3 of this year and by $5 million in Q3 of last year.","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $46.4 million, representing 83% of net income, as net working capital increased by $32.3 million during the quarter. Through 9 months, cash flow from operations of $172.7 million represents 119% of net income. We repurchased 1.9 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $19.96 and paid dividends totaling $10.5 million. Capital expenditures were $12.8 million in Q3.","As Earl and Andy stated, we announced an agreement today to acquire Lorex Technology for CAD 1.30 per share or total consideration of $59 million, representing a multiple of 6.8x trailing EBITDA. For the 12 months ended June 30, Lorex reported revenue of approximately USD 77 million and EBITDA of approximately USD 8.3 million. We expect this acquisition to add to GAAP net income in 2013.","This concludes the summary of our third quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call back over to Earl.","Earl R. Lewis","Great. Thank you. Claudia, we're open to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Can we just start out with the Lorex acquisition and maybe some additional detail on how you think this fits in strategically with -- in the commercial division and how quickly maybe we can see this channel open up opportunities for some of the commercial products?","Earl R. Lewis","Sure. Andy, you might as well address that.","Andrew C. Teich","Sure. So the key thesis here is, is that we've recognized, as we've been in the security business now for about 6 or 7 years, that this is a vertical that I think has good legs for the Commercial Systems division. And Lorex brings to the table 2 things: Number one is they bring very high volumes. They're selling several hundred thousand cameras a year in the security space and a full suite of products include cameras and DVRs. The other thing is that Lorex has a division that's been growing quite rapidly that they call it Digimerge, which is a division focused on enterprise-level security cameras. And fundamentally, that's where we felt thermal today is to integrators using enterprise-grade product. And many of those customers that we call on today, I think, would be more than happy to be buying a full suite of products from FLIR and not just a thermal camera from FLIR. Similarly so, we think that those customers buying from Digimerge today would be interested in entering thermal into the equation there. And the last point is, is that the supply chain that Lorex has developed is much more high-volume oriented, low cost, rapid turn times in terms of technology that gets deep integration on the MDDR side, which is an area where we don't have a strength. And I think the combination of all of those, together with the injection of thermal, will significantly expand the use of thermal in the space where there's a very well-proven value proposition.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. Jonathan, I'll just add a couple of comments. The -- this is right in line with what we've publicly stated as our strategy for a long, long time, introducing active thermal into places like Costco and other direct, if you will, marketing activities that these folks do, has clearly been in our strategy for forever so to speak. And this is an extension of it in the security business, should be very positive to us, as the number of cameras they sell now are huge numbers. I mean, I think they can get to 1 million cameras in the next couple of years. So we see this as something that is well within everything we've said we're going to do.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And can you talk a little bit about the EMEA region? I mean, it seems like that's a continual source of pain here for the past couple of quarters. Are you seeing any signs that this is starting to turn around? Or is it just kind of the same thing, as we look into the first month of visibility this quarter?","Earl R. Lewis","No, you're right. It's too early to really say this quarter whether we're seeing a change, I think. I wouldn't forecast we've seen one yet. I wouldn't forecast we won't see one. It's just too early to tell. Eventually, it'll get better.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jeremy Devaney with BB&T Capital Markets.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Speaking of acquisitions, wanted to take a look if you can give us some color on what your capital deployment strategy will look like next quarter? And then maybe just some additional color as you think about where the business heads over the next year or so. There was a bit of buyback in the quarter on top of the acquisition, just some puts and takes versus the way that you're looking at putting the cash out there.","Earl R. Lewis","Well, I think we've been pretty consistent in that in terms of what we want to do with our cash. Our -- actually, our cash is significantly higher than it was a year ago. We added, I believe, about $50 million compared to Q3 last year and still purchased, I think, almost 2 million shares. Our cash disbursements are going to be just what we've said they will be. We want to have sort of an equal mix between acquisitions, between buying back our shares and between dividends. And I don't see that changing. I mean, the fact we've made an acquisition means that approximately $60 million we'll spend in this quarter. We'll still try to buy back shares, and we'll still pay a dividend. So we just believe that this should be a balanced approach, and we'll continue to do that.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Is there any thought going on internally that perhaps an increase in your dividend payout ratio should be considered, bring it more in line with some of the other players out there?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. If you're saying to me, do we think we should increase our dividends? We'll get back to you on that one early next year when we make that decision. The -- it's clearly once you start paying dividends, it would certainly be our objective to see them increase. Whether we would want to match what other people do, I'm not sure we're going to target that. I think we'll target gradual increases more than matching someone.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wondered, Tony, maybe if you could just give us the walk from the old earnings guidance range to the new earnings guidance range because we see the revenue coming in a little bit in terms of the midpoint. Looks like there is tax help. Margins were a little better than I thought, but not sure how they compared to what you thought. Maybe you can just give us the puts and takes in the new range there.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Well, if you look at Q3, the -- down at the EPS line, the $0.37, pretty consistent from an operating profitability standpoint because we had a little bit of tax lift, but we had a bit of tax lift in Q3 last year, in fact, actually nearly exactly the same amount. And we had some -- in the other income line, we actually had a loss on the other income line because of some hedging activity that we've done. So I think Q3 looks pretty consistent with what we expected. If you look at the changes that we made in the outlook, we really tightened things up. We tightened things to the lower end of the revenue range mainly as a result of the challenges in Europe that we're talking about. But the earnings guidance of $1.42 to $1.47 suggest that, overall, margins should come in a little bit better than that earlier guidance range because we're not at the -- even though we're at the lower half of the guidance that we gave on revenue, we're not at the lower half in terms of what we gave on earnings per share. So I think we've made a lot of progress from the standpoint of producing costs.","I talked about what the cost reductions sequentially have been in the divisions, and we saw similar cost reductions in our corporate expenses. So we're pretty well positioned. As Earl said, we expect revenue to be basically flattish in Q4 with last year, and we'll see some growth in earnings per share. So overall, I think what we've done is create a situation where there's a fairly significant amount of operating leverage in the business because of the cost reductions that we've made. And I think margins are looking a little bit better than what we thought 90 days ago.","Earl R. Lewis","And we had -- remember, we said that we had some slight price increases. We did. We had some -- a little bit more cost reduction than we had planned. And frankly, if you look at our guidance, it really is saying that in Q4, we're not going to have negative growth, so that, coupled with the fact that I think we have our costs under very good control and our backlog's expanded very significantly. I think, in fact, they're higher now than they've been in 2 or 3 years, I think, as we pointed out. I think we move into next year and into Q4 in pretty good shape now.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Super. And just one follow-up for Andy. The Cores & Components bookings strength that you mentioned, any ability to parse out where that's coming from?","Andrew C. Teich","It's the same cast of characters that we have been selling to on that segment. Frankly, there's not -- so we had orders from Northrop Grumman, who\u2019s been a key customer of ours and orders from the fire segment, auto segment, UAV segment. The issue of that business now is that it's a bit lumpy. And those customers, to the extent that those are military government-based customers have had some challenges on their end, again, which has just caused the orders to move around a little bit quarter-to-quarter but basically, the same mix that we have seen historically.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Lewis with Lazard Capital Markets.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. So, Tony, you gave the trailing 12 months revenue for Lorex. I was wondering if you could give us an idea what the growth profile looks like, what expectation is for the EBITDA margin growth because right now, there's a -- somewhat a margin diluted. And then finally, do you have an average price point for the Lorex product portfolio?","Anthony L. Trunzo","So I'll give you a little bit of color on that. We need to be careful because, a, the transaction hasn't closed yet, and Lorex is a public company. But I think clearly, the operating margins at Lorex are 10-ish percent, which is half or less of the operating margins that we typically expect. The insertion of our thermal technology into their product suite should have a significant positive effect on margins. It's a competitive space, right? I mean these guys are -- they're in big-box retailers in places where if you don't have a differentiated product, you're going to have tighter margins just because of the level of competition. But as Andy said, and I'm sure he'll want to comment on this, we really -- what we really see here are the ability to take our technology and insert it into their product line, which we think will be significantly positive both in terms of revenue growth and margin. And frankly, we see the opportunity to go to school on their e-commerce and their retailing capabilities because those are markets that, over the relatively short term given some of the development work we're doing on low-cost thermal, are going to be important for a lot of our markets. And that's not a trivial piece of this. The lift that we get from learning about those markets and really being able to deploy their capabilities across markets beyond just that kind of do-it-yourself security market is a big part of this.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And [indiscernible] the average price point?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I don't think we have -- I mean I'm not sure how meaningful an average price point would be.","Earl R. Lewis","Probably isn't actually because they sell kits of cameras. You might by 2 or 3 or 10 in a kit with the DVR, et cetera. If you're asking what the average price point of a camera is, I'm not sure it's relevant because the sale isn't almost always more than one camera. It'd be 4 or 5 and a DVR. Mike, you can go online and -- they are public companies, you see their entire product range or you can go to Costco and buy one, which I think...","Anthony L. Trunzo","You should do that.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. I mean they sell 2 packages at the Costco, typically 1 for $500 and 1 for $1,000. And I think it's -- one is a 4-camera set, and the other is an 8-camera set with an nDVR, and so that's representative of what they're doing today in the Lorex line. As we've mentioned, I'll just augment Tony's comment to this is that the initial focus with Lorex will -- we will continue to run the Lorex business as is and let it continue to execute and grow on path that it has been. It's a very well-run business and has good solid management. The area of focus, I think, an intersection with FLIR will be at the Digimerge side, which is the professional integrator series of product. And that's where our sales organizations, I think, have a convenient overlap, a beneficial overlap on the integration side. And then also, the injection of thermal initially at our current cost structure will make the most sense. As this long-term investment that we're making in lower-cost thermal comes to fruition, we will then backwards integrate lower-cost thermal technologies into the Lorex line, which will give them a significant differentiating feature in the marketplace.","Anthony L. Trunzo","One other thing I think worth underscoring on Lorex, I think it's a very good example of the fact that we haven't changed our strategy, nor have we stopped investing aggressively in that strategy in the face of some challenging market conditions, right? I mean, we're still committed to ultra-high-volume, ultra-low-cost thermal imaging. We're still committed to getting this technology down to the consumer level. And I think Lorex is an example of that execution plan.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Yes, if you take that midpoint of the 750 to 1,000 -- or I'm sorry, 500 to 1,000, that implies 100,000 units. But if Earl is on point with the $1 million projection next few -- or I'm sorry, 1 million unit projection next few years, I mean, this is a significant growth market for you.","Earl R. Lewis","But let me make sure -- Mike, I don't want to mislead you. That was not units, units of cameras. And like we said, they sell 4 at a time or 8 at a time, and those are the price points that Andy was referring to. So in the there, the camera's $100 a piece. That's exactly -- so that's more the way to look at it. So if you got a $100 camera, we've got to get our cost down for the thermal part of that to convert that to a thermal camera. But that's our objective.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Tim Quillin with Stephens Inc.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","The R&D spending was down quite a bit both in dollar terms, both year-to-year and quarter-over-quarter. Can you just talk about where you've cut back spending, where you are spending money on R&D and how you're or where you're targeting R&D as a percent of revenue?","Earl R. Lewis","Sure. But I think probably both Andy and Bill should address it on their divisions. Go ahead, Bill.","William A. Sundermeier","Sure. Actually, year-over-year for us, we're pretty even...","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, I don't think it was down.","William A. Sundermeier","Compared to Q3 last year, total spending. We did our major reduction last year in 2011. Right now, we're targeting right around 8% to 9% in R&D. It's a little bit lower than we've talked about the past, about [ph] 10%. But we're still focused in working on new technologies, new gimbal technologies that we're going to be coming out with in 2014. So we can always say we can use more R&D, but I think we are very well focused right now for the products that we want to come out with next year to stimulate growth.","Andrew C. Teich","And, Tim, from the CS perspective, we took our spending down by about 10% year-over-year in R&D spending, but we're still spending 10% of revenue within the groups. The mix on targeted spend within Raymarine really hasn't changed. We've got a rich cadence of new product development that we have been doing there, and that will continue here again this week at the Fort Lauderdale Boat Show. We've got several new products that we're launching, similarly selling thermography, same cadence, a lot of development. We've got some longer-term development going on there to significantly lower cost as we had done before and then developments to enhance existing product platforms. The one area where the mix has changes a little bit more significantly is in the former CVS segment where, as Earl mentioned in his opening comments, we have been spending over the course of the last 18 months on a targeted program to come out with the next generation of technology that will significantly lower cost and enable significantly higher volumes that will ultimately feed into a Lorex-type channel and low-cost thermography products and so forth.","Earl R. Lewis","The 8%, 9%, 10% range probably will bounce around a little bit depending on economic conditions, but overall, over the years, that's about what we're committed to do.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly for Bill, it seems like the bookings outlook could get a little more challenging with the -- at least the threat of sequestration.","Earl R. Lewis","But we didn't promise it's not going to happen. You don't believe that, Tim?","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I don't believe politicians. Go figure.","Earl R. Lewis","I'll be darned.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","But what's your outlook over the next 6 months on the bookings front, Bill?","William A. Sundermeier","Sure. Q4 is going to be a reasonable quarter for us, and we might draw down backlog a little bit in Q4. But then as we go into next year, it's really going to largely depend on that sequestration. So we're trying to build as much backlog as we can to have legs to get into next year. But we're judiciously looking and following the palm and watching our programs there, and they haven't been cut for next year, and we'll see and we're trying to get as much as life as we can of where cuts will happen and see how it affects our business. But it's really going to -- have to check out and see where the cuts happen.","Earl R. Lewis","But right now, Q4 looks pretty good for us, Tim, compared to last year actually. So we're slightly bullish on the government orders in Q4 at this point.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just first, a clarification on the Lorex, the 100,000 cameras that you kind of mentioned, what is the kind of split right now between consumer and professional grade?","Earl R. Lewis","Okay, let me just make sure I got -- I put a number out that I slipped in the one in that respect because I probably didn't qualify it. Number of cameras, units, I believe, can be 1 million in the next couple of years. It's significantly more than 500,000 now. So we suspect that, that business will continue grow and produce something like 1 million cameras a year. It's that order of magnitude.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just is the mix between consumer or -- and professional grade? Is there any color there?","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, today, it's mostly Lorex.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, it's consumer as majority.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So it's a huge opportunity for you on the -- in moving up the professional grade, right?","Earl R. Lewis","It is, and the professional grade is the fastest-growing segment within the business right now. So we think that we can put gas on that fire effectively.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, okay. And then just my main question was you mentioned quite a bit of a kind of, I guess, technology that is finally coming to bear in the CBRNE kind of marketer detection. How do you see the adoption going there? I think we've all kind of waited for some increased adoption from that marketplace.","Earl R. Lewis","Bill, you want to talk about CBRNE? Pay attention, Bill.","William A. Sundermeier","CBRNE in the future?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, right.","William A. Sundermeier","We really focused, our folks in the detection group, on some burning and proliferating into different and new markets. So we're starting to see international growth out of that group. And when we acquired them, they were only 5% abroad, and that is continuing to strengthen. And with programs like DRC and J2, hopefully, first part of next year, we'll get into an older phase of that and start proliferating that to -- that's a very large program for us ongoing from 2013 to continue to stimulate that. We're still working on a couple of areas with the TSA in mass spec and explosives to get qualified there and have programs for hopeful adoption next year as well, which will help proliferate that technology for us as a gate to moving through TSA then get European adoption. And we're working on approvals in China and Asia right now for all of our products, and so we see those as strong markets in our future. So growth potential continues in the following years.","Earl R. Lewis","Just the -- I've got another comment. The combination of these technologies is where we see a good future of growth. This one order for DRC is really multiple technologies packaged together. Part of the ICX acquisition was basically that. It was put together detection, surveillance, CBRNE technologies all in a box or on a trailer or in the truck to sell to the customer. And that's -- that, we believe, is paying off. We had tremendous good -- very good orders in Q3. We think our orders will be very good in Q4.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","I guess, on Lorex, the one thing that -- the red flag that gets raised for me is don't -- isn't there the danger that you're going to alienate a lot of your other customers in the surveillance market because don't you sell to a lot of the other camera makers currently?","Earl R. Lewis","We don't sell any equipment into this market today, into what I'm talking about relative to Costco and the other ones, and neither do the people we supply thermal equipment to. The do-it-yourself, the people that are installing these themselves are pretty unique market right now. Andy, you might want to comment because I don't think we have a lot of risk in that area right now.","Andrew C. Teich","No, we don't. I -- perhaps, Peter, you're thinking about the integrator space as a more enterprise-oriented space. And there, we sell to integrators. We don't sell to camera manufacturers. So an integrator has the choice of what products he brings to bear in a project. So today, an integrator might pick a FLIR thermal camera and then combine it together with a Pelco, Axis, Bosch, something like that, enterprise-grade camera. And we feel that we can offer to that integrator an enterprise class of a product that will have a compelling value proposition versus those competitors. And at this point, those aforementioned companies are companies that are starting to compete with us as well in the thermal space. So I think we're more than willing to take on that level of competition.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you're not taking on the role of the integrator?","Andrew C. Teich","No, no, not at all. Not at all.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Okay. Okay. And then I want to follow up again on Europe. It's obviously the big headwind to CVS. I mean, is there any reason to think Europe's not going to sort of continue to be negative? And I mean things seem to be pretty bad over there, and so, Earl, should you be planning for a further cost takeout over there? Or are you kind of at the...","Earl R. Lewis","I think we're where we need to be. I mean, yes, Peter, you can certainly draw some horrible lines on Europe for the next 2 or 3 years. It seems like Wall Street changes their mind on it weekly. I think we're positioned about right on the cost structure for Europe. And I don't suspect we're going to see huge declines from here going forward.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can you remind us -- I might have missed this -- what your current percentage of sales to Europe are in CVS?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, we'll look it up.","Anthony L. Trunzo","We didn't break out the -- we don't break out -- we give you international. We don't go deeper than that. So total Commercial Systems sales -- just bear with me. I had it here a second ago. Total Commercial Systems, U.S. was 52.8% and international was 47.2%. That compares to international being 54.8% in Q3 of 2011. So pretty significant decline, about a 22% -- 21% decline in Commercial Systems' revenue outside the U.S. and a 7.8% increase in revenue inside the U.S.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. And of course, the Far East continues to have some growth, so that's the other piece of total international. So you can kind of draw those lines I guess, but...","Andrew C. Teich","We have moved some assets around there. So for example, just in the last quarter, we moved a key sales management asset from the EMEA region to the APAC region. So yes, but we think we'll see some dividends from the [indiscernible].","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Earl, what sort of -- what are the puts and takes to the high end and low end of the guidance really for the fourth quarter? Kind of, I guess, the high end, $430 million; low, $300 million. We're into the quarter. Are there any programs? Or is there any end markets that can swing you to one end or the other?","Earl R. Lewis","Mike, I think what you're asking -- because there was some background noise. What's the -- what's given us range in our guidance?","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, okay. Our gross margins bounce around a little bit. They've -- a couple of points one way or another in gross margin, I think, we could see. I think our revenue number is going to be pretty good given the pretty good backlog in the Government Systems business. And we have some risk, of course, in our thermography business. We have a little risk in government on the top line, but I think we'll be all right there. I think it's more in the area of gross margin where we might see a point or 2 difference between internal forecasts, external forecasts.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then just on -- back to Lorex. What -- if I looked at the revenue trajectory for that company, they did about $53 million in '05, $48 million in '10, and they hit a big inflection point, really growing in '11. Is there -- can you give us a sense of what sparked that growth at Lorex last year? And I guess they're tracking fairly well this year, but is there anything that they introduced or new product lines that really accelerated their growth rate the last year or so?","Earl R. Lewis","I think this is -- this is just a very interesting market. I mean you can go to the store and for relatively short money, do what it cost me $25,000 to do on my house. And that's where I think the nature of their growth is, which is essentially have an IP security system that you spend -- Andy, you spend a day doing in your house, right, with 7 or 8 cameras. We think that's a good, in itself, future growth business.","Andrew C. Teich","I'd add one other thing that I think is -- I bought one of the systems at the consumer level before we started having discussions with the companies that have a consumer out-of-the-box experience, so to speak. And I think one of the thing is the technology-enabling side in this are -- is the connectivity to mobile platforms. So having the ability to go and buy this network for $1,000, install it in your house and 15 minutes later, be watching it on your iPhone or iPad from anywhere in the world, I think is a very strong value proposition. Lorex's also -- one of their unique capabilities is, is that they really have 3 lines business. So they've got this consumer DIY business. They've got this Digimerge enterprise business, but they also have a pretty strong vector in the baby monitoring business, baby cams. And again, the same thing, the technology that's out there today to get an image from a baby cam to an iPhone, many of us are parents on the call, it's a nice feature. It's not something I had when I was raising my kids but would like to have. So I think that those are some of the things that drove the inflection point in the last couple of years.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with CRT Capital Group.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Couple of questions. Just looking at Lorex, the public filings, their gross margins are around the 36% mark. Can you talk about that and how that will impact you guys, if you plan to change that at all and how government pricing with your -- kind of the low price technically acceptable, which seems to be the term going forward, how that's going to impact your gross margins, both those things going forward into '13 and '14?","Earl R. Lewis","I'm not sure on your second point, so let's just talk about the first for a minute and come back and try to clarify it. Clearly, when we add thermal technology, we would expect to increase the gross margin. So yes, they're 36% today, but we believe we can get a higher gross margin due to our significantly lower-cost structure in the thermal market and then adoption of thermal technology in these do-it-yourself markets, if you will, and commercial markets. So we would expect that gross margin to improve. I'm not 100% sure on your second question though. Can you rephrase it to me?","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Yes. At least what I am hearing from the defense primes and from others out there is the federal government is going to a low-priced, technically acceptable business model bidding model.","Earl R. Lewis","Wonderful. Hallelujah.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes.","Earl R. Lewis","Boy, do you believe them? If you do, that's great. We would love that.","Anthony L. Trunzo","That's right in our sweet spot.","Earl R. Lewis","That's what we've been all about for years, Brian.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. So that won't impact your margin. That should actually help you guys. Is that correct?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Forced competition like that for best value is everything we want to have happen.","Earl R. Lewis","This is our dream of running this business, as a commercial business that supplies the government, no question.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Great. And then the -- a little follow-up is in the fourth quarter, you talked about flattish revenue year-over-year from fourth quarter-to-fourth quarter. Is that -- can you just elaborate? Is that government and commercial being flat year-over-year? Is there going to be a mix shift at all?","Andrew C. Teich","Let's just stick with [indiscernible] ...","Earl R. Lewis","I'll give you the total at this point. How's that?","Operator","We do have another question coming from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I've asked this before, but I want to try again, which is back to the balance sheet utilization and capital deployment topic. The company has a relatively large net cash position, and even after you closed this latest acquisition, that will still be true. Given where rates are, given where the stock is and that you buy back stock, why not get more aggressive with the balance sheet? You could add a lot to the balance sheet and still have it be fairly conservative. Why not do more here?","Earl R. Lewis","Well, we might. But this business -- I guess, I'm starting to feel my age here, but when I came here, we had huge debts, problems baked in our payroll, a lot of real serious issues, and frankly, having a strong balance sheet doesn't bother me. I think that whatever acquisitions we want to make, we can make. We can pay back a decent amount in our dividends, and we can buy back a decent amount in our shares and still have a decent amount in the bank for contingencies or for -- if a large acquisition were to come up, to be able to do it. And I guess I like the conservative position, and maybe that's old fashioned, but I think at this point, we're not alone in having large cash balances on our balance sheet given the uncertainty of, say, the political realms that we deal with. So no, I'm -- we're not going to run out and do something dramatic one way or the other with our balance sheet. Tony, you want to comment?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes. I mean, just we -- last year, when we sold our bonds, one of the key things we wanted to do was get an investment-grade credit rating to go along with the strong investment-grade credit profile of the company. We have the ability today to raise several hundred million dollars in the market. Would we do that? It would have to be for a significant acquisition opportunity. To leverage the company to buy back stock, given what we see as the opportunities around us, probably isn't something that we do. We'll continue to buy back stock. We'll continue to do our dividend. And as Earl said, our expectation is that we're going to grow it incrementally. We want to have that conservative credit profile. I don't think that we want to have growth leverage of more than 1x EBITDA. And having the flexibility that's afforded to do transactions like Lorex is something I think we want to continue to maintain. So on the one hand, yes, we're thinking more internally about return on invested capital and return on equity. And that's kind of the thesis behind the fact that we've bought back a couple of hundred million dollars worth of stock. But doing something that's going to significantly change the credit profile or the leverage profile of the company, that's not something we're going to be taking on.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, and that's definitely not what I'm suggesting. It just seems like there is a lot of room in between where you are and sort of the danger zones that you're talking about not wanting to be in if that makes sense. And given where rates are, it would just seem like it would be easy to make the math work.","Earl R. Lewis","Well, it would. I mean Tony said and it's very clear, we could go out and borrow $300 million more in the bond market tomorrow, but then the next day, we get a phone call saying, \"What are you going to do with that money now?\" And since we don't have a place to put it, we just -- a month ago, we went and looked really hard at going and getting some more money out of the bond market and decided, now what are we going to do with it? And since we didn't have a good home for it, we passed. If we had a great idea and a great application, then certainly having that strong balance sheet would be wonderful. We could go execute it. And I guess, that's a position we want to take. You look and look and look for an acquisition until it finds you is an old saying, and who knows what might happen in the future in that regard.","Anthony L. Trunzo","I mean, I guess, Noah, if you were to talk to the hypothetical that says there was a strategically important $500 million acquisition...","Earl R. Lewis","Or $1 billion.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Or $1 billion acquisition, would we do it and would we take down our cash balances and issue debt within the constraints I just explained? Yes, we would.","Earl R. Lewis","We would. Yes.","Anthony L. Trunzo","It's not that we're spooked at all. It's just that it would have -- in order for us to do that, it would have to be a pretty compelling situation.","Earl R. Lewis","Okay. Operator, I -- there's no other questions, so I think we'll call it a day. Thank you, all, very much for phoning in today. Is there another? Do you want to take -- no. Okay, I guess, we're done.","Again, I think we had a -- the kind of quarter we expected to have and the kind of order entry we expected to have. And I think we\u2019re going into Q4 as a very strong company with, as Noah's pointed out, a good balance sheet, a good cost structure, a good backlog and lots of good new opportunities.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Carol Lowe, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Ms. Lowe, please go ahead.","Carol Lowe","Thank you. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Please note that our earnings press release and presentation slides referred to on this call are available under the Events & Presentations section of flir.com in our Investor section.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that statements made on this call other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and based on our current expectations.","Words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, and believes, and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking statements we make today, speak as of today and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statement to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","We'll be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP information is useful, because it can enhance the understanding of our core ongoing operating results and facilitate consistent comparison of results over time. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in this morning's earnings press release.","With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim Cannon, President and CEO of FLIR Systems.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Carol. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining FLIR's second quarter 2019 earnings call. With Carol and me today are Travis Merrill, President of our Commercial Business Unit; David Ray, President of our Government & Defense Business Unit, and Sonia Galindo, FLIR's new Senior Vice President, General Counsel, Secretary, and Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer. Sonia brings the wealth of experience and we're excited to have her on the executive team.","Frank Pennisi, President of our Industrial Business Unit has a travel conflict and is unable to attend the call. On today's call we will focus on a few key messages. First, we achieved organic revenue growth while lapping prior year double-digit growth.","Second, our expanding organic operating margins have allowed for reinvestment in the areas poised for long-term accelerated growth. Third, our Government & Defense business unit continues to achieve strong growth having successfully replaced large sun-setting programs.","And lastly, we continue to make exciting progress on our strategic initiatives to fuel, feed and focus the business with the FLIR Method at the foundation to drive long-term value creation. I'll start the review of the quarter on slide three of the presentation with a few financial highlights. Carol will provide more color later in our prepared remarks.","As announced earlier this morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $482 million, total revenue growth with 6% and on an organic basis growth was in line with our expectations at 3%. Second quarter organic revenue growth laps the 11% organic growth posted a year ago.","Foreign currency exchange negatively impacted growth by 1%. Total bookings were down 3% compared to prior year due to orders originally planned for the second quarter materializing in the first quarter of the year.","Recall, we experienced significant franchise program wins and non-programmatic orders in the Government & Defense and industrial business unit in Q1. For the first half of 2019, total bookings are up 14%, total company 12-month current backlog increased 12% to $670 million compared to the balance at the end of the second quarter 2018. Total backlog also increased 12% to $809 million over the same period.","Adjusted gross profit increased 5% versus second quarter 2018. Adjusted gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 52%. Continued improvement in organic gross margins driven by productivity initiatives through the FLIR Method and product mix were offset by the early ramp of recent acquisitions.","Adjusted operating income was in line with prior year. Adjusted operating margin was down 140 basis points in comparison to last year due entirely to the dilutive effect of recent acquisitions. We are maintaining our full year 2019 guidance.","We continue to expect full year revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10%, which includes organic growth of approximately 5%. As we outlined on the first quarter call and unlike last year we expect second half quarterly seasonality to return to historical averages with particular strength in the fourth quarter.","We also continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.36. As communicated on the first quarter call, our 2019 adjusted EPS outlook includes approximately $0.06 of dilution from the Aeryon Labs and Endeavor Robotics acquisitions.","We realized the majority of that dilution in the second quarter of 2019 and expect these high growth businesses to scale sequentially from the third to the fourth quarter. Finally, we announced the quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share which will be payable on September the 6th to shareholders of record as of August 23rd.","We've made continued progress on our strategic priorities to fuel, feed and focus the business with the FLIR Method as its foundation. I'd like to highlight a few key second quarter developments that will fuel our business in the near-term, feed delivery of our strategic plan and also address more specifics of the FLIR Method.","We'll start with fuel on slide four where we advanced many near-term opportunities to gain scale on the business. In the second quarter the Government & Defense business unit was awarded a $44 million purchase order from the U.S. Department of Defense to deliver unmanned PackBot robots, FirstLook robots and associated accessories with deliveries beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019.","This order is further evidence of the alignment of our long-term strategic plan to position FLIR as a leading unmanned solutions provider with the DOD's modernization priorities which include utilizing unmanned solutions to protect the war fighter.","Our Industrial & Commercial business units also continue to advance franchise programs. As an example in the second quarter FLIR was awarded a $17 million nationwide program to protect critical infrastructure in Asia representing the largest commercial security project win in FLIR's s history. This win is a testament to our growing solution orientation with thermal camera, visible camera and software capabilities all part of FLIR's winning proposal.","Turning to slide five, FLIR has launched many exciting new products across the portfolio since our last earnings call. And I'd like to highlight a few. Earlier this month the Industrial Business Unit launched the new people counting sensor for retail business environments call the Brickstream 3D Gen 2. This new version includes a unique employee filtering feature designed to provide retail and shopping businesses with more accurate customer traffic data and sales conversion metrics.","Additionally, in June the Commercial Business Unit launched TrafiData, an intelligent thermal traffic sensor solution for smarter and safer cities. This is a thermal traffic camera that operates in all conditions, integrated with the recently acquired a cyclic data analytics platform to detect, track, classify and communicate insights to traffic managers. This product is a great example of how FLIR is integrating more software capabilities into our sensors to facilitate customers making more intelligent decisions to save lives and livelihood.","Also in June the Government & Defense business unit introduced several upgrades to the Griffin 510 portable gas mass spectrometer to help responders analyze and identify drugs, chemical agents and other toxic substances faster and more effectively during field operations. Major new features on the G 510 give users access to an expanded onboard drug library, as well as the new quick search capability for chemicals and hazardous substance.","Lastly, we introduced our second regional dataset for autonomous vehicle makers. The enhanced San Francisco dataset features over 10,000 annotated images across 11 image classes in multiple weather conditions. With this much improved data set developed at the epicenter for many ADAS developers.","It serves as a reference to demonstrate the increased awareness and therefore safety that thermal brings the challenging conditions in our urban environment. With over 15 years of experience in automotive FLIR has the only automotive qualified thermal sensor that is deployed in over 600,000 cars today for driver warning systems.","As highlighted on slide six we made additional strategic investments in the second quarter that will feed delivery of our long-term strategic plan. As you know in early April we continued our minority investment strategy via our investment in drone base, a global drone operations company that provides businesses access to one of the largest Unmanned Aerial Surveillance or UAS pilot networks.","Also during the second quarter we acquired New England Optical Systems or NEOS, a recognized leader in niche optical applications for the design and manufacture of high end optical lens assemblies used for visible, thermal and multi-spectral cameras. Their thermal zoom solutions are enabled by the NEOS electronic lens controller, which provides enhanced focus performance while zooming as well as predictive maintenance metrics.","This investment continues our vertical integration strategy delivering a complete camera solution to our commercial and defense customers. We're pleased to welcome the NEOS team to the Industrial Business Unit.","Turning the slides seven, in 2018 we introduce the FLIR Method, which is comprised of six elements with an emphasis on one FLIR Lean Management and continuous improvement. In 2019 we are building upon our 2018 momentum, while implementing the elements of acquisition and integration discipline, customer driven innovation and talent management.","With some of the largest acquisitions in FLIR's history recently completed, the discipline around people, process and technology continues to be refined. The integration of our recently acquired unmanned businesses continues as planned and we strive to achieve world-class performance around this TFM element.","As an example of our customer driven innovation, FLIR can point to winning the prestigious Red Dot Award for excellence in industrial design in each of the last three years. Lastly, I'd like to discuss the talent management element of the FLIR Method.","In addition to providing employees with leadership and development opportunities, we hold a robust Global Talent Review or GTR to align key talent with our long-term strategic objectives. In fact, we completed our second annual GTR in June here in our new Arlington Virginia headquarters.","Let me now turn the call over to Carol for her review of the second quarter financials. Carol?","Carol Lowe","Thank you, Jim. On slide eight is a summary of our second quarter financial results. Please note, with the exception of cash flow all of these financials are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the filed appendix.","Jim has already highlighted our Q2, 2019 revenue growth of 6.5%, adjusted gross profit increase of 5% and flat adjusted operating income as compared with Q2, 2018, while growth in operating margins decline on a year-over-year basis both expanded organically.","As expected and previously communicated the acquisitions made to advance our unmanned strategy negatively impacted margins. These investments are critical to the execution of our long-term strategy and we look forward to their positive contribution to our second half performance especially in Q4.","Operating cash flow reached $121 million in the first half of 2019 compared to $153 million in the first half of 2018. The decline in operating cash flow as compared to 2018 was due to timing and certain working capital balances as well as other operating assets and liability.","In the second quarter, we've repurchased approximately 500,000 shares for $25 million increasing our year-to-date share buyback to approximately 1 million shares. We also returned $23 million to shareholders in Q2 through the payment of dividend for year-to-date payment of $46 million.","Our cash balance at June 30, 2019 was approximately $269 million. As Jim mentioned regarding our 2019 outlook we continue to expect full-year revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10% which includes organic growth of approximately 5%.","As we have communicated since first providing our 2019 outlook in February, we expect stronger second half revenue growth versus the first half. We currently expect Q4 to be stronger than Q3 with both higher revenues and higher earnings generated in the last quarter of the year.","Our full year adjusted earnings per share outlook of $2.30 to $2.36 includes approximately $0.06 of dilution from our recent unmanned acquisition with slightly more than half of that dilution already reflected in the second quarter results.","Turning to slide nine, I will highlight performance from each of our business units. Beginning with the Industrial Business Unit, second quarter revenue was $189 million driven by strength in cooled thermal cores that was largely offset by lower demand for test and measurement product and the transition from handheld to UAS based offering.","It is important to note that the Industrial Business Unit delivered impressive growth of 14% in Q2, 2018. Operating income for Industrial was $62 million, 7% higher than Q2 2018. Operating margin improved 200 basis point year-over-year driven by favorable product mix and productivity gains achieved through the FLIR Method.","The Government & Defense business unit saw revenue growth of 23% year-over-year including contribution from the Endeavor Robotics and Aeryon Labs acquisition. On an organic basis the business grew by 13%, lapping 11% organic growth the previous year.","Government & Defense showed strength across all businesses and was led by growth in UAS and Surveillance. Government & Defense operating income increased 8% compared to the second quarter of 2018. Total operating margin decline 350 basis points due entirely to the recently acquired unmanned businesses.","During the second quarter, Government & Defense current backlog reached $472 million to end the quarter, a 34% increase over the second quarter of 2018, having successfully replaced large end-of-life program, book-to-bill for Government & Defense stands at 1.2 for the first half.","The Commercial Business Unit second quarter revenue was down 7% year-over-year including 3% negative impact of foreign currency exchange. The Maritime business is experiencing negative growth that correlates directly to industry condition.","Additionally, the OTS realignment has created near-term headwind. But we're pleased with the team's effort to reposition our products for the professionals. We experienced healthy topline right in the second quarter and our ITS and Security businesses. Operating income and operating margin for the commercial business decreased 25% and 300 basis points year-over-year respectively.","Despite record productivity improvement through the FLIR Method, revenue declines in our Maritime business and OTS businesses, foreign currency exchange and U.S. import tariff negatively impacted our financial performance in the second quarter. While it was a challenging quarter for commercials and we expect these headwinds to persist, we are committed to our full-year 2019 guidance.","I will now pass the call back to Jim.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Carol. I'm pleased with the overall performance we delivered in the second quarter. But as our team often hear me say; I'm proud but not satisfied. We are committed to driving stronger organic growth in the second half of the year and our current backlog positions us well to deliver revenue growth for 2019 of 8% to 10%.","We will continue to accelerate our efforts leveraging the FLIR Method and remain diligent in our daily tasks to consistently exceed our commitments with integrity and\/or purpose to innovate the world's sixth sense to save lives and livelihood.","I'll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now we conducting a question-and-answer session. We ask you please ask one question, one follow-up then return to the queue. [Operator Instructions] First question today is coming from Asher Carey from Baird. Your line is now live.","Asher Carey","Hey, Jim, just first clarification; you have adjusted out of $4 million cost that previously wasn't included. What was that charge in the quarter?","Carol Lowe","So, are you looking at the GAAP reconciliation?","Asher Carey","That's right. Yes.","Carol Lowe","Okay. Which specific items, I mean\u2026?","Asher Carey","It's classified as other, 3.951?","Carol Lowe","So there were certain expenses that related to some older legal matters as well as some product warranty for a company that FLIR had purchased and those warranties extended to contracts that existed prior to the acquisition. So it from items that were very dated that not related to any current operations within the past two to three years for the company.","Asher Carey","Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up on industrial performance, segment was up in tough comps, but we still had a great quarter. I was wondering if you could \u2013 you curious to hear about any specific areas of strength, the areas of weaknesses that you saw in the quarter?","Jim Cannon","Yes. Our industrial business, we're really proud that they lap some really strong organic performance in the prior years as we mentioned. And at -- the heart of it are OEM business there that makes various sensors and components for other companies as well as feed the rest of FLIR continues to have great success. They are probably one of the earliest adopters of the FLIR Method with lean projects throughout the business. And they've done a really good job ramping and scaling production of our uncooled cores, the Boson, in-sourcing other products as well as Neutrino cooled cores. Also important to note in the industrial business our machine vision business. You know that it benefited from a boom in smartphone production Asia. That was a very difficult thing to comp. And we've seen in the quarter a return to positive bookings as they focus on a host of different industries, life sciences, for example in North America. So, really proud of the Industrial Business Unit's efforts throughout the quarter and continued efforts as we go in the second half.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.","Jim Ricchiuti","Thank you. Question just with respect to the normal seasonality in the second half and the sequential ramp from Q3 to Q4. Is that mainly driven by the Government & Defense business? Or are you expecting a stronger sequential business conditions in some of the other business units as well?","Jim Cannon","Yes. We really see it across most all of our businesses. You know last year was an abnormal year. Typically FLIR has a stronger second half than a first half. Last year we had a very strong first half. As we look at the bookings that we've made entering the year and current backlog not just in Government & Defense, but across a host of the businesses we see a return to that sort of more normal seasonality with stronger second half versus first half and in particular as we noted, the fourth quarter. We see a ramp from Q3 into Q4 with particular strength in the fourth quarter.","Jim Ricchiuti","Thank you. And just a follow-up question if I may, Jim. You alluded to I think some headwinds and some of the industrial commercial areas of the business. And I wonder if you could be a little bit more specific as to where you're seeing and maybe what's changed in that regard from earlier in the year?","Jim Cannon","Yes. There are really two places where we're seeing these headwinds inside of our Commercial Business Unit. In our Commercial Business Unit, our traffic business continues to flourish, growing at a pace that's leading the company and expanding margin. But in two parts the Commercial Business Unit, the OTS or Outdoor and Tactical Systems business, if you'll recall last year we made a deliberate decision to reorient that towards the professional. So, we made some moves in the business. We rationalized the product offering. We're focusing upon different channels to market. And we're seeing what we expected is near-term headwinds as we pivot that business towards professional law enforcement or foreign paramilitary organizations.","The Maritime business, though have seen some headwinds from macroeconomic concern. Ass we entered the year we had good innovations across the Maritime business with our Axiom MFDs, with the DockSense product that has assisted docking solution that we premiered at the Miami Boat Show and others with great response. But you know partially due to weather concerns and other macroeconomic concerns we see new boat registrations down. We see boat sales down, and that slowing growth in the Maritime industry in general is translated into negative growth in our Maritime business.","Now, we also have been working in our Maritime business to expand the customers that we focus upon. So, in late 2017 we won the SINS program with the Coast Guard. We've been innovating features into our MFDs to help the professional on the water with search and rescue and border protection. And we've seen some wins in those areas. But not enough to offset the slowing new boat registration and new boat sales that affect our Maritime business directly.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Your line is now live.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. Carol, maybe first, just housekeeping. On the slide nine where you're showing the segments, you're showing a government book-to-bill of 0.96. But I'm coming up with something closer to 1.2 considering the backlog expanded year-over-year. Is that accurate, I mean it -- the book-to-bill was above one in Government for the second quarter?","Carol Lowe","Yes, so we -- for government for the -- well for the second half, we have 1.2 on the book-to-bill, and then for the quarter we're at 0.9 in total.","Jim Cannon","For the first half.","Carol Lowe","Yes, for the first half and in the quarter is the lower amount.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay. Got it. And then just maybe sticking with government, maybe could we get a little bit of color on the program pipeline. Any opportunities that are out there either large or small, domestic and international and kind of how your view in the current marketplace even with the -- what looks to be a three-year budget deal in place?","Jim Cannon","Yeah, David, do you want to address that question?","David Ray","Sure. So, we're continuing to see some expansion in our current rate program out of our core gimbal business. We think the modernization efforts now that the government has a budget in place is going to continue to flourish in the second half and we expect to see some benefit there. There deals we have internationally that we expect to close in the second half. But also there is some franchise programs as part of our new acquisitions, the [Indiscernible] opportunity as well as Robotic Combat Vehicle in Endeavor that really a promising sort of longer-term efforts that will see some opportunities for growth, with respect to new bookings in the second half of the year. So, on balance between those franchises and the backlog we build we've built in the first half of the year. It's going to be a good mix of continuing to execute was expected in the second half with continuation of building that backlog into 2020.","Jim Cannon","And I'll just add, David. The second half is really important to us with our Soldier Borne System program. As you know, we were awarded that earlier in the year. We've been working really hard to field that program. It's now been fielded to the initial units to receive the Black Hornet. And so, we're working very hard through the second half of the year to make sure that program is successful as it is so important to protect our soldiers on the battlefield.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is now live.","Jeff Kessler","Thank you. I know you visited the Maritime situation before. But just wondering -- the -- you did have a very large amount of new product introduction particularly control systems, control panels for boats. And I'm wondering even with the amount of new products you had out there, the decline in registrations offset that is what you're saying?","Jim Cannon","That's correct, Jeff. Yes, we're again real pleased with the performance of our products and the share we've been able to capture with MFDs and other controls. I mentioned DockSense earlier. Also, I am pleased with the team's effort to shift into professional markets in the Maritime arena. We mentioned Maritime Law Enforcement Border Protection et cetera, but those efforts still aren't quite mature enough to offset the decline that we see in new boat sales and with those new boat sales typically that directly drives the adoption of our products. So yes, Jeff, you're correct with that state.","Jeff Kessler","If we just move into some of your sensors and the use of those sensors in what we call safe cities programs because as you know securities the area where I am most familiar. And I'm wondering what the progress you see there as I know this is a very long -- a very long tailed type of development that goes on. But, it's something that I asked the company that once or twice a year, just to give me an idea of where we are in terms of the adoption of various cores and including various cameras that includes your cores for purposes of both civilian and security use in the -- I'm going to call safe cities or secure cities model programs?","Jim Cannon","Yes. We see that adoption really in two areas, right now. I mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks, the TrafiData that we've introduced with our intelligent traffic systems. We see more and more of a fusion between traffic management, intersection management and monitoring as well as connected and safe cities. So, with the acquisition that we did last year of Acyclica, having data and data set management along with that software, along with the sensors in such and intersections help not just traffic management, but safe cities.","Also I mentioned, we had in the quarter, our largest ever $17 million award for our core security business. Monitoring critical infrastructure, something we've long focused on, whether its power, water, utilities and more and more we see strength in data centers, using thermal cameras, really our bread and butter or staple kind of products to secure data centers, because of their obvious benefits.","We've also been working to -- with the Saros camera introduced, combined, visible and IR-fused sensors with analytics that can determine whether it's a deer, or a dog versus a pedestrian that's approaching a perimeter and integrating low cost radars, with those solutions as well. So, more and more across the world, but also particularly North America, we see real brand strength and our brand being a U.S. company securing critical infrastructure where concerns around cyber security and otherwise continue to persist.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Your line is now live.","Josh Sullivan","Hey, good morning.","Jim Cannon","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Sullivan","Just within that guidance for accelerated growth in Q4 and on the defense portfolio. The two-year deal here provides the backdrop, but if we still get even a short continuing resolution in Q4. Does that impact your outlook anyway? Is that already factored in?","Jim Cannon","Well, certainly, we don't want a continued resolution or any form of the government shutdown. That absolutely would impact our business. Right now though we do have some bookings, we want to still go capture, but with the backlog that we have. Again, we have confidence in the guidance that we've issued now. Again, if there is a sustained CR shutdown et cetera, I can't say that's fully anticipated inside of our guidance. But we're cautiously optimistic, and with the bookings that we have now with the backlog that we have now, we have confidence in that guidance that we've issued.","Josh Sullivan","Right. And then just one on the industrial portfolio. Can you dig into the geographic performance? Where are the strength? Any standout to product outperforming or underperforming in Asia?","Jim Cannon","The strength is really been in the U.S. In Asia, we've seen some softness. We've seen some softness in our machine vision, business in Asia. Now that can partially be attributed to the boon that we had in smartphone production that slowed, if you will, but also for our instruments business, we had a slow down in the first half related to some import issues that we needed to address. But in the U.S. and in Europe, but particularly U.S. our cooled cores have really seen a lot of strength. So the geographic performance probably -- principally, I'd say, U.S. or North America centric, but also Europe as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Your line is now live.","Louie DiPalma","Good morning, Jim, Carol, David, Travis and Sonia.","Jim Cannon","You got a soft cover, Louie. Good morning to you.","David Ray","Good morning.","Louie DiPalma","Defense media report suggests that the U.S. Army's three-year outlook for the Soldier Borne Sensor program is set to scale from around 1,150 systems to over 9,000 systems over the next three years. And the published President's budget request for Robotics which includes Soldier Borne Sensor and the Endeavor MTRs II program shows the budget, increasing from $100 million in 2020 to $209 million in 2023. Is that media report in the budget, generally consistent with your expectations for how Soldier Borne Sensor and Endeavor scales over the next three-years?","Jim Cannon","Yes, I'd say directionally. Now again, we want to push much more adoption. As I mentioned earlier, that's why right now, the second half is so important to us when we look at the Soldier Borne System. It has been fielded now. Its been noted in the media with the third Brigade Combat team of the 82nd Airborne Division and as they now are adopting tactics techniques and procedures and we're learning about its use. Again, we couldn't believe more and it's lifesaving capability to give that non-line of sight Personal Reconnaissance at the squad level. So yes, I would say directionally that makes sense. But I think there's still a lot of discovery happening, we know that one of the major modernization priorities of DOD is unmanned systems.","And as you know with the acquisitions of Endeavor and Aeryon, we're very focused on that Group One, that small squad platoon company level organic unmanned capability. And we know that that's going to continue to proliferate over the battlefield. So, while we directionally sort of agree with those published comments that we have now, I think what we're going to find in the coming quarters and years as these systems get deployed is tactics and techniques develop around them, in their made a part of doctrine and as we continue to innovate and evolve to make them more capable and accessible, we hope to push that number higher because again it's got such a unique in defining capability that we can provide to war fighter.","Louie DiPalma","Okay. And on this subject of unmanned systems, at a high level, can you talk about the role that FLIR plays in counter drone systems? Last week, or it might have been two weeks ago there was a high profile incident in the Middle East of a drone being taken down by a counter drone system and at the Sea-Air-Space Show a lot of the different defense contractors talked about FLIR's involvement in counter-drones, but you guys haven't really been vocal about it on your earnings call. Can you discuss, I guess what systems or the general rule that you guys plan to counter UAS?","Jim Cannon","Sure, what we do in several areas. First, I'm proud to say, the article that you've mentioned it was our Neutrino cooled core. That was a part of that system that down that aircraft. So, we participate at the sensor level with other companies that we provide cooled cores and other sensors into their counter UAS solution. We also are working on our own counter UAS solution and we've demonstrated it in several applications using our own radars, our own EO\/IR systems.","Now we focused on the detect loop. We don't have any technologies or solutions around the defeat loop. So our emphasis has been on providing cooled components and other sensors to folks that are integrating into their counter UAS solutions, as well as our own organic counter UAS solution. But our solution is focused more on domestic applications to detect. We don't have any technologies and right now we're not pursuing any technologies on the defeat loop of that counter UAS solution.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning everyone.","Jim Cannon","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Can you hear me, okay. I'm hearing some feedback, and I'm on a cell phone.","Jim Cannon","I've got you now. Yes. You cut out for a minute, but I can hear you now well.","Noah Poponak","All right. Maybe I'll just shout. I actually wanted to go back to the adjustments from GAAP to adjusted and also as it pertains to cash flow, because there is just more and they're larger in the quarter. And historically, the cash flow is always been there. But in the quarter the cash flow to the adjusted earnings there is a little bit weak.","So, the first part of the question was just, at what point in time -- I understand the intangible amortization is non-cash, you're getting to a cash number, but at what point in time do we just not have the acquisition expenses, the management transition expenses, all of these other expenses. At what point in time do we have a cleaner number? And then Carol on the free cash, I know it's lumpy quarter-to-quarter, but where should we expect free cash to come in for the year relative to your adjusted earnings guidance?","Carol Lowe","So, let's talk about the GAAP and non-GAAP items first. So, as you noted, we'll continue to have the amortization of the intangible assets related to acquisitions as one of the reconciling items, because we report at adjusted operating income, not EBITDA. That's how some companies address that different. We expect the executive transition costs to be complete at the end of this year largely complete. As well as it relates to acquisition-related expenses, those will primarily depend on whether or not we are competing an auction process or their investment bankers involved and that is largely determined by the size of the deal and in terms of who we bring in for support for legal and other special services that are needed in terms of valuation that's required. Those will continue to see and again it's just going to be driven by the volume of M&A that we're doing. And those are the larger items.","As we relate to cash flow, I guess one thing just to provide a little bit more clarity about the -- when you first look at the decline year-over-year in cash flow, it's really driven by the timing of when sales are realized and we had higher sales in June of 2019 as compared to 2018 when you then compare that to June of 2018 compared to 2017. So last year, cash flow was benefited by receivables and timing of sales, it was a positive net $12 million to cash flow. This year for the first half it's a negative $35 million, again just on timing. So that's the net delta when you're comparing 2018 cash flow to 2019 cash flow of approximately $47 million. So that's a big impact of it. We've not really provided guidance on cash flow. We expect to continue to be able to exceed at the cash flow from operations level. We've always been at more than 100% and will expect to continue to deliver that on a year-on-year basis.","Noah Poponak","Okay. I appreciate that. That's really helpful. And then I just wanted to ask on the government margin, kind of 31 and change, at the end of last year, 27 and change in the first quarter than 24 and change this quarter. And I totally get the acquired businesses and some of the new efforts there and the potential to grow revenues significantly from them, but them to dilute the margin, but I don't know how much they dilute the margin sustainably. And so I guess, which of the last four quarters is more indicative of the kind of normalized two to three year out run rate margin in that business?","Jim Cannon","Well, I mean, we don't want to guide the future specific margins of our Government & Defense Business Unit, except to say as we've talked about before. We're constantly managing that arbitrage between competing for larger programs that could have a dilutive effect, as well as driving innovations and non-programmatic business that can be accretive. You mentioned the acquisitions and we talked about there dilution inside the quarter is they advance through the year we expect them to begin to contribute to positive margins in the Government & Defense business. So as we've said at the macro level, we are still committed to 23 points operating margin and the Government & Defense business is a key contributor to us maintaining or exceeding that guidance.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Your line is now live.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey, thanks guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up here. Just to maybe stay on that. I mean, you've got the 29%, 2021 bogey out there for government margin. So is that still good? And then separately, you've got that 2021 target of 30% for Industrial margins and I mean on that front, you put up close to 33%, it sounds like you're even dealing with some headwinds in the instrument margins. So should we be thinking there could be upside to that industrial margin longer term and then basically 29% still good for government?","Jim Cannon","Yes. I mean, as we've talked about in our Investor Day, and we still remain committed directionally to those kind of margins in the businesses. But quarter-to-quarter, we have lumpiness across all of our business units that can drive margins a couple of 100 basis points one way or the other. So I wouldn't say, after one quarter that's sustained upside for industrial and\/or dilution for Government & Defense. Again as the business mix ebbs and flows, but I will note across all the businesses, Industrial, in particular, but Government Defense and Commercial as well, we're also working really hard with the FLIR Method to drive productivity.","And we've seen now well into 2019 that effort beginning to take effect. So whether it be some tariff headwinds that we've seen in the Commercial Business Unit or mix shifts or -- as we mentioned, some of the dilutive effect of the recent acquisitions. We've got a productivity engine that I'm real proud of right now that's beginning to fire. So, again as we go back to what we communicated at Investor Day and what we're guiding to in the year now, still very much in line with that direction.","Operator","Thank you. We reached the end for our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Jim Cannon","Well, again I want to thank all of you for joining the call today, as well as your interest in our company. As always I especially want to thank the over 4,000 FLIR employees across the globe for their continued passion and dedication to our customers. We look forward to updating you on our third quarter 2019 financial results in October. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference.

And we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","Let me now turn the call over to Andy Teich, President and CEO of FLIR Systems. Andy?","Andrew Teich","Thanks, Todd. And I want to welcome, everyone, to FLIR's first quarter 2016 earnings call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, Shane Harrison.","I'll start with a review of the quarter with slide three of the presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $379 million, up 10% from the prior year and up 12% on a constant currency basis. Commercial product revenues grew 4% over the first quarter of 2015, while government product revenues grew 20%.","Earnings per share were $0.01, which were negatively affected by a $40-million charge to establish reserves booked in the quarter, primarily related to an excess profit ruling dispute between Belgium and the European Commission, which Amit will discuss in more detail. Excluding these charges, earnings were $0.30 per share, which compares with $0.34 per share in the prior year.","First quarter operating income was $57 million compared to $66 million in the prior year. As we mentioned in our outlook commentary last quarter, the first quarter of 2015 proved to be a difficult comparable, as it was a quarter that had lower than normal corporate costs as well as our strongest gross margins in the past three years due to foreign exchange and a strong Surveillance product mix.","Bookings of $379 million were the highest first quarter order intake we've seen in over five years. Backlog continues to grow, reaching $613 million, which is the highest level since 2008. Surveillance segment bookings grew 50% over the prior year, driven by strong international orders.","We introduced several new products since our last call, including the new Boson thermal camera core. This innovative new core is priced and has performance above our Lepton micro camera core and it features powerful onboard processing capabilities enabled by a programmable Movidius Vision Processing Unit.","Boson features our latest 12-micron pixel design and is offered in VGA and QVGA resolutions with 15 different field of view options to choose from, each of which use internally produced optical components. Boson's revolutionary size, weight, and onboard processing power will open up new applications and uses for our technology given its versatility and low-power consumption.","On the Lepton front, we've been successfully integrated into two new OEM product platforms during the quarter. First was the announcement of the ruggedized Cat branded smartphone that will feature thermal imaging and a FLIR app that will provide building professional, electricians, and first responders the ability to measure surface temperature from a distance, identify mechanical and electrical problems, spot moisture and missing insulation, see in total darkness or see through smoke.","Second was the Scott Sight, hands-free thermal imaging system from Scott Safety, which is the first head-mounted thermal imaging system to have a micro display integrated inside the SCBA mask. Both of these products take full advantage of Lepton's industry-leading size, weight, power and cost capabilities. Also, on the firefighting front, we introduced five new FLIR branded firefighting solutions at the FDIC show last week. We continue to see strong market share gains in the fire market.","On slide four, you'll see our updated outlook for 2016. We continue to expect revenue to come in between $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion and EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70 for the full year, excluding the impact of the tax reserve booked in Q1. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 9% when compared to 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.","Given product margin expectations for specific programs in Surveillance, consolidated gross margins in the second quarter are expected to remain near Q1 levels. These programs are winding down. And thus Surveillance segment as well as consolidated margins should improve in the second half of the year. We intend to be diligent in absorbing gross margin softness through operating cost management. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share which will be payable on June 3 to shareholders of record as of May 20.","I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review the first quarter financial results. Amit?","Amit Singhi","Thanks, Andy. On slide five, you'll see our first quarter financial results. First quarter consolidated revenue was $379.5 million, an increase of 10% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Currency continued to negatively impact the top-line and particularly for the Instruments and Maritime segments, but to a lesser degree than we have experienced in prior quarters.","Excluding the impact of currency changes, revenue would have been up about 12% compared to prior year. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the Detection, Security, OEM & Emerging, and Surveillance segments increasing 61%, 21%, 20% and 10%, respectively.","Maritime revenues improved 1%, while Instruments experienced a 5% decline, driven primarily by softness in the mid-range of the Building & Predictive Maintenance product lines. On a currency adjusted basis, Maritime revenues would be up 5% and Instruments down 3%.","Recently, revenue increased in all geographies, except Europe, led by 78% growth in Canada\/Latin America and 17% growth in the U.S. Sales to the U.S. government increased $32 million or 61% and represented 23% of total revenue compared to 15% in the first quarter of 2015.","Consolidated first quarter gross margin was 47%, a 4-percentage-point decline compared to last year, primarily driven by product and segment mix changes, manufacturing cost absorption, some inventory adjustments, competitive pressures in security retail channels, and non-recurrence of favorable exchange related gain from last year.","Operating expenses increased by $10 million or 9% year-over-year, primarily due to the addition of expenses related to the DVTEL business that we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015 and some corporate expense credits that were recognized in 2015 and did not repeat in 2016. Our operating margin fell from 19.1% in the first quarter of 2015 to 15.1% this year, primarily due to the decline in our gross margin.","Our tax expense in the first quarter was $54.5 million, which is based on an estimated annual effective tax rate of 26%, plus reserves for discrete tax items totaling $40 million. These reserves are primarily associated with the previously disclosed European Commission decision against the Belgian tax authority.","The Belgian government is currently appealing the decision. The final exposure to FLIR, if any, is subject to the result of the appeal, other related litigation and the determination of any additional deductions that we may be able to claim. The impact of these items have not been factored into our reserve. The company continues to comply with all tax laws. And we expect our 2016 effective tax rate to remain at approximately 26%, excluding any discrete tax items.","Net earnings for the first quarter of 2016 totaled $1.1 million or $0.01 per fully diluted share. Excluding the discrete tax items, adjusted net income in the first quarter was $41.2 million, down 14% from last year. And adjusted EPS was $0.30 compared to $0.34 in the first quarter of 2015.","We closed the first quarter with cash of $510.6 million, an increase of $37.8 million during the quarter, primarily driven by operating cash flow. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $44.9 million or 109% of net income, excluding the discrete tax items.","We had capital expenditures of $10 million in the first quarter and returned $16.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock during the quarter but we will continue to evaluate our opportunities to do so in subsequent quarters.","This concludes the summary of our first-quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?","Thomas Surran","Thank you, Amit. You will see a summary of our segment results on slide six. While revenue grew 10% during the quarter, first quarter consolidated segment operating income declined 5% as a result of higher operating expenses, primarily from the DVTEL acquisition, and lower product margins.","Moving to slide seven, during the first quarter, Surveillance segment revenue increased 10% year-over-year to $124.2 million. This growth was driven primarily by the Man Portable and Maritime product lines. Surveillance segment operating income of $35.2 million increased 17% versus the prior year, driven largely by reductions in operating expenses.","We expect Surveillance second quarter operating margins to be several points softer than the 28% seen in Q1 due to the mix of product deliveries we see in backlog. We do not expect this mix impact to continue throughout the balance of the year.","Surveillance backlog increased from the end of 2015 to $314 million. As Andy stated, bookings of $137 million were the highest level seen for the first quarter since the RAID and G-BOSS programs were active in the late 2000s. The first quarter book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x and the 50% year-over-year bookings growth were driven by demand from customers in the Middle East and Asia.","Turning to slide eight, Instruments segment revenue declined 5% or 3% on a constant currency basis compared to the first quarter of 2015. Revenue of $79.4 million was negatively impacted by increased backlog during the quarter in comparison to a backlog reduction in Q1 of the prior year. In addition, we have not yet seen the recovery in the high-end Building & Preventive Maintenance offerings, which come from the recently introduced premium T1K product.","We're currently developing new products to bolster our mid-range Building & Preventive Maintenance offerings, which were also softer in the quarter. The volume products in our BPM and Building lines that were introduced over the last few years continue to do well during the quarter, as did our OGI fire automation and science product lines.","Instruments operating margin was 25%, a decline compared to the first quarter of 2015 as a result of increased operating expenses and higher production costs. Actions are being taken to return the segment's operating margin to its historic levels in the upper 20%s range.","Last week at the FDIC tradeshow, Instruments introduced five new products for the firefighting industry. The FLIR K33 and K53 are handheld TICs which offer the firefighter the simplicity of a single button operation, but also provide four-inch displays and FLIR's FSX technology. The KF6 is the first thermal camera designed for mounting on fire engine ladders to provide better tactical awareness in directing firefighter activities.","FLIR also introduced two versions of its Aerial Responder Kit which provides firefighters and first responders a ready-to-fly drone-based system, with powerful thermal imaging capabilities, enabling users to be able to assess a scene from an aerial perspective.","On slide nine is our Security segment results. Revenue of $47.1 million was up 21% year-over-year. Visible spectrum products grew nearly 40%, but were partially offset by a year-over-year decline in our high-end, high-margin thermal product deliveries. Thermal products are often sold into large installation projects that do not occur on a regular cadence which can cause lumpy thermal product revenue.","Security operating profitability fell to a loss in the quarter due to gross margins pressure associated with price reductions for certain slower moving Lorex product inventory, product mix shift to lower margin consumer offerings, and higher operating expenses, primarily from the acquisition of DVTEL. The DVTEL integration is ramping at a measured pace, but we intend to realize meaningful synergies in the coming quarters.","The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on slide 10. OEM & Emerging first quarter revenue was up 20% over last year to $47.8 million. Growth was broad across the product line with particular strength in Uncooled Cores, FLIR ONE and the new FLIR Vue drone compatible camera product line. OEM & Emerging operating profit was $10 million in the quarter with margins largely in line with the prior year.","In April, OEM & Emerging announced Boson, an important addition to its Uncooled Core family of products. The powerful yet tiny Boson will provide a smaller, less power consuming and highly advanced thermal camera core to both our OEM customers as well as our internal teams. Boson's use of an advanced system-on-a-chip vector processor enables the FLIR XIR video processing algorithms for highly enhanced image quality with low-power consumption.","The Boson's internal processing capabilities are expendable. So customers can add software and algorithms suitable for their specific needs. Since the end of last year, OEM & Emerging has added two significant new customers for its Lepton core, each with a particularly interesting thermal-enabled value proposition to their end-users. The Bullitt Group announced the CAT S60 ruggedized smartphone for the industrial and trade professionals that features thermal imaging capability to empower these customers with the ability to preemptively identify jobsite issues before they become significant problems.","And in April, Scott Safety announced the integration of Lepton into an SCBA face mask for firefighters enabling firefighters to see through smoke and find hotspots in a fully integrated and hands-free way. Also, during the first quarter, OEM & Emerging Intelligent Traffic (sic) [Transportation] (17:43) Systems business introduced the Lepton-based TrafiOne, the first thermal traffic camera featuring Wi-Fi tracking technology to provide traffic engineers with a differentiated, highly reliable solution to detect vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians in an urban environment.","Turning to slide 12, Maritime segment revenue was $51.7 million, growing 1% over the prior year or 5% on a constant currency basis. Maritime operating income was $5 million in the quarter, up 4% over the prior year. In February, Raymarine introduced the Dragonfly 7 PRO, the seven-inch version of the award-winning Dragonfly 5. The 7 PRO utilizes DownVision Sonar with wide spectrum CHIRP multi-frequency transmission technology, which creates photo-like underwater sonar imagery.","On slide 13, you will see the Detection segment's first quarter summary. Revenue was up 61% year-over-year to $29.3 million. Growth was seen across all Detection product lines with the DR SKO program growing significantly over the prior year due to the timing of shipments. The revenue increase, a slightly higher gross margins and a nearly unchanged level of operating expense drove Detection operating profit growth of 200% over the prior year. Detection backlog finished the year at $97 million, an increase of $15 million from the end of 2015.","That concludes my summary of the segments' first quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy.","Andrew Teich","Thanks, Tom. We're pleased with the strong bookings growth and resulting year-over-year backlog growth of 10%. While revenues met our expectation for 10% growth, profit margins did not. Gross margins were impacted by a number of factors that we feel are temporary.","Operating expense controls were not fully effective in making up the gross margin softness. We expect gross margins to return to the 48% to 50% range in the second half of the year. And we intend to focus on operating costs as we navigate through the year. As demonstrated by the product launches discussed this morning, the innovation engine within the company is strong. This is driving a continued progression in the expansion of military, commercial, and consumer markets.","We're now fully integrated into our first smartphone, which has been a long-term objective to increase overall volume, build awareness and increase adoption. We continue to innovate across all sensor performance tiers as shown with the evolving versions of Lepton and now the introduction of the revolutionary new Boson camera core. We've already begun developing next-generation FLIR branded products based on this advanced sensor.","That concludes our comments on the first quarter. We'll now ask the operator to open up the call for any of your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Noah Poponak","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Andrew Teich","Good morning.","Thomas Surran","Good morning.","Noah Poponak","I think you said \u2013 correct me if I'm wrong \u2013 Surveillance and consolidated gross margin both about flat sequentially in the second quarter. And then I think you said Surveillance segment EBIT margin down a few hundred basis point sequentially in the second quarter. Could you kind of, I guess, fill in the blank and tell us where you see the consolidated segment EBIT margin heading directionally sequentially in the second quarter?","Amit Singhi","Yes. So, the overall \u2013 this is Amit Singhi. The overall softness, as we said, given the overall Surveillance business and the mix that we see in the second quarter, the margins are going to be a bit softer in Surveillance. Overall, as a company, we believe that we would be about in line with where we are on the gross margins in the second quarter. But the operating margin we will see an uptick from where we were in the first quarter.","Noah Poponak","Okay. I guess if I remember correctly last quarter, you were pointing to roughly flattish full year 2016 versus 2015 consolidated segment margins. Is that still in play or are margins trending too much below what you originally thought to get to that?","Amit Singhi","Right now we're still bullish on the second half, Noah. So we think it's generally in that range. As you know, some of this can skew a bit by shipments and product mix in a specific quarter. But, right now, we're still consistent with where we expected it to be. As you may recall, we had guided to a softer first quarter. Some of that is going to continue in the second quarter but the second half we believe would be stronger. So, overall, for the full year, we'll be still in line with where we thought we would be.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And then, lastly, on margins, just \u2013 if I didn't know anything about the details of the quarter and I just saw the volume number, it's one of the better volume growth numbers you've had in a while. Typically, FLIR is a company with pretty good operating leverage on positive volume growth surprises. It sort of begs the question, are you pricing down mix-wise? And do investors need to be concerned that a lot of the new product introductions, especially things that are smaller core, are moving down the pricing spectrum? Are we facing this sort of margin dilution impact several more quarters going forward?","Andrew Teich","Yeah. Noah, this is Andy. A couple of things on that. The first, at the top level, at the pricing level, there really haven't been pricing effects here. So what you're seeing here is not an effect of aggressive discounting to get sales to happen. There are some price effects in the Security segment where we're facing stronger competition there, but it's a small piece of the puzzle.","To your point about what's happening with new products, as we introduce new products, those products fully support the long-term gross margin objectives of the company. And I don't have a concern around that. The area where we see margin challenges are primarily in the Surveillance segment where we have some larger programs that were booked some time ago that are nearing their conclusion.","And these are programs like the MSC program for the U.S. Border Patrol and the PB-EOS program for the Coast Guard. And these are programs that were bid pretty aggressively early in the product development cycle and, as a result, have lower than corporate average margins and they pull down the overall margins particularly of that segment.","The good news about that strategy though is it establishes credibility for those products and allows us to sell those products much more effectively in international markets, having the backing of major U.S. users behind them. And in those specific situations where we're selling them internationally, they fully support the corporate overall gross margin objectives.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ben Hearnsberger with Stephens. Please state your question.","Ben Hearnsberger","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start in Instruments. Specifically why you think you're seeing some softness in your mid-range products? I guess how would you attribute the softness here? Is it more Lepton cannibalization or is it just generally kind of a softer industrial environment?","Andrew Teich","Yeah. Ben, this is Andy again. A couple of things on that. The first issue is, is that mid-range of our product value ladder; those are actually some of the oldest products that we have in our product value ladder. So, from a product development standpoint, we've been very focused on the low-end. We had tremendous success there. The C2 has been the hugely successful product for us following on the heels of our Ex product range. And also the IGM test & measurement products that we have introduced \u2013 and those are the traditional test & measurement products that have Lepton injected into them \u2013 have been doing extremely well in the market. So, we've got a very solid lower end as part of our Control the Corners strategy.","On the other end of the spectrum \u2013 and again to our Control the Corners strategy \u2013 we launched our T1K product. That's a product that's just getting traction now. When you have a premium product like that that is typically a product that's involved in a replacement cycle of capital equipment, the adoption rate of products like that tends to take longer than one would expect because it is capital allocation type of budgeting process that's required to purchase that product given its price point. But we're seeing that start to get traction.","The mid-range of the segment, which is our Exx Series and our Txxx Series, those are products that are the oldest of the product portfolio. They are due for a refresh at this point. They are still quite competitive in the market. But I think you look at the feature set that are coming in advanced new products like the C2 and then the T1K at the other end of the spectrum, it's quite attractive to customers and we'll blend those feature sets and capabilities into that mid-range product. Those products are under development now and are expected to be out within the next six months to 12 months and they will re-bolster that midsection.","We also expect that to go somewhat hand-in-hand with the large number of systems and users that we brought into the fold. That those lower end products are likely to be candidates for people who are going to want to upgrade to higher performance units after they've been using a product like the C2 or an IGM product for a year. So we've had a very good track record of moving people up the value ladder after they see the value proposition that comes from thermal imaging.","Ben Hearnsberger","Okay. And is it too early to tell on kind of that upgrade cycle and how long it will take to play out?","Andrew Teich","Well, we've had a lot of experience with it. I think it's a little bit difficult to predict from a timing perspective. But I would say, from an efficacy perspective, we have had a very strong track record of moving existing customers into new product platforms through a combination of marketing and communication and, of course, offering a better value proposition in the subsequent product to make their jobs easier, the data more easy to interpret, imaging performance better and so forth.","Ben Hearnsberger","Okay. That's helpful. And I've got a couple of modeling questions here for Amit. Can you call out the amount of the inventory adjustment in Instruments and how much that impacted margins in the segment?","Amit Singhi","That is a level of detail we don't get into specifically.","Ben Hearnsberger","Okay. Maybe one on Security on integration expenses. I doubt you'll call them out, but can you give us a sense for when those start to flow?","Amit Singhi","What we talked about was primarily around just the inclusion of those expenses that were not in the comparable quarter last year, right. There are integration expenses, but the big piece of this was just the inclusion of the absolutes that were not in the comparison quarter last year.","Ben Hearnsberger","Understood. Understood. So there is nothing really one-time that you would call out?","Amit Singhi","No.","Ben Hearnsberger","Understood.","Amit Singhi","There are some, but they are not significant.","Ben Hearnsberger","Right.","Andrew Teich","Ben, I think \u2013 this is Andy again. I think the more important thing to think about in the integration effort on DVTEL is that \u2013 and I've seen this happen with a lot of companies that we've acquired. When you acquire a business like that, you bring in different sales leadership. There tends to be a big focus on what am I doing, what are my job descriptions and so forth, people getting aligned on their functions and territorial assignments. And then we also spend a fair amount of time in training, cross-training between the two sales teams, so they can get out there and sell that full suite of products. And, obviously, that takes time and is a distraction from day-to-day business. So, we saw a little bit of headwind effect associated with that.","That said, that effort is going well. The products from a brand standpoint have been well integrated at this point and are represented on the website as such. And from a technical standpoint, the compatibility links that were necessary between the FLIR professional and thermal visible products and the DVTEL Video Management Systems have all been put in place and tested at this point. So, we're ready to hit the street running at this point with an integrated solution which is part of the vision on the integration of that business.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please state your question.","Jim Ricchiuti","Thank you. Yes. I guess a follow-up to the prior question. If we think about the margins and impact in the Security business, was integration expense that the biggest factor? I mean there were clearly a couple of other moving parts. I mean was Lorex a major drag on gross margins overall? And I assume it was also a function of the lower thermal. I'm just trying to get a sense as to what the bigger impacts were and how we should think about that going forward? Thanks.","Thomas Surran","Yes, Jim, you're right pretty much where you were saying and speculating. And that's true is that we had some pretty good success with the Lorex offerings in terms of the overall volume. And it was at the time when, as Andy mentioned, a bit of distraction in the integration of the thermal team with the DVTEL team and we had a bit lower on the thermal side. So we saw a mix shift to the consumer offering. So that was one impact. We also did have some one-time events related to moving some of the slower moving inventory that we saw in the channel in the Lorex and we wanted to deal with it early in the product lifecycle rather than waiting till later when it could become a much larger issue. So we dealt with it. It's been done. And so that was kind of a one-time piece. So, those two were the major pieces that impacted the gross margin in Security.","Jim Ricchiuti","So, going forward, you would assume that we're going to see \u2013 it sounds like we're going to see some improvement just on the two factors that you cited going forward?","Thomas Surran","Yes. That would be a fair statement.","Andrew Teich","Yes. That's correct. Jim, the other issue that's a pretty big factor in the Security margins is what the percentage of thermal is. And, here, we also had kind of a tough comp relative to last year. The number of cooled cameras that we sold in the Security segment in Q1 was down rather significantly versus Q1 of 2015. And that's a business that tends to be kind of lumpy because you're going after either large infrastructure or enterprise class customers. And they can be a bit lumpy.","And when those projects do have a high concentration of cooled thermal cameras, there's a lot of margin in those. We did see growth in our uncooled thermal cameras during the quarter. But it was not enough to offset the fairly significant decline as a result of the lumpiness of the cooled camera business. We think that the prospect though over the rest of the year for the thermal business is quite good.","The value proposition there is still quite strong. And we continue to introduce new products in that space. And it really is a key thesis of the success of that business, is to be successful in thermal and continue to drive thermal. And that's bolstered now by having the integration of a full Video Management System in our 360 C2 Surveillance platform. The integration of those three things offers a much more turnkey solution for customers that are doing large scale perimeter security applications.","Jim Ricchiuti","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please state your question.","Asher Carey","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Asher Carey on the line for Peter.","Andrew Teich","Morning.","Asher Carey","I have a question on Detection actually. The DR SKO program \u2013 I know it contracts out through May 2017 with the DoD. Because that's a meaningful part of the revenues for Detection, how should we think about the future opportunities? Like is there any runway beyond the first quarter of 2017 or is that revenue that will have to be made up?","Thomas Surran","Yes. Asher, is it?","Asher Carey","Yeah.","Thomas Surran","Yeah. So, yeah, the DR SKO program \u2013 obviously, they have what's currently led in terms of the contracts and what's in the budget. Then all of a sudden there is the expected program life, which we see going up to 2019. And then there's the replacement. The need of the DR SKO offering solutions doesn't go away in 2019. And so we would expect derivatives or next-generation offerings to continue to be developed and supplied to the customers.","Asher Carey","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.","Andrew Teich","Good morning.","Michael Ciarmoli","Andy, maybe back to the margin question. I know I think you said you have no real concern about gross margins and the fact that they've trended down. But the reality is we continue to see these margins trend down. I mean as you guys think about it, you've made a decidedly, I guess, more aggressive effort to put out lower cost products, tap in the consumer market with Lorex. I mean should we be thinking about structurally lower margins going forward? I mean I know it sounds like you guys are designing products with these 48% to 50% gross margins in mind. But if we're going to have to start dealing with standard maybe retail issues, inventory in the channel, discounting, I mean, is this something we should just get used to?","Andrew Teich","Well, I think, it's a function of the mix of the business, Michael. We see the gross margins manifest themselves lower when we have a segment like Surveillance which is normally pulling the overall margins up, margins that are below our target average. And, again, that happens when we have strong deliveries into a program, typically a US program, a record type program where we have lower than normal gross margin. So that's something that we're watching very closely. We continue to have the ability to bring in new business. The book-and-bill business, the international business that we bring into the Surveillance has margins that are well above the average margin for the quarter, so these things offset each other.","You're correct that when we integrate businesses like Security or Raymarine that have inherently lower gross margins and those businesses represent the larger percentage of total for FLIR that it can pull down the overall gross and operating margins for the business. And I think that's something though that we can see coming from a fair way off. And in each of those businesses, we continue to make sure that we have products within those businesses, the thermal content products within those businesses that generate higher gross margins that help to bring up the overall gross margins of that business and offset the lower margins associated with the consumer and retail aspects of those business. I'd say a prime example is, is in the security space where we acquired DVTEL. We've integrated our 360 Surveillance business. Those are two software-oriented businesses that can support much higher gross margins that will help to bring up the overall gross margin levels for the Security business.","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay. And even on your \u2013 you had a good bookings quarter, Surveillance. Is there anything in those bookings? I mean, are those \u2013 you talk about mix of deliveries next quarter bringing Surveillance margins down. Is there anything in the business you've been looking lately that has lower margin or something that we should anticipate that going forward in the Surveillance segment?","Andrew Teich","No. We've actually done an analysis of the margin and backlog in Surveillance. And it looks solid. It's in line with our expectations. I think probably more what the wildcard is in Surveillance is what does the book-and-bill margin look like. And typically the book-and-bill margin looks good. And, again, we've said Q2 Surveillance margins will be down again as a result of us wrapping up a couple of programs that we've got in there. There are still three programs that are ongoing that have lower than average gross margins. And these are programs that have been around for quite some time that are just in the high cadence delivery phase right now. And we've got to run those through the system and they're going to pull over our gross margins down. I do want to underscore though the strong benefit that comes from programs like that because of the credibility that comes from being on these rather significant U.S. platforms. It really drives very strong credibility for those same products in international markets.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please state your question.","Jonathan Ho","Good morning. I just wanted to start out \u2013 particularly given the outperformance in the full year and the fact that you guys left the revenue guidance range roughly the same, is there any sort of seasonality shift we should be aware of in terms of the revenue pattern or anything that was potentially pulled forward into 1Q?","Andrew Teich","So, yes, Jonathan. We saw strong bookings in Q1 in both Surveillance business and in the Detection business. And it's possible that there may be some pull forward from Q2 in those bookings that we have. The business is still a bit challenging to forecast in that space. And we've now seen a couple of back-to-back very strong quarters in terms of overall bookings growth. I think Q4 was up 26% in Surveillance and Q1 was up to 50% in bookings. And we're very pleased to see that but the visibility is still a bit challenging on that front. The overall feel from the market is good. It seems like more frequently than not we've got new requirements that are coming in that weren't identified clearly in our forecast.","And I've been in that space before in my career and it's a good indication that demand is increasing. And, of course, it's very much in line with how we operate as a company. Our CDMQ model affords us the ability to be very responsive in a short period of time to urgent needs. And we're seeing more of that urgent need requirement. So, as a result of that, I think, we're being conservative in terms of how we're looking at what the bookings look like for Q2 for Surveillance if there was a significant pull forward from Q2 into Q1, but I would also say that there's potentially upside in that regard.","Jonathan Ho","Got it. That's helpful. And then just as a follow-up. As we look at some of the new products that you've talked about on the firefighting side with Cadillac, how should we think about, I guess, the expected revenue that's going to come from these products? Is there a meaningful ramp that we should be looking for or some type of acceleration and maybe what quarters those could fall into?","Andrew Teich","Sure. Well, starting with the firefighting space, I mean this is an area where I mentioned in the prepared comments that we feel that we're doing quite well from a market share gain standpoint. And we're building on that success through the launch of five new products that were launched at FDIC, so those two new handheld products, one new dedicated product that mounts off the top of a ladder \u2013 truck ladder for aerial surveillance and two DJI drone-based products for drone-based aerial surveillance for firefighters which is becoming increasingly popular tool to have at a fire scene. I think this is part of our strategy. It's one of our key six strategic pillars to identify and attack new viable markets. And firefighting is one that \u2013 the market has been around for a while. The value proposition of thermal is incredibly strong there.","We have a strong capability to create products and to innovate new products. And what we're doing here is not only building the value ladder of handheld products to have not only the most attractive opening price point all the way through the upper corner to a very attractive and well-priced NFPA system with our A65, but also to inject a couple of easy to use products in that and expand the overall product category by solving other problems that we're learning from firefighters which really come around we need to get an aerial view of what's going on at a fire scene. And that can be done from a ladder and from a UAV. So we feel that we should see that fire segment's growth bolstered by the expansion of new applications within that segment. And that's been a key strategy for us as we work to offset some of the softness that we're seeing in the mid-range of the product line in Instruments.","Jonathan Ho","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please state your question.","Jeffrey Kessler","Thank you. One of the \u2013 can you hear me?","Andrew Teich","Yes, we can. Go ahead, Jeff.","Jeffrey Kessler","Thank you. One of the wildcards that's still sitting out there that has not produced big revenue yet is the OEM area. And I'm wondering, without going into specifics, which I am sure you won't, can you give us some broad-based areas in which OEM is being at least tested or beta tested or proof-of-concepted at this point in time, areas that may be of interest to us in a year or two years.","Andrew Teich","Sure, Jeff. I'll talk about three things there. First, we talked about in the prepared comments the two new OEMs that we've established with Lepton, one being the CAT phone and the second being the Scott Sight. Both of those are completely new applications. I don't see those as being cannibalizing. They offer completely new capabilities to those two OEMs. And I think that they will generate significant interest with other players in that market. So, clearly, the launch of the CAT S60 phone has got a number of other smartphone manufacturers looking at that.","And when that product gets launched and starts getting traction later this summer, we think that there will be other parties that are going to be serious about looking at that capability for inclusion into their devices as well. And similarly, when you look at firefighting and SCBA is one of the most common pieces of the turnout gear. And integrating a thermal imager directly into an SCBA offers a hands-free capability that a lot of firefighters have been looking for. So we think that that product concept is going to do well.","Two other areas that I'll mention, one is the introduction of Boson. So we've got a completely new core here, a core that has a very powerful system-on-a-chip vector processor embedded in it that can host a number of different image improvement algorithms, automatic detection, artificial intelligence algorithms. And it's a system-on-a-chip that also supports all the typical peripherals that you have in a handheld system display, battery control, USB, memory, those user interface, those kinds of things.","So that will make it easier for people to create products around that core and I think should drive future business for the OEM group. Also, the fact that that core is available with 15 different fields of views and two different resolutions gives a lot of flexibility to system developers. And then the last thing that I'll mention is we continue to get traction in the OEM space with automotive. We've got \u2013 Cadillac has just begun shipping units with CT6. And it seems like it's getting good response. And we continue to have other auto manufacturers in the hopper there. So it's been a slow go, getting traction with night vision, but it's one that is gaining steam in terms of its adoption rates.","Jeffrey Kessler","Is this with the same VaR or with a different one?","Andrew Teich","This is still with Autoliv. So -","Jeffrey Kessler","Okay. My follow-up question is given that you've had some very good growth in revenue and in product sales in areas like Security, areas like Detection where the margins may be a little bit lower in spots, nevertheless, those products that you've been selling, particularly when it comes to Security, how much bleed over do you think those products are going to have as a beneficiary to other segments in the business given that there is a lot of R&D and a lot of obviously \u2013 and a lot of development that has to go into integrating DVTEL Video Management System, analytics and other types of the storage with the types of products that you have in Security? Some of that is applicable to the other areas and the other divisions that you have.","Andrew Teich","Yeah. That's absolutely correct, Jeff, and it's really a big part of the strategy within the company, is to leverage developments across the segments. And, frankly, things like the Security segment with its cloud services that are being developed with the video analytics capability, with the mapping capability that's coming out of 360 Surveillance, those capabilities are applicable into other businesses, into Maritime, into Instruments, into Surveillance and we're actively doing that. Also, the development of the Boson core with its embedded vector processor, vision processor that is inside that unit, we can develop algorithms for that for video analytics and artificial intelligence that can be applied across multiple segments within FLIR.","And that is something that we've got a team that is solely focused on that. It's been a long-term vision here at FLIR. It was part of the reason that we bought Traficon. We also got additional video analytics capability with the acquisition of DVTEL with the former ioi image assets there. And it's still early days in terms of what we will be showing from a video analytics standpoint, but we believe that the broad spectrum of products being offered in Surveillance, Instruments, Maritime, Security, and even Detection can benefit from those enhanced capabilities that will run on board this low-power core.","Jeffrey Kessler","So, at some point in the future, we may be seeing a Traficon\/ioi booth or adjunct to one of your tradeshows?","Andrew Teich","Yeah, exactly. In fact, part of the integration efforts that are going on with DVTEL are integrating the video analytics teams between those two groups.","Jeffrey Kessler","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Andrew Teich","Pleasure.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Noah Poponak","Hey. Just had a few follow-ups. The 20% government products growth, was that entirely organic or not?","Andrew Teich","It was entirely organic. Yes.","Noah Poponak","And can you talk about that by, I guess, anything that stood out by geography or by government agency?","Andrew Teich","Yes, just a moment, Noah. As we looked at, the skew was much stronger towards U.S. DoD. If you looked at the revenue for the quarter, there was a much stronger skew towards DoD versus federal and state law enforcement. So from a revenue standpoint, during the quarter, the DoD total was up a little over 50%. And this is \u2013 I'm talking about total. If I look just within Surveillance, the DoD business grew faster than the other business in the quarter. We find that there is some shift typically back and forth between DoD customers and typical three letter agency customers. And we had a particularly strong quarter for total DoD business from a revenue perspective during Q1. And that can move around a little bit.","Noah Poponak","And, sorry, is the 20% a U.S. number or a global number?","Andrew Teich","I think what you're talking about there is the difference between the total U.S. government bookings year-over-year. Is that what you're referring to, the 20%?","Noah Poponak","I'm just trying to get an understanding for \u2013 in addition to the numbers you just gave me on U.S. and on DoD, what happened internationally in the government business or if it's specific to Surveillance?","Andrew Teich","Yeah. So the government products revenue of plus 20%, I think, is U.S.","Thomas Surran","Yeah. That's 22% for total business.","Andrew Teich","Yeah.","Noah Poponak","Middle East specifically, there has just been a lot of concern there given the oil price. Can you -","Andrew Teich","Hey. Noah, I want to go back to that. The government products revenue increase of 20% is the total government products. It's not U.S. only.","Noah Poponak","Okay.","Andrew Teich","So we have \u2013 those first two bullet points on slide number three have shown historical growth rate averages of our commercial versus government businesses. And that 20% growth that you see shown in the government business was largely driven by DR SKO.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Any ability to talk about -","Andrew Teich","I thought you were talking about the U.S. content.","Noah Poponak","And then any ability to talk about what international government did in the quarter and, specifically, if there was any \u2013 specifically here is what you saw in your Middle East revenues?","Andrew Teich","Hang on just a moment, take a look at that. The Middle East \u2013 I mean primarily when you're talking about the government for the most part, that would be in our Surveillance business. And that business had relatively small growth, but fairly strong business. So, although the growth wasn't large, it was still a healthy quarter. Even if you deal with it overall, we had about 4% Middle East growth.","Noah Poponak","Okay. And then if I could just ask about the balance sheet and the cash flow statement a little bit. You guys have, I think, talked about the M&A pipeline being pretty full, but you haven't done a ton. The net cash position increased sequentially again. So, I guess, what's next from here with the balance sheet?","Amit Singhi","So, Noah, as you know, we continue to look at M&A opportunities. And there are several in the pipeline. We're not at a point where we're ready to announce anything at this point. The other piece, as you probably are aware, we have debt that is coming due this summer. So, in terms of the balance sheet, we will be looking to refinance our notes that are coming due. And when we do that, we would be looking at overall our complete debt profile, including the credit lines and the revolver that we have, just given the overall conditions in the market and being opportunistic in terms of what's available out there with relatively low interest rates. But, again, we're not ready to announce specifically what we're going to do, but that's something that's going to come in the second quarter.","Noah Poponak","Is there anything specific that's holding up acquisitions from getting across the finish line? Just kind of scrolling through my notes here I wrote down a couple quarters ago you guys saying that the pipeline was potentially more full than ever. What's holding things up from getting done?","Shane Harrison","Noah, it's Shane. The thing that's really been holding up lately is sellers' expectations of what they think their company is worth really. And we've seen some slowdown in some of those targets as far as getting to close to the finish line in a couple of examples where we got an update as far as performance. And it just wasn't making the model work anymore. So we did walk away from a deal or two here recently. And it's largely because of exactly that slowdown in the business itself that we're looking at. But the pipeline still is quite rich. We're still looking at a lot of things but that's the specifics to closing the last couple of things that we've been looking at.","Amit Singhi","And, Noah, this is Amit, just one more follow-up to the cash build-up. The other thing, as we pointed out, right, we did not do any share buybacks in the quarter. Again, because we look at all our investments to make sure that they are the right business decision and just given the share price and where we were at, it was just not the right time to buy. So that was the other reason why that use of cash was not there in the quarter.","Noah Poponak","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the conference over back to Andy Teich for closing remarks. Thank you.","Andrew Teich","Thank you all for joining us on the call today. Before we close, I'd like to note that Dave Muessle will be retiring from his role as Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer early next month. I'd like to thank Dave for his more than 16 years of outstanding support and dedicated service to the company.","Dave will be replaced by Brian Harding, who is currently our Vice President of Corporate Finance and Accounting. Brian will formally start in his new role on May 6. Dave, we wish you all the best as you transition into retirement. And, Brian, we welcome you to your new role.","I'd also like to thank the more than 3,000 FLIR employees around the world for their continued dedication and innovative spirit, as we pursue our goal of becoming the world's success.

Earl?","Earl R. Lewis","Thanks, Wit. And good morning, everyone, and thank you all for joining us today. As we anticipated, our first quarter 2012 financial results were soft. Revenue for the quarter was impacted by lower sales to the U.S. government as well as in Europe and in the Middle East. While our top line continues to be impacted by governmental budget and economic uncertainty, we were able to maintain overall gross and operating margins at levels very close to our first quarter 2011. We maintained a healthy level of R&D investment of 10.5% of revenue as we focused our development efforts on some exciting opportunities that we feel will yield growth and profitability long into our future.","Selling, general administrative expenses declined by 6% compared to last year as we worked to gain efficiencies and optimize our sales activities. When we met last November at our annual analyst investor day, I mentioned that we are focused on producing instruments that provide people with valuable information, and that have an established -- and that we have an established model that allow us to produce them at lower costs. The strategy is still very much intact, and I am convinced it will not only help us grow and provide value to our shareholders but will also improve the world around us by saving energy and protecting people. We've only scratched the surface of beginning -- bringing these technologies to the world. Because of that, I'm excited today to be where we are.","We'll now let Bill and Andy talk, we will start with Andy and the Commercial business.","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Earl. The Commercial Systems division finished the first quarter with revenue of $202.3 million, growth of 4% over the first quarter of 2011. Overall division operating margin was 21.3%. Our TVM segment grew revenue at 7% over the prior year reaching $155.7 million. While revenue growth was slowed by lower end -- by lower high-end Thermography, security and Cores sales, unit growth of the TVM cameras and systems were strong at 34%.","Raymarine revenue for the first quarter was $46.6 million and the operating margin was 8.2%. Raymarine saw a good growth in the U.S. and Raymarine new products are being well received. But while we increase the number of OEMs in Europe, their volumes have been down, which has weighed down our international results.","Turning to our bookings for the quarter. TVM segment bookings dollars declined 4% versus the prior year. This decline was driven largely by the European and APAC regions while bookings in the Americas improves compared to last year.","From a product line perspective, worldwide orders for our premium Thermography cameras, those with price points typically above $20,000, declined over 20% compared to Q1 2011, while our lower-priced and new E-Series and automation products performed very well.","Course and Components bookings increased in units by nearly 60% but declined on a bookings dollars basis due in part to fewer high-end cooled products. The growth in units booked during the quarter illustrates continued progress in growing volume, particularly in the uncooled segment.","Security bookings grew rapidly with dollar bookings up over 25% and unit bookings up 230%. Emerging markets such as critical infrastructure protection and commercial security has driven volume growth in our uncooled security products. We are also seeing expansion in the adoption of high-end cooled security products for mostly border protection solutions towards a more diverse set of customers and applications that protect infrastructure such as bridges, dams, power facilities and other high-value assets.","Our FLIR branded maritime products saw a 30% increase in bookings in the Americas, but the EMEA and APAC regions slowed compared to a strong comp from last year.","Once again, our Personal Vision Systems business grew significantly over the prior year with bookings dollars up over 70%. A significant aspect of this business is its focus on consumer applications and retail distribution and, interestingly, the areas of significant strength for PVS in Q1 were the international markets, where our strong channel development over the last 18 months has delivered a trend that is contrasting we've been seeing in many of our other businesses. In fact, our EMEA region booked more dollars during this first quarter than our America region, which is the first since we've introduced this new line of PVS products.","Turning now to Raymarine. We saw first quarter bookings dollars decline by 1% versus the first quarter of 2011 with weakness in the EMEA and APAC regions. Given the weakness in the European boat sales and the fact that the Raymarine EMEA region is more heavily skewed towards the OEM market, a decline in that region was not unexpected.","The Americas regions largely offset these declines with over 20% growth in bookings dollars this quarter compared to the first quarter of last year. We introduced some new products in February, including the larger format E and C-Series color multifunction displays, a broadband CHIRP depth sounder and a new line of high definition color radars. With these and other releases, coupled with the improved operational structure of the business, we're optimistic on the outlook for Raymarine for the rest of the year.","We see the expanding adoption of thermal technology every day as demonstrated by our focus on creating new applications in, and the relatively quick adoption rates of, non-border security, automated temperature monitoring and outdoor recreation. As an example, we recently induced the combination thermography and surveillance pan-tilt products called the A310PT that enables temperature measurement and security of high-value electrical substations. This product has garnered the attention of some large utilities, and we've booked over 100 units to date.","Continuing on the new product front, we also introduced the next generation of our popular I-series line of volume Thermography cameras and are excited to see the market response to the new look, feel and functionality of these cameras. We also recently introduced the T420 and T440 professional grade Thermography cameras, which include our new patent pending multispectral dynamic imaging algorithm, that applies high fidelity details from a visible image to a corresponding thermal image in a way that improves the depth and texture of the thermal image and gives the user the ability to do much more with an image such as read text, signs and equipment labels normally not visible in the infrared spectrum. This technology, which we have branded MSX, is one of the important breakthroughs I have seen in my nearly 30 years in the thermal imaging industry.","Organizationally, the CS division continues to rationalize the benefits of combining our former CVS and Thermography segments into 1 PVM segment. At the begin of this year, we've made some adjustments to our U.S. and APAC sales organizations that we hope will mirror the improvements we've made in the EMEA region in late 2010.","These changes in our go-to-market strategy took a few quarters to bear fruit, but we feel should yield to improve results in the second half of this year.","With that, I'll end my review of the Commercial Systems division, and we'll pass the call to Bill Sundermeier, who will discuss the results of our Government Systems division. Bill?","William A. Sundermeier","Thanks, Andy. Despite a difficult global budgetary environment, Government Systems division's bookings increased by 20% sequentially over the fourth quarter of last year. As expected, we saw a decline in revenue and profitability during the first quarter when compared to the first quarter of 2011.","Our focus continues to be on improving bookings to strengthen our backlog, and we made progress in that area during the first quarter. While domestic procurement remains sluggish during the quarter, we saw increased demand in order flow from international customers.","Total Government Systems division\u2019s 12-month backlog finished the first quarter at $312 million, down just slightly from the end of 2011 and book-to-bill was 1x. Divisional operating margins declined 1.5 percentage points over the first quarter of last year to 25% due largely to the decrease in revenue after cost reductions that were put into effect last year.","Focusing first on the Surveillance segment, I'd like to point out a few of the significant wins we received during the quarter. The Persistent Ground Surveillance System, or PGSS program, with the U.S. Navy, yielded another 14-unit order under the IDIQ we won last summer. To-date, the U.S. government has ordered over 100 FLIR gimbals over the life of the PGSS program with nearly all of those being our second generation full HD Star SAFIRE EO\/IR sensors. ","[Technical Difficulty] ","And I'll jump back in here at the Surveillance segment, where I was talking about the Persistent Ground Surveillance System or PGSS program. The U.S. Navy yielded a 14-unit order under the IDIQ we won last summer. And to date, they've ordered over 100 gimbals from us, and those gimbals are pretty much all our full HD Star SAFIRE EO\/IR sensors. And we received another order from the U.S. Marines NSYS contract for UH Yankees. And that one was for nearly $7 million of BRITE Star II gimbals.","As I mentioned earlier, international market showed renewed strength during the first quarter, particularly in our Middle East and European regions. We sold our first systems into Turkey in Q1 with the Turkish national police ordering 12 million of our 380-HD EO\/IR sensors and over 3 million of our Recon handheld products. But yet another Turkish customer booked a sizable number of our 380-HD gimbals to strengthen their ISR capability. ","A Saudi Arabian agency put in orders for $8 million worth of soldier and vehicle level solutions, and the Canadian government placed a sizable order for our dual band rifle Night Sights."," ","Our Detection segment ended the first quarter with $24.7 million in backlog, which is roughly equal to the end of 2011. We have been making some significant enhancements to the selling organization and sales processes and detection, with a focus on product sales and an expansion of our international sales teams. These changes are only beginning to bear fruit. We've had some noticeable order activity during the first quarter with an order for over 200 of our IBAC bio-aerosol detection units to an OEM, as well as an order for over 1.6 million for the underwater versions of our identiFINDER radiation detectors. Our exclusive and radiation handheld units continue to do well worldwide. And particularly, in the Middle East, the reception of our new handheld products have been encouraging. With positive budget signals in the suburban [ph] space and the continuing evolution of the operating model, I am pleased with the direction of our Detection segment. ","Integrated Systems finished the first quarter with $45.2 million of 12-month backlog, up $3.6 million from the end of 2011. Order growth was driven by several key initiatives including our J2 development program. We booked nearly $6 million under the program in the quarter. And we are confident we will meet the Army's requirements for performance and reliability on J2 based on testing to date and anticipate reaching production next year. Integrated system software capabilities won us nearly $4 million contract for command-and-control system for the Port Mann Bridge outside of Vancouver, British Columbia. We also continued our wide area surveillance success with airports by booking the Riga Airport in Latvia. We also booked our first integrated system sale into Latin America with 10 of our SkyWatch towers ordered by a national police force.","In all, the quarter was mixed, continued global military spending reductions and budget uncertainty was countered by some strong wins and promising activity for the future. Detection and Integrated Systems are beginning to adopt the FLIR operating model and have some very promising opportunities on the horizon.","And finally, I'd like to acknowledge our employees who have done an amazing job at maintaining their diligence and focus as these temporary headwinds persist. The ability to control our cost, innovate great products and ensure top quality and service are all hallmarks of FLIR and will keep us ahead of our competition long into the future. ","I'll now pass the call over to our CFO, Tony Trunzo, to discuss the financial results in more detail. Tony?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Thanks, Bill. First quarter consolidated revenue was $348.5 million, a decrease of 7% compared to $376 million in the first quarter of 2011. Commercial Systems division first quarter revenue increased by 3.5% to $202.3 million. The Thermal Vision and Measurement segment posted first quarter revenue of $155.7 million, an increase of 7% compared with the first quarter of last year. TVM revenue growth was the result of strengthened Personal Vision systems, uncooled security and volume Thermography cameras offset by slowness in premium Thermography cameras and general weakness in European markets. Raymarine revenue declined 8% compared to Q1 of last year to $46.6 million as strong sales of recently introduced products was more than offset by significant weakness in the important European market. ","Government Systems Q1 revenue was $146.1 million, a drop of 19% compared with $180.5 million in the first quarter of 2011. Surveillance segment revenue was $114.6 million compared to $149.9 million in Q1 of last year. Continued slow demand from key U.S. government customers as well as lower deliveries to Middle Eastern markets were the primary reasons for the lower revenue.","Detection segment revenue increased 8% in Q1 to $19.4 million, driven by increases in product revenues, particularly chem\/bio monitors, offset by a decline in nonstrategic contract R&D. Integrated Systems segment Q1 revenue was $12.2 million versus $12.7 million in Q1 of 2011 ","International revenue was 42.9% on the consolidated total in Q1, down from 47.8% of revenue last year, reflecting slowness in the EMEA region. International sales made up 51.9% of Commercial Systems revenue in Q1 compared to 60% in Q1 last year, while 30.4% of Government Systems revenue came from outside the U.S. compared to 34.6% last year.","Total sales to the U.S. government were 28.3% of the total in Q1, down from 31.5% of revenue in the first quarter of last year.","Consolidated gross margin was 52.4% in the first quarter, essentially unchanged from last year. Consolidated operating income was $68.3 million compared with $76.3 million in the first quarter of last year and operating margin was 19.6%, down 70 basis points from 20.3% last Q1. ","First quarter operating income in Commercial Systems was $43.2 million, a 3% decline compared with Q1 of last year. Thermal Vision and Measurement posted $39.3 million of operating income, up 6% from last year, while Raymarine operating income of $3.8 million was $3.6 million lower than last year due to higher operating expenses associated with changes to the European sales organization from costs associated with the building boom. ","Despite difficult market conditions, we expect Raymarine's profitability to improve significantly for the rest of this year as costs come down and new products flow into the market.","Government Systems operating income was $35.9 million for the quarter compared with $47.1 million last Q1. Surveillance segment operating income was $34.9 million, down $16.4 million from last year. SG&A expenses in Surveillance declined by 8% in dollar terms due to cost reductions taken late last year in continued cost containment, and segment gross margin was stable.","The Detection segment performed very well in Q1 reporting operating income of $1.4 million compared with an operating loss of $3.9 million last year. The improvement was due to much lower SG&A expenses and the roll-off of $2.1 million in acquisition related inventory charges recognized in Q1 of last year.","Integrated Systems lost $400,000 in the quarter, roughly flat with Q1 of 2011.","Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock compensation in the quarter were $88.4 million compared with $101.2 million last year. Interest expense during the quarter was $3.1 million, an increase of $2.7 million from last year due to the $250 million in 5 year notes we issued last August. Our tax provision for the quarter was 24.7% [ph] of pretax income compared with the Q1 2011 provision of 31.5% of pretax income.","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $49 million, representing 102% of net earnings. During the quarter, we repurchased 1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $25.39 and paid dividends totaling $10.8 million.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $12.9 million.","That concludes the summary of our first quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call back to Earl.","Earl R. Lewis","Thanks, Tony. And while this quarter was not about what we -- was about what we expected in terms of performance, it's not up to our overall standards. We have done and will continue to do a lot of work to position ourselves for growth by controlling cost, optimizing gross margins and invest in new products and markets. We are looking for our financial performance to improve in the second half of this year as all these initiatives take hold.","And with that, operator, we're ready to take questions. I hope the webcast people are back on.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Michael Lewis.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Tony, I had noted a comment in the press release where you stated that some activity moved from discontinued operations to continued operations on the P&L. Can you give us some information on that?","Anthony L. Trunzo","It was a tiny amount, Michael. We -- I think that the revenue that went back into the P&L for Q1 of last year was about $2 million. So when you compare the Q1 2011 reported results with the Q1 2011 comparison that you're seeing today, revenue is up about $2 million because there were 2 pieces of PBA and 360 that we decided we wanted to keep, and we pulled them back out of discontinued operations in Q2 of last year, I believe. The operating income effect was basically nothing.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, got you. And as we look at the weighting of revenue from the first half to the second half, how should we think about that as a percent of the full year? Will it be, say, a 60:40 mix second half the first half, or something else other than that?","Earl R. Lewis","Pretty close to what we've been doing. But I think we'll see the government be a little bit more in the second half.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes. Clearly, second half is going to be bigger than first half, Michael. I don't know that it would skew all the way to 60:40, but clearly, the second half is going to be a larger revenue quarter than first half.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one final question for Andy. Last quarter, you talked about the introduction of 9 and 12-inch E-Series systems. How are they tracking? And are you seeing more momentum in the North American market versus, say, Asia Pacific?","Andrew C. Teich","Yes. First of all, they're been doing very well. Those products have been very well received, and we exceeded our target in terms of the number of units that we wanted to ship in the first quarter fairly significantly, so we're quite pleased about that. So not only have the products done well from an introduction standpoint, but they've done well from a production standpoint, and that's being able to fulfill the orders quickly. In terms of the comments of the U.S. versus international, it's quite strongly different. So we saw a decline in the international region given that the boat builders there are building fewer boats, and we have a strong OEM presence. In the U.S. market, we saw a nice double-digit pickup in terms of bookings. And that was also bolstered by the introduction of those new products. So we're quite pleased to see those results from the U.S.","Operator","Your next question comes from Noah Poponak.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Question on -- if I heard the numbers correctly there, the surveillance operating margin in the quarter was 30%, a little more than 30%. That's down pretty significantly from where that was running last year. Can you talk about how you think that progresses through the rest of '12? And then, what the right 2 to 3 year margin is there?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Q1 -- I made the comment, Noah, that we've taken our SG&A down in dollar terms. I think it was down 6%. We're still taking SG&A out of that business, so the dollar spending will come down. And revenue was low. Revenue will come up in the subsequent 3 quarters, so you will see a recovery in the margin there. Gross margins were stable. And that's the encouraging piece of the overall puzzle for Surveillance. We're continuing operationally to do a good job. But frankly, the revenue number was a little softer than we had originally anticipated it being, and that resulted in a higher SG&A load relative to revenue. So we said that our target for that business is in the mid-30s. We did 40 points in Q4 of last year. We were pretty clear that that's not sustainable. But I think that a trend back up a few percentage points over the next few quarters is what you can expect.","Earl R. Lewis","Well, it is cyclical, of course. I mean we will see improvement as the volume goes up. And volume will go up.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And mid-30s is the right medium to long-term number to think about there?","Earl R. Lewis","Probably annualized. That's about right. Yes.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is it possible to tell us or just say what you think the organic revenue growth rate will be for total government and total commercial in 2012?","Anthony L. Trunzo","No, I don't think we have it.","Earl R. Lewis","I don't know if we got that handy.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I don't mean to give you guys so much grievance with my questions.","Anthony L. Trunzo","No, no. It's a fair question. When we look at our revenue, we clearly got a forecast. Over the last couple of days, as we were going through it, I didn't ask for a breakdown, I don't think any of us did, of the organic revenue by customer segment. Not that we couldn't get it, we just don't have it calculated.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly, expectation for the full year tax rate?","Earl R. Lewis","27%.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes, the 27% that we booked up in Q1 reflects our expectation for the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Quillin.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So I think you expect that the bookings in the Government business, particularly the Surveillance business, will pick up in the back half of the year. And maybe VOSS and PIGS is part of the rationale there, maybe confirm that. And maybe talk about what are the factors that give you confidence in a pickup in bookings? And if the headwinds persist in the Government business, do you still think you're able to maintain gross margins? Or at some point, do you have to adjust your production capacity in a more meaningful way?","Earl R. Lewis","Right now, we don't believe we have to adjust our capacity in a more meaningful way at all. What gives us assurance, it's -- actually, we had yesterday a review by Kevin Tucker, who runs the Surveillance business. So every project and every order he's working on between now and the end of the year. And at the end of the meeting, we basically asked him, \"Are you going to do this?\" And he said yes. Beyond that, we can talk about every single program in our factory and of each one of them, Tim. But I don't know if it's doing any of us any good. Rely on the manager of the group, and he is pretty certain he is going to be able to do what he said he could.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And a similar question on the commercial side. So Europe's been a little bit weak, the premium cameras. And I think that's probably both on the Core side, and Thermography side have been a little bit weak. What gives you the belief that -- or do you believe that we'll see commercial growth accelerate throughout the year? And that would be the factors that would drive that?","Earl R. Lewis","Well, Tim, we think that the bookings side of the Commercial business will certainly improve in the second half of the year. And the factors that roll into that, part of it is continued new product introduction. So we've got new products staged for both the TVM segment and the Raymarine segment throughout the rest of the year. That gap between the volume segment and the premium segment in the Thermography business is kind of an important one, because in the way that we had introduced products, our E-Series product, it basically went up to about $8,000. And then we introduced the T600 product, which started at about $20,000. So there's a big gap between there that was filled with our older T300, T400 product line. And that middle product there did not have the feature set that the new E-Series, the new T600 had. And we've just launched a new T400 line that fills that gap in. And we think that that's going really help the premium segment, because those products that are booked in that T-Series line are all considered premium segment products. It's a very rich feature set. We've got this new MSX feature that's in there. And we think that that's going to draw the customers in, both from competition and from lower end products to help bolster Thermography bookings. ","But there's other measures, too. I mean, we look at the number of quotes, of course. We look at the level of activity in terms of people asking for literature, et cetera. And you put all those things together, Tim, and come to a conclusion as to where it's headed. And those ratios are good.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on that. So, Andy, the premium cameras, the softness you saw was also in the Americas as well?","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, it was.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. I mean is there any sense that there's any kind of structural change in the market, just given the products that you've come out with at the lower end of the market? Or you just feel this is really just an issue where you had a gap within the product portfolio that presumably, those products are now shipping on the T400?","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, they are. We launched them 2 weeks ago, and we have several hundred units of inventory on the day of launch. Distributors who placed orders received products the following Monday morning. To answer your question, I do think it's more of the latter. I think it's more of a fact that we have this gap in our product line. There's certainly some issue with capital spending. I mean, when you move up into the premium segment, it's a CapEx product. And it's possible that some of those budgets were set during a time when CapEx budgets were lighter than they have been historically. We do believe in the concept that a bigger base fills a bigger top. And that the very large number of iX products that we're selling are primarily new thermographers coming into the market for the first time, and those people are going to buy up over time.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And one follow-up. The strength that you're seeing in the commercial security market, is that across all geographies? Are you seeing that kind of strength even in Europe, where, just in general, you got more economic headwinds?","Andrew C. Teich","So, first off, it was where we are seeing strength, we saw very good, very strong bookings in the Security segment in the APAC region. It's on a small base, but it was up more than a couple hundred percent. In the EMEA region, bookings in terms of dollars in the Security segment actually declined, but that is just a result of the prior year having still strong orders coming from the Border Security segment, which has been quite quiet. There are things that are cooking there, but we haven't had orders come to fruition there. So we're having to backfill those fairly high dollar value pool systems with lower dollar value uncooled systems. The good is that channel continues to build, and those volumes are going up very strongly, so we feel like we're building a base for the future there.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","In the Americas, it looks like you've got good strong demand in that region.","Andrew C. Teich","The Americas did very well in Q1 in Security.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And last question. Bill, can you talk a little bit about the pipeline on the international side of the business? You saw some encouraging signs this quarter. How does the funnel for new business look?","William A. Sundermeier","Great questions. The funnel for new business as we look out for the rest of the year looks very strong internationally. By the end of last year, we had some issues with Middle East sales channel, and we've got these problems resolved, and we're moving forward there. I'm glad to see in Q1 we had -- back to business in the Middle East, and I see some more good opportunity in Q2 and Q3. So this quarter, it's certainly the low point of the year, and things are going to get -- continue to build in Q2 and certainly Q3 as well. So not only are we going to see international orders increase in the territories that we're at, but as you saw, we're really focused on new territories. And Turkey was a spot that we've been trying to penetrate for years. And you're going to see us move into other countries where we haven't before, not only in Surveillance [indiscernible] order out of Latin America where iX had never been before. We're going to continue to penetrate lots of new territories. So that's a market expansion and product expansion on our 2 areas that we're focused on.","Operator","Your next question comes from Nathan [sic] Jonathan Ho.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","This is Jonathan Ho. I just wanted to, I guess, maybe touch a little bit on -- first of all, the MSX opportunity that you talked about, you seemed to indicate this is of significant importance. Can you tell us why and how quickly of an impact that's going to have potentially on the business?","Andrew C. Teich","So these is a feature that currently we have relegated to the premium segment. And it's really amazing. Like I say, in 30 years in this business, this has been a real wow moment for me to see what this technology does. Fundamentally, what it does is it takes high fidelity information from a visual image and blends it together in an intelligent way, an algorithm doing that with a thermal image. And it brings critical things that are missing from thermal images to light, things like texture, depth and, more importantly, the ability to read printing, so reading signs, reading labels. Frequently when an inspector is in a plant, he is looking at equipment that has labels on it, circuit breakers are labeled, motors are labeled, et cetera. And suddenly, you can read all those things in the thermal image. So in the past, people have captured a visual image and a thermal image and used those separately or done picture-in-picture modes or some type of blending. But frankly, none of those things really work very well. And this gives the thermographer what they really want, which is one image that has all the necessary information to make their decisions. So we've deployed this initially in the Thermography business. We've got patents pending on this technology. But I think you're going to see it make its way into other segments as well. I think it's got broad scale applicability for improving the resolution of thermal images.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And can you give us maybe a brief update on what's been happening in some of your distribution efforts? Notably I think a few quarters back, you guys talked about expanding the trial at Home Depot and other retailers.","Andrew C. Teich","So on the retail front, we continue to bring on large scale distributors, [indiscernible] refers to them as super regional so they're -- an example here in the Northwest is a company like Platt Electric. But there are examples of those, and the HVAC space, the electrical space, the mechanical, the MRO space. So we continue to push those. We still have not made demonstrable traction with retail at a Home Depot or Lowe's level. We continue to work those sectors, but have nothing significant to report there. We continue to run a rental program at Home Depot, and may look at some expansion there in the fall. We use the Test and Measurements business as a vehicle into the retail segment. So we're in places like Fry's, RadioShack, Sears. So we've got channels open there for subsequent product introduction. And that's really our thinking on that topic now.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And if I can have just one more on -- as we look at sort of the Government business, you talked about a few programs like, J2. What are your expectations around some of these large programs at this point? And how much of a driver can it be, especially if you're transitioning J2 from I guess development to production?","William A. Sundermeier","Sure, J2 was a significant program when we acquired ICS and still remains. If we look into the 2013 fiscal budget in the program and still as a program [indiscernible] $350 million. So we anticipate going into production next year, and they certainly have budget placed up for numerous years for that program. Chem\/Bios still is a priority there, and I think that that's going to morph into a nontraditional engine program as well. So there's J2 will continue to be a strong force in the future as well as some variations on that program.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe, Bill, can you discuss sort of how the 4-year planning, especially with the volumes ticking up, might be impacted by another continuing resolution in the back half of the year? I mean, we've had it for a couple years now, so I imagine you guys are used to that environment. But how does that enter into the planning equation?","William A. Sundermeier","So far this year, we looked at our forecast for the remainder of the year and had some really nice programs on the line for the remainder of the year. I think the thing that we're all interested in is sequestration, what happens there at towards the end of the year. Really, this year's plans are solid with our forecast and what we think is going to happen. So really, to me, the inflection point is what happens with sequestration and that really won't impact us until 2013 and our plans [ph] there. So we haven't -- we started thinking about what might happen if sequestration happens before 2013. But right now, our 2012 plans are quite solid, and we anticipated Q1 to be a slow quarter just because of the backlog that we have. We just couldn't push out anymore because of timing issues, but bookings should grow for the remainder of the year.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can you maybe elaborate on, I guess, 2 points? Maybe what could happen under sequestration, and what your contingency plans are. And we've been hearing anecdotally that maybe contracting officials are rushing right now to spend any money they have not knowing what the fiscal '13 environment will hold. So is that -- are you seeing a meaningful uptick in bookings? Like, down the pipe, I guess, over the next quarter or 2?","William A. Sundermeier","I really haven't heard of any procurement folks rushing to spend their money other than Q3 is typically a big rush to spend. So I'm not sure that's going to happen. I think that it's probably wise for them to get their programs in place. Sequestration brings the total budget down another 10%, if you will, roughly, and it's more about Oconus, funding and kind of supplementals being reduced. We do a lot of quick book and bill because our company is really focused on quick delivery and not long-term programs. Some of the programs that we're focused on this year will be long-term, around [ph] the record, and that should carry us into the future. So sequestration, to us, means that we need to focus more internationally, and we've been good at that. And we'll see that resurgence happening here in Q1 in the bookings for the remainder of the year. So we try to be focus abroad to try and fill in some of that 10%, if that happens. Although I've met with my military advisory board just last week, and it could go either way. There's a lot of folks out there that think it's going to happen. It's inevitable. But the military is just not planning on it. If anything, it would seem to go into more of a slowing of procurement if sequestration happens. What's going to get cut and what's going to happen in that it might slowdown spending. But I'm hoping that, if that gets resolved, end of this year, we don't see a sequestration. I think that's what the military is hoping as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Josephine Millward.","Josephine Lin Millward - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Bill, what is your expectation of the U.S. and international mix with Government Systems this year?","William A. Sundermeier","The mix, I think, will trend towards 50:50. And I think we've been kind of 60:40 in the last 4. But I'm hopeful we'll quite make 50-50 international and the U.S., but we might [ph] be shy of that.","Josephine Lin Millward - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Can you give us an update on the Air Force A29 contract, since it was successfully protested and canceled? Did you take that out of your backlog? And when do you expect to recompete decision on that?","William A. Sundermeier","Sure, Josephine. We have never received an order for the A29, so it wasn't in our backlog. Embraer has been a great partner for us in the long time. [indiscernible] bright star Super Tucano. So it was a great -- it was the right choice. Unfortunately, Beechcraft's [ph] delegation got a hold of that program, and Air Force cut it up. But anyway, it was never in our backlog. We never did receive an order for that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeremy Devaney.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","A couple of questions for you on assumptions underlying guidance here. What would you say your base macro case is that's supporting the current guidance? Is it for global GDP improvement or is it for EMEA strengthening? Or what sort of are you seeing there?","Earl R. Lewis","Macro case. I'm not sure we could say we have a macro case. We look at each division. We talk to each division manager, review all of the forecasts that they put together. And I mean, will the euro go to hell? It's probably not in our forecast. Will the economy improve slightly in the U.S.? That's probably in our thinking. Will we improve our operating cost? Yes, that's in our thinking. I don't think I can give you a 40,000-foot macro guidance, I guess.","Andrew C. Teich","Jeremy, I guess, I would say that from the standpoint of what has to happen in the economy for us to meet our plan, certainly not expecting a huge recovery. I think there's still a fair bit of concern across our commercial division about what's going on in Europe. I think our Raymarine team, Tom Surran's, got some caution about recovery in Europe in there. You just saw today that the U.S. economy grew a little slower in Q4. I don't think there's a lot of optimism, expectation that -- I think there's an expectation that there's a lot of improvement. But as Earl said, we really tend to -- when we're testing our guidance, we tend to look more at what we see as our opportunity landscape and, frankly, our customer.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Earl, at the Investor Day, you'd commented that a 25% EBIT margin on a consolidated basis was definitely a possibility. Is that still within plan considering where we see EBIT margins posted today?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. I think by the end of the year we'll be in that range.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Probably tough to get there for the totality of the year.","Earl R. Lewis","Exactly, yes. But each quarter, we suspect right now we should improve slightly.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","All right. And then if I can get one more in there. Directionally, next quarter, do you expect weaker or stronger, and particularly looking at Raymarine with the extreme seasonality that we see between the first half and second half?","Earl R. Lewis","Raymarine will have a very strong Q2. And then they will taper off Q3 and Q4. And that's very much historical in -- way before we owned them.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And across the rest of the segments?","Earl R. Lewis","Across the rest of the segments, we're not forecasting great growth in Q2. We think Q3 and Q4 will be stronger in all the other areas. Q3, for example, is always very strong when it comes to government orders, and that's been historical. If you look at the Thermography business, that's always been very strong in Q4. When you average all these together, we see an improving landscape, Q3 and Q4, and with Q2 slightly better than Q1.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Quillin.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just a couple quick questions. One, Andy, you'd -- I think maybe a couple years ago, had talked about what percent of the then commercial division systems consisted of government end markets. I'm wondering if you could say what percent of TVM revenue is exposed to government end markets. And then, Tony, what's the capital expenditure plans for the year?","Andrew C. Teich","So on the ratio, if I look at it, I don't have the number for all of TVM. If I just look within the Cores business, that number hasn't changed much, Tim. So that's been running fairly level. It runs at about a 70% level. And we look at that quarterly, and it, well, ticked down a bit in Q4. It kind of ticked back up to historical levels in Q1. And I don't expect that it's going to change a lot. We see some mixed shift between that between cooled and uncooled, which we saw this quarter, so we actually saw uncooled becoming more dominant.","Earl R. Lewis","Tim, I'll be a little careful there. Andy was referring that 70% to a subset, a very small subset of the total so...","Anthony L. Trunzo","Q1 U.S. government revenue, as you guys know, U.S. government revenue, teasing it out for us can sometimes be -- take a fair bit of focus because we're trying to trace through to the end customer. But it was less than 10% of Commercial Systems' total revenue in Q1. The vast majority of that, less than 10%, came out of the TVM business. And the vast majority of that would've come out of the old Commercial Systems business.","Earl R. Lewis","Commercial vision.","Anthony L. Trunzo","I'm sorry, Commercial Vision systems.","Earl R. Lewis","And then Even another level deeper is in Cores.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Right. So it comes out of Cores. But in the totality of the Commercial Systems business, it's less than 10% of revenue, Tim.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And CapEx, Tony?","Anthony L. Trunzo","CapEx? Well, we've scaled back our CapEx plan for the year, but it'll probably still be in that $12 million to $15 million a quarter range for the totality of the year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lewis.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Totally lost me on that last question on the TVM.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Let's try it again. Let me try it, if I can. So in Q1, the total Commercial Systems business, you look at the Commercial Systems division, less than 10% of their revenue came from the U.S. government, okay? The vast majority of that 10%, the vast majority of that U.S. government revenue, came from a segment inside of TVM, which is our Cores business. We don't have very much U.S. government revenue in the old Thermography business. We don't have very much in the system side of our old Commercial Vision Systems business. And we don't have very much in Raymarine. It's focused -- it's really focused on a couple of customers in the Cores business.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. But my actual questions were going to be -- I missed the detection backlog number, Tony. And then just one more follow-up for Bill.","Anthony L. Trunzo","I don't think I gave you a detection backlog number, but we have one.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, it was basically flat.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Flat with year-over-year?","Earl R. Lewis","Quarter-to-quarter. Book-to-bill it's attached to [ph] was one. That's a nice way to look at it, Mike.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Got you, okay. And then, Bill, just to close the loop on government services and the weakness in the quarter, were there any product deliveries that slipped from Q1 due to some POs that did not hit by the end of the quarter that may have hit and you've already delivered out in the second quarter? Or was this a scenario that do not play \u2013 it was not part of the issues that we saw in Q1?","William A. Sundermeier","That wasn't part of the issues in Q1. No.","Earl R. Lewis","Operator, I think we're actually a little past our time. Is there a large queue of questions or not?","Operator","No, sir.","Earl R. Lewis","Then I think we'll end. And thank you all for calling in this morning. We look forward to talking to you about Q2 in 3 months.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

And we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","We will be discussing our results for the quarter, primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of our core ongoing operating results and facilitate consistent comparison of results over time. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning.","Let me turn the call over to Andy Teich, President and Chief Executive Officer of FLIR Systems. Andy?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Todd, and thank you for joining us for FLIR's fourth quarter 2016 earnings call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; SVP of Product Strategy, Jeff Frank; and SVP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison.","I'll start to review the quarter with slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter revenue of $475 million, an increase of 8% over the prior year and a 2% increase on an organic basis. Commercial products revenue grew 13% over the fourth quarter of 2015 and government products grew 3%. Driving the commercial products were strength in Lepton camera cores, growth in our Maritime segment and the addition of our newly acquired businesses. On the government products side, increased military camera core deliveries from our OEM business helped to drive the growth.","Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating profit grew 6% and 5% respectively in comparison to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.52, which represents 4% growth versus fourth quarter 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.50.","As Todd mentioned and as stated in the press release this morning, beginning this quarter, we will present adjusted profitability metrics along with our GAAP results. This is to provide a view of our core ongoing operating results and to facilitate better comparisons of our results over time. You can see reconciliations from GAAP profits to adjusted profits in the press release. And we've provided an eight-quarter historical reconciliation in the appendix to the quarter results presentation slides.","Under the previous method of reporting guidance and reporting adjusted earnings per diluted share, fourth quarter historical-method earnings per share were $0.48 compared to $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2015. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $97 million or 158% of our GAAP net income in the quarter and was 24% higher than the prior year, driven primarily by improvements in our inventory levels where we reduced the balance by nearly $60 million during the year, excluding the addition of inventory from the acquired businesses.","Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter at $592 million, down 8% since the end of the third quarter as we work through Surveillance and Detection backlog during the fourth quarter. Since our last call, we've introduced several new products. At CES in Las Vegas, we introduced two new FLIR ONE smartphone attachments, the third generation FLIR ONE and FLIR ONE Pro.","We also launched at CES two new consumer and commercial drone cameras, the FLIR Duo and Duo R, which feature Lepton and an HD visible camera for airborne situational awareness and data collection. Last, we introduced the new C3 pocket Wi-Fi-enabled thermal camera for contractors, building inspectors and trades people.","During the fourth quarter, we completed our acquisition of Point Grey Research, which has become our Integrated Imaging Solutions line of business within the OEM & Emerging segment. Also during the quarter, we acquired Prox Dynamics, a summary of which you will see on slide 4. Based just outside of Oslo, Norway, Prox Dynamics is a leading innovator in the world of nano-drone systems. They're highly differentiated Black Hornet to personal reconnaissance system as the unique solution for getting multiple sensors into the air from military and paramilitary surveillance and reconnaissance.","This extremely covert drone weighs less than about three sheets of paper and as a man portable hand launchable system that features our Lepton micro thermal camera, a visible spectrum camera, advanced low power rotor technology and proprietary software for flight control, stabilization, and encrypted communications.","Now, part of our Surveillance segment, we are excited to have the talented Prox team join us and continue to develop highly advanced and differentiated aerial sensing solutions that enable a significant advantage in situational awareness and mission planning for our customers.","Slide 5 shows the summary of our full year 2016 where we saw year-over-year revenue growth of 7% to $1.7 billion. On an organic basis, 2016 revenue growth was 3% as our Surveillance segment returned to organic growth for the first time since 2012 and our OEM & Emerging segment grew over 20% organically. Offsetting this growth for revenue declines from the Instruments segment, which saw soft demand for the midrange plant predictive maintenance and building products as well as the decline in our Security segment, which was primarily due to a decline in our retail security business.","Adjusted operating profit was flat compared to 2015 as we saw margin compression in the Instruments and Security businesses. We expect both of these segments to return to organic growth and improve their profitability in 2017, as Instruments refreshes its mid-range product line and Security introduces new products and expand its enterprise business. Cash generation improved significantly in 2016 with full-year operating cash flow growing 13% over 2015 to $312 million, driven by better utilization of working capital.","On slide 6, you'll see our outlook for 2017. We expect full year 2017 revenue to be in the range of $1.78 \u2013 I'm sorry, in the range of $1.78 billion and $1.83 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.81 to $1.91. This outlook represents a revenue growth rate of between 7% and 10% and an adjusted EPS growth rate of between 7% and 13% over our 2016 results. We announced today a 25% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.15 per share. This growth represents an increase in our targeted payout ratio as a percent of our adjusted net income to roughly 33% from 28% in 2016.","The dividend will be payable on March 10 to shareholders of record as of March \u2013 February 24. Additionally, our board has authorized a new share repurchase program under which we can repurchase up to 15 million shares over the next two years. This is the same level of authorization we had over the last two years where we repurchased a total of 6.3 million shares.","I'll now ask Amit to review the fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results. Amit?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. Good morning.","On slide 7, you'll see our fourth quarter financial results. Consolidated revenue was $475 million, an 8% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2015. OEM & Emerging, Security, Maritime, and Surveillance segments grew 55%, 7%, 6%, and 5% respectively. Instruments and Detection segments declined 3% and 6% respectively.","Geographically, revenue increased in all regions, except Middle East and Africa. Sales to the U.S. government increased versus last year to about $118 million, representing about 25% of total revenue. Consolidated fourth quarter adjusted gross margin was 47%, a 115 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to segment and product mix changes and higher manufacturing variances and period costs.","Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 22%, 79 basis points lower than last year, primarily driven by the lower gross margin. Other expenses were up year-over-year as a result of foreign exchange transaction losses, and higher interest expense. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 totaled $71.9 million or $0.52 per fully diluted share, compared to $69.6 million or $0.50 per fully diluted share last year, increases of 3% and 4% respectively.","Our cash flow from operations for the quarter increased 24% from year-ago levels to $97.1 million or 158% of GAAP net income or 135% of adjusted net income. Our days sales outstanding and days inventory on hand improved year-over-year, driving an improved cash conversion cycle. Our two acquisitions in the fourth quarter, Point Grey and Prox Dynamics, resulted in a net cash outflow from investing activities of $376.8 million.","Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $8.3 million, significantly reduced from the higher levels a year-ago when we were in the midst of consolidating our manufacturing facilities in Santa Barbara. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares and returned $16.4 million to shareholders through the payment of dividend. We closed the fourth quarter with cash of $361 million. On slide 8, you will see our full-year financial results. Consolidated revenue was $1.66 billion, a 7% increase over prior year.","OEM & Emerging, Detection, Surveillance, Security and Maritime segments grew 31%, 8%, 6%, 6% and 4% respectively. Instruments segment declined 3%. Geographically, revenue increased in all regions except Europe, which was down slightly. Sales to the U.S. government increased versus last year to about $416 million, representing about 25% of total revenue. Consolidated full-year adjusted gross margin was 47%, 176 basis points lower than last year primarily due to product mix changes and manufacturing cost variances in certain areas.","Our adjusted operating margin for the year was 20%, a 134 basis points lower than last year, primarily driven by the lower gross margin. Adjusted 2016 net income totaled $233.9 million or $1.69 per fully diluted share compared to $232.8 million or $1.65 per fully diluted share.","Under the previous method of reporting and providing guidance for adjusted EPS, which excluded the impact of discrete tax items, minority investment gains and losses, restructuring charges, SkyWatch remediation charges and the impact of fourth quarter 2016 acquisitions. Fourth quarter historical method EPS were $0.48 compared to historical-method earnings per share of $0.47 in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Full year 2016 earnings per share under the previous method were at $1.56 equal to adjusted EPS for 2015. A reconciliation table summarizing these adjustments is included in the earnings release published earlier today under the heading GAAP to non-GAAP Reconciliation as previously guided.","Our cash flow from operations for 2016 increased 13% from year-ago levels to $312.3 million or 187% of GAAP net income. Our days sales outstanding and days inventory on hand improved year-over-year driving an improved cash conversion cycle. In addition to Point Grey and Prox, our net acquisition related cash outflows included purchases of Armasight and ISD in the second quarter.","Our total capital expenditures in 2016 were $35.9 million or 2.2% of revenue, significantly reduced from the higher levels a year ago. During the year, we repurchased about 2.1 million shares for $66 million compared to about 4.2 million shares in 2015 for $123 million. We also paid dividends of $65.9 million or $0.12 a quarter.","Our total debt increased by $158.5 million in 2016 as a result of refinancing our five-year notes and upsizing to $425 million from $250 million. This was done to implement our previously communicated capital strategy to increase our gross leverage ratio and liquidity while maintaining our investment grade rating and using our interest rate and cost of capital.","This concludes the summary of our financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational results. Tom?","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Amit. Slide 9 is a summary of the fourth quarter results by segment. Four of our six segments showed solid growth year-over-year with Instruments and Detection declining 3% and 6% respectively. Segment level adjusted operating profit was up 3% as we saw 8% overall revenue growth, but at a lower margin.","Moving to slide 10 to cover the Surveillance segment. Fourth quarter revenue for Surveillance was $158.5 million, up 5% over the fourth quarter of 2015. The addition of the unmanned aerial systems line of business with the acquisition of Prox Dynamics as well as continued success of our Outdoor & Tactical Systems line of business drove the growth. This was offset by year-over-year decline in our integrated systems products due to significant Cerberus and U.S. border-related MSC activity in the prior year.","Adjusted operating profit for Surveillance segment was $47.6 million, down 5% versus the prior year due to higher operating expenses. Surveillance backlog declined $35 million from the end of Q3 to $328 million, but it's up 6% from one year ago.","Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 0.7 times in the fourth quarter, slowed by lower order flow from U.S., Asia and Middle Eastern customers. In January, at the SHOT show in Las Vegas, Surveillance's Outdoor & Tactical Systems line of business introduced a broad array of new thermal scopes for hunting and outdoor enthusiasts, based on our new powerful thermal camera core, Boson.","New variants of our Helios, Prometheus Q14 thermal imagers and new variants of our thermal weapon and clip-on sights were introduced at the show. With Boson technology inside, customers will get market-leading image quality, long battery life and unmatched size-to-weight performance.","On slide 11, you will see a summary of the Instruments segment. Revenue declined 3% as compared to the fourth quarter of 2015 to $96 million, which includes a negative impact of 60 basis points from foreign exchange.","Growth from Fire, Optical Gas and FLIR Test & Measurement products was more than offset by reduced revenue in the mid-range of our plant predictive maintenance and building product line, as customer await the upcoming release of our new middle-range products in Q1 of this year. Unit volumes delivered during the quarter were up 49% versus the fourth quarter of 2015.","Instruments adjusted operating profit in the fourth quarter declined 10% from the prior year to $31.5 million or 33% of revenue. Negative product mix and manufacturing variances relative to the prior year drove lower gross margins in the quarter, while operating expenses were down only slightly. In January, Instruments introduced the C3 pocket-sized thermal camera for home inspectors, real estate professionals, general contractors and other trades people. The C3 builds off of a highly successful C2 camera to now include Wi-Fi connectivity, higher thermal sensitivity and an advanced user interface.","Also in January, Instruments introduced our first intrinsically safe optical gas imager, the GFx320. Adding an intrinsically safe version of this technology which has proven extremely valuable for the oil and gas production and transmission industries offers advanced safety and product resilience for customers that work in potentially explosive environments, broadening the applicability of this technology.","On slide 12, you will see the Security segment results. Security's fourth quarter revenue was $73.1 million, up 7% compared to last year's fourth quarter. This growth was due to strong results from our long range thermal cameras, enterprise cloud security solutions and Lorex's e-commerce business. Security adjusted operating margin was 12% in the quarter, slightly below the prior year and nearly 400 basis points ahead of Q3 in 2016.","Our cost improvement initiatives and improving profitability from our enterprise line of products helped drive this improvement. During the fourth quarter, the Security segment launched a new network video recorder that is aimed at small and medium-size businesses. The new Meridian NVR incorporates Power over Ethernet switching for operation of up to 24 cameras. As FLIR's united video management software preloaded supports dual monitor usage and has a modernized web interface.","These features enable turnkey integration out-of-the-box, a feature that is becoming more and more important to security system integrators and users. The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on slide 13, reaching the third sequential all-time organic high OEM & Emerging fourth quarter revenue was $76.1 million increasing 55% over last year.","The creation of OEMs intelligent imaging solutions line of business from the acquisition of Point Grey helped drive growth in the quarter as did continued strength in military-grade thermal camera cores and Lepton cores. OEM & Emerging adjusted operating profit was $18.1 million, more than double the prior year where we saw significant amount of cost related to the move into our new fabrication facility. Adjusted operating margin of 24% in the fourth quarter of 2016 was negatively impacted by inventory charges.","On slide 14, you'll see several new OEM & Emerging products that have been introduced into our last call. First, as Andy mentioned, we rolled out two new variants of our FLIR ONE smartphone accessory at the CES show. The third-generation FLIR ONEs have a new form factor and each feature MSX to emboss visible image video details on top of thermal video, as well as our new patent pending OneFit adjustable height connector. This feature allows a better fit for iPhone and Android users that have protective cases on their iPhone \u2013 on their phones.","The Pro version also features a ruggedized design and a more powerful set of imaging and measurement features including our new VividIR image processing algorithm that yield superior thermal imagery. Also launched at CES were the FLIR Duo and Duo R hybrid cameras for commercial and consumer drones. The Duo camera features both a thermal and visible camera and a commonly used action camera form factor, MSX image processing technology and real-time remote control of functions including switching between visible and thermal imaging streams.","Turning to slide 15, Maritime segment revenues were $38.3 million, representing a 6% growth versus prior year. We saw growth in nearly every category above with thermal cameras being particularly strong with 16% year-over-year growth. Maritime adjusted operating income was $2.1 million in the quarter and was 52% higher than the fourth quarter of 2015. Higher product volumes helped overhead absorption and reduced period costs drove the 165 basis point improvement in adjusted operating margin.","We have recently been informed that we have been selected for a $50 million contract to provide marine electronic systems under the U.S. Coast Guard's Scalable Integrated Navigation System 2 or SINS-2 program. Under this five-year indefinite delivery and indefinite quantity contract that includes an additional five-year option, our Maritime signal will provide electronic systems that will be standard fit on over 2,000 U.S. Coast Guard vessels ranging from small class boats to large cutter class vessels. The systems include Raymarine multifunction navigation displays, radars, sonars, remote instrument displays and autopilots.","And last week, we introduced the new Raymarine brand identity to the Maritime market. This rollout includes a redesign of the Raymarine brand including a new logo, icon and tagline to be used in all marketing activities and throughout its product lines. Both the new brand design and tagline, Simply Superior, signify FLIR's commitment to technology leadership and ease of use in the marine electronics market.","Our Detection segment results are summarized on slide 16. Detection's fourth quarter revenue was down 6% year-over-year to $32.7 million. The prior year saw a significant amount of DR-SKO shipments, which created a difficult comparison for this year's fourth quarter. Excluding DR-SKO activity, Detection revenue was up 20% driven by very strong quarter for radiation products with the U.S. Domestic Nuclear Detection Office. Adjusted operating margin was equal to the prior year at 30%. Detection finished 2016 with $57 million of backlog declining $11 million since Q3. We expect to receive another order from the U.S. Department of Defense for more DR-SKO deliveries in Q1 of 2017 and we expect the order size to be similar to what we have seen in previous orders.","On the new products front, Detection recently introduced the Griffin G465 mobile gas chromatograph mass spectrometer. The Griffin G465 is designed to be taken in the field to test vapors, liquids and solid samples for harmful chemical threats. Featuring a heated sample intake a survey mode and an intuitive color-coding user interface, the Griffin G465 enables better decisions in complex environments.","That concludes my summary of the segments' fourth quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Andy.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. We're pleased with the growth we saw in the business both organically and from the acquisitions we've made during the year. While we reached our highest level of quarterly operating cash flow since 2013 and saw sequential growth and profitability, margins did not meet our expectations. We will be working diligently in 2017 to improve margins in all of our businesses. When we look at the full year, we're encouraged by our ability to control operating costs to help offset pressure we saw in the decline in adjusted gross margins. We're excited about the four companies we acquired during the year, which provides strategic paths into new markets and deeper penetration into existing ones.","Our revenue from U.S. government increased meaningfully over 2015, the first time that part of our business is growing since 2009. And the improvements we're seeing in working capital help improve our cash flow, which enables acquisitions, organic investments in growth, and the increased dividend we announced today.","The guidance we presented for 2017, assumes a stronger U.S. dollar, a slightly higher effective tax rate of 25% and only modest growth in our government businesses as we expect continued budget uncertainty, particularly in the U.S. We are encouraged by our backlog levels and 2017 is set up to be a meaningful year for new product rollouts. And we expect 2017 adjusted growth and operating margins to improve over 2016 as we introduce new products, invest in manufacturing yield improvements and continue to integrate our recent acquisition and control our cost.","Before we turn to the Q&A, I want to take a moment to discuss the other announcement we've made this morning. As you've likely seen, we're beginning a leadership transition at FLIR. After more than 33 years including the last four years as President and CEO, I have decided it's time for me to retire once a permanent successor is named. Having pioneered several new markets, developed dozens of new products and shipped more than a 0.5 million thermal cameras in 2016, I am proud of what FLIR and this talented team has accomplished. FLIR continues to be a leader in the infrared industry. This has afforded us the opportunity to expand our capabilities well beyond the thermal spectrum. With these additional technologies, we're closer than ever to reaching our vision of being the world's sixth sense.","Now is the right time for me and for the company to begin this transition. I know that our next CEO and the rest of the outstanding leadership team will continue to build on the important progress that we've made. Looking ahead as part of our succession planning process, the board will conduct a comprehensive search for my successor. The board has retained a leading executive search firm to assist in the process.","As I mentioned, I will continue to serve as President and CEO and as a board member until a successor is named. During the transition period, I will continue to work closely with my colleagues, on the board and the management team to ensure a seamless transition. In short, it will be business as usual, and we'll continue to focus on serving our customers, and executing our strategic plan to deliver shareholder value.","With that, let's now open the floor for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting our question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Good morning, guys. Great cash flow quarter. Andy, I was wondering if there is anything more you can add. You haven't been CEO that long, I don't think you've been in your mid-50s yet and there is a lot of exciting things going on at the company for sure, I think. Can you explain why you'd want to retire now versus maybe closer to a more normal retirement age?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Pete. I know that this has been a common question this morning. And I'm actually a little older than you think. But in any case, this is really driven by two things. I mean, the major driving factor here is a personal decision. I'm a couple of years away from becoming an empty nester. I've got two kids left that are about ready to finish high school and head off to college. And for those of you that have known me, I have had a singular focus for the last 33 years. I've been incredibly dedicated to this business and its vision for growth and I've enjoyed every day of that. But it literally has been every single day, it's been a 24\/7, 365 effort from me and that's had \u2013 it affects on my personal life.","And I've come to a point where I want to change that focus and I feel like the company is in a position where it's the right time to make that change. I feel like we've built the strongest foundation, a very capable management team and I feel very good about the outlook for 2017 which was strongly bolstered by what we feel is a very strong teams of new product introductions that are going to come this year. And the combination of the businesses that we've acquired in the last 18 months, I think, the setup is right, and the timing is right and well, it's an extremely difficult decision for me. I feel pretty good about it.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","That's pretty valid reasons. I wish you the best of luck there, Andy. Let me just follow up with a couple brief ones and I'll get back in queue. 2017, the top line growth looks pretty good. I was wondering if you could talk about what the organic growth you are assuming is for 2017.","And then just on Prox and Point Grey, not a lot of details there, but I think safe to say the purchase prices were not smallest, the multiples there and so I was just wondering if you can give us a sense of what gave you guys the comfort level to pay what you did for those two deals?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. So, Pete, let me hit the first question on the organic growth. So, you're going to see about a third of our organic growth is going to come from organic growth and two-thirds of it from the recent acquisitions. Relative to those two recent acquisitions, the \u2013 I feel very good about what we paid for these companies, these are two awesome companies, very rich technology, excellent teams, employee groups, and technical teams of these companies and great opportunity for FLIR and for the injection of thermal.","If I look at Point Grey Research, what we're now calling Integrated Imaging Solutions, we've been looking at and participating in the machine vision and automation part of our business for some time now. And I think we're at a point where both the market acceptance level, the cost and capability of our sensors and the advancement of machine vision and intelligent imaging systems is right to bring the combination of FLIR's capability, both from a thermal standpoint and from a company go-to-market strategy together with a company like Point Grey Research.","They are at an inflection point, I would say, for growth. The adoption of visible imaging into machine vision applications is going very rapidly. And then the other applications that they're involved in, in intelligent imaging to include retail analytics types of cameras is also at an inflection point for growth.","Moving over to Prox, we have been, as a company, all about getting sensors in the right place at the right time to provide situational awareness and decision support for our military and industrial customers. At the end of the day, that's what Prox Dynamics is all about. They have a very unique and highly differentiated platform to get sensors in the air in an extremely covert way. Their sensor, of course, is completely unique in terms of its size and weight and covertness. They were one of our first customers for Lepton. They have integrated Lepton and a visible camera into a truly remarkable lightweight helicopter that can fly very long distances for significant periods of time in a very covert way and provide really a true game-changing capability for war fighters and law enforcement professionals out there. I am also incredibly impressed with this team and it's a natural fit for FLIR. Our brands on top of that remarkable product, I think, is really going to drive good growth.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Great. Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti from Needham and Company. Please go ahead.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Andy, I just want to wish you the best as you go and move on to this new chapter, but just moving to my questions, the sequential decline in adjusted gross margins, wanted to go a little further into that, was that mainly in the Instruments business and how should we think about the potential for that to turn around? You're obviously answering a sequentially weaker quarter, seasonally it's a weaker quarter in Q1. So I'm just trying to get a sense as to how we might think about the outlook for gross margins?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Jim, thank you for the well wishes and I'm going to hit the top level of this and then I'm going to pass it over to Tom Surran to talk a little bit more about some of the details on what we're \u2013 how we're going to address this. The declines we saw both in instruments and OEM, and there different reasons for each of those. I think they're both very much one-time in nature and they're both issues that we have plans to address.","And so the \u2013 some of the issues that we saw in OEM were as a result of our inventory improvement initiatives and then in the process of working the inventory in the OEM group, we had some excess and obsolete and scrap that was higher than normal and that also affected factory absorption. Also in the Instruments business we also saw some E&O scrap and absorption issues that that we feel will flush through the system. Tom, why don't you just talk a little bit more about some of the things we're going to be doing there?","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I think, as you look forward, there is three things that will actually contribute to our gross margin improvement and operating margin improvement overall. The first is the acquired entities, they all have very strong gross margins higher than the current average gross margin of the organic businesses. So that will make a contribution.","Second, as we look at our existing businesses, we'll be introducing new products that have very strong gross margins, and we expect them to make a significant contribution over this next year. And finally, it's kind of the blocking and tackling of the gross margin. This is where you get your hands dirty. And it's working all the details and the execution that the operations of the business including the materials to how you apply the labor and the overhead. So through those three things that's why we're expecting an improvement in gross margin in 2017.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","And I know you guys don't give quarterly guidance. But just as we think of that, the margin outlook in Q1, is this something, Tom, we should view this as gradually improving as we go through the year? Obviously, the back half of the year is a stronger year for revenue. So presumably that would help your margins more so?","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Jim, absolutely. This is going to be a continuous process that we're going to be focused on. And so it will not be a singular pop, it will be something that will continue to improve as we progress through the year.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, just one final question from me. You've had a number of, I think, I guess five quarters of sequential growth in backlog prior to this decline that you saw in Q4. I'm just wondering, just given what you're seeing out there, hearing out there, how should we think about the government business in 2017 just in terms of the pipeline?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Jim, this is Andy again. I want to first just add one other comment to the gross margin issue relative to how this will play out over the year. We have a lot of new products that are going to get launched in the first half of the year. The good news for that is it's going to drive growth. They're replacing older product lines that are ready for a product cycle refresh, and we've built a very good base of entry level customers, particularly in the Instruments business with low cost Lepton products, some percentage of those are going to look for higher capability, and we're going to fulfill that need with new products.","That said, early production on new products, you tend to have a little bit lower gross margin as you power up the learning curves and the production of new products. So, as a result of that, we'll see that gross margin improvement ramp throughout the year.","To your question about backlog, how we're feeling about the government business, I'll say something that I say at every call, is just that it is a bit unpredictable. We don't have a super clear crystal ball on this business. But the other thing I've said on many other calls is that we're extremely well-positioned. Our CDMQ model, our vertical integration, the competitive nature of the products that we have out there today position us really well for a change in demand in that business.","If I look at the backlog decline that we saw in Q4, it's all related to our government oriented business, and a little bit in Maritime, which is typical for Q4. But the majority of that is in Surveillance and in Detection. And those were cyclical businesses. They're just lumpy businesses. The Detection business, we mentioned that we're expecting a large order in the DR-SKO program. Candidly, we were expecting that in Q4, looks like it's going to happen this quarter, we're pretty confident about that.","And then also on Surveillance, it's just a bit of a lumpy business. We saw a little bit more softness in the Middle East in the second half of 2016. We do see cyclicality in that business type, oil prices and I think that's what we saw. The demand level there continues to be very high. And I think for obvious reasons in terms of what's going on in the region and I think with the recent increases in oil prices, we should see that snap back to performance and we'll see the backlog come back up as a result.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. Thanks very much.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Pleasure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and good luck, Andy, going forward, definitely been a pleasure working with you. Did acquisitions contribute meaningfully to the backlog at the end of the fourth quarter?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Hi, Mike, thanks for the well wishes. You were breaking up a little bit, but I think you were asking about acquisitions related to change in the backlog. It was a little over $15 million most of that going into OEM. The backlog coming in from Prox was pretty low, low single digit millions.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it, that's helpful. And then just looking into 2017 (41:13-41:24) keeping the business under pressure out there?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So, I didn't catch enough of that one to be able to answer it. It sounded like there was a question about the organic growth, but you're really breaking up a lot.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Yeah. Sorry, Andy. I was just asking about the 3% organic growth next year, if there's any specific headwinds or maybe if you can give any color, what would be stronger or weaker into 2017?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. So, there are kind of two things that I would think about here. Number one is there is an FX headwind, so we have in our planning about 1.5% of FX headwind on organic growth side, so that's factored in. So if you add that to the growth number, I think it brings it up. So as a result of that, we're still above GDP growth and I would say it's growth above what most industrial tech companies are doing, and we're fairly conservative on what we're thinking about the government business as I mentioned in the prepared comments. So, it's yet to see with the budget uncertainty and the change of administration how that's going to play out. My thinking is it's biased to the upside, but we'll have to see how it plays out.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Andy, I just want to say, having worked with you and you were at the divisional level at these trade show, it's been great working with you and I hope for all the best for you in the future.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","One of the things that I noticed was that your R&D spending was up about 20% in the quarter and as a percentage of revenue it was up nearly a 100 basis points and probably took on a couple cents away shares \u2013 cents away from earnings for whatever it's worth. What is that R&D going into why the increase as a percentage of revenue? And what are you going to expect out of it?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure, Jeff. Without question, the biggest driver to that is acquisitions. So that's a majority of the change in spending there because we're picking up the incremental R&D spend from four acquisitions that we've made during the year. The other piece of that though is, we've got a lot of new products coming in the first half of the year, and typically, as you get to the finish line with new products, the spending goes up and we've seen that in Security, we saw it in Instruments as well, and a little bit in OEM. So we'll \u2013 and actually probably a piece of it in Maritime as well. So I think, you'll be pleased with what you see that comes from that additional spending, we've got a lot coming on the new product front, which I'm pretty optimistic about.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Can you describe either the size or the timing of the DR-SKO relative to the last when you had?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. So the timing on it we expect to see something this quarter. As I'd mentioned, it actually slipped out of Q4. We were expecting in Q4, but due to some budget delays it's very likely that we'll move into this quarter. And the size of the orders would likely be in the same kind of zip code that we've had orders in the past, which is in the $50-ish million range.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","And when I say timing I'm talking about period of time over which you expect to have this satisfied?","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So this is Tom, Jeff.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Yes.","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So, you're asking about the deliveries on \u2013 the rate of deliveries basically.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Yeah, rate of deliveries.","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah, it's very similar to the level of the bookings we're talking about. So, there's a bit of a stagger between them. We're trying to maintain that.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Right.","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","But you're looking at something in that the range between $15 million to $20 million per quarter.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. And I apologize for my voice. Can you go into a little bit about \u2013 with regard to what new products \u2013 the Boson sensor is going to be going into, given that it seems to be a very good compromise between very tiny and, let's call it, large. And the question really is not about that you've had out there, you've been talking about it now for a little over a year, year and a half. And what products are we going to see it going to. And will it be going into some \u2013 will it be integrated into some of the stuff that you've gotten through acquisition as well?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah, it's a good question, Jeff. Fundamentally, the Boson has six key aspects to it and that's cost, size, weight, power, resolution, and processing power. And those have always been things that we have driven when we come out with a successive generation core. What's really new about Boson though is the processing power piece that it has this embedded, Myriad 2 processor that gives us a tremendous level of signal processing and artificial intelligence processing capability inside the core. And that's going to manifest its way in terms of enabling our mantra of intelligent imaging in these cores.","You're going to see Boson across pretty much every one of our product lines perhaps, every one of our segments perhaps with the exception of Detection for the time being. So, Surveillance, Instruments, Security, OEM, Maritime, will all be having products that will have Boson at their hearts. It will be the broadest deployment of core technology that we've ever done at the company as it's been a very strong mantra to leverage our research and development investments on a single common platform so that we can get products to market faster and leverage technologies that we develop on the software side across multiple segments.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. One final question, you got a lot out of working capital efficiency this year with regard to your cash flow. How can we view the cash flow that you generated this year, which was a fairly high amount against the investment that you're going to be making into a lot of these new products that are coming out next year to drive revenue? Where is that cash flow going to be deployed and will the levels \u2013 can you talk about \u2013 do you have some idea of where that cash flow level maybe over the course of next year, or we're going to have to wait for the fourth quarter of next year to see how the hockey stick works?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, overall, we expect total cash flow for 2017 to be higher than 2016, but not to the same level that you saw from 2015 to 2016 most likely. And the reason for that is that we'll probably have higher capital spending in 2017 than we had in 2016, it was kind of a light year for us. That said, the current investments that we're planning to make are included in that thinking. Our R&D spending for 2017, as a percent of revenue, will be roughly consistent with what you saw in 2016. We don't expect big changes there.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay, great. And that's it, thank you very much. And again good luck, Andy, we'll be talking.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Good morning.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Just looking at the Prox Dynamics, Black Hornet, I know the marines and army have put the hornet through some testing. Are there any specific near term funding opportunities we should be keeping an eye for?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","There are no programs of record that have been defined yet today. There are some thoughts of programs that are yet to come. And we're involved in those evaluations and we expect to see some more formal competitions and procurement processes that will come out of that. The Prox has done quite well with those products \u2013 with those entities to date and it has also done well with several foreign entities. I think it's a total of 30 different foreign MODs and MOIs that are using the product today. So we feel like we're really well positioned and given the products uniqueness there really is no competition \u2013 direct competition for that product. I think the real game changer relative to Prox's future is the overlay of the FLIR brand, credibility and sales organization that comes from our organization, I think, it's really going to give that product a shot in the arm in terms of its credibility into the markets.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay, thanks. And then just one on Point Grey and the machine vision market. And I know you said that the market set an inflection point here. Can you talk about where infrared penetration might be right now? And then where you see it going as things progress?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah, the comments on the inflection point is really related to the utilization of thermal imaging technology, and machine vision applications. We've had an automation segment for over a decade and it's been growing steadily. The issue though is as we're not a machine vision and automation company today. We will be now that we have Point Grey Research as part of the team. There are unique characteristics to cameras that are used in that space. Unique interfaces, unique timing of the signals and packaging even and the Point Grey team knows this extremely well.","So we can bring that knowledge of the marketplace, the customer applications, the required interfaces and functionality of the products and combine that with the expertise, and manufacturing cost efficiencies that we have in the thermal space. If you think about machine vision application, thermal imaging brings some very interesting capabilities that can't be done with visible imagers. The obvious one are being able to see in total darkness, but less obvious level things like being able to see through factory of obscureness; steam, smoke, dust, there are many situations where those things inhibit the use of visible cameras.","And then of course, we have the ability to accurately measure temperature remotely to look at thermal patterns of products. And there are a lot of applications where knowing the actual temperature or being able to determine the uniformity of the temperature or look for specific thermal patterns associated with sealing or welding or other processes, machining processes, is important to maintaining product quality. And those are the kinds of applications that we're going to go after. We've been doing that for a while in our own automation segment and we feel now the time is right to inject that technology into a more capable organization that can take it to the next level.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah, few follow-ups, guys. I guess first, Andy, on the President Trump's southern border initiative, are you guys seeing anything \u2013 any RFIs, any RFPs out there yet or is it too early?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Too early. Yeah, we haven't seen anything formally yet. I feel pretty good about it, irrespective of how and ultimately get executed whether it's a physical wall or the use of technology. The reality is that the Border Patrol Mission revolves around situational awareness and that's what we do. So whether it'd be ground base systems, pole mounted systems, vehicle mounted systems, systems on UAVs or systems on manned aircraft or systems on marine vessels, we do it all, Board of Control likes us, we've got a very good reputation and track record with CBP.","And I think no matter what ends up going on, if there is more money being spent on the border, I think it's reasonable to think that thermal imaging and FLIR will be a part of that. We're also ramping up our business relative to our radar capabilities and have developed some really good quality ground base radar that I think also could be considered as a augment or whatever final decision has taken for border security.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Got it, got it. Great. And then one for either you or Amit, are you guys assuming any share repurchases in year 2017 EPS guidance and just was wondering explicitly what level of CapEx you're expecting next year also?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So, we \u2013 in the guidance that we've provided, there is not much share repurchase assumed in that. In terms of CapEx, this year was unusually low, a full year was 2.2% of net revenue. Our general guidance has been in the 3% to 4% if you look at the last few years. Next year, we expect it to be in that range of 3% to 4%, not the unusually low 2.2% that we saw this year.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay, okay. And then, Amit, can you quantify the inventory charge, OEM in the quarter and I don't know maybe what product line it related to?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","We don't get into that level of specificity around specifics by segment, but that was a key contributor to the gross margin impact that we had and it was in the OEM segment, there was a little bit in the Instrument segment as well. But we don't give more texture around that.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay, okay. And I promise my last one here. On the accounting, I think in the past you factored \u2013 you haven't factored out amortization of acquired intangibles in your adjusted EPS and I believe it sounds like you're going to now going forward. So...","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Can you repeat?","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. So, can you give us a sense of maybe what you're expecting that level to be acquiring intangibles in 2017 and I don't know if there is any legacy purchase accounting that will flow over 2017 as well and ...","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. So a few \u2013 so you're absolutely right. What we have in terms of what we're going to provide now in the non-GAAP measures and we've defined exactly what the principles are and what those line items are in the attachments that we've provided. But acquisition related activity, one-time costs and\/or the intangible amortization and inventory step-ups are going to be the adjustment that we're going to make, just because as you know, those are lumpy and the calendarization could vary depending on the level of the acquisitions. This year we had probably around $20 million or so related to that, and next year is going to be higher than that both for the inventory step-up, and the amortization of intangibles together.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Okay. And maybe on the purchase accounting, maybe more first half weighted, I would assume?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Next year, yes.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Okay. Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hello, everyone.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Hey, Noah.","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Hello.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Andy, my best wishes as well to you in your retirement.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks. Appreciate it.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","If I were to look at the rank order of the segments growth rates in 2016, which grew the fastest and which grew the slowest, which of those changes it's positioned significantly in 2017 versus 2016?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, I don't have the rank order in front of me. But if I sort of think about what our expectations for the business going forward, we expect the OEM & Emerging segment to continue to do well, it's core business, the launch of Boson, traction that we're getting from Lepton is all positive. The emerging pieces of that business, FLIR ONE, the traffic business, those are both, we expect to continue to do well with new product launches.","And also, of course, the addition of Integrated Imaging Solutions, the Point Grey Research business, as I mentioned in the previous comments, I think they're all going to drive that good growth in that business. We've been pretty conservative about our expectations relative to surveillance I'd say that one is kind of a wildcard for us.","I do expect, good things to come from Prox, but we'll look at how that ultimately plays out. Detection and Maritime, those are both businesses we expect to grow next year as well. We've got a strong cadence of new products that are coming in the Maritime segment, we've got the Miami Boat Show that kicks off this week, and we'll have some product announcements later in the week, talking about what we're doing there. But I'm pretty excited about the opportunities that that brings. And we're being pretty conservative about Instruments right now. We do have a strong cadence of new products that are going to be coming as we've alluded to in previous calls and again here today. But that's a business that's had both currency headwinds and headwinds based on ASP declines. So we're being pretty conservative in our thinking on that business right now.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Andy, are you assuming Surveillance has a positive growth rate in 2017?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah, but it's low.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And I guess, you've given \u2013 you've spoken to the fourth quarter book-to-bill there and the lumpiness of the business. Do you have any other numbers on what that was split by geography? Just my understanding of the lumpiness of your business and the short cycle nature of the business, but seem to be on a recovering trend and most of the sort of leading indicator data points we can look at in U.S. defense seem pretty positive. So was it elsewhere in the world or was it sort of just random including the U.S.?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. So from a booking standpoint, Noah, actually the U.S. and Europe were up in Q4, Middle East was down and it was down pretty strongly and that is a business that is pretty lumpy as we've discussed in the past and I think it's a business that would likely \u2013 will likely rebound again. Actually, I take that back on looking at the data. Now, U.S. was down. Americas, other was up, Europe was up slightly. Middle East and Africa and APAC were down in Q4.","I don't read too deeply into those things though because it just is a lumpy business. The one-point that I made earlier about the Middle East and Africa having some tie to oil prices. We expect that we would see a return there. If I look at the world in total for the full year, the U.S. was down high single digits. The rest, every single other region that we look at Americas, other Europe, Middle East and Africa and APAC were all up for the year in total, bookings for the year were up slightly 2016 versus 2015.","I think we're going to see stronger sales in the U.S. in 2017. We're starting to see some early evidence of that, but I think it's going to be skewed towards the second half of the year as the administration refines its plans for refit of product and for how technology is going to get deployed on the border.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate the color there. So just to make sure I'm clear, you're saying, Surveillance U.S. bookings full year 2016 declined high single digits year-over-year?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","That's correct.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I guess, does that surprise you? We haven't seen that from too many defense companies and, again, budget kind of getting better. You do \u2013 it's really budget authority that's getting better in 2016 and outlays not quite yet. Maybe is that \u2013 are you just waiting for the timing lag to come through there?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. And if we sort of look at the pieces of our business, the things that went down, our integrated systems business was down and those were mostly deliveries into the U.S. and our Maritime business was down, this is bookings again in the U.S. and that's just timing of program last year we had a big \u2013 in 2015, we had a big program, the PB-EOS program, the U.S. Navy Special Operations came through and Coast Guard programs.","And I think it just shifts by customer, so I am a little bit surprised. I would have thought that the U.S. would have been stronger in 2016, but I'm not concerned about it. I'm confident that we're set up pretty well in 2017. You got to keep in mind that our business is short cycle in nature, we're not \u2013 those other companies that you are seeing growth come from are program of record business based, is my guess. And our program of record based business or business that is driven by program of record, manifest itself more so on our OEM business and that business was up significantly, and it's part of our total U.S. government business was up strongly year-over-year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That's really interesting. Any quantification you could provide, even if a relatively wide range on where you expect the total company segment operating margin to come in for 2017?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","I'll have Amit cover that one.","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Hi, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hello.","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","How are you?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Doing well. How are you?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good. So overall, we expect in terms of the non-GAAP adjusted operating margins that we've provided, adjusting out for some of the intangibles we do expect it to go up year-over-year slightly. So it will be in the same ballpark range, but it will be a slight improvement compared to 2016.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So it sounds like you're assuming less than 50 basis points of total segment margin expansion, adjusted?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Right, right around that.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","In the guidance?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","That's right.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, okay, okay. Okay, terrific. Thanks so much.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Noah.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Please go ahead.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. Just one quick question on Security. Have you gotten to a point yet in the retail area where there's been weakness for a couple years due to far eastern imports and things like that, have you gotten to a point of where it's going to \u2013 you can see a bottoming out of that so that the other areas in Security, which do have more growth, can improve? You had growth in that division, it began to slow down, a lot of it due to retail. Are you at that bottom point now that \u2013 where you can start seeing the comps going forward to be not as bad?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So Jeff, the retail space certainly continues to be a very competitive space, and I expect that that's going to continue. Our strategy in dealing with that has two major prongs to it. Number one is differentiate products, and we've got some new products that we will be launching in the retail space that are differentiated from our historical bundled wired and wireless products that we've sold under the Lorex brand. The second thing is, an increased focus on the higher margin parts of that business and that's the former DVTEL business, our Video Management System based business, and enterprise class camera business, and also the thermal camera business, we've got several product introductions that are teed up for the thermal camera space that I think will further extend our leadership there as the adoption rate of thermal and security particularly enterprise based applications increases.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","All right. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Great. Thank you all for joining the call today.

Andy?","Andrew Teich","Thanks, Todd, and thank you for joining us for FLIR's first quarter 2017 earnings call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; SVP of Global Product Strategy, Jeff Frank; and SVP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison.","I'll start to review the first quarter with Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $407 million, an increase of 7% over the prior year. Commercial products revenue grew 12% over the first quarter of 2016 and government products grew 2%. The addition of our recently acquired businesses drove this growth. On an organic basis, first quarter revenue declined 2% as we saw softness in Surveillance and in the retail channel of the Security segment. The Instruments and Maritime segment had single-digit revenue declines as backlog increased due to new product introductions in the quarter. Partially offsetting these declines was 29% organic growth in our OEM and Emerging segment.","Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income grew 9% and 12% respectively, in comparison to the prior year. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were $0.36, which represents 13% growth versus last year's adjusted EPS of $0.32. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $75 million or 176% of our GAAP net income in the quarter and was 64% higher than the prior year, driven primarily by continued improvement in our working capital levels, particularly accounts receivable in the current quarter. Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter at $608 million, up 3% since the end of 2016. This month, we produced our 1 millionth Lepton camera core.","The revolutionarily small and significantly lower-cost sensor has enabled a significant expansion in the use of our technology. Since its launch in 2014, we've seen a 58% compound annual growth rate in our total unit volumes, as we've developed more than 20 FLIR-branded products utilizing Lepton and delivered tens of thousands to other companies who have successfully integrated it into their own products.","2017 is going to be a strong year for new product introductions for many of our businesses. Since our last earnings call in February, our Instruments segment introduced the new EXX line of mid-price point planned predictive maintenance and building handheld thermal cameras. Instruments also brought to market two new high-speed thermal imaging cameras for science and research applications and the new ETS320 benchtop thermal camera for electronics product development and testing applications.","The Security segment announced several new products as well, our new patent [ph] product, a 4K box camera and corner mount security cameras. In the OEM segment, we launched a new variant of our Lepton with 4x more pixels than the previous Lepton. And our Maritime segment launched a breakthrough line of thermal cameras for boaters as well as the new Axiom family of Raymarine-branded multifunction displays that feature revolutionary new 3D sonar technology.","On Slide 4, you'll see our outlook for 2017. We continue to expect full year 2017 revenue to be in the range of $1.78 billion and $1.83 billion and adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.81 to $1.91. This assumes organic revenue growth in addition to the growth associated with our recently acquired businesses. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share which will be payable on June 9 to shareholders of record as of May 26.","I'll now ask Amit to review the first quarter financial results. Amit?","Amit Singhi","Thanks, Andy. Good morning. On Slide 5, you'll see our first quarter financial results. Please note, all of these financials are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the slide appendix.","Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $407 million, a 7% increase compared to the first quarter of 2016. Exchange rate changes negatively affected revenue growth by about 100 basis points. Excluding the results of acquisitions made in the last 12 months, year-over-year revenue decreased $9 million or about 2%, more than explained by a decline in the Surveillance segment. OEM & Emerging and Detection segments grew 77% and 9%, respectively. Instruments, Security, Surveillance and Maritime declined 2%, 4%, 4% and 6%, respectively. Geographically, revenue increased in the U.S. and Asia by 14% and 23%, respectively, while it declined in Canada, Latam, Europe and Middle East and Africa by 23%, 1% and 12%, respectively. ","Sales to the U.S. government increased versus last year by 36% to about $106 million, representing about 29% of total revenue. Consolidated first quarter adjusted gross margin was 48%, about 90 basis points higher than last year. At constant currency, gross margin improved by about 130 basis points year-over-year, driven primarily by improvements in all standard variances. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 17%, about 70 basis points higher than last year. At constant currency, operating margin improved by about 90 basis points year-over-year, driven by the increase in gross margin.","Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2017 totaled $49.6 million, 10% higher than prior year, and adjusted EPS was $0.36, 13% higher than prior year. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter increased 64% from year-ago levels to $75 million or 152% of adjusted net income. Our quarterly cash conversion cycle reduced by over 10 day's year-over-year as a result of our working capital improvement initiatives. We did not have any acquisition-related outflows in the quarter nor did we repurchase any shares.","Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $13.6 million, slightly higher than last year. During the quarter, we returned $20.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends, $4 million higher than prior year as a result of our 25% year-over-year dividend per share increase announced earlier this year. We closed the fourth quarter with cash of $397 million.","This concludes the summary of our financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?","Thomas Surran","Thank you, Amit. Slide 6 is a summary of the first quarter results by segment. The OEM & Emerging segment drove the overall revenue growth of 7%, with 77% revenue growth for this segment. Organic growth for the OEM segment was 29%. ","Growth in segment level operating income was 10%, again, driven by the OEM segment growth of 128%. Operating margin improvement outpaced revenue growth due to improved gross margins.","Moving to Slide 7 to cover the Surveillance segment. First quarter revenue for Surveillance was $118.7 million, down 4% from the first quarter of 2016. The additions of Prox Dynamics and Armasight businesses were not enough to offset slower international shipments and the delay of a $6 million delivery to a specific U.S. customer. Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $26.4 million, down 26% versus the prior year due to product mix and higher operating expenses as a percentage of the soft revenue. Surveillance backlog declined $8 million from the end of 2016 to $320 million but is up 2% from one year ago. Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 1.0 in the first quarter.","On Slide 8 is a summary of our Instruments segment. Revenue declined 2% as compared to the first quarter of 2016 to $77.9 million. Revenue growth from firefighting products was overshadowed by declines in the planned predictive maintenance and building product line, as customers awaited deliveries of the recently introduced products. Backlog for Instruments increased 15% during the quarter, mainly due to bookings for new products launched during the quarter, including new offerings in the plant, predictive, maintenance and building line. Instruments operating profit in the first quarter increased 6% from the first quarter of 2016 to $21.1 million or 27% of revenue. Better gross margins, combined with reduced operating expenses helped to improve operating margin 200 basis points.","During the quarter, Instruments introduced several new products, as shown on Slide 9. First with the launch of the new EXX Series product line into the mid-range plant, predictive, maintenance and building market. This replaces the existing EXX Series of products which were originally launched in 2011. These new FLIR EXX Series cameras were redesigned from the handle up and improved on the previous version with Wi-Fi connectivity, interchangeable lenses with autocalibration, laser-assisted autofocus, a larger and brighter touchscreen and improved image processing capabilities such as UltraMax and MSX.","A couple of weeks ago, Instruments Science business launched two new high-speed thermal cameras at the SPEI Show in Anaheim. For use by scientific technicians and researchers, the X6900sc SLS and the X8500sc SLS cameras can capture thermal images at up to 1,004 frames per second and measure temperatures up to 3,000 degrees Celsius. In this week, Instruments introduced the ETS320, a hands-free benchtop thermal imaging system for using testing and analyzing circuit boards and electronic components. The ETS320 is a new factor -- form factor for thermal sensing that we expect to be extremely valuable for evaluating the performance of electronic systems that are continuously shrinking in size yet growing in power and processing.","On Slide 10, you will see the Security segment's results. Security's first quarter revenue of $45.1 million was down 4% compared to last year's first quarter. This decline was due largely to continued softness in the retail channel for visible security systems, which offset good results from lower [ph] e-commerce business and FLIR-branded enterprise-class security solutions. Security operating income was $300,000 for the seasonally weak first quarter, but operating margins increased 530 basis points, with improved gross margins and lower operating expenses compared to the first quarter 2016.","Moving to Slide 11; at the ISC West Security Conference in Las Vegas, the Security segment launched Version 8.0 of FLIR's enterprise-class united video management solution with global administration across multiple sites, enhanced online security credentials, simplified system installation and streamlined camera discovery. Also introduced at ISC West were three new FLIR-branded security cameras; the PT Series dual-sensor camera that features a cool or uncool thermal camera and then the HD visible cameras; the Quasar 4K visible spectrum box camera that is uniquely compact and designed to enable a multitude of integration options; and the Aerial 3 Visible Spectrum Megapixel Corner Camera that provides ceiling-to-floor and wall-to-wall views and a Vandal-proof flush mount housing.","The results for the OEM and Emerging segment are shown on Slide 12. OEM and Emerging first quarter revenue was $84.8 million, increasing 77% over last year and reaching another all-time high for the segment. The creation of OEM's intelligent imaging solutions line of business from the acquisition of Point Grey helped drive growth in the quarter, as did continued strength in military-grade thermal camera cores and Lepton cores. OEM and Emerging operating profit reached an all-time quarterly high of $24.4 million, more than double the prior year. Product mix, improved manufacturing variance, and better factory absorption helped drive higher gross margins versus the prior year.","As Andy noted, we reached an important milestone this April when we produced our 1 millionth Lepton. Additionally, we introduced a new variant of the Lepton to our OEM customers, this one with 160 by 120 resolution, which is 4x the number of pixels as the existing Lepton on the market.","Turning to Slide 13, Maritime segment revenues were $48.6 million, a decline of 6% versus the prior year. Like what was seen in the instruments around the anticipation of the new product rollouts, revenue was soft in thermal cameras and multifunction displays, with new offerings introduced in both lines during the quarter. Backlog from the Maritime segment grew 27% during the quarter. Maritime operating income was $5.2 million in the quarter, with operating margins declining 50 basis points, due primarily to the soft top line despite improved gross margins.","At the Miami Boat Show in February, the Maritime segment introduced the latest variance of the FLIR M-series thermal cameras and the new Axiom generation of Raymarine multifunction displays. The new M132 is a highly compact, adjustable tilt thermal imaging system that utilizes our [indiscernible] camera core to create a new entry-level price point for fixed-mount thermal maritime cameras at $2,500. The M232 adds full pan-tilt capability and a 2x digital zoom. When either of these new M-series cameras are added to a Raymarine multifunction display with a lighthouse 3 operating system, the boater can utilize our new FLIR crew's intelligent thermal analytics technology that detects and alerts on objects or obstacles that are in the water.","The M300 and 600 series of thermal cameras were also updated with an improved visible imager, and stabilization was added to all models. The new Raymarine Axiom generation of high-performance MFDs are all-glass touchscreens that featured the new Intuitive Lighthouse 3 Operating System, a Quad core processor for powerful and fast operation and a real vision 3D sonar built in to create lifelike views of beneath the boat.","Our Detection segment results are summarized on Slide 14. Detection's first quarter revenue was up 9% year-over-year to $31.8 million. This growth was broad, but particular strength came from radiation product deliveries to the U.S. Domestic Nuclear Detection Office and other U.S. federal agencies. Operating margin was down slightly from 28% last year to 27% in the first quarter as a result of slightly higher R&D spend. Detection finished the first quarter with $74 million of backlog, increasing $17 million due to the receipt of another order from the U.S. Department of Defense for DRSKO units; this one for $54 million of deliveries through Q2 of 2018.","That concludes my summary of the segment's first quarter. I'll now pass the call back over to Andy.","Andrew Teich","Thanks, Tom. The first quarter was a success on many fronts. Top line growth of 7% with improved gross margins helped drive a 13% increase in adjusted EPS. We were efficient in converting that income into cash, with quarterly operating cash flow growing 64% year-over-year.","Our recent acquisitions are integrating well and are adding value strategically and financially. Organic growth was below expectations, particularly in the Surveillance segment, but we see this as a temporary timing-related issue and expect to see Surveillance return to growth in the second quarter. We're happy with the investments that we've been making in products and processes. Recent products introductions are providing to be a success, and more innovations we have coming are expected to add to our momentum. And the investments we've been making in improving our manufacturing yields are beginning to show success through higher profit margins.","To update you on the CEO transition, our Board of Directors has been working with our search firm to identify high-quality candidates, and that process continues. We hope to bring someone into the role in the near term. We do not have any updates at this time. ","I continue to lead the business, and we intend to run uninterrupted as we continue to focus on serving our customers and executing our strategic plans to deliver shareholder value. I'd like to now open the call for Q&A. Adam?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducted a Question-and-Answer Session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company.","Jim Ricchiuti","Thank you. Good morning. I just wanted to go back to the Surveillance segment. The pickup you're expecting in Q2, is that the delivery of the shipment that was delayed in Q1, that $6 million? Just trying to get a sense as to what's going to drive that.","Andrew Teich","That will be part of it, Jim. We did have that one $6 million order that was delayed. That order has now been received and is skewed for delivery. We have the equipment actually produced and sitting on the shelf, ready to go. So that's part of what will be an uptick in Q2. We also had some international revenue that was delayed due to either customer issues or licensing issues. So we feel that some of that revenue will flow through as well. And we're also expecting stronger bookings in Q2 -- Q2 or Q1, the bookings were a little bit lower than we had expected. The $6 million order was part of that, but there were others as well. The Middle East was kind of slow in Q1, and we expect that to return to growth in Q2.","Jim Ricchiuti","Okay. And just turning to the commercial OEM & Emerging. It looks like you guys had a real strong quarter. And I wanted to maybe understand a little bit more of the drivers on the organic side and it does appear, it sounds -- it appears that Point Grey is off to a good start. And maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in that part of the business?","Thomas Surran","Sure, Jim. I'm going to hit the organic piece first, then I'll come back to Point Grey. But on the organic side, I think that there are three drivers in the OEM business that have been driving the organic growth. So one of those is the launch of Boson, so we're starting to get traction with that product. The second is continued traction coming from Lepton. So Lepton's doing well, and obviously we talked about the million unit milestone there. And the third one is continued strength in the defense side of that business, with [indiscernible] being one of the larger customers there. The both bookings and revenue have been quite strong, and we expect that to continue through the rest of the year.","Moving over to the inorganic side and the OEM; Point Grey or Integrated Imaging System, IIS, as we call them, had an excellent quarter, very strong bookings and backlog build, significantly ahead of our investment case. And we think that will continue in Q2. So demand has been strong there, team's been executing really well, very good integration as well. So we're feeling good about that business, and demand has been strong.","Jim Ricchiuti","And the markets where that's been strong, Andy?","Andrew Teich","So there are two primary markets that have been strong in IIS. One is the machine vision market, so there they're selling cameras that are doing inspection of new product developments. We can't talk specifically about customers there but this has just been very high demand related to some new product development that are coming in the market in the consumer space. And the second area is in the people counting business. So there we have stereo vision cameras that are utilized in primarily retail environments for counting customers as they enter and exit the store and we've seen a pretty strong uptick in orders there as well.","Jim Ricchiuti","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho from William Blair.","Jonathan Ho","I just wanted to start with some of the weakness in the Surveillance business. And are you anticipating any potential impact from the situation in Washington, particularly around the potential for a continuing resolution?","Andrew Teich","Yes, Jonathan, it's always difficult to predict what the impact of a CR is. In the past those have had mixed effects on our results. Much of the products that we supply into the U.S. though are supplied under an urgent needs basis. And as we've spoken in the past, we don't have a high level of program of record business in our backlog. But that said, it is a little bit difficult to predict. I would say that on the demand side, we've seen a fairly high level of activity in the RFI, RFQ space in the last 90 days. And I think the general theme of the rebuild of the U.S. Military and retrofit of older equipment is a positive sign for our sector in general. But at this point, I think it's a little bit difficult to predict. I'm feeling pretty good about how I see it factoring. Our U.S. business was up, our DOD business bookings were up slightly in Q1 from a Surveillance standpoint. Overall, they were up significantly, but that was largely bolstered by the DRSKO order and detection.","Jonathan Ho","Great. And then just in terms of the initial reception for the new products. It looks like you guys have some backlog orders there but just wanted to kind of see what you're hearing from customers. And how much elasticity do you think you can drive with sort of the new product categories on the commercial side?","Andrew Teich","The initial reception so the new product has been quite good, and the primary areas that saw new product launches during the quarter were in Instruments and Maritime. And in both of those cases, we built backlog rather significantly; it was about a $4 million backlog building each of those two segments. And the majority of the backlog built in both of those cases was related to the new products that were launched but we weren't able to ship as we ramp up production in those products. That will flush through in the current quarter. The overall reaction of the products has been quite good. In the Instruments space, the EXX products, the new products in the science business will help to drive a refreshed cycle. The EXX product was initially launched in 2011, and we have a pretty large installed base, it was a very high-selling product for us from a volume standpoint. And as a result, I expect to see a product refresh cycle, given the age of many of those cameras that are out there and the feature set that is offered by the new products.","And similarly, in the Maritime space, the lower-priced thermal cameras that we've launched, I think, can really flex the price elasticity that's in that market, getting down to a cost that is close to the cost of a radar. It's something that we've had as a vision for that business for a long time. And the new Axiom product line is very powerful, has very innovative features and is really the first major platform change that we've had in that business since the launch of the Adam product a year after we acquired the business in 2010.","Jonathan Ho","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead.","Peter Skibitski","Good morning. So on the first quarter revenues being a bit light, you're saying it was primarily -- you think, due to the timing and new product instructions, not necessarily due to kind of a macro weakness or any weakness from the DOD continuing resolution?","Andrew Teich","There were two things, Pete. The majority of the revenue shortfall was actually in Surveillance, and in that case, it was a combination of timing of orders and issues related to orders and backlog that prevented us from shipping them in the current quarter, many of which we expect to get resolved in the current quarter. The second issue was the aforementioned point that I was mentioning to Jonathan about the backlog build related to the new products that were launched, fairly light in the quarter in Instruments and Maritime.","Peter Skibitski","Okay, okay. And the 29% organic growth in OEM, was that largely the timing of lightning part [ph] deliveries, mainly, and also maybe if Lepton for FLIR-1?","Andrew Teich","It's not a timing issue, actually. That business has had steady growth. There was not a backlog build in that business. So it's just strong orders across the board in those three categories that I mentioned; lightning, of course is part of our military-oriented cores and components but we saw strong demand in the Lepton, we saw strong demand in Boson. And then of course, as we've mentioned earlier, the IIS segment, the former Point Grey business had very strong demand, there was a backlog build in that particular area, and the industry in general has had strong demand in both machine vision and people counting.","Peter Skibitski","Okay. So I mean, OEM organic growth, I mean, my takeaway is it seems like you're taking OEM for the full year to be a double-digit organic grower. Is that a fair takeaway?","Andrew Teich","It will be double-digit -- well, now looking at it from an organic standpoint, I think it will be high single digits for OEM. But the inorganic growth in OEM coming from IIS will drive overall revenue well in the double digits.","Peter Skibitski","Okay, okay. My last one, I'll get to the end of the queue; do you guys have any visibility on the opportunity for the new Southern border wall technology?","Thomas Surran","Well, that one is hard to predict but I can tell you two things. Obviously, that we're seeing some political rhetoric suggesting that there might be a little bit more of an emphasis on technology versus physical walls. If that does happen, and again, I think it's hard to predict right now, but if that does happen, we're well positioned. We have a very strong position on the border. As a technology provider, we've been very successful for decades providing very useful technology, both in thermal imaging and, on an increasing level in radar. And the platforms that we have out there today, whether it be handheld, UAS, airborne, vehicle-mounted or pole-mounted, we've got systems across every one of those platforms and they're very well-liked and well-respected by CPP and border patrol.","Pete, I just want to go back on one other thing on an OEM organic; the other program that's been doing well from the [indiscernible] standpoint are the what's reefed to as the layer cum [ph], these are the anti-missile defense systems that are mounted on aircraft. So that's a program that's been doing pretty well.","Peter Skibitski","Got it. Very helpful, thank you.","Thomas Surran","My pleasure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Please go ahead.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good afternoon guys, this is actually Les [ph] in for Mike. One question for you on the margin side, specifically when it comes to Surveillance and Security, just year-over-year and sequentially in Surveillance was down. So maybe comment a little bit on that. I understand that was a product mix issue and then also on the Security side as well, if you could.","Andrew Teich","Sure, Les. On the Surveillance side, it is largely product mix. That's a business that margins can move around, depending on the mix of sales between airborne, maritime, land-based units. So that drove the margins down a little bit in that business. Generally, though, we've been seeing the mix in the backlog improve. In Security, margins were up overall, and largely, that was coming from better margins in our e-commerce business. And we have better margins associated with the thermal products and the software products that are coming from the former DVTEL [ph]. In that business, the traditional retail margins are the weakest in that space, and we had growth in those other areas and declines in the retail space, which drove, I think, it's around 530 basis points of total operating margin improvement in the Security space year-over-year.","Unidentified Analyst","And would you say looking into the second half for the year, maybe even 2Q, margin should improve slightly? Or...","Andrew Teich","Yes, margins will improve sequentially in both of the as the year progresses.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it, okay. And then just one last one for me; any issues in a product cannibalization on introduction? And I understand there's some hold-off period because of the new introductions, but any comment on that?","Andrew Teich","There are some normal ramp-up that's associated with the production of new products that are introduced in the quarter. All of the products that have been launched in Q1 are in production at this point and shipping, so I don't anticipate any problems.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, thank you.","Andrew Teich","My pleasure.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Kessler from Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey Kessler","I have a couple of questions. First, it appears that what you've done this year is to invest very heavily over the course of -- after your R&D has come out of the woodwork. And you've launched, at the end of last year and into this year, a lot of new products, which have, I'm going to say, frozen the market. But given pauses, looking at replacing products in about three -- at least three of your categories; I know you can't sequence this to make it easier because each division is different, but the question really -- the question really involves, what are we going to see in terms of sequential margin improvement as these new products begin to replace the older products? And what is the, essentially, the sequence of revenue replacement that we're going to see? Because, again, we haven't seen as big a replacement cycle over several divisions of yours as we have this year.","Andrew Teich","Sure, Jeff. So your point is correct. We've been investing over the course of the last couple of years in these new product platforms. And many of these platforms run on about a two-year cycle. And we foreshadowed this in previous calls that we were expecting those cycles to come to fruition in the early part of 2017. And we've seen some of those product launches already. There are still some that are yet to come. The new products that we have launched support company-wide gross margin targets. And in many cases, the margin profile of those products are better than the gross margins of the products that they are replacing. The fact that we had three segments, launched new products all in the same quarter is largely related to timing and meant that our industry. Many times, we tried to align product launches with major trade shows in the industry. But we have other new products that are yet to launch in Q2 and in H2 of this year. So to answer your ultimate question as to how this is going to affect margins overall, we expect margins improve sequentially as the year progresses, and that's a function of the new product launches and the other efficiencies that we've been driving in the business. Some of those manifested themselves in Q1.","Jeffrey Kessler","And the segments that will be most affected by new product launches that haven't been announced yet are going to be where? Or you don't want to give that out yet?","Andrew Teich","Yes, I don't really want to talk about which specific segments will have new products that are coming, but we've got a fair bit yet to go for 2017 on the new product front.","Jeffrey Kessler","Let me focus on just one area, and that's Security. Clearly, obviously, at the retail level, there's a race to the bottom in -- it's a race to the bottom in retail pricing. On that -- looking -- in that your new products that you've introduced before them should clearly show where your focus is going to be at from the new major VMS area to the high visible spectrum IP box camera. Are these the types of introductions in Security that we are likely to see going forward? This is a fairly large amount of new products that you introduced, at least the ISE tradeshow and other trade shows as well. I'm wondering how you expect this to effect the revenues in the business, which have been volatile over in that segment over the last couple of years, as you've gone from small product, which has gone way up. Now it's come down. And they're going back to enterprise-level products, some of which are quite high-end, but some of which are mid-market products.","Andrew Teich","Yes, Jeff. There's a couple of things there. One of the things is that the new products that we have announced that we'll continue to announce are going to hit on three majors themes; integrated products, differentiate products and intelligent products. So those will help to set these products apart from the commoditized, low-end retail businesses that you started your question with. The other two areas that we're going to focus on are enterprise and perimeter Security. And the reason for that is not only do they benefit from those three aforementioned points, but they're also areas that pull on strengths that we have at FLIR. Thermal imaging and radar, for example, are both technologies that are highly beneficial for perimeter applications. Enterprise locations, in general, have both perimeter and interior applications that exist, and we see the perimeter side of that equation presenting an opportunity for FLIR that we can take advantage of, utilizing the core technologies that we have in the company.","So you'll see more to come there in terms of technology and product launches, but I feel confident that we'll be well positioned to enter those spaces that will be able to drive higher margins from those segments than we have historically from the retail segment of the business. It's...","Jeffrey Kessler","And how far -- with these new products, how far down the line in terms of, what we call, pipeline discussions are you in towards getting these toward? Maybe there is a backlog that's really built here, but the pipeline and the nature of the pipeline may be important.","Andrew Teich","Well, if you look at pipeline, it starts with demand, and we believe that the demand exists for these kinds of applications. The next step down in the pipeline is what distribution looks like, and distribution is largely established through our existing businesses in that space. And then the next phase is really product execution, and that's the part that is under development, in some cases. Some products have already been launched, but we have more to come later in the year that will hit these themes that I've spoken about earlier.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is a follow-up question from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.","Peter Skibitski","Not to belabor the point, but I want to talk more about Security on the revenue side. So Andy, you guys are going to stay in the retail side. I know lauric some had some headwinds and the foreign competition. But you want to stay in the real retail space, I think, it sounds like. And I guess, my question is what are your return to growth in retail? And can your move to sort of enterprise, outpace, if you will, the headwinds in retail?","Andrew Teich","Yes, thanks, Pete. It's a good question to ask here because the commoditized, undifferentiated part of retail is something that is not a focus for us. We want to move to a space that pulls on those themes of integration, differentiation and intelligent-enabled products. And there will be a retail component of that, but it's going to be at the higher end of the retail market and more into the small and medium business integrated portion of the market. I think it'll take some time to create that evolution, but generally, that's where we won a vector of the business. And that'll be a higher-margin business and a less commoditized business that'll pull on the strengths that we have inherent in the technology base that we have at FLIR.","Peter Skibitski","Is it going to take a while to make that shift? In other words, should organic growth in Security be down this year? And hopefully, by next year, you're going to get that enterprise side going?","Andrew Teich","Yes, I think that, that's -- it will take some time because some of the strategy relies on products that we have not yet launched, and those products are going to be required to drive organic growth back into that business in a meaningful way.","Peter Skibitski","Okay, got it. And one last one for Amit. So Amit, so free cash conversion was good this quarter. I think it was 1.4x. Are you expecting -- could it be more than 1 on a full year basis also in the free cash conversion? And then just wondering if you could talk about you been here for probably long enough time now to see if there's any real inventory reduction opportunity at FLIR or if there is just kind of the nature of the business in terms of these levels of inventory.","Amit Singhi","Yes. So the free cash flow conversion will be more than 1 projected for the full year. The operating cash flow as a percentage of income will be more than one as well. So that is the plan. It won't be as high as it was in this quarter. At 52% [ph] on operating cash flow as a percent of net income, it won't be that high, but it will be above one. On inventory, also, while this quarter, we were higher when you look at the DIO year-over-year, that went in the right direction, depending on the revenue and the sales. But we do expect to continue our inventory reduction initiatives, including the monthly reviews that Tom's been having with the segment, and that will provide production year-over-year.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Asher Carey from Baird. Please go ahead.","Asher Carey","This is Asher on the call for Peter Arment. I have a question, a follow-up to a previous question on the adoption of current products and how you're seeing the road map for additional products. I know you have 20 out there right now or more than that. And how we expect the product mix to grow, how OEM conversations are developing, but more specifically, if you could touch on the that zone and its reception to date. How are you seeing that growth being accepted? Is it still ramping? Or has it leveled off? And how has that put the Lepton on the map for other parties to become more serious about considering the inclusion and other devise to drive volumes?","Andrew Teich","Thanks, Asher. Those are all great questions. We're all very happy with the traction that Lepton is getting. We have a personal goal for hitting the 1 million unit mark for Lepton number, pleased that we have hit that now. And having launched more than 20 products under the FLIR brand with Lepton, those products are all doing very well. Our total unit volumes nearly doubled year-over-year this quarter for thermal products. So we're getting very good traction with those products, and I like the fact that every one of those sale creates a new demographer out there, and that's a person that has the potential to move up the product line into product like the EXX that we just launched late in Q1. Relative to CAT phone, continues to do very well. We're in undersupply situation, so we're still supplying-constraint on [indiscernible]. We could actually sell more of those if we could supply more Leptons into that. And that's really a yield issue. And we made very good progress on yield improvements during the quarter, and I expect that to continue into the first half of the year.","So I'm pleased with the way the CAT phone has been doing, and there are several other manufacturers of similar products in the market that have been looking at and experimenting with the integration of Lepton into other mobile platforms. So we will see more products on that front in the coming months and throughout the year.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions in queue at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Andrew Teich","Thanks, Adam. Overall, we're pleased with the results from the quarter. We saw good revenue growth, good growth in our backlog and launched several great new products with more to follow. I'm particularly pleased with the gross margin improvement we saw and the smoothness and efficacy of the integration of our recent acquisitions. I want to think the nearly 3,500 FLIR employees for executing our strategic initiatives in Q1 and for continuing to support me and the rest of the executive team as we prepare for leadership transition. Thank you all for joining us on the call today.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude the teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day."],"9566":["FLIR Systems, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Jay Gentzkow, Head of Investor Relations for FLIR Systems. Please go ahead sir.","Jay Gentzkow","Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Please note that our earnings press release and presentation slides referred to on this call are available under the Events & Presentations section of www.flir.com\\investor.","Before we begin, I need to remind you that statements made on this call other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on our current expectations. Words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, and believes, and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Please refer to the earnings press release we issued earlier today for a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecasts. The forward-looking statements we make today, speak as of today and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statement to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","We'll be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP information is useful, because it can enhance the understanding of our core ongoing operating results and facilitate consistent comparison of results over time. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in this morning's earnings press release.","With that, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim Cannon, President and CEO of FLIR Systems.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining FLIR's first quarter 2019 earnings call. With Jay and me today are Carol Lowe, our CFO; Travis Merrill, President of our Commercial Business Unit; Frank Pennisi, President of our Industrial Business Unit; and David Ray, President of our Government & Defense Business Unit.","On today's call we will focus upon three key messages. First, historically high bookings position the business to achieve our 2019 growth objectives. Second, the team's steady commitment to productivity improvements is enabling us to harvest gains to invest back in the business, while maintaining margins. And finally, we continue to make exciting progress on our strategic initiatives to fuel, feed and focus the business with The FLIR Method as the foundation to drive long-term value creation.","I'll start the review of the quarter on slide 3 of the presentation with a few financial highlights. Carol will provide more color later in our prepared remarks.","As announced earlier this morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $445 million. Organic top line growth was in line with our expectations at 1%. Foreign exchange negatively impacted growth by 2%. Organic bookings growth exceeded our expectations in the quarter increasing 34% year-over-year.","Historically, high bookings were driven by both franchise program wins as well as non-programmatic order momentum in the Government & Defense and Industrial Business Units. With the second consecutive quarter of robust bookings, we're on track with our long-term financial objectives.","Total company 12-month current backlog increased 13% to $672 million, compared to the balance at the end of the first quarter of 2018. Total backlog increased 19% to $836 million over the same period. Notably in the quarter, we grew current backlog by more than 26% in our Government & Defense Business Unit.","Adjusted gross profit increased 7% versus first quarter 2018. Adjusted gross margins improved 270 basis points to 53%, the highest quarterly adjusted gross margin since 2012. Gross margin expansion was due to favorable mix and the team's efforts to drive productivity initiatives through The FLIR Method.","Adjusted operating income increased 11% over the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted operating margin also improved up 190 basis points in comparison to last year.","We realized solid operating leverage with adjusted earnings per share growing 10%, compared to the first quarter 2018. Operating cash flow reached $56 million for the quarter, up 29% over first quarter 2018.","Turning to our outlook. We're maintaining full year 2019 expectations as communicated in February. We continue to expect full year revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10%, which includes organic growth of approximately 5%.","As we outlined on the fourth quarter call, unlike last year, we expect stronger second half 2019 revenue growth versus the first half. We also continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.36.","As communicated on the fourth quarter call, our 2019 adjusted EPS outlook includes approximately $0.06 of dilution from the Aeryon Labs and Endeavor Robotics acquisitions. We expect to realize the majority of that dilution in the second quarter of 2019, as these high-growth businesses scale into the second half of the year.","Finally, we announced a quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share, which will be payable on June 7 to shareholders of record of May 24.","Turning to slide 4. We began the year with solid progress on our strategic priorities to fuel, feed and focus the business with The FLIR Method as its foundation. I'd like to highlight a few key first quarter developments.","We'll start with fuel on slide 5, where we advanced many near-term opportunities to gain scale in the business. In the quarter, the Government & Defense Business Unit was awarded a $48 million development contract from the U.S. Department of Defense for a Sensor Suite Upgrade for the Nuclear, Biological, Chemical Reconnaissance Vehicle or NBCRV. FLIR will be the lead developer and integrator in providing a wide selection of modernization capabilities on this manned and unmanned platform application.","Along with our $158 million IDIQ program for the Man Transportable Robotic Systems Increment II program or MTRS, these franchise programs are clear examples of our evolution to a full-scale solution provider. Also in the quarter, as detailed on the year-end call, the Government & Defense Business Unit won two franchise programs to deliver Black Hornet solutions; the next phase of the U.S. Army's $40 million Soldier Borne System program or SBS; and the French Ministry of Defense's $89 million IDIQ program to deliver Black Hornet Personal Reconnaissance Systems or PRS.","Additionally, we were also awarded a $2 million contract from the British Army to deliver Black Hornet PRS, demonstrating solid global interest for Black Hornet solutions from Allied militaries.","Government & Defense franchise program wins in the first quarter were important contributors to bookings strength and helped successfully offset sun setting 2018 programs. While not at the scale of the Government & Defense programs our Industrial and Commercial Business Units continue to advance franchise programs. Wins around Neutrino cooled cores, premium handhelds, machine vision cameras, intelligent traffic systems and smart and connected cities continue to gain traction. And we look forward to updating you on wins in the coming quarters.","Turning to slide 6. Our Industrial Business Unit launched several exciting new products since our last earnings call. And I'd like to highlight a few. In February, we introduced two optical gas imaging or OGI cameras for the oil and gas industry. The FLIR GF620 is our highest-resolution cooled thermal OGI camera. This best-in-class handheld thermal camera detects and visualizes leaks of hydrocarbon gases and other volatile organic compound emissions allowing inspectors to effectively and safely scan thousands of components from greater distances.","We also introduced the FLIR GF77, the industry's first uncooled methane-detecting OGI camera. Using a uncooled core significantly lowers the cost compared to other cooled OGI cameras providing more oil and gas professionals access to differentiated infrared technology, to reduce emissions and ensure safer work environment.","Additionally, in April, we announced the FLIR K1 our most competitively priced thermal camera for first responders and fire investigators. This rugged compact thermal imaging camera detects heat and provides visibility through smoke and in total darkness at a more affordable price point. The K1 will provide more first responders with lifesaving technology to improve situational awareness and keep their community safe.","Also this month, we launched two FLIR studio software products. The FLIR Research Studio is a new thermal imaging software for R&D and science professionals. This multi-platform software is designed for R&D and engineering teams to easily collaborate on data collection, analysis and sharing of FLIR camera images. In addition, we introduced FLIR Thermal Studio. Thermal Studio is a thermal imaging analysis and reporting software designed to manage large sets of thermal images and videos.","Engineered for thermographers, who use FLIR thermal handheld cameras, OGI cameras and unmanned systems with thermal cameras Thermal Studios' advanced processing capabilities and automation are designed to increase work efficiency and productivity. We're excited about the possibilities these two software tools bring to enhancing our customers experience with FLIR cameras.","Turning to slide 7. We continue to feed targeted opportunities with long-term growth trajectories through strategic investments. Starting on the left side, with our recent unmanned developments in April, we made a strategic minority share investment in DroneBase. DroneBase is an exciting early-stage company that provides businesses access to a large unmanned aerial surveillance pilot network.","As part of our investment, FLIR will be the exclusive provider of thermal product technology for DroneBase's inspection services. In addition, it establishes FLIR as the official UAS training partner for their enterprise pilot network through FLIR's Infrared Training Center. Our investment will not only expand the adoption of FLIR thermal imaging technology, but provide DroneBase users with more valuable, actionable information to make better real-time decisions.","We spoke in detail on the fourth quarter call about our two recent acquisitions Aeryon Labs and Endeavor Robotics. We successfully closed on the acquisition of Endeavor in the quarter and they've joined Aeryon in the Unmanned Systems and Integrated Solutions division within the Government & Defense Business Unit. Integration is progressing as planned and we're excited about the capabilities these two companies bring to FLIR's unmanned platform.","Finally, since its introduction in January, the Commercial Business Unit's groundbreaking assisted docking technology Raymarine DockSense continues to gain significant traction. We've received strong industry support including collaborations with boat makers Beneteau and Boston Whaler; and leading engine manufacturer Mercury Marine. We're enthusiastic about DockSense's future potential. The momentum for unmanned solutions across all of our business units has resulted in a bookings increase of approximately $60 million compared to the first quarter of 2018. We're encouraged about the recent developments in our unmanned platform and its long-term growth potential.","Moving to the right side of slide 7. We believe thermal will play a critical role in saving lives as the ADAS market develops and have made strategic investments to position FLIR for that long-term opportunity. The Industrial Business Unit's second-generation thermal vision automotive developer kit or ADK introduced in early Q1 continues to gain traction. FLIR thermal cameras are already installed and gathering data on over 20 manufacturers' autonomous vehicle fleets and we expect to significantly increase the number of ADK units delivered this year. As a result, we've made additional investments in FLIR's ADAS facility to prepare for the potential of higher unit volumes in the years to come. We also continue to advance discussions with the over 50 customers in FLIR's ADAS partnership funnel with exciting developments underway.","Finally FLIR's autonomous vehicle featuring 360-degree thermal vision and automatic emergency braking is actively logging miles since introduced in January. We've already participated in several key industry ADAS events successfully demonstrating thermal's integration capabilities with LiDAR, radar and visible cameras.","Let me now turn the call over to Carol for her review of the first quarter financial highlights. Carol?","Carol Lowe","Thank you, Jim. On slide 8, you'll see a summary of our first quarter financial results. Please note with the exception of cash flow, all of these financials are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the filed appendix. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $445 million, a 1% increase year-over-year. Organic revenue also increased 1% with acquisition growth nearly offset by first quarter 2018 revenue from the divested Security businesses.","Foreign exchange negatively impacted growth by 2%. Revenue growth was in line with our expectations including a challenging year-over-year comparable as we've begun to lap strong performance by all business units that began in the first quarter of 2018. As Jim mentioned, contrary to 2018, we expect a higher proportion of growth in the second half of 2019.","In the first quarter, we drove historically strong organic bookings growth increasing 34% over the first quarter of 2018. Bookings outperformance was driven by both franchise program wins as well as strong non-programmatic orders in the Government & Defense and Industrial Business Units.","First quarter adjusted operating margin was 22%, 190 basis points higher than last year. We created solid operating leverage leading to adjusted net income of $73 million, up 7% from the first quarter of 2018. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.53 in the quarter 10% higher than the prior year. During the quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $56 million, representing a 29% increase over the same period last year, driven by solid earnings growth. In the quarter, we repurchased approximately 500,000 shares for $25 million. We also returned $23 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends.","Our cash balance to end the quarter was $284 million and includes the impact of the recent acquisitions. In March, we completed a refinancing of our syndicated credit facility enabling us to increase the capacity of the current facility to $900 million, while reducing our effective interest rate. While this expands our total current debt capacity, we are still committed to maintaining our investment-grade profile.","As Jim mentioned, regarding 2019 outlook, we continue to expect full year revenue growth in the range of 8% to 10% which includes organic growth of approximately 5% with stronger second half 2019 revenue growth versus the first half. We also continue to expect full year adjusted earnings per share of $2.30 to $2.36.","Adjusted EPS outlook includes approximately $0.06 of dilution from our recent acquisitions and we expect to realize the majority of that dilution in the second quarter 2019 as these high growth businesses scale into the second half of the year.","Turning to slide 9, I will highlight performance from each of our business units. Beginning with the Industrial Business Unit, first quarter revenue was $179 million, up 5% from the first quarter of 2018, driven by strength in cooled, thermal cores, industrial, UAS, and optical gas imaging products.","Operating income for industrial was $57 million, 25% higher than the prior year. Operating margin improved 510 basis points year-over-year, driven by favorable product mix and productivity gains under the FLIR Method.","The Government & Defense Business Unit saw revenue growth of 9% year-over-year including contributions from the Endeavor Robotics and Aeryon Labs acquisitions from their respective closing dates.","Government & Defense growth was also driven by strength in UAS and surveillance systems. Government & Defense operating income increased 5% compared to the first quarter of 2018. Operating margin declined 110 basis points, primarily due to operating expenses related to the acquisitions announced in Q1.","During the first quarter, Government & Defense's current backlog reached $451 million to end the quarter, a 26% increase over the first quarter of 2018. Bookings grew 81% over Q1 2018 on our orders from the recently won NBCRV program, SBS program, as well as broad-based non-programmatic growth. Combined with the first quarter book-to-bill of over 1.4 times, we are well-positioned to execute against our strategic plan.","The Commercial Business Unit first quarter revenue was down 16% year-over-year including Q1 2018 revenue from the divested security businesses and negative foreign exchange effects.","Excluding these impacts, first quarter 2019 revenue would have been $96 million, down 4% year-over-year. We experienced declines in our outdoor and tactical systems business or OTS, primarily due to continued restructuring impacts.","Operating income for commercial decreased 11% year-over-year. This decrease was the result of declines in OTS, negative foreign exchange impacts, and U.S. import tariff effects.","Operating margin improved 90 basis points year-over-year due to product mix and operating expense management. While it was a challenging quarter for commercial and although foreign exchange and OTS restructuring headwinds persist, we see solid growth opportunity in the second half of the year.","I will now pass the call back to Jim.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Carol. Overall, I'm pleased with how we kicked-off 2019. We achieved another quarter of strong bookings, putting us in a solid position for growth. And we continue to advance on our mission to become a world-class operating company and we're starting to see those efforts materialize in financial results.","In closing, I want to remind everyone of our daily task; to exceed our commitments with integrity and our purpose to innovate the world's sixth sense in order to save lives and livelihood. We operate with our B FLIR values to be brave, be bold, be ready, and be ambitious. These values are at the center of the FLIR Method and they drive integrity, speed, innovation, and a winning culture.","I'll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Your line is now live.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question and real nice quarter here. Maybe Jim or Carol on this one, industrial margins, I mean I think Carol you just hinted added up 510 basis points year-over-year seemingly really strong for the first quarter. It sounds like there weren't any anomalies in there just basic blocking and tackling mix and productivity. But can you give any more color? I mean should we expect that level for you guys to maybe even getting more leverage as the second half strengthens? Just really impressed of industrial margins there.","Jim Cannon","No, we're really proud of the work in the Industrial Business Unit. They had strong mix throughout the quarter, particularly with a lot of the cooled product lines that they're producing and we see that demand continuing. They're serving several OEM customers that have longer term programs that we're providing those components to.","And another key point to make aside from mix is our Industrial Business Unit is probably furthest along with the FLIR Method efforts underway, particularly our Santa Barbara facility. They've been practicing lean manufacturing principles for years well before we called it the FLIR Method and have really accelerated those efforts. But Frank, the President of the Industrial Business Unit would you like to add some color?","Frank Pennisi","Yes Jim. You've summed it up pretty well. A lot of it I would say attribute a large portion of it to product mix. The cooled products, optical gas products, as well as our drones, which are high margin offerings really skewed the mix quite a bit for the quarter. But we've also coupled that with a lot of productivity in TFM that's more sustainable over time.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe just a follow-up for David Ray on the Defense side. Just given the release of the fiscal 2020 budget, obviously, you guys had a really strong bookings quarter. Are you seeing the flow of funds out of the defense? I mean it looks like U.S. government was up 15%, but has the pipeline gotten even stronger? Or I guess can you give a general view of what's going on from a D.C. perspective?","David Ray","Yes. So, I think the FLIR strategy aligned with the budget is really starting to shape up well. One of the things when Jim came on Board, then I came on Board at about year and a half ago is to really focus on how we're tuning our strategy to align to where the customers' needs were.","I think with the bookings -- strong bookings outcomes that you're seeing in Q1, that's reflective of some of the success we've had. I still think there's a ways to go in terms of continuing to align the business to the priorities of our DoD customers to ensure we're aligning with that DoD budget.","But in total, I think we're making solid progress there. And as we begin to gain more fidelity in more of those markets, I really believe we're going to be aligned with the priorities.","Even as 2020 and 2021 come beyond and there starts to be pressure in the base budget, we think that the priorities we have in the business are aligned to the priorities of our customers long-term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Your line is now live.","Josh Sullivan","Hey good morning.","Carol Lowe","Good morning.","Josh Sullivan","Just on the FLIR Method, can you give us an update where you mostly hit the targets versus where there's more of a heavy lift? I think the inventory at one point was the large pole in the tent. Have you moved the needle on that?","Jim Cannon","Yes, absolutely. This past year we focused on continuous improvement and lean manufacturing principally as we wanted to drive a productivity engine to fuel some of the investments we need to make in the business while maintaining margins.","As we move more from sensors to intelligent sensing and ultimately solutions, we have to develop more muscles around artificial intelligence, video analytics, augmented reality. But we wanted to make sure we could self fund those investments and continue to expand margins.","So the initial efforts were really around educating folks about lean manufacturing continuous improvement. In some cases, it was well underway and we wanted to accelerate those efforts, put visual string mappings in place, to identify waste. And I'm really proud of the team's efforts across the company to undertake those efforts. And we began to see them in the margin rates and in the business.","This year, we're evolving two additional elements to the FLIR method because it's not just about lean and continuous improvement, but particular focus for us now is acquisition and integration discipline, global talent management and building out one FLIR, so that we can gain more scale and leverage as we source and take other actions like that.","We've mentioned several times particular opportunity with working capital turns improvement. And that's been an area of a lot of education, a lot of focus, a lot of opportunities with where we're at in our turns right now to generate more cash. And I'd say we've had mixed performance. In some areas, some success; other areas a lot more work to do. That's a hard metric to influence in the near-term.","Carol do you want to add some color?","Carol Lowe","Yes. So -- and Josh it's a good question. The inventory is still the most challenging because FLIR's commitment to serve our customer and meet their needs and getting robust certain operations planning in place and addressing inventory it takes longer.","We hold ourselves accountable to a 15-month average in terms of how we measure our improvement, so we're eking out modest improvements as we move month-to-month. But there's still a lot of opportunity there. Our procurement team has done a fabulous job with respect to addressing DPOs, our sales team\u2019s credit and collection with our DSOs. But I would say our days of inventory still present the greatest opportunity. But it's all upside as we move forward from here.","Josh Sullivan","Great, great. Appreciate the color on that. And then just one for Frank on the ADAS opportunity. Can you just talk about the level of interest and how it's progressed over the last 12 months?","And then as far as the investment in capacity, just curious given auto OEMs typically are very concerned with what your production volumes could be just interested to see where you guys have capacity at this point.","Frank Pennisi","Yes, absolutely. So we're working with all the ADAS firms you've heard of. Because of NDAs, I won't be naming off who they are. But a couple of points of feedback that we've gotten from them, one is a lot of them have come to the point that qualitatively they've determined that thermal technology eliminates a lot of the current cases. And they're getting to the point where they're ramping up their kits and their fleet quantities to get to the point of quantifying and in ensuring so they can determine is it one camera? Is it two cameras? Is it six cameras per car getting to that point?","Another piece of feedback is that of the couple of start-ups that are also in the area, they're basically finding that FLIR provides best image quality, best data quality as well as the fact that since we're already installed on 600,000 cars and in production and auto qualified at this point when they go and they see our factory, they see the investments that we're already making to be able to handle that capacity. They're confident that we'll be the most reliable supplier in this space.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company. Your line is now live.","Jim Ricchiuti","Hi, thank you. Good morning. I was wondering if I could just reconcile the strong growth that you're anticipating in the back half of the year in the Government & Defense business to the franchise wins that you've identified, or is some -- and can you talk a little bit about delivery orders against some of these? Or is the recovery you're anticipating in the second half coming from other areas of the backlog in this part of the business?","Jim Cannon","Yes, certainly. Well, first there are several programs, franchise programs that we've announced and been awarded that begin to have deliveries in the second half of the year. MTRS II, for example, others as well, the bulk of those deliveries begin in 2H and then proceed from there. So we certainly have visibility of known programs and those program delivery starts.","Also if we compare this year to last year, the first half comps are much more difficult. Last year, we grew double digits organically in Q1 and then again in Q2. So as we lap that performance into the second half, we've got that. As well as, as we mentioned still a large part of our business in government defense is non-programmatic, so we continue to see and work on a whole myriad of non-programmatic opportunities as well as non-programmatic international opportunities with Allied military nations.","We mentioned some of the success that we've had with Black Hornet in expanding that PRS capability with the French MOD in particular, as well as continuing to build that relationship with U.K.'s Armed Forces.","So as we look at the arbitrage of all those and then compare it to our past year, it leads us to that stronger second half. But not just in Government & Defense, we see similar phenomenon\u2019s in our Industrial Business Unit that has OEM work that's tied to other programs that are happening with our customers, as well as just typical seasonality.","Last year was a bit different than other years for FLIR as in the past we typically are more back half than front half loaded. Last year kind of ship that. This year is much more into that normal if you will cycle of a back half being stronger than the first half.","Jim Ricchiuti","Got it. And -- Jim thanks for that. But I was also interested to hear that you're seeing some pickup in the industrial machine vision area. Particularly it was surprising to see in the deck calling out some wins in the mobile phone market where I think there's this view that things are still pretty soft there. So it sounds like you are seeing some pickup in that area of the business. I know you had some easier comps in that looking out to the second half.","Jim Cannon","That's right. And you know the machine vision market last year after really tough comps, the prior years as you mentioned with mobile phone production and such has largely been flattish throughout this past year.","We are seeing though a pickup in bookings now that we hope certainly translates into a stronger back half. And the booking opportunities are coming from a whole range of different application that's showing more and more different industries are adopting machine vision, for example, food processing or beverage production.","Now semiconductor production is a bit softer. Some of the traditional places where we've had more machine vision, we're not seeing as much strength. But seeing wider adoption into different industries and we're working to try to address any specific needs they have.","And at the same time, our IIS machine vision team has continued to innovate. We launched not long ago Firefly, which is a really great product that's got analytics on the edge, making it easier for integrators and others to work with the product. So, throughout the course of last year and now beginning to get momentum this year some of those new products that have came to market.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Louie Dipalma from William Blair. Your line is now live.","Louie Dipalma","Good morning.","Jim Cannon","Good morning, Louie.","Louie Dipalma","What is involved with the integration for Endeavor and Aeryon Labs? And from the perspective of -- like what synergies come from having a portfolio of unmanned systems versus previously only having the Black Hornet family?","Jim Cannon","Yes. Really good question. First of all, if I talk about some of the just practical internal synergies that we have, all of these unmanned solutions, their ultimate purpose is to deliver some sort of sensor so a professional can make a decision. And that's right in our wheelhouse innovating technologies that help professionals make better decisions to save lives and livelihood.","So Aeryon, for example, were using our thermal payloads, as well as some of our other products from our Government & Defense Business Unit as sensor capabilities. Endeavor, for years and years have been a customer of FLIR's with our thermal camera core as well as our radiation detection products and our explosive detection products. The Fido for example has been a long-established sensor platform on robots that Endeavor has developed.","So there's those practical synergies that we produce, not just the detector, but also the sensor and now the complete solution. And now how that helps us engineer a much more autonomous intuitive easy-to-operate and effective solution helps ultimately the end user. And then if we think about the suite of different unmanned capabilities we've got, we're really focused if we talk about military applications first, but there are also many industrial or first-responder applications as well.","But Black Hornet principally targets military customers of course. But having solutions that range from a nano drone with a 5-gram payload that can do covert non-line-of-sight ISR up to larger payloads 4.5 even five pounds that can now challenge in a group one asset, the group two mission. So being able to stand off kilometers and gather intelligence and\/or take other actions on an objective with a product that can be transported by the individual soldier is really important.","So we're focused on a key DoD modernization effort around what they call soldier lethality and that is smaller units being more capable with more organic assets that pushes SWaP-C and again a whole range of mission capabilities. As you continue to look at future modernization efforts around next-generation, ground combat vehicles et cetera all of which include a manned\/unmanned component and not just a manned\/unmanned air ground, but ground\/ground component going forward.","If you just practically think about the different mission sets that our customers undergo sometimes a UAS is not appropriate. They need a ground vehicle to go into a deep and hardened target for example. Or vice versa an unmanned ground application won't work, because they've got to access the third or fourth story of a building or search for a rooftop.","So as we move forward, what we want to innovate and really drive and disrupt is making that individual operator at the forward edge of battle really, really capable with a suite of ISR capabilities, sustainment logistics and having air\/ground and manned\/unmanned teaming is right at the center of that effort. So tremendous synergies that we're just now beginning to realize as we continue to innovate these technologies.","Louie Dipalma","Thanks. And along those lines, I think you discussed how there's demand in the first-responder vertical for drones and you are already partnered with DJI. But should we anticipate seeing shipments of Endeavor Robotics and Aeryon Labs, UAS systems to your existing first-responder customers as well?","Jim Cannon","Yes, we've long served this first-responder market more and more with unmanned aerial systems. DJI is a great partner of ours; make great products with payloads that can serve the whole host of first responders' needs. Ones that we're particularly proud of are helping firefighters as they respond to a scene to be able to put an asset in the sky to quantify where heat is as they make plans on how they're going to enter that fire and save lives and communities.","Aeryon has also served first-responder market for some time. And with Endeavor, the first-responder market has been one of their original markets. One of the key mission sets that they undertake with their robots is explosives and ordnance disposal. So right across the world that EOD market not just military, but civil first responders is a market we're very proud to serve. We often get feedback from those users about the missions they do every day in our community.","So, you'll continue to see us, focus heavily on that first-responder market and work with sensors like our Fido trace explosives detector or our radiation detectors to make that capability for first responders with Endeavor Robotics even more capable as they approach explosive threats, other hazardous materials, potentially dirty bombs et cetera at greater standoff distances with more capabilities on the robot itself.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Your line is now live.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up. Maybe Jim or Carol, can you just give us some color? Obviously, real strong bookings. But can you give us maybe some of the trends by geographies sort of what you're seeing, especially on the Commercial Industrial side in Europe and the APAC region?","Jim Cannon","Yes. Why don't we -- I'll let Travis and Frank from Industrial and Commercial talk a bit about what they see, because there's a bit of a different dynamic by each business unit. Travis, would you like to go first?","Travis Merrill","Sure. Thanks, Jim. As Jim mentioned, it is a little bit different from business to business even within the Commercial Business Unit. We are seeing in some markets a little bit of softness in Europe. In other markets, we see a little bit of softness in the U.S. We see continued investments in infrastructure really and that's kind of a global trend. That impacts positively our Security and ITS businesses. The Middle East in general seems to be an area of growth for many of our verticals as there's increasing investments again on the infrastructure side in that region. And then APAC is a region within CBU where we don't have a tremendous footprint, so it presents a significant a growth opportunity for us in a number of our businesses.","Frank Pennisi","Yes, this is Frank. If I were to break it out by geography, essentially I'm not sure I would give you as meaningful of answers as I were to tell you where the pros and cons are relative to where we're seeing strengths and weaknesses. We're seeing a lot of tailwinds worldwide everything related to drones and everywhere where people are buying drones we're seeing that. So the developed markets that tend to be a bit more focused on those tend to have that strength. Same for defense spending. You're seeing a lot out of the Americas and that's driving parts of our growth.","And the infrastructure spending where it's being spent places like China, places like the Americas we're actually seeing that that's driving a lot of those tailwinds. And on the headwind side, we already mentioned when Jim spoke FX tariffs related to China on some of the durable goods that are dropping in a few spots here and there and in the semi-electronics -- semiconductor and electronics market which is predominantly in Asia Pacific that's a bit of a headwind for us. So you put it altogether it gives us strength in the Americas about neutral in Asia Pacific. In Europe, it's slightly up at this point.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe one more not to bring up a negative Jim, but have you guys had gotten a debrief on the CRS program loss since the Endeavor acquisition? And I know there's some additional programs behind that one iterations of it. But any more color you can provide us there?","Jim Cannon","Yes, sure. We certainly got a debrief as is customary when you have a program loss from DoD. Any program we compete on of course we want to win. As we were going through the diligence process with Endeavor though, we frankly put a lower probability win on CRS-I. We had just won MTRS II really focused on ramping up for the production and delivery around MTRS II. It's a larger program than CRS-I. So having won that we had a bit of a lower expectation on our win for CRS-I. But no doubt learned lessons. And now as we go focused -- or go forward, we're focused on additional programs like the follow-on CRS-H that's coming up et cetera.","Operator","We reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.","Jim Cannon","Again, I want to thank you all for joining the call today as well as your interest in our company. As always I especially want to thank our now over 4,000 FLIR employees across the globe for their continued passion and dedication. We look forward to updating you on our second quarter 2019 financial results in July. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference and webinar. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"9564":["FLIR Systems, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Jay Gentzkow, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Jay Gentzkow - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Please note that our earnings press release and presentation slides referred to on this call are available under the Events & Presentations section of www.flir.com\/investor.","Before we begin this conference call, I need to remind you statements made on this call other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on our current expectations. Words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, and believes, and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking statements we make today speak as of today and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statement to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","We will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of our core ongoing operating results and facilitate consistent comparison of results over time. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in this morning's earnings our press release.","I'll now turn the call over to Jim Cannon, President and CEO of FLIR Systems.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Jay, and thank you, everyone, for joining FLIR's third quarter 2018 earnings call. With Jay and me today are Carol Lowe, our CFO, Todd DuChene, General Counsel, Travis Merrill, President of our Commercial Business Unit, Frank Pennisi, President of our Industrial Business Unit, and David Ray, President of our Government and Defense Business Unit. I'm also pleased to welcome Tony Buffum, who joined FLIR this month as Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer. Tony will lead the company's global HR team and drive all facets of change management and culture. Tony brings a wealth of experience and knowledge and we're thrilled to have him.","As announced earlier this morning, we reported another solid quarter operationally and financially. Gross margins, operating margins, and operating cash flow reached quarterly levels we haven't seen in over five years. We also realized another quarter of double-digit EPS growth. And we maintained organic revenue growth in all business units despite challenging year-on-year comparables. Additionally, we're making meaningful progress on our continuous improvement initiatives through The FLIR Method. I'll start with third quarter review on slide 3 of the presentation with a few financial highlights. Carol will provide more color later during our prepared remarks.","This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $435 million. Excluding revenue from acquisitions and divestitures, organic top-line growth was 3%. A very strong quarter in 2017 led by broad-based growth across all business units made for a difficult year-over-year comparable, but we're proud to deliver our fifth consecutive quarter of organic growth despite the lumpy nature of our end markets. While adjusted gross profit was flat versus third quarter 2017, adjusted gross margins improved significantly, up 330 basis points.","Gross margin expansion was due to favorable product mix and productivity initiatives driven by The FLIR Method. Adjusted operating income increased 5% over the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted operating margin also improved, up 260 basis points in comparison to last year.","While we're enthusiastic about achieving margin performance we haven't seen in years, we plan to continue balancing margin expansion with investments necessary to position FLIR for long-term profitable growth. This investment is especially key to franchise program wins, an essential part of the strategy we shared during our Investor Day in May. We'll share more information on our strategic investment plans during our fourth quarter earnings call in February 2019.","We also demonstrated solid operating leverage with adjusted earnings per share growing 10% in the quarter compared to Q3 2017. Operating cash flow reached $122 million for the quarter, the highest quarterly cash flow in over five years. Operating cash flow for the first nine months grew 32% over the same period of 2017.","Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter at $591 million, down 1% compared to the balance at the end of the second quarter. While we grew backlog by more than 5% in our Government and Defense Business Unit during the quarter, our Industrial Business Unit continues to methodically lower backlog utilizing The FLIR Method to reduce customer lead times and more consistently position the business closer to a book and bill level.","Turning to our outlook for the full year 2018. We continue to expect revenue to be in the range of $1.78 billion to $1.8 billion and full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.17 to $2.22. These ranges represent organic revenue growth of 7% to 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 18%. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share which will be payable on December 7th to shareholders on record as of November 23rd.","Turning to slide 4. We've made significant progress on our strategic priorities to fuel, feed and focus the business with The FLIR Method as its foundation. Perhaps, our strongest quarterly progress since introduction, I'd now like to update you on two key components of that strategy.","Let's start with fuel on slide 5. We've advanced many near-term opportunities to gain scale in the business. To highlight a recent franchise win in the quarter, the Government and Defense Business Unit received an award totaling $28.7 million for the Next Generation Chemical Detector 3 or NGCD 3 in support of the U.S. Army's Multi-Phase, Chemical Agent Detector program or MPCAD. FLIR's MPCAD solution will provide the war fighter with chemical threat confirmation in the field and better enable the joint forces to combat chemical weapons of mass destruction. This franchise program win enables our team to further fulfill its mission to protect the lives and livelihood of soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines. They are our heroes.","Turning to slide 6. We also strive to innovate differentiated technologies to secure market positions and fuel future growth. I'd like to highlight one key product introduction from each business unit since our last earnings call.","Last week the Industrial Business Unit's Integrated Imaging Solutions business or IIS announced the FLIR Firefly, the industry's first deep-learning enabled machine vision camera. The Firefly integrates Intel's Movidius Myriad 2 Vision Processing Unit to enable deep neural networks for on-camera inference. Combining a new affordable machine vision platform with the power of deep learning automates complex and subjective problems for image analysis professionals such as recognizing faces or classifying the quality of a solar panel during the manufacturing process.","At the Association of the United States Army's Annual Meeting and Exhibition (sic) [Exposition] in Washington DC, the Government and Defense Business Unit launched the Black Hornet Vehicle Reconnaissance System or VRS. The Black Hornet VRS takes the combat-proven Black Hornet UAV and integrates it with military vehicles. War fighters will have the ability to conduct real-time non-line-of-sight covered reconnaissance while remaining in the protection of their vehicles for increased situational awareness. The Black Hornet powered VRS is representative of our continued focus on delivering full solution technology and we look forward to playing a role in helping modernize our military forces.","Finally, in October, the Commercial Business Unit's Maritime division delivered a Marine industry first with the introduction of ClearCruise Augmented Reality Navigation Technology. ClearCruise Augmented Reality or AR brings a new level of navigational awareness to users of the Axiom family of multifunctional displays. With ClearCruise AR, Axiom users can make smarter decisions with physical navigation objects overlaid directly on Axiom's HD video display, giving captains greater confidence and peace of mind when navigating busy or unfamiliar waterways.","Turning to slide 7. We also continue to feed, feed longer-term market opportunities through technology investments and consolidating stronger positions in attractive markets. As an example, we've been aggressively investing in FLIR's unmanned solutions platform since identifying the unmanned market as a strategic priority. FLIR's unmanned solutions exemplify our transition from intelligent sensors to intelligent sensing solutions.","At our Investor Day, we announced the intention for a new unmanned systems and integrated solutions division in the Government and Defense Business Unit. That division is now fully operational with leadership in place and we're strategically investing to capture the military's unmanned solution needs.","Other recent unmanned solution successes include the previously mentioned Black Hornet 3 nano UAV and subsequent Black Hornet Vehicle Reconnaissance System. We also announced the DroneSense-FLIR Edition, a drone-flight management software platform designed for public safety applications following a strategic minority investment in DroneSense earlier this year. Another strong quarter of results in unmanned solutions for both Government and Defense and Industrial Business Units is a byproduct of these strategic investments.","Moving to the right of slide 7, we announced two exciting partnerships that will feed our business with differentiated technologies. In the quarter, we made a strategic minority share investment in CVEDIA. CVEDIA is an exciting young company that uses gaming engines to create synthetic images. These images allow developers to train artificial intelligence systems faster and more economically. Together, we've generated thermal synthetic images creating a differentiated and valuable feature that augments the rich and distinctive data our sensors already produce. We see CVEDIA software playing an important role in many FLIR applications including unmanned solutions.","We also acquired Acyclica in mid-September. Acyclica is a leading developer of automotive roadway and intersection data generation and analytic solutions. These solutions provide real time traffic flow information, strengthening our differentiation in Intelligent Transportation Systems or ITS by adding dynamic traffic data in a cloud-based analytics engine to FLIR's ITS solutions.","Now part of the ITS division within the Commercial Business Unit, the capabilities of the Acyclica team in data analytics and software platforms can be scalable across numerous other FLIR businesses. We will continue to feed targeted opportunities with long-term growth trajectories that are accretive to FLIR. We look forward to sharing more progress on these strategic priorities in the future.","Let me now turn the call over to Carol for her review of third quarter financial and operational highlights. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. On slide 8, you'll see a summary of our third quarter financial results. Please note with the exception of cash flow, all of these financials are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the filed appendix.","Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $435 million, a 6% decrease year-over-year. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, organic revenue increased 3% over the same period. As Jim mentioned, organic revenue growth was impacted by a challenging year-over-year comparable as we've began to lap strong performance by all business units that began in the third quarter of 2017.","Sales to the U.S. government increased $27 million or 23%. This growth is largely attributed to deliveries under the EO\/IR Force Protection program as well as cooled military camera cores supplied by our Industrial Business Unit. U.S. government revenue represented 33% of total revenue compared to 25% in the third quarter of 2017. Adjusted gross margin improved 330 basis points year-over-year to 52%.","The increase in adjusted gross margin was driven by favorable mix and productivity gains driven by The FLIR Method. This was our seventh consecutive quarter of adjusted gross margin expansion and highest quarterly adjusted gross margin since 2013.","Third quarter adjusted operating margin was 24%, 260 basis points higher than last year. We created solid operating leverage to achieve adjusted net income of $80 million up 10% for the third quarter of 2018. Adjusted EPS was $0.57 also 10% higher than prior year.","Adjusted net income was favorably impacted by a 430 basis point decrease in our effective tax rate versus Q3 of the prior year. This was primarily due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as well as a jurisdictional mix shift of our taxable income. Due to changes in our estimate of the impact of the new U.S. tax legislation on foreign and domestic profits, we now expect our full year 2018 effective tax rate to be approximately 21% excluding discrete items that impact the GAAP tax rate.","During the third quarter, the Swedish tax authority issued a proposed tax assessment to one of our non-operating subsidiaries in Sweden. The proposed assessment of approximately $ 300 million concerns the use of tax credits applied against capital gains recognized in the 2012 tax return. We believe the proposed assessment is incorrect and the assertions therein are inconsistent with applicable tax regulations. We intend to vigorously defend the company against the proposed assessment.","During the quarter, we generated cash flow from operations of $122 million. This brings our cash flow from operations for the first nine months of 2018 to $276 million representing a 32% increase over the same period last year driven by earnings and working capital improvements. Year-to-date, we repurchased approximately two million shares at an average price of $50.52 per share.","With these repurchases and $66 million in dividends paid, we returned $166 million to shareholders during the first nine months of 2018. Despite these uses of cash, we increased our cash balance by $85 million during the third quarter to $593 million positioning us well for future capital deployment including execution on a number of acquisitions and investments in our current pipeline.","At the business unit level, we again saw organic revenue growth across all three businesses. Business unit level operating margins increased 160 basis points over the third quarter of 2017 as a result of favorable mix and productivity gains driven by The FLIR Method.","Turning to slide 9, I will highlight performance from each of our business units. Beginning with the Industrial Business Unit, third quarter revenue was $177 million, up 4% from the third quarter of 2017 driven by strength in automotive, industrial UAF, and optical gas imaging products.","Operating income for Industrial was $56 million, 3% higher than the prior year. Operating margin was in line year-over-year with productivity gains driven by The FLIR Method offset by a lower margin product mix. The Government and Defense Business Unit saw revenue growth of 1% year-over-year. Deliveries of gimbal systems for the EO\/IR-FP program, UAS systems and higher revenue were top-line strength. Revenue growth was partially offset by a challenging year-over-year comparable due to a large international order for airborne systems in the third quarter of 2017.","Government and Defense operating income increased 2% compared to the third quart of 2017. Healthy product mix contributed to a 30 basis point improvement over the prior year.","During the third quarter, Government and Defense backlog reached $371 million to end the quarter, a 6% increase over the second quarter of 2018. Bookings grew 25% over Q2 2018, driven by orders from the recently won Next Generation Chemical Detector program from the U.S. Army. Book-to-bill was just over 1.2 times for the quarter.","The Commercial Business Unit third quarter revenue was down 31% year-over-year, due primarily to $43 million of revenue in Q3 2017 from the security businesses divested earlier this year. Excluding acquisitions and divestitures, Commercial third quarter revenue grew 6% over last year. We saw continued strength in Maritime's Axiom multifunctional displays and our intelligent traffic solutions.","Operating income for the Commercial business decreased 27% year-over-year. This decrease was due primarily to $3 million in prior-year operating income from the divested security businesses. Operating margin improved 60 basis points over the prior year. I will now pass the call back to Jim.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Carol. Overall, we're encouraged by the results thus far in 2018. As we position the company for a strong finish to the year and look ahead to 2019, we'll continue to emphasize execution in our core businesses and delivering on our operating performance objectives. As we've stated, we'll seek to balance growth, operating leverage, and investments in the business.","In closing, I want to remind everyone of our daily task, to consistently exceed our commitments with integrity and our purpose, which is to innovate the world's sixth sense to save lives and livelihood. We operate with our BE FLIR values to be brave, be bold, be ready and be ambitious. These values are at the center of The FLIR Method and they drive integrity, speed, innovation, and a winning culture. I'll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [ Operator instructions ] Thank you, our first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everybody.","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I wonder if it might be possible to \u2013 I don't know if you have the numbers there in front of you. Hopefully, you do. I know you've spoken generally to the near to medium-term temporary issue in Government and Defense of the programs that roll off and therefore create a temporary year-over-year growth rate headwind. Is it possible to actually just kind of level set us on what they are, what they were in the quarter, how much they declined in the quarter, and then how much they declined over the next few quarters and when they stop? I don't know if we've ever super-precisely heard those numbers, just to get everybody on the same page on that issue.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah, sure. I mean, happy to provide color for certain. In the quarter, obviously, the EO\/IR-FP program that was a big driver that was awarded last year is coming to an end. There are a few more systems that we're going to ship in the fourth quarter and DR-SKO, which you know has been a long-tenured program for us and driver for us, we have one more tranche that we expect and then there may be more based off need and requirement, but that will certainly lapse. So we've got that arbitrage until some of these larger programs of record we're competing for franchise wins pick up. But I guess two points I'll bring up and then hand it over to David to talk in any more color is the book-to-bill was at 1.2 in our Government and Defense Business Unit, so we're continuing to drive smaller wins, and for the next two years, OCO dollars are in that base DOD budget. So that's a great area of opportunity for us to go win business to mitigate the arbitrage of some of these larger programs closing before others pick up. David, you want to add some color?","David Ray - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Jim, I think you hit it spot on. Our 1.2 book-to-bill for the quarter was very enlightening. That's two quarters in a row we've been above 1.0 book-to-bill. That's the leading indication of backlog growth with, as you mentioned, E0\/IP-FP going down. DR-SKO, we expect another booking in Q4 on DR-SKO that will take us into mid -2019. Also think there are upgrade opportunities with that program, but all in all, our book-to-bill in the last two quarters and moving into the future are really is an indication of our backlog growth that mitigates that in the short-term as we execute on some of these franchise programs we plan to win in 2019.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. The international airborne program that was a headwind year-over-year in the quarter, how much was it down?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, that was a delivery we had to the Mexican Navy and it was about $30 million.","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah, it...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","It went from $30 million to $0 million.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","$18 million","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. It was $18 million for the quarter, $18 million and then $0 million in the quarter for that specific program.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Sorry. So what was it in the year-ago quarter?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","$18 million.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And what was it in this quarter?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","$0 million.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then can you give me those numbers on DR-SKO?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So DR-SKO for Q3 2017 and Q3 2018 are approximately flat at $14 million to $15 million between the two, year-over-year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And then what do each of those programs do year-over-year next quarter?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So it's less for 2018 for the DR-SKO. It's about half and it was about $20 million Q4 2017.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. On your point on bookings and the backlog there, I hear you on where the book-to-bill came in in the quarter which does make it look like that's maybe picking up for you. But on the other hand, I think it is a pretty consistently seasonally strong quarter, the third quarter. And if I look at a trailing 12 months number, I think it's still below 1.0. Or if I just look at the Government and Defense backlog at the end of the quarte, it's at the same number as where you ended 2016. And I know you have these program specific situations but just directionally that's not really true for too many defense companies given what's been happening with the budget. And so just wonder if there's anything unique to that maybe with the program specifics. Or if you are looking for a meaningful change in the backlog in the immediate term?","David Ray - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So two things. So I'm particularly proud of the 1.2 book-to-bill and especially when you look at the comparable to 2017. The EO\/IR-FP program that we talked about was booked in that quarter. That was a substantial booking and the fact that we've covered most of that with the growth that we've had in this quarter is an indication of our portfolio diversity. So that gives me great confidence that as we look forward to executing our strategy, not only are we focused on programs that really replace those types of bookings in the current surveillance business, but we have a portfolio that's diverse enough for us to, as we invest in the future, really position for new opportunities as mentioned around NGCD 3 that we talked about earlier.","Going forward when we think about the year, we'll continue to go and really hit hard the mid to smaller programs as we wait for some of the larger franchise programs to materialize. I think what we benefit from is our relative balance with respect to domestic and international bookings and how we're positioned in those areas. A lot of our mid to small bookings that we're going to book in Q4 next year and Q1 of the following year are international in nature and we think that gives us a great hedge against the upcoming headwinds that may be seen in 2021 and beyond relative to the budget.","So the portfolio diversity we have as a business geographically and the fact that we've been able to replace pretty much the bookings of that large EO\/IR-FP program of last year really, I think, gives us a positive momentum as we execute our strategy that Jim laid out earlier.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe just to stay on Noah's line of questioning. I mean, so how should we calibrate in this sort of environment, as you were just talking about, with the defense budget, the book-to-bill? What's sort of a realistic longer-term growth trajectory for that business, contemplating the headwinds? And maybe if you can even give us some color on the Next Gen Chemical Detector. You've got that initial booking. You're calling it a franchise opportunity but can you give us a sense of what the tail might look like on that potential program?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, as we said in our Investor Day, we expect all of our business units to grow at an annual CAGR of 5% or greater. Also as we've mentioned, we began this focus on franchise programs, larger programs of record, about nine months ago, almost a year ago. And it takes time to develop those programs, to put those captures in place.","In the meanwhile, a lot of the wins that we're having and the book-to-bill being greater than 1.0 were driven by smaller and in many cases very profitable opportunities we have with technology we've developed.","I'll point to a lot of the conversation we had about unmanned solutions. The VRS solution, the Vehicle Reconnaissance System, for example, is not a part of a big program. It's a technology we're bringing to market and we expect and already have a lot of enthusiasm as most of our forces fight mounted and they need some kind of point of battle non-line-of-sight reconnaissance system.","And FLIR traditionally has always competed in bringing these technologies to the war fighter and winning smaller wins if you will, a lot of it through OCO funding. And for the next two years, again, that OCO funding is in the base budget.","The big program wins, the military are awarding now, again started years ago in many cases. And if you look at the six modernization priorities that the Secretary of Defense has outlined, we line up very nicely with many of those like next-generation vertical lift, next gen manned unmanned ground combat vehicle, soldier lethality in particular as we continue to push size, weight, power for uncooled IR cores and focus on unmanned solutions and other sensors, et cetera.","So again when I think about this space in the near-term, I see us continuing to grow the business, continuing to grow backlog. It'll be lumpy. We want all the businesses to contribute greater than a 5% CAGR. And then as we get out into late 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 where we have very specific programs that we're developing and compete on, we expect and hope to get larger wins if you will.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then just maybe you mentioned competition there a couple of times. Any thoughts whether there are opportunities or potential pressure from two of the bigger infrared players maybe thinking of L3 and Harris coming together? Does that potentially create challenges for you? Does it create some opportunities? If the customer is looking for another vendor for things like goggles, can you maybe just give us some color on thoughts on that consolidation in the space?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","I don't want to speak to that consolidation specifically other than to say our strategy remains intact and relevant and we're very enthusiastic about it.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe just one more for Carol. On the op margins, the last two quarters I think running at 23.5%. The long-term target is 23%. What other levers are you guys pulling, or maybe even what inning are you in here? And I noticed the big \u2013 there was a big drop in R&D, I guess down $4.4 million sequentially. It's under 10%. It looks like a six-quarter low. Should we expect R&D to kind of trend at these levels? Maybe just some color there.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I'll say a few words then hand it to Carol. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're balancing margin expansion with investment back in the business. What you've seen with R&D spending is not indicative of a long-term trend. Instead, we're trying to focus the R&D much more. We've got a very broad base of businesses and serve a very wide range of end markets. And so this year we're trying to concentrate some of the R&D effort around what we believe are more attractive longer-term markets like unmanned or intelligent transportation smart and connected cities or ADAS applications coupled with that.","So you will see more focus in how we distribute the R&D spending. I don't think any big deviation from what we've spent in the past historically and we had a great quarter in terms of operating margin rates. But to be the company we want to be three years from now and have that concentrated strength in augmented reality and artificial intelligence and machine learning to make our sensors smarter and more mission-capable, we're going to have to make additional investments.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it.","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","And I'll add to that just to kind of call out everything that we highlighted in the prepared remarks around the benefits that we're getting for The FLIR Method and that impacts not only our gross profits and gross margins but also operating income, operating margins. But we also had a timing benefit relative to our general and administrative expenses just the timing of certain accruals and \u2013 that you'll see a little bit more heavily weighted expense for corporate expense in the Q4 2018, so it's just timing. And our total corporate expenses are still running that $70 million to $75 million kind of flat year-on-year.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks a lot guys.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Louie DiPalma with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Louie DiPalma - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, Jim, Carol, Jay and the rest of the team. This quarter's U.S. government sales increased by $27 million year-over-year and I was wondering, if you can provide a breakdown of where that increase came from. I think you mentioned the EO\/IR-FP and I was wondering if that was the majority or if there were other contributors?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","There's a wide range of contributors. Certainly, we deliver a bulk of the EO\/IR-FP program. Also in our Industrial Business Unit, a lot of the components that we supply to other defense contractors saw a very strong quarter as well. Shipments out of Santa Barbara for different cooled components, et cetera. Unmanned applications, the CBRNE applications, really across a whole spectrum of products we saw growth. I don't know if I could point to \u2013 I guess the two strongest would be the EO\/IR-FP and components out of Santa Barbara for other defense contractors.","Louie DiPalma - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. And secondly on this quarter and last quarter's calls, auto was cited as a source of strength for your Industrial's OEM division. And traditionally, your partner Veoneer has priced the night vision sensor or servers for luxury auto customers at over $2000 per vehicle. And I was wondering if anything has changed with your go-to-market strategy there that maybe stimulating demand?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Frank, why don't you take that question. There's a lot that's happened in the past couple of quarters as we focused on that market.","Frank Pennisi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. Just to let you know, a combination of \u2013 we're still working with Veoneer. They're one of the folks who are most familiar with thermal or the benefits of thermal, the fact that they can see it at night and rain and fog. And actually even if you read the owner's manuals, you crack open an owners manual for an automatic emergency breaking system, you'll see \u2013 you can't see crouched pedestrians and you can't see people up against metal. And there are a lot of things that thermal does that allows you to see more things.","We are not exclusive of Veoneer. We're actually going to market with a number of different partners and working on that. And Veoneer has been breaking into more and more standard \u2013 I don't want to say standard platforms, but lower or higher volume \u2013 lower-priced higher volume platforms. So as a consequence, we're seeing a lot of growth there. We're seeing platforms from Volkswagen, General Motors and Peugeot coming into play that are actually driving a lot of that growth that give us more scale and more ability to continue to get into more and more platforms as we go and eventually getting into autonomous vehicles.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","And I'll add, when I think about what we can do with ADAS applications, we really look at it from two perspectives. One, certainly with thermal sensors on the vehicle and I think Frank did a good job describing those benefits.","And the other is, with the infrastructure and the acquisition of Acyclica is a part of our intelligent transportation business. It's in the Commercial Business Unit. The V2X technology, so intersections can be smarter, run real-time analytics, communicate with the vehicle. All the sensors on the world can't identify pedestrian coming from the other side of a building into an intersection, for example. So when we, again, think about the opportunities with ADAS we think about both on-vehicle applications as well as connected infrastructure.","Louie DiPalma - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks, Jim and Travis. One last one perhaps for David Ray. During the quarter a competitor notably won a large infrared award for Textron's Shadow drone. And I think, Jim, during an answer you mentioned potential opportunities with next generation vertical lift.","For future aircraft electrical, optical sensor awards such as the Boeing Huey replacement and the future Boeing's Stingray tanker drone, do you guys feel that FLIR has the sensor to compete against the established primes for those future contract awards?","David Ray - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So I'll take that question in two parts. So the answer is, yes, both today, and the investments we're making to really push what we're trying to do in size, weight and power from a sensors perspective. The competence you mentioned for Textron's UAS require smaller sensor.","Our investments that we're making moving forward to really lay out our EO\/IR strategy involves really not only the gimbal size activity we have today, but really looking at smaller opportunities there as well as the delivery mechanisms, i.e., UAVs for ISR become smaller.","When you think about programs such as next generation combat vehicle, future vertical lift, I think we're well-positioned from a technology perspective on what we have today as well as the investments we're making over the next year to really go, become a major player there. But in its totality, I think, it's a combination of the systems we have today, but more importantly how we're equipping those both from a SWaP perspective and the technology insertion through the investments that Jim talked about earlier that are really going to position us.","This is part of our strategy we've deliberately started to execute within the last year, since Jim came onboard a year-and-a-half. And it's going to take time for us to mature that and we have targeted opportunities where we expect to realize those investments.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Pete Skibitski with Alembic Global Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Peter John Skibitski - Alembic Global Advisors","Yeah. Good morning, guys. I apologize I missed part of Noah's initial question. I think I got the flavor for it and hopefully I'm not repeating anything. But Jim on the status of G-BOSS(NYSE:E), are you going for an integrated role there or for a different role? And I'm just wondering whatever role you're going for, could it be equivalent in size to the EO\/IR-FP program?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","With the G-BOSS(E), again we integrate all the technology and such on the platform. Right now G-BOSS(E) when it'll get awarded we're not real certain of. Are they going to continue with the current program, the EO\/IR-FP program or make a decision on G-BOSS(E), I think that's one of the things that's up in the air right now. With a two-year DOD budget set and with all the modernization priorities that are underway, there's a lot of effort to figure out how DOD prioritizes, makes decisions in the near-term with the uncertainty past 2020, right. In 2021, 2022 what's going to happen to the DOD budget.","But that product started as the RAID program, evolved into the EO\/IR-FP program ultimately may become the G-BOSS(E) program. Could be of the scale that we've seen in the past. It's a battle proven solution that really helps with force protection. We're working now to bring even additional technologies through other minority investments and innovations we're doing to that capability.","Peter John Skibitski - Alembic Global Advisors","I understand. One quick follow-up on Soldier Borne Sensors, are you guys expecting a final award announcement before the calendar year ends or we're pushing into 2019?","David Ray - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So the next follow-on SBS, so we won phase one as you know. Tranche 1 which is the next competition is expected to be awarded around the end of Q1 timeframe next year. We expect to get RFP on that probably before the end of the year here. Again, we're continuing to ensure that we're properly positioned to go drive execution of that. We're delivering on phase one to expectations today. So I don't see any of that changing in the near-term.","Peter John Skibitski - Alembic Global Advisors","Thanks so much, guys.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, Jim, Carol. Jim, a question I guess on Industrial. You've had nice growth year-to-date but there was a sort of a deceleration here. I wonder if you could just give us some of the details around that. Whether it's just more timing, tougher comps, what's driving all that? Are you seeing any impacts from different parts of the regions, any weakness in Asia?","And then just as a follow-up to all this is just how you're doing in your newer pricing strategy that you talked about at your Investor Day? Thanks, Jim.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Right. Yeah. Our Industrial Business Unit has had a strong year certainly year-to-date. We always knew the back half would be a tougher comp than the first step and have signaled that.","We haven't seen any, I'll say, marked deceleration in any part of the business. The instruments business slowed a bit in Q3 compared to prior quarters, the past four or five quarters run rate and that principally was in our European market there.","But in other markets for instruments, for example, our OGI, our optical gas finders, have seen tremendous growth. And that's a very strong product for us as regulation and sensitivities around environmental health and safety have increased. And we've got additional features and product capability that's going to come out around that solution.","If you talk about geographic trends, our business can be lumpy right across all of our businesses as we win various projects or programs. We've seen certainly in the Middle East in this past quarter, a couple large security orders slip out a bit that we were expecting. Latin America and Canada was driven principally by the delivery to the Mexican Navy that we referenced early when we talk about year-on-year movement that way.","With regard to the pricing actions, I'm really pleased with how that effort is coming along and pricing like productivity is an effort that takes time to get going, right. I mean, it takes at least a year to kind of prime the opportunity, to get the resources on board, collect the data, understand the data, pick the opportunities, and begin to go after it.","We mentioned several times in the prepared remarks we are beginning to see some of the productivity effects of The FLIR Method. Now, with regard to pricing, most of that effort is focused not so much on current product offering, but future products that we're bringing to market. So, as we're going through the tollgate process to launch new products, pricing \u2013 and our pricing leader in tools that are being put in place now are getting exercised. So, I don't think we're really going to see a marked result there really until we're exiting this year going into 2019 as some of these newer products come to market.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Appreciate the color. Thanks, Jim.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Josh Sullivan with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hey, good morning.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Morning.","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Morning.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Just on the investments, you mentioned necessary to position for long-term growth and I know you're going to give us more detail in February, but are the investments organic, inorganic, SG&A, or even CapEx, is there any way to frame the context of the conversation at this point?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. Again in the fourth quarter, we want to provide much more commentary, but not to be coy, but it's kind of all the above, less so on the CapEx though. I think the investments we need to make certainly are organic in that we've got to attract some different skillsets into our business of scale, technical capabilities that we haven't had the kind of depth we need as we go forward.","There also are inorganic investments and those come in two pieces. Certainly, we have an active pipeline of acquisitions that we've been working on for some time, but you've seen us make several minority investments now. And those minority investments are investments that we're making principally to advance our technology roadmap. They're companies that perhaps aren't for sale nor would we want to own them, but we need exclusivity for a capability that they have to integrate into our solutions.","Acyclica, the acquisition we made there, certainly is one that we can point to in the past quarter and CVEDIA, the minority investment we made that we can point to in this past quarter, helps across a whole host of our business applications because it creates the engine that can help our machines learn much more quickly and more economically.","So, certainly, some organic investments in terms of talent, and in NRE, inorganic as well. I don't see a lot of really large CapEx that's required though. I don't see it being too tremendously capital-intensive what we need to do.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then I guess just a follow-up on your comments about the M&A pipeline there. Is the market volatility influencing you or pushing towards joint ventures or acquisitions one way or the other at this point?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","No. I don't think the volatility certainly that we've seen pushes us one way or the other. We've put together a very deliberate acquisition campaign, if you will. We want to be, again, measured about how we do it. The minority investments really have been driven by our desire to rapidly advance our technology roadmap.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. Hi Jim, hi Carol.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Hi, Jeff.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Good to talk with you again. I just came from a Safe Cities Conference and the talk about the increasing amount of public-private partnership money that's being made available for the first time really. And what I'm thinking of is looking at other companies that have benefited from this like let's just say TASER or Axon and ShotSpotter. What are you seeing in the types of programs that are out there or being mentioned out there for safe cities that you see affecting your business. And I know that this would across a couple of your divisions?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Right. Travis, you want to address that?","Travis D. Merrill - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. Hey, Jeff.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Hi.","Travis D. Merrill - FLIR Systems, Inc.","We continue to see a lot of enthusiasm in the smart and safe city domain whether it be security orientation, really securing the entire metropolitan area and in some cases even expanding beyond that into the suburbs, seamlessly networks across a single VMS. Largely, we are seeing public funding around, sometimes coming at the federal level both within Europe as well as within the U.S.","Likewise we are seeing, on the smart side much more momentum on the Intelligent Transportation Systems. We're also starting to see a little bit of a joining of these two areas into more of a single type platform across municipalities. So yeah, I mean the momentum there is good. That's where we really focused our enterprise security business. We've had some nice wins there in the past couple of quarters. So it's going to be a continued focus for us.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. A follow-up question would be, can you update us on any new product advancements in the sensor area that maybe affecting the company in 2019, 2020 with regard to what you may be doing with Boson or Lepton, or something new that would take it \u2013 that would take characteristics of those small sensors that you have out there a little bit further. I know you're not give out anything specific but I'm just wondering what you're looking for in terms of your infrared sensors to take it to the next step or the next year? And who's going to be requiring something like that?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, that's a great question. I mean, at the core, no pun intended of our business, we're always seeking to push size, weight, power SWaP-C performance. The Lepton was obviously a breakthrough for us and you're seeing the Lepton now integrated into a different security sensors, for example the Lepton integrated with a EO camera and LEDs that can light up with onboard analytics to know if it's a dog or a humanoid moving to trigger the alarm. I'll go back though to what we're doing around unmanned applications, the more that we can do by pushing SWaP-C with sensors gives our unmanned applications more endurance and more capability.","So that intersects our company in a lot of places. Unmanned solutions that we're delivering, security solutions, I could go on and on, ADAS for example as well. But absolutely the Boson we're real proud of, it's maturing nicely in production, et cetera getting into a host of different solutions but we're certainly not satisfied with it. We always seek to constantly sort of disrupt ourselves with regard to our cores.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Yes. Thank you. Appreciate it.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We do have a follow-up question from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. Carol, the cash flow statement in the release cites $26 million of other activity impacting operating cash flows. What is in there?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So there are within pensions and other liabilities is part of that. So that includes amounts relative to the consent agreement, penalty and then just changes relative to a combination of the pension and just other assortment liabilities, but the concern agreement is probably the biggest piece of it.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Is your change in working capital in that number? Or can you tell us what that was in the quarter?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So the total working capital number the improvement for that, the net working capital we've been down for three quarters in a row now and we're down 8% on a year-over-year basis and that's primarily driven by accounts receivable and accounts payable improvements.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. So I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any additional or concluding comments.","James J.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Shane Harrison. Please go ahead.","Shane Harrison ","Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Please note that our earnings press release and presentation slides that will be referred to on this call are available under the Events & Presentations section of flir.com\/investor.","Before we begin this conference call, I need to remind you statements made on this call, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on our current expectation.

We believe that non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of our core ongoing operating results and facilitate consistent comparison of results over time. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning.","Let me now turn the call over to Jim Cannon, President and CEO of FLIR Systems. Jim?","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Shane. And thank you everyone for joining FLIR's fourth quarter 2017 earnings call. With Shane and me today; Carol Lowe, our CFO; Travis Merrill, the President of Commercial Business Unit; Frank Pennisi, the President of Industrial Business Unit. And I'd like to welcome David Ray. The new President of Government and Defense Business Unit. ","The fourth quarter was another sound quarter from a growth and profitability standpoint. We grew the top line at 4% year-over-year, improved our adjusted gross margin; reached the highest quarterly adjusted operating margin since 2012; and improved our working capital metrics. The quarter kept off the year that saw a record level of revenue and adjusted earnings per share. We feel we are set up well for 2018 with a strong backlog. Our reposition security business and a lower than expected tax rate. We are very encouraged to see our law makers agree on a multiyear US Department of Defense budget. And while we are well into our 2018 operating plan, this will help us focus on US DoD priorities for 2019 and beyond. ","I'll start the review of the fourth quarter on Slide 3 of the presentation. This morning we reported fourth quarter revenue of $495 million, which was an increase of 4% over the fourth quarter of 2016 and 2% on an organic basis. Our commercial products revenue grew 7% over the prior year and our government products were flat with the prior year. As a reminder and is discussed on our last call, our customers accelerated the delivery of couple of key programs into the third quarter that affected this fourth quarter of 2017. ","Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income grew 10% and 8% over the prior year respectively. With operating margin expanding approximately 80 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2016. We demonstrated solid leverage by growing operating income, double the rate of revenue growth. Adjusted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.58, which represents 12% growth versus last year's adjusted earnings per share of $0.52. Total company 12 months backlog finished the quarter at $652 million, that's up $60 million or 10% over the end of 2016. Indeed the highest year end backlog level in nearly a decade. For the full year, shown on Slide 4, revenue of $1.8 billion was 8% higher than 2016. Organically, 2017 revenue growth was 2% over 2016. Commercial products grew 13% and government products grew 2% compared to the prior year. Adjusted gross profit grew 12% with margin improving 180 basis points. Adjusted operating income also grew 12% while adjusted EPS grew 11% from a $1.69 to $1.88. ","As mentioned on our earlier calls and shown on Slide 5, we intend to fuel parts of our business, feed other parts of our business and focus our operating portfolio. As announced last week, we sold our Canada based non thermal security operation that included Lorex branded retail security products, as well as small and medium business security products in the first quarter of 2018. We made the decision to divest this business in order to better focus our security division, differentiated technology on the more attractive critical infrastructure and enterprise markets for security solutions. We want to thank the employees of Lorex our SMB business for their hard work over these last five years. ","On Slide 6, looking ahead to 2018, today we announced our initial expectations for full year revenue to be in the range of $1.73 billion to $1.76 billion. And full year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.05 to $2.10. We exclude the results of the divested businesses from 2017. These ranges represent expected revenue growth of 4% to 6% of organic growth and adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 12%. This outlook represents our highest organic growth rate in nearly a decade, and implies solid operating leverage in the business. Carol will provide more color around this guidance. ","We also today announced the 7% increase to our quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share. As we discussed in the past, and as we were begin to reporting in three business units rather than six segments beginning in the first quarter of 2018, for your reference in the appendix of slide deck, you'll find quarterly revenue and operating income history by our new business units. This realignment of businesses and resources will reduce our complexity, improve our agility, unlock synergies, increase team collaboration and enhance management focus. It is our goal that this lead to improved ability to grow and create sustained shareholder value. ","With the addition of David as our Government and Defense Business Unit President in January, our executive staff transition is complete. And we are ready to execute on our strategy and accomplish our task of exceeding our commitments with integrity, while we innovate the world's sixth sense to enhance perception awareness in order to improve decision making to save lives and livelihood. We intent to discuss our strategy in detail at our upcoming Investor Day on May 16 in New York City. We will be sending out invitation in the coming weeks but please hold this day on your calendar.","On Slide 7, you'll find an update and overview of the FLIR method or TFM. Our continuous business improvement initiative that we feel will accelerate organic growth, improve profitability and generate excess cash to maximize value creation. During the fourth quarter, we began aligning internal resources as well as recruited new talent to execute on our TFM strategies. For 2018, one of our priorities is the creation of a pricing analysis function to apply pricing strategy across all of our businesses. So we ensure we are making informed pricing decisions. Additionally, we are implementing several productivity enhancement projects which are intended to improve manufacturing efficiencies and increase our sensor production yields, which is as important as those savings trickle through all of our vertically integrated businesses. ","The longer term mission of TFM includes focusing our sights on pricing and productivity. It also drives innovation and product development, standardize this core business processes, improve cross business communication, enhances our talent development programs and boost our acquisition and integration processes. Ultimately, all these benefits will better enable us to grow organically, drive strong profit margins and generate cash. ","On the topic of product innovation, you'll see on Slide 8 a summary of the products we've introduced since our last earnings call. Many of these products are built around Boson, our highly differentiated thermal camera core that offers industry leading size, weight and power consumption capabilities. First, our Security segment introduced a new thermal bullet camera called the FLIR FB Series ID, which combines the thermal sensor with high performance video analytics to offer high reliability and alarming solutions. In December, the security segment also introduced the Quasar Panoramic visible light camera that effectively reduces the number of cameras required for wide area surveillance. ","At the consumer electronic show in Las Vegas, we rolled our second -generation thermal vision Automotive Development Kit or ADK. The ADK is designed to introduce autonomous automobile system designers to the power of thermal sensing, specifically how the technology is ideal for sensing at night through adverse weather conditions, identifying and classifying living being, sensing at long distance which includes seeing up to 4x farther than traditional headlights. In January, at the Shooting, Hunting and Outdoor Trader SHOT Show in Las Vegas, our Outdoor and Tactical Systems business or OTS introduced the FLIR Bridge, advanced thermo monocular. The Boson based bridge incorporate the digital compass and other features into a light weight housing that can be hand held or helmet mounted. Also at the SHOT show OTS' Armasight by FLIR brand launched three new family of night vision scope that offer multiple mounting options, better battery life and more lens options for multiple fields of view. And lastly, our Instrument segment NGS brand launched our latest intelliRock system, which is a sensor system used by construction professional that provide data to ensure the strength and the quality of concrete. The new intelliRock III version now incorporates a Lepton camera to add thermal sensing capability to the solution. ","Let me now welcome Carol to FLIR's quarterly earnings call and have her review the fourth quarter financial and operational highlights. Carol?","Carol Lowe ","Thank you, Jim. On Slide 9, you'll see our fourth quarter financial results. Please note with the exception of cash flow, all of these financials are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the appendix.","Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $495 million, a 4% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. Geographically, revenue increased 25% in the Middle East, 12% in Europe and 2% in the US. While Asia was down 8% due to a tough comparable in the prior year. The strength in the Middle East region was due to deliveries from the surveillance segment. Revenue to the US government was 24% of total revenue, and increased 2% versus last year. Adjusted gross margin improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 49%, driven by product mix, acquisition and new products.","Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 23%, about 80 basis points higher than last year, with the gross margin improvement being offset partially by higher R&D and selling spend. Adjusted net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was up 14% to $82 million and adjusted earnings per share were $0.58, 12% higher than the prior year. Quarterly cash flow from operations grew 2% $99 million, and was 121% of adjusted net income. ","During the quarter, we returned $21 million to shareholders through the payment of dividend. At the segment level, revenue growth in the Detection, OEM and emerging, Maritime and Instrument segment was partially offset by declines in the Surveillance and Security segments. Improved margins in several segments helped to grow total adjusted operating income faster than revenue. We finished the year with $519 million of cash. ","On Slide 10, you'll see our full year financial results. Consolidated revenue was $1.8 billion, an 8% increase over prior year and 2% on an organic basis. Geographically, revenue increased in all regions except the Middle East, which was down slightly. Sales to the US government increased approximately $50 million for the year, up 12% and represented approximately 26% of total revenue compared to 25% in 2016. ","Consolidated full year adjusted gross margin was 49%, a 180 basis points higher than last year due to margin accretive acquisition, product mix and new products. Our adjusted operating margin for the year was 20%, 70 basis points better than the prior year. Adjusted to 2017 net earnings totaled $263 million, or $1.88 per fully diluted share compared with $234 million, or $1.69 for fully diluted share. All segments except security grew to revenue in 2017 versus the prior year.","The decline in security was due primarily to the retail product line; a business that as Jim mentioned has since been divested. Total segment operating margin improved 90 basis points for the year. Our guidance for full year revenue is $1.73 billion to $1.76 billion. And full year adjusted EPS of $2.05 to $2.10 representing revenue growth of 4% to 6% and adjusted EPS growth of 9% to 12%, when you exclude the divested security businesses. ","This outlook assumed a diluted share count of 142 million shares and that our adjusted effected tax rate will go from the 25.4% in 2017 to 21.5% in 2018. The reduction in the effected rate in 2018 is due to the enactment of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. The new statutory federal rate reduction of 14% impacts our rate by about six points given over 50% of our income is earned outside of the US. This reduction is offset by approximately one point from the elimination of certain tax credit under the new law and by another point on the net change and our expected foreign income tax rate. The US tax reforms resulted in $93 million of discrete tax items in our fourth quarter 2017 GAAP results. This is made up of $81 million of deemed repatriation charges of previously earned foreign income, most of which will be payable over the next eight years. And a $12 million charge due to the revaluation of our net deferred tax asset. ","Detailing the segments a bit more, you'll see on the left side of Slide 11, a summary of Surveillance's fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter revenue for Surveillance was $151 million, down 5% from the fourth quarter of 2016. Strength in land products was offset by softness in airborne, OTS and integrated systems product lines compared to the prior year. Operating income for the Surveillance segment was $48 million in line with the prior year but we saw an operating margin improvement from 30% to 32%. Surveillance bookings grew 9% year-over-year with growth in all regions except Europe. Notably in the quarter, we booked a $7 million order for Black Hornet Nano UAS system by the Australian army. Surveillance's backlog increased 8% over the prior year to $354 million. ","On the right side of Slide 11 is a summary of the Detection segment, which saw fourth quarter revenue grow 18% year-over-year to $39 million. Timing of deliveries under the DR-SKO program drove this increase. Operating profit increased 18% with margins maintaining at 30%. Detection finished the fourth quarter with $59 million of backlog, up $2 million from the end of 2016. ","Moving to Slide 12. Instrument's revenue of $103 million was up 7% over the fourth quarter of 2016. And helped Instrument finished 2017 with an all time high annual revenue level. Broad product line growth drove the Q4 revenue increase with particular strength in volume, handheld, plant predictive maintenance cameras as well as growth in our science camera. Instrument's operating profit in the fourth quarter increased 3% over the fourth quarter of 2016 to $33 million or 32% of revenue. Operating margins declined 110 basis points as investments from the sales organization and R&D were made to accelerate growth as we move forward in 2018. ","The results for the OEM and Emerging segment are shown on Slide 12 as well. OEM and Emerging's fourth quarter revenue was $88 million, increasing 15% over last year. And represented another all time quarterly high in revenue for the segment. The acquired Integrated Imaging Solutions line of business was the drive of the growth. Organic revenue was up slightly due to strong results from our Lepton cores partially offset by a small decline in other cores and component sales. The Lepton revenue in the quarter was the highest level of Lepton revenue since its introduction in 2014. OEM and Emerging operating profit grew 43% year-over-year to reach $26 million. Operating margin of 29% was up 560 basis points versus the prior year on higher product margins and improved yield. Order backlog in OEM and Emerging segment increased 5% during the quarter to $169 million. ","Moving to Slide 13, on the left side you'll see the Security segment revenue of $71 million was down 3% compared to last year's fourth quarter. High-end cooled thermal was the primary driver of the decline due to the fact that in the prior year we shipped a number of cool security cameras for specific project that did not repeat in 2017. Security operating income was $5.7 million or 8% of revenue and declined 36% from the prior year. Continued pressure on gross margin in the Lorex retail and the SMB businesses combined with higher investment and Lorex e-commerce marketing drove the decline in margin versus the prior year. As Jim stated, we completed the sale of the retail and SMB portion of the security segment last week. The businesses divested had combined revenue of $140 million in 2017 and were breakeven on an operating income basis. We recorded a $23.6 million non-cash loss in our GAAP results related to the transaction. ","Maritime segment revenue was $44 million, up 14% versus the prior year, which represented the highest growth rate in this segment since our acquisition of Raymarine in 2010. The market performance of Raymarine Axiom Multi Function Displays led this performance which spurt growth in related sensors and instrumentation including Thermal Cameras, Echosounders and Radars in the quarter. Maritime operating income was $4 million or 9% of revenue. This represents the highest operating margin for fourth quarter since we created the Maritime segment. Improved margins combined with OpEx discipline created significant leverage. With operating income growing 90% over the fourth quarter of 2016.","This concludes my summary of the financials and the segment. I'll now turn the call back over to Jim. ","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Carol. We are proud but not satisfied with these results and with our performance in 2017. It was a year a lot of change and the team executed very well considering, I commend the very hard work of all of our employees in making 2017 a success. As we look ahead, our focus will be on growing organically, improving margins and deploying cash effectively. We pivoted our security division away from consumer oriented market and towards the markets that can drive the most value out of our differentiators. The FLIR message is underway and we expect to begin the same improvements in cost, processes and innovation during 2018 and beyond. ","And I now feel that we have the right senior team, organizational rhythms and operating structure in place to take this excellent company to the next level and achieve our vision of enabling the world with a powerful sixth sense. I'll end the prepared remarks by reminding everyone of daily task. To consistently exceed our commitments with integrity and our purpose, which is to innovate the world sixth sense to enhance perception, awareness in order to save lives and livelihood? We are committed to organic growth, margin improvement and executing our plans without compromise to our core values. ","I'll now open up the call for questions-and-answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question today is coming from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning, everyone. Can we talk about balance sheet utilization because with the strong free cash generation of the business, you are back into a net cash position after spending really just a few quarters out of on -- haven't bought back stock in a little while the guidance has the share count going up a decent amount. So what is the thought process around balance sheet, proper balance sheet utilization? Where should net debt to EBITDA and net to debt to cap be and what are you looking to do? I know Jim you've talked about wanting to add more inorganically. What's out there in terms of size and could you not at least offset share count creep while still looking for sizable acquisitions?","Jim Cannon","Sure. Well, as we mentioned in earlier call, we paid down some of our debt in the third quarter as we levered up to prepare for an acquisition in the first half of 2017 which just didn't materialize, right. And then as we -- it went through the second half of this year and as you stated, it's important task to grow inorganically as we think about this business going forward and the capabilities we have. There is a lot that we want to do to augment those capabilities in particular as we talk about moving from sensing solutions and the helping make decisions, the analytics and software required, again to focus on total mission outcomes for our users. And that's going to require inorganic activities like it happen in concert with organic work. Now with regard to the potential targets that are out there, their size et cetera. It's sort of all over the Board, and I think you all know evaluations right now can be incredibly high. Now we have a very active pipeline underway. Of course, there is only so much certainly we can talk about that here. Have not yet certainly been able to execute on the deal in the back half of this year to talk about. But regardless, lots of activity underway and as we mentioned on earlier calls. We want to have a balanced approach of share buyback opportunistically when it makes sense for so deploying our own capital to invest in our technologies. We want to constantly innovate and disrupt of ourselves if you will, do acquisitions as we've talked about. And we are also looking at opportunities to make minority investment in companies that perhaps we don't want to acquire out right, but have a technology or capability that's important to us. So that's an area of interest as well. But Carol any additional thoughts from your perspective. ","Carol Lowe ","Yes. Thank you, Jim. I would say we will share more information on our capital allocation strategy when we have our Investor Day in May. We do enjoy the benefit of investment grade rating and would intent to maintain that rating. We feel like it's the right decision for the company, it gives us financial flexibility to address acquisitions as they come up under the right strategic acquisitions in addition to rather when they are a broader macro impact from an economic standpoint. So we will continue to focus on maintaining the investment grade. And look for the right opportunities to invest for both organic growth as well as acquisitions as Jim described. ","Jim Cannon","And I'll just cap it off, Noah, by saying right now our focus we have and you see it in the guidance of 46% organic growth. We want to consistently demonstrate organic growth. And as we mentioned in the past -- in organic strategy that compliment that as we go forward. ","Noah Poponak","Where do you -- where you can take leverage net debt to cap or net debt to EBITDA and maintain your investment grade rating? ","Carol Lowe ","So we can probably go right now up to about 2.5x but again it's all depending on the quality of the asset. If we are executing an acquisition. So depending on the cash flow generated and the accretive value that gives us room as well, as well as the commitment to bring leverage back down. So as always with acquisitions it depends but we have quite a bit of room to go from our current leverage grade before we would even start pushing that out of bound. ","Noah Poponak","And where would you pin the likelihood that, that happen in 2018 that you take leverage 2x -2.5x for inorganic activity.","Jim Cannon","Yes. There is no way really for us to predict that, right. Certainly would be opportunistic as those kind of deals came along. But right now would be difficult for us to predict anyway. ","Noah Poponak","So with the guidance having the share count up to decent amount, should we think of that as there is enough in the pipeline to --even though you can't predict that likelihood that there is enough in the pipeline that there is decent chance of that happening or should we think of that as more like a placeholder and if nothing happen to your buyback stock.","Jim Cannon","Yes. We really don't want to speculate what's going to happen with future acquisitions in 2018. Suffice to say we are going to continue to be acquisitive but impossible for us to predict timing or give you any sort of forward looking insight there. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Peter Arment from Baird. Your line is now live","Peter Arment","Thank you. Good morning, Jim, Carol, Shane. Jim, on the guidance when you -- the 46% organic maybe can you just may talk about some maybe the puts and takes, how you are maybe thinking about that? And how that looks maybe on if you can from a segment level, maybe if you could just quantify it a little bit? Thanks. ","Jim Cannon","Yes, sure, Peter. If we look at past performance, 46% organic growth is a sound improvement as we go into 2018. And we look across the business and you know from following our company for sometime with six segments now three business units, over the past several years it's been a bit choppy the end market. We would have one business that could be significantly ahead but then that could be neutralized by another business that perhaps the market dynamics weren't strong. Right now as we look at our end market across commercial and industrial and government defense business unit, we feel pretty good about all of those markets. We have a multiyear budget now that's been passed by our law makers and while in 2018 that doesn\u2019t mean a lot tailwind to us, certainly going into 2019 with OCO dollar, OCO funding being included in that budget. It gives some confidence for our war fighters to make decision around readiness and modernization et cetera. Our commercial business unit, we took a pretty big step focusing the security business away from retail and into places where we can differentiate. Our Maritime business is growing nicely throughout 2017. And with Axiom and other new products has momentum. The industrial business unit in particular with the acquisition of IIS which anniversaried itself in November is seeing just tremendous organic growth throughout 2017. And that's without the introduction of thermal into their kind of product or technology offering. That's with their core machine vision. So across all of that they use when we think about that 46% organic growth rate, we don't see any real laggard. All the business units we expect to perform and contribute to that kind of guidance. And we want to throughout as we mentioned earlier do that with leverage down to our earnings. So as I mentioned on the earlier question, organic growth maintaining and improving margins, good capital efficiency, those are the three sound metrics that we are going to be really, really focused on. And then as you'll hear in our Investor Day, executing the strategy with inorganic opportunities that lay in accretive to that effort.","Peter Arment","It's helpful. And just about as a follow up just you mentioned kind of create this new or pricing strategy. I was wondering if you could just give us an example maybe how this is different from what is being done today from I guess you mentioned standardization across the platform.","Jim Cannon","Yes. So with the full method and we are really excited about it. It brings an operating discipline into our business that really begins to take us into -- I don't know -- I hate to use the word next level but for lack of better one I'll use it, to the next level. Again, FLIR is a great company but as we brought six segments into three business units, we really tapped into a lot of economy of scale and synergies when it comes to standardizing processes. And when we think about how we want to drive margin improvement, pricing and productivity are two of those key levers. Now with regard to productivity, for a long time we've worked to improve our processes and improve yield and improve again the way that we implement lean on the shop floor but we can always do better. And we've got different site sort of different places on that continuum of lean manufacturing prowess. With regard to prices, pricing the same holds true. So we want to bring in a seasoned pricing leader who has spent a career in that discipline and we are fortunate to get great individual on board, now building out that team and you know with the good pricing analysis, first it start with collection the data right. Really understanding where those opportunities are, pricing to win et cetera. I'll say that the team is formed. Those efforts and operating rhythms are underway. But a pricing effort won't take effect right away. We are going to be working through the first half of 2018. And I expect more into the second half of 2018 really going into 2019 is where we are going to see the real tailwind of that effort. So the 46% organic growth that we are targeting right now is really volume driven to begin with.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Drew Lipke from Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Drew Lipke","Yes, good morning, guys. Just maybe talking about the commercial strategy and thinking about the level of vertical integration that FLIR has historically targeted there and maybe you rolled out your Thermal by FLIR at CES, can you maybe talk about this and talk about some of the changes that you are making in the go-to-market strategy in commercial?","Jim Cannon","Yes. So when we think about -- when you mentioned Thermal by FLIR, I mean that's in our industrial business unit but we'll talk about commercial products in general. I wouldn't say there is any significant shift to how we are going to market per se but we are certainly organizing differently. We are thinking about end markets. For example, first responders, there are a lot of different parts of our business to touch that. How can we come together and have a more coalesced offering? But across our commercial business unit and industrial business unit, there is a lot of product innovation it's underway that's given our sales team a lot of great tools to go out in the market and help solve problems for our customers. We mentioned ADK that we launched at the consumer electronic show which is really helping autonomous automobile designers understand what they can do with thermal. Again, the benefits we could talk about on and on as we mentioned earlier its capability. And Thermal by FLIR, we got a lot of great partners that again have end users that thermal technology is really helped with their jobs day in and day out and accomplishing their mission. So you'll see our partners with Thermal by FLIR, I don't know if it signals a different wholesale go-to-market strategy, but certainly maturing some very strong relationships with partners in the marketplace. ","Drew Lipke","Okay. And then it seems there wasn't a viable case for thermal in retail security. And a lot of that seemed to tie to the fact you couldn't really drive the thermal penetration there and realize the pricing. As we think about some of your other markets, I mean are there any others that need portfolio shaping or maybe if there is not a real viable case for thermal in your opinion as you look maybe at the commercial segment. ","Jim Cannon","Well, you are right. And again we made the decision with the retail business that long term it wasn't a fit as we want to focus on more of those perimeter security application where thermal really is a differentiator and critical infrastructure et cetera. In our Maritime business which is growing nicely and improving margins, we again got that business out of bankruptcy and have steadily made improvement to, but it was really this year with Axiom, the new MFD and other technologies that it began to grow and accrete at great clip and when we looked at what it was, our thermal offering for the recreational boater there wasn't perhaps the adoption we wanted. Now we are addressing that and have addressed that by introducing price point to the more affordable for the recreational boater to use thermal on the water and also then focusing our business on a lot of commercial maritime application. I'll point to the SINS and SINS 2 order that we secured from the coastguard. When those guys are going out to the sea the recreational boater are trying to get off the water. And there is no doubt that thermal technologies are an important technology to increase awareness and perception on the sea to avoid other objects to operate under tough weather conditions et cetera. So again right now not prepared to announce any kind of wholesale go-to-market difference. But you'll see us continue to focus on in the maritime space. Those commercial opportunities and build our relationships with the folks like the coastguard, maritime law enforcement et cetera. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is now live.","Jonathan Ho","Hi, good morning. I just wanted to start out could you maybe quantify for us or just remind us of how much of the revenue was pulled forward from Q3 to Q4 in terms of the Surveillance business unit. And then just given some of the changes in the business how we should we think about any potential shift in the seasonality for 2017 either on the revenue or expense lines? ","Jim Cannon","Right. So we had about $15 million that came into the third quarter of 2017 out of the fourth quarter of 2017 for that Surveillance business accelerated delivery that the customers needed. The EO\/IR-FP program which was awarded in Q3 was shipped about $7 million of that in the third quarter. Another $4 million in the fourth quarter as we are constituting or reconstituting the supply chain to make delivery. In DR-SKO was another piece again that had that shift. If we think about seasonality going forward, I don't know foresee, we don't predict any huge change in what we think traditionally with our seasonality. If we think about our government and defense business now that there is a multiyear budget in place perhaps that provides more consistency. Whether would it be a bit more volatility and how some of the businesses would come in but at this point no real change I believe in our seasonal. Carol, anything to add from your perspective? ","Carol Lowe ","So, Jonathan, I would just note that as we look at our 2018 operating plan and the guidance we provided, just a reminder that we did have a very strong Q3 as well as Q4 in 2017. So from a comp basis when we compare 2018 to 2017, the second half of the year will be a little bit more challenge versus both comps compared to the first half of 2018.","Jonathan Ho","Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just as a follow up in terms of your comments around operating leverage. I guess I wanted to get an understanding or better understanding of what you think the magnitude or the impact and the timing for some of the process enhancement you are looking at would be for either 2018, 2019 maybe sort of a medium term. What can you really do from an operating leverage standpoint?","Jim Cannon","That's a great question. So we have expanded margins throughout the course of the year. But I would not attribute that margin expansion in 2017 to FLIR method. We introduced the FLIR method in the third quarter, we established executive sponsorship, and we began to detail how we want to execute it and how it makes it for FLIR, what are the levers that we want to go after? Because it wasn't just productivity but we want to increase velocity. We want to increase velocity in which we innovate. We want to focus on talent development. Lot of components to the FLIR method. Again to mature and become a much more disciplined operator as we move from six segments into three business unit. So, now I am happy to say we do have that dedicated leadership and resources to point of impact. We moved some very talented folks to be dedicated to FLIR method. We recruited some great talent from outside. And probably our biggest event to date is in the fourth quarter we did a big effort in our IIS business that you know is growing significantly over the past year to a point that its backlog really needed to be reduced. We got improved our capacities there. So the team went up there with intent to do just that. Reorganize the manufacturing footprint, shop floor to be able to get more products out, more velocity and capacity through the business. And we are beginning to see that. But like all continuous improvement efforts, there is a bit of long tailwind until we can really realize forecast and has great confidence in predicting when that productivity will come through. So as we think about 2018 right now, while we certainly have internal targets that we are going after, much of the FLIR methods benefit as on the pricing side will come towards the end of 2018 with the intent that we are really trying to build strong conditions with regard to margin improvement as carry over into 2019.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Peter Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question. ","Peter Skibitski","Good morning, guys. Jim you alluded earlier to the strong kind of budget allocate at this point within DoD. And in light of that I am just wondering are you guys trying to see any kind of chunkier, larger program opportunity at DoD? Or you think as far as Surveillance goes it's a matter of continue to kind of hit signals and doubles right in the home runs, you got the kind of their large a quarter or two ago. I am just wondering if there is more out there with the budget going up.","Jim Cannon ","There are more out there. There are some pretty significant programs probably the largest of which is the soonest is G-BOSS-E which is going to be what the EO\/IR-FP or what used to be RAID evolves into. So certainly that's something that's front incentive for us. Others as well, David Ray brings a new perspective to our government defense business unit as well. We are going to compete for programs as well as continue to go out for signals and doubles. But why don't I let David say few words in this regard.","David Ray ","Thank you, Jim. Jim mentioned earlier, I think the outlook for 2018 is good for the business. To your question about the budget, as the budget firms up as we talked about, we see more opportunity in kind of your rotary ring platform with respect to modernization budget as they firm up. Jim talked about readiness which we think about the concept of readiness really being able to look at ways to modernize existing systems, other end field. Both land, sea and air, those present opportunities for us from an upgrade perspective to really look at ways to we can grow business with those double and triples as you talk about versus the signals that we kind of seen in the past. ","Jim Cannon","And we are not opposed to home runs either. So we are going to swing for the fences where we can for sure.","Peter Skibitski","Thanks guys. Let me ask one for Carol. Hey, Carol, do you have any CapEx expectation for 2018? Maybe a D&A look also. ","Carol Lowe ","So our CapEx, we are expecting it to be higher than what it has been in the last couple of years; ranging somewhere around that 2.5% to 3% of revenue. So that's where we expect that to be. Our D&A, depreciation and amortization and including our stock comp amortization with $102 million for 2017 and we would expect it to be basically at that level for 2018. ","Peter Skibitski","Got it. And Carol does this new revenue recognition standard impact you guys in any meaningful way? ","Carol Lowe ","No. It doesn\u2019t. The transition impacts that will go directing retain earnings upon implementation. It's less than $5 million and on a go forward basis it's not significant. Obviously, some timing impact especially in the government and defense business but overall not material. ","Peter Skibitski","Great. One last one guys maybe for you Jim. I feel like we haven't talked about this yet. And I thought you needed to be broached because it has been in your filings. Does this [I Tower] or kind of language let's call, that's been in your filings. Is there any reason for us to be concerned there? I raised it because I had another company that had an issue when it cost them some money. How are you guys thinking about that? I am sure you have fair language in the K? ","Jim Cannon","Sure. What we have consistently disclosed that we are in continuing dialogue with the State of Department with respect to compliance program. And we have detailed the voluntary and other disclosures that we made to the state department with respect these issues. We've also mentioned on previous call the investments that we've made to remedy these issues, these are areas that we've maintained significant focus and we are working hard to make sure we got the best processes, best people in place to ensure we are world class in that regard. Historically, a consent agreement has been tool used by State Department to ensure mediation in situations like ours. But regardless the outcome of our continued discussions with the state of a company, we have both the legal and moral obligation to safeguard our technology. And we are committed to do that. As a veteran myself and to represent the hundreds of veterans we have at FLIR, we know first hand how important it is to protect technology for our country. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Co. Your line is now live.","Jim Ricchiuti","Hi. Good morning. Just question on the IIS business and you alluded to this, the strength you saw last year and I am just wondering what's the outlook look like for this business just given the difficult comparison? What do you seeing in some of the core commercial market that they address? ","Jim Cannon","Well, again the acquisition of Point Grey or IIS is we call it now fantastic acquisition. And we bought the business again we intended to introduce thermal technologies but their organic growth rate, the backlog then became and all hands on deck to meet that backlog, really we've not even gotten to the step yet which we see as opportunity as we go forward. Now, throughout 2017 they grew tremendously. Do we expect that continue growth rate? No. They had one job in particular, it's drove a lot of organic growth. We are kind of gotten through that. And we are backed down to what we will say is what -- is a more normal rate going forward. There is still a pretty significant cliff. Also mentioned, this is one of the places where we first had made big steps with the FLIR method to drive and improve capacity. But with us here is Frank Pennisi; he leads the Industrial Business Unit. Frank, any additional comments you like to make about IIS. ","Frank Pennisi ","Yes. I would tell you that IIS sits in two fabulous markets. You got machine video and market at the high single digit market; you got a people count market, its lower double digit market. And the fact that there is a strong player in that arena, there is a lot of tailwinds and lot of ability to continue driving and performing throughout the year. ","Jim Cannon","And you know its part of our company. We are going to continue to invest in. We like the technology. There are again great synergies with the rest of FLIR and the customers we serve. So again you'll see us continue to feed that part of our business. ","Jim Ricchiuti","And follow up question. You may have addressed this and I may have just missed it. But did you comment at all on the potential gross margin lift that you could see from the divesture of the Lorex business? ","Carol Lowe ","No. We didn't make the specific comment at the gross margin as the operation margin level. The improvement without the Lorex business for 2017 would have resulted in 170 basis points higher operating margin. The business that was dispose that is basically ran it breakeven at an operating income level for 2017. ","Jim Ricchiuti","Got it. But is it fair to say that it has been a drag on gross margins? ","Jim Cannon","Yes. $140 million in revenue is breakeven on margin, yes. ","Jim Ricchiuti","Yes. And the last question for me and this is more of just with respect to the automotive market, more of a bigger picture question. You had some challenges clearly penetrating the automotive market. And I am just wondering Jim, as you think about that market and the ADK, any sense as to how we might think about FLIR playing in this market longer term? ","Jim Cannon","Sure. I don't know if I characterize as challenges. I don't think that marketplace and a technology that they are going to be used for ADK are still very much evolving. Low cost radars, thermal sensors, lidar et cetera, there is still just a lot of technologies been explored and price points being examined to see what make sense. As we talked about ADK and introducing that, that's another way by which we want to drive adoption awareness of the capabilities of thermal technology. And we've had successes in particular with using thermal cameras to identify deer or other animal that could be on the side of the road ahead or outside of the headlight beams to be able to predict any kind of collision there. And I'd say also when we think about ADAS, we think about thermal technology and again we do more than just thermal low cost radar et cetera. We think about unmanned not just automotive. For example, commercial trucking applications that indeed might enter the market and be seen on the roads before you see automobiles an ADAS applications or the same technology is used on the military side of the house, where you will see more and more unmanned vehicles on the battlefield. One of the biggest casualties producing tactics that our enemies have used has been the IED. And so having trucks or convoys moving over open road and in the battlefield exposed to that, it's certainly something that our leaders want to eliminate going forward. And again there you see our technologies that are already widely adopted and widely known. So I think there is certainly market maturity that's got to continue to happen. We are going to continue to educate and collaborate with our partners to inform them about the capabilities of thermal technologies but we want to also provide a whole suite of sensing solutions in that regard not just for the automotive marketplace but I would call it for the unmanned space.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is now live.","Jeff Kessler","Thank you. And hi Jim, hi Carol, hi Shane. Just two quick questions. Number one as you consolidate and come out with basically three new groupings that speaks towards cross selling. And cross selling obviously not just across all of the visions but particularly within the three new divisions more emphasis on that. Are there going to be some incentive set up to that are not in place right now to improve and incentivize more cross selling of product as these groups begin to -- as the group begin to consolidate from 6 to 3?","Jim Cannon","Jeff. That's a great question. And that's -- it's absolutely one of the opportunities that we wanted to after as we consolidated from six segments to three business units. For example, our OEM business sells through a lot of defense prime contractors that also touch what was our Surveillance business. Or if you look in the commercial business unit, we have security products and technologies that sell well within intelligent traffic solution or other transportation safety application. Or maritime for example, we mentioned maritime working to -- with the coastguard on SINS and SINS2 and obviously we worked with the coastguard on the Surveillance side as well with their airborne gambles and whole host of other technology. So step one is bring the businesses together under common leadership. So you got a leader that's making sure they are making decisions for once FLIR if you will. And then step two just that, how do we organize our team, identify those end customers we are going to and de -conflict any space that we might have there. So we are putting the best space forward. And then lastly, of course, we want our sales team as they go out in the marketplace not to be disincentive or that see other parts of our company indeed as competitors within the market. But operator as one FLIR and as we go into 2018, those things are coming together. We are again about a quarter and half into the integration of the segments into the business unit, but already opportunities are coming forward. That's great question, Jeff.","Jeff Kessler","Okay. And one final question that is I think it was mentioned that Boson sales were down a little bit. Was that for one segment or was it for the company as a whole? And that was for the quarter I am assuming.","Jim Cannon","No. I must have must misspoke or you have heard that wrong. Boson is actually up. And we\u2019ve got some great product launches with it. The Boson for its size, weight, power consumption, processing capability, market leading capability. So when OTS was to breach in other cameras, the Duo Pro, et cetera, Boson now as we are improving more and more just to get the capacity up and yield up as well. Boson is growing product line for us. ","Carol Lowe ","Yes. I think just to clarify the reference was to some other core and core components that was not relative to Boson. ","Jeff Kessler","Okay. ","Jim Cannon ","Boson has been very well received in the marketplace; it's enabling again a lot of solutions and capability. ","Jeff Kessler","I only asked because I must have misunderstood because that surprised me greatly. That's it. Great, thank you very much. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now live.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for sticking around here and take the questions. Maybe Jim or Carol, I don't know who want to hand this one. But you clearly --you refocused the security segment; you got momentum in all markets. The volume seems to be driving all the growth. I understand the pricing analysis and productivity. Maybe you get a little bit of benefit in late 2018 but that's more 2019. I would have expected to see more leverage and drop through. I mean it seems like the margin expansion next year is really just from losing the low margin Lorex and we've sort of got flat operating margin with the majority of EPS growth coming from tax. Is there more conservatism there? And I could appreciate Jim and Carol; this is your first time issuing full year guidance. But any color why there is not more core margin expansion on the volume growth?","Carol Lowe ","So if you are looking at earnings per share, the one thing note so the tax reform is giving us the year-over-year benefits $0.10, so noticed favorability for that. You also have to take into account the dilution that occurred relative to shares in 2017. That creates an overhang for us in 2018. And so it masks good operating leverage performance by about $0.04 per share. So you have to take that into account as well. And I think that's why it's not coming through in terms of the leverage that we are really seeing in operations results for the year. ","Michael Ciarmoli","Okay. But it still seems like the margins are going to be fairly flattish, right? So you are just saying that there is some of that overhang was in the margins as well. ","Carol Lowe ","No. From a margin standpoint we do have -- we have uplift relative to the sale of Lorex business. And right now again we are focused on accretive revenue growth, organic growth that's built into the forecast and as Jim noted, it's predominantly on volume for 2018. ","Jim Cannon","And you know as we look back in past years, putting 46 points organic growth, maintaining indeed expanding margins consistently demonstrating leverage. That something that's real important for us to have a consistent say do ratio going forward. And that's why you hear so much focus about the FLIR method, pricing et cetera. Systemic things that we can put in place so that if we have any kind of large make shifts et cetera in the business, we can still again grow organically, maintain or expand margins and impress the business forward. So for us 2018 is a good step forward particularly when you compared to those metrics over the near past. ","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it, that's helpful. And then maybe just for David on the government. You came from Raytheon. I have always thought FLIR had the quicker go-to-market strategy more of the commercial off- the- shelf. It seems like the DoD with comment from Ellen Lord; she wants to get technology into the field faster. I mean it would seem like the new strategy is tailored specifically to one FLIR deliver from a manufacturing standpoint to the war fighters. Is there anything you guys have to do differently with the sales strategy? Or is it just more basic blocking and tackling to either win the singles, doubles or even get the home runs? ","David Ray ","I think it's a combination of both. That's a great question. I think Jim talked about our ability to focus. If you think about what we've traditionally done in the market we play in with respect to our Surveillance and Detection business. I think there is a tremendous opportunity to focus on those customers where we can drive the most amount of value. I agree that one of the reasons this company is positioned as well as I think it is in the government defense space is because of that agility. It's because our size as we continue to grow, allows us to take innovation, implement and execute at a pace that our competitors can't do in the marketplace. And we are going to take advantage of that. And we think it presents opportunity. We just have to take that energy and focus in the right market with the right customers on the right mission. And continue to focus on how we are helping the customers deliver mission outcome and not just selling the product. We feel like we can do both. We feel like that creates an opportunity to capture more of the customer budget, but doing that and focus amount is really what's going to take us to the next level. ","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. ","Josh Sullivan","Hey, good morning. Thanks for -- me in here. Just one question. Are there any updates on the Black Hornet with SBS? I think the industry day was mid January, just any update on what this opportunity could look like or maybe timing at this point. ","Jim Cannon","Yes. So there is another industry day or fly off I am not sure what the nomenclature of it is, at Fort A P Hills, that's coming up. No decision yet. Hard for us to predict when that decision will come. But still very much in the competition and again there is going to be another gating exercise or fly-off that's coming up will be participating in. I will note in the fourth quarter and as Carol mentioned we got $7 million Black Hornet from the Australian Army. And we are really proud of that. And programs are going to build upon that. I have had the privilege over the past quarter to talk to various users that actually use Black Hornet in theater on target et cetera and the feedback that we get from them, it really moves us. When we think about our purpose of innovating, to save lives and livelihood. The Black Hornet is just doing that right now around the world. So not sure exactly when SBS will come or how to close but we continue to focus very heavily on that technology and believe very much in its capability in theaters. ","Operator","Thank you. We reached end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments. ","Jim Cannon","Well, again I want to thank all of you for joining our call today. I want to especially thank all of our employees for their hard work in 2017, and their dedication to our customers. I look forward to talking to all of you again soon and seeing you at our Investor Day on May 16 in New York City. Thank you very much."],"9466":["FLIR Systems, Inc.

Andy?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Todd, and welcome everyone to FLIR's second quarter 2016 earnings call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison.","I'll start the review of the quarter with slide three of the presentation. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $403 million, an increase of 2% compared to the prior year. Commercial product revenues grew 1% over second quarter of 2015, while government product revenues grew 5%. Year-to-date, government products revenues are up 12% over the first six months of 2015.","On the commercial side, softness in our Instruments and Security segments was only partially offset by growth in our Emerging and Maritime product lines. Deliveries of cooled and uncooled thermal camera cores, MSC systems and Man-Portable products helped drive the growth in government products. However, both the MSC and Man-Portable products carried relatively low margins.","Earnings per share were $0.33, which were negatively affected by a $2 million write-down in the carrying value of a minority equity investment we hold in a third-party company. Excluding this non-operating expense, earnings were $0.34 per share. While gross margins were pressured by unusual product mix and somewhat elevated manufacturing costs, we improved our operating margin by a 110 basis points over the first quarter of this year.","Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter up 17% year-over-year to $629 million as we saw 9% growth in overall orders versus the prior year. This is our highest backlog balance since 2008, which was the height of our activity for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Backlog in the Surveillance segment is up 19% over the balance at the end of Q2 2015.","On the new products front, the Surveillance segment introduced the new Star SAFIRE 380-HLDc at the Farnborough Airshow this month. The 380-HLDc is our latest variant of the 380-HDc gimbal platform that adds laser designation capability to this highly differentiated compact, airborne, EO\/IR system.","Surveillance also announced the new LTV-X, all-terrain turnkey mobile surveillance vehicle, which has onboard attack FLIR gimbal multi-sensor as well as our new R6SS Beam-Forming long distance ground radar.","And also during the quarter, the Instruments segment introduced the latest infrared guided measurement or IGM test and measurement product, the DM284 all-in-one digital multi-meter.","During the second quarter, we completed a couple of financing transactions, will allow us to have more capability and flexibility in our capital deployment strategies. We expanded our revolving credit facility to $500 million and issued $425 million of new publicly traded notes, the proceeds of which have been used to repay our existing $250 million of notes and increased our U.S. cash balance.","We also completed the acquisition of sporting and tactical scopes business, Armasight, which will strengthen our presence in both the recreational and military weapon sights and scopes markets. Armasight did not impact our second quarter results and is not expected to meaningfully impact EPS during 2016, but we do expect to see acceleration under the FLIR brand as well as profit synergies in 2017, as the business leverages our brand and vertical integration in the thermal space.","On slide four, you'll see our updated outlook for 2016. We continue to expect full year 2016 revenue to finish in the range of $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion. Based on the profit margins seen in the first half of the year, we now expect the EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65 for the full year, excluding any charges related to cost reduction initiatives in the second half and the tax reserve and investment write-down booked in the first half. This represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 6% when compared to the 2015 results, after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items.","We expect to see improved margins in the second half driven by favorable product mix changes, targeted price increases and reductions in manufacturing and SG&A costs. These changes are expected to result in an overall gross margin improvement of approximately 2 percentage points over what we saw in the second quarter.","We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on September 2 to shareholders of record as of August 19.","I'll now hand the call over to Amit to review the second quarter financial results. Amit?","Amit Singhi - Senior Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Andy. On slide five, you'll see our second quarter financial results. Consolidated revenue was $403 million, a 2% increase compared to the second quarter of 2015. Overall impact of exchange rate changes on revenue and operating income was minor. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the OEM & Emerging, Maritime, Security and Surveillance segments increasing 23%, 6%, 6% and 5% respectively. Instruments and Detection revenues declined by 14% and 2% respectively.","Recently, revenue increased in the U.S., Middle East, and Africa and Asia by 9%, 10% and 3% respectively, while it declined in Europe by 12% and in Canada\/LatAm by 9%. Sales to the U.S. government increased $24 million or 32% and represented 25% of total revenue compared to 19% in the second quarter of 2015.","Consolidated second quarter gross margin was 46%, 273 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to changes in product mix, manufacturing costs under absorption, and additional costs associated with the ramp-up of our low cost IR lens capability.","As a result of cost control measures, operating expenses reduced by $1 million year-over-year, despite the addition of expenses related to the DVTEL business. Our operating margin fell from 18% to 16% as a result of the decline in gross margin, partially offset by operating expense reduction.","We now expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 25%, excluding any discrete tax items, and our second quarter tax expense was $14.5 million. Net earnings for the second quarter of 2016 totaled $45.4 million or $0.33 per fully diluted share. Excluding the impact of a minority investment write-down of $2 million, adjusted net income was $47.4 million and adjusted EPS was $0.34, compared to $0.36 in the second quarter of 2015. We closed the second quarter with cash of $903 million, an increase of $393 million during the quarter, primarily driven by proceeds from the debt refinancing and strong operating cash flow.","Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $81.7 million or 173% of adjusted net income, driven by improvements in working capital as a result of our special initiatives. Accounts receivables and inventory improved during the quarter resulting in a lower quarter-over-quarter cash conversion cycle.","During the quarter, we acquired Armasight for $41 million and had capital expenditures of $10.9 million. We repurchased 950,000 shares for $29.7 million and returned another $16.6 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. Our cash balance increased as a result of the $425 million of new debt, $250 million of which was earmarked for repayment of our previous notes, which was settled in early July.","This concludes the summary of our second quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?","Thomas A. Surran - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Amit. Slide six shows a summary of our second quarter segment results. While four of our six segments achieved good growth during the quarter, overall growth was hampered by softness in our Instruments and Detection segments. Segment level operating profit was down 9% as we saw gross margin headwinds due to product mix, under absorption of manufacturing costs, and acquisition related intangible amortization.","Moving to slide seven, which covers the Surveillance segment. Second quarter revenue for Surveillance was $113.4 million, up 5% over the second quarter of 2015. Increased revenue from the MSC program, Man-Portable product line and Personal Vision Systems product line, each contributed to the growth. Delays related to export licensing requirements created a headwind to this growth during the quarter.","Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $26.1 million, which was down slightly from the prior year, while operating margins declined due to an unusual product mix in the quarter, the significant amount of MSC shipments, as well as large deliveries of a certain Man-Portable product each came at lower than normal margins for the segment.","Based on our backlog, we expect shipment of these products to be lower in the second half, while shipments of higher margin products should help bring Surveillance operating margins back to the high 20%s. Surveillance backlog increased $27 million from the end of Q1 to $341 million ended up 19% from one year ago. Strong order flow from international customers, including ones in Latin America, Asia and Europe helped add to the backlog.","Additionally, the acquisition of Armasight and the delay in getting certain export license further increased our backlog. Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 1.1x in the second quarter, which was the fourth time in the last five quarters that book-to-bill ratio exceeded 1x.","As Andy mentioned, during the second quarter, we acquired Armasight, a leading night vision and thermal tactical scopes company. The addition of Armasight's product line in management team will provide us with meaningful scaling and additional capabilities in the hunting, outdoors and military scopes space.","As we integrate our existing PVS and military scopes business with Armasight, we have renamed the combined business FLIR Outdoor and Tactical Systems or OTS, which will be reported within the Surveillance segment going forward.","During the second quarter, Surveillance introduced three new products as shown on slide eight. At the Farnborough Airshow, we showcased our new 380-HLDc gimbal EO\/IR system that features HD thermal and visible imaging, and precision laser designation capability in a low profile form factor. By integrating laser designation capability into this form factor which offers improved ground clearance, the 380-HLDc brings laser designation capability to aircraft that were previously unable to perform this crucial role.","Our radar team introduced the R6SS portable ground radar that utilizes advanced Digital Beam-Forming to enable detection and tracking of people from up to 15 kilometers away. Also launched this quarter was Surveillance's new integrated vehicle system, the LTV-X. The LTV-X is a compact modular four-wheel vehicle that features our TacFLIR 280-HD multispectral gimbal, the R6SS radar and onboard command and control software. The product offers a turnkey highly transportable solution for advanced border surveillance and reconnaissance.","On slide nine, you will see a summary of the Instruments segment. Revenue declined 14% compared to the prior year to $78.1 million. Significant MERS related sales in Asia and a communicated price increase in Europe, each drove higher shipment in Q2 of last year, which created a difficult comparison for Instruments in the second quarter of this year.","While we continue to see very good growth in firefighting and automation lines of business, it was not enough to fully offset the relative declines in the other businesses, including continued weakness in the plant and predictive maintenance line of products. The softness in the PPM product line related to mid-range products was partially offset by strong sales in the recently introduced high-end T1K product.","Instruments' operating profit was $19.1 million, a 25% revenue in the quarter. Manufacturing overhead, investments and development of low-cost molded infrared lens production capability and reduced operating leverage related to lower revenue levels contributed to the relatively low margins. We expect that margin improvement initiatives implemented in Q3 will allow instruments to return to second half operating margins in the 30% range, which is customary for the back half of the year.","During the second quarter, Instruments introduced the DM284, our latest IGM test and measurement tool. With the digital multimeter, we have integrated our Lepton thermal camera to create a differentiated version of an everyday tool that electricians use, allowing them to now visualize temperature anomalies and other electrical problems that are not visible to the naked eye.","On slide 10, is our Security segment results. Security second quarter revenue of $63.4 million was up 6% over the prior year. Growth in Enterprise-class products was offset by lower sales of thermal products versus difficult comparable on the prior year, where we saw significant shipments of high-end long range cooled camera systems.","Security operating margin was 5% in the quarter, up significantly over Q1 of this year, yet below the prior year. Gross margins were largely in line with last year. However, increased operating expenses and intangible amortization related to the DVTEL acquisition pushed down profitability.","We are taking costs out of the Security segment as we right-sized this operation. During the quarter, Security segment acquired the assets of Innovative Security Designs or ISD. ISD provides advanced security hardware and software solutions to the enterprise security market. While not meaningful from a financial standpoint, the acquisition has strategic importance and that we are brought on board a very experienced engineering team that will add significant capabilities and knowledge to the company to help with our innovation of advanced solutions for the security industry.","The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on slide 11. Reaching an all-time high, OEM & Emerging second quarter revenue was $57 million, increasing 23% over last year. Strong growth occurred in our IR camera cores, as well as our FLIR ONE and FLIR drone camera sales continue to grow significantly.","OEM & Emerging operating profit was $16.1 million in the quarter, increasing 53% over the prior year and reaching 28% operating margin, as increased revenue resulted in meaningful operating leverage benefit.","During the second quarter, OEM & Emerging introduced a new version of the popular Vue series of thermal cameras for commercial drones. The Vue Pro R is a radiometric thermal camera that enables drone operators with the ability to accurately measure temperature remotely down to the individual pixel level as well as import images into our FLIR Tools application for detailed analysis and reporting.","Turning to slide 12, Maritime segment revenues were $55.2 million representing 6% growth versus the prior year. Higher sales of radars, thermal cameras and multi-function displays drove the revenue growth. The marine variant of our Scout TK handheld monocular was introduced in the quarter and was well received by the market.","Maritime operating income was $6.7 million in the quarter, reaching 12% operating margin in the segment's seasonal high quarter. Our recent inventory improvement initiatives showed good result in Maritime segment as our ending second quarter balance was down $10 million versus Q1 and down $3 million compared to the last year.","Maritime introduced several new products during the quarter including the R17 release of Raymarine's Lighthouse Operating System for multi-function displays, which incorporates advanced dock-to-dock Autorouting capability for boaters as well as sonar-enabled mapping.","Raymarine introduced two HD visible cameras the CAM210 and CAM220, which enable boaters to monitor their boat and keep themselves and their passengers safe on the water.","Also introduced was the new Raymarine Evolution R4 autopilot. The Evolution R4 brings advanced patented wind correction capabilities to its adaptive core in addition to increased accuracy and tracking and waypoints.","The Detection segment results are summarized on slide 13. Detection second quarter revenue was down 2% year-over-year to $35.7 million. The timing of deliveries under our DRSKO orders can result in quarter-to-quarter variability and in the second quarter of last year, we shipped the most units since the program began, causing it difficult comparable for the quarter.","All the Detection's other product lines grew year-over-year to mostly offset the decline in DRSKO. Unchanged gross margins combined with reduced operating expenses resulted in over two percentage points of operating margin improvement. Detection finished the second quarter with $74 million of backlog, declining $23 million since Q1 due to shipments under the DRSKO order.","That concludes my summary of the segment second quarter. I'll now hand the call back to Andy.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom. Overall, the quarter was below our expectations. Delays related to our licensing processes for international customers pushed approximately $20 million of revenue into the second half of the year. In the back half of the year, we expect to see revenue growth rates that exceed, what was seen during the second quarter. Supporting this was year-over-year bookings growth of 9% in the second quarter resulting in the highest backlog we've seen in nearly eight years.","We expect to enhance both our gross and operating margins in the second half as well. Recent margin degradation is the byproduct of successes in certain lower margin business lines, temporary product mix headwinds in Surveillance and increased manufacturing costs.","As stated earlier, we intend to improve our operating efficiency and cost structure to bring our margins back in line. Including the benefits from our margin improvement initiative and the expectation of a more usual product mix of Surveillance, we expect to see gross margins to improve by approximately two percentage points over what we saw in the second quarter.","Sensor volumes increased considerably during the second quarter. Success in selling Lepton camera cores to OEMs and success of our own branded Lepton based products have helped drive 200% growth in the number of Lepton units produced compared to last year. While we're working diligently to build relationships with high volume OEMs, this volume ramp is helping to reduce the cost to manufacture all of our uncooled sensors.","Our long-term strategy of being The World's Sixth Sense is centered on innovating advanced sensing technologies that solve people's needs for safety, security, process efficiency and environmental preservation.","When we look at our core technology of thermal sensing, the runway in front of us remains very long. Price and awareness continued to be barriers that we are gradually overcoming. We have a strong presence in many existing markets, but continue to be focused on developing new applications and use cases to drive overall growth in both awareness and utilization of the technology.","Our sensor costs continue to come down, allowing us to expand the overall customer base while maintaining our margins. We remain focused on building our product suite, distribution channels and overall product solutions in a way that utilizes our capital efficiently while creating strong returns for our shareholders.","That concludes our comments on the second quarter. We'll now ask the operator to open the call up for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now conduct our question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Ben Hearnsberger with Stephens. Please state your question.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, thanks for taking my question. I wanted to start with the Instruments' EBIT margin, which surprises to the downside. I think the expectation heading into the quarter was that we would see improvement relative to 1Q and clearly that didn't play out. I guess, relative to initial expectation, what surprised you in the quarter that ultimately drove the mid-20%s margin?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Ben. There were actually a couple of things there. I mean number one is really the headline revenue there. The revenue was lower than we expected. We had a difficult comp, as Tom mentioned in his prepared comments, that we had executed a price increase last year that pulled some orders from Q3 into Q2 last year.","The other issue that occurred last year is we had a little over $4 million of both bookings and shipments last year that were related to the MERS outbreak in Korea that did not reoccur this year. So that the lower revenue resulted in lower overall absorption, manufacturing overheads in the Instruments business.","The other thing \u2013 there were couple of other things going on there. We have had an ongoing investment in new optics capability that is centered in the Instruments business. We fundamentally have three optics technologies at the company, wafer scale optics, molded optics and diamond point turned optics.","And we have a fairly concentrated investment effort going on in the molded side to be able to produce our own molded chalcogenide optics in the future and those will be used across the business segments. There are five out of six of the segments will utilize those optics going forward. And the expenses in that area were a little bit higher than anticipated and not fully absorbed by the operation.","Tom, you want to add anything else to that?","Thomas A. Surran - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","No. It's also just as you mentioned the revenue and the operating margin leverage. The expenses were set for a higher level of revenue which we did not achieve as you discussed why.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So we'll be making some adjustments in that business spend to make sure that the operating overheads of that business are in line with the expected revenues in the second half.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","So if we think about the back half of the year, getting back to the 30% range, we need better volumes, but let's just look at any absence of volume showing up, with the initiatives you have at hand, what type of margin profile do you see in that segment, assuming margins do not show up in the back half of the year?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we expect that the operating margins in that business will be in the 30% range in the second half as a result of the initiatives that we're taking. We're seeing if you move up to the gross margin level, I think we'll see some improvement there as well, as we've got our high-end products are in the market now and at a maturity level of manufacturing, they're generating their expected margins.","So this is products like the T1K which was introduced late in 2015. So that's a product now that's shipping and getting good traction in the market, and we feel there's a good opportunity for replacement cycle, as we've got a very large installed base of P600 and T600 units that are used in industries where that level of performance is required.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","Can you maybe touch on the product development pipeline for the mid range tier products in the Instruments segment, and when you expect an upgrade to those products to be released?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So we've mentioned in previous calls that those are products where we're seeing some pressure in terms of growth. They're products that are older products in our product line, and so, we've been focused more on the corners of the product value ladder in that business.","There has been an ongoing effort to refresh the midsection of our product line, and that's going quite well, and we'll utilize new technology that we've developed at the company at the core level. And those products are expected to launch early in 2017.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Gentlemen, thank you very much.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Ben.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please state your question.","Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, thank you, good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the Security segment, clearly, a deceleration of growth. And can you walk us through what some of the dynamics might be? Is it just slower uptake on thermal, which I think had higher expectations or is that market taking longer to develop? And is there any share shift going on within maybe the traditional video base portion of the business?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Jim. So I'll talk first about the thermal end of the business. That is a business that is still very much in its infancy. The value proposition for thermal cameras in the security space is quite strong, as it significantly improves the accuracy of video analytic based systems.","We've introduced some new products in that space just recently, our FC-ID series, which is the first product that we've introduced that has fully integrated edge-based video analytic capability that's very quick and easy to set up and quite reliable from an accuracy standpoint. That really brings a differentiated value proposition to outdoor perimeter security applications, you're leveraging the capabilities of thermal imaging.","In Q2, we changed some of our export licensing processes to refine those and that resulted in the delay in obtaining some export license and that manifested itself in the Security segment, to some degree in the Instruments segment, and more so in the Surveillance segment. And as a result, that pushed some deliveries from Q2 into the second half and that was manifested in the security-based revenues and that again pertains only to the thermal products.","In the visible space, the competition there has increased, and as we've seen some of the larger Chinese suppliers enter the markets directly, that has put some pressure on margins as a result of increased competition. Our strategy there is to offer more Enterprise-class products and that will be supported by the DVTEL integration.","Also in that space, we believe that over the long-term, the opportunity to offer integrated thermal and visible products or hybrid products as we call them, will give us a differentiated solution that will not only be unique, but also have the ability to generate higher margins than traditional visual products.","Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Thanks. That's helpful. And just with respect to the margin improvement that you're anticipating in the second half, I think I heard you, you're anticipating a 200-basis-point improvement in gross margins in the second half versus the Q2 levels. I wonder if there's a way for you to perhaps maybe quantify, if there are some major components of that, that gets you there, clearly mix, I think, right?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. There are fundamentally three things that drive that. Mix is one of the big ones. So we did have an unusual mix in the first half of the year that will resolve itself in the second half of the year, particularly in the Instruments segment.","The second area is we'll have some price increases. So we've implemented a price increase program. So we'll have some targeted price increases that will affect each of our segments.","And then, the third area is we'll address the under absorption issue. So we'll take some cost out of the manufacturing operations that will help both absorption and some of the variances that we saw in the first half of the year.","Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please state your question.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. I guess either Andy or Amit, can you guys talk about the working capital improvements? It was a nice cash flow quarter and I remember about three years or four years ago, there was a lot of talk about the working capital takeout opportunity. So I'm just wondering if in the second half we might see more working capital takeout and it's longer term, there's an opportunity there as well, whatever color you can give will be great on that front?","Amit Singhi - Senior Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Thanks. This is Amit. So yes, so we are also pleased with the improvements we're seeing. Again, it's the result of lot of hard work and effort and special initiatives across all the three components; receivables, inventory and payables. We saw about a $20 million improvement in AR, about $12 million in inventory that was net of \u2013 there was an addition due to Armasight coming onboard and AP was off by about $5 million.","So about $30 million working capital improvement in the quarter, a lot of it is again driven by special initiatives on collecting faster and on inventory, I'll let Tom speak to that in a minute. Overall, our cash conversion cycle improved by 13 days, and we expect to continue that same trend going into the second half.","Inventory turns also improved slightly from 2.1 to 2.2. And I'll turn it over to Tom who's leading our inventory reduction initiatives.","Thomas A. Surran - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, Pete. So Amit made reference to the fact that our core inventory reductions, excluding that inventory that was acquired, were down $17 million for the quarter. And last quarter, we talked about some of the things that we are doing in these programs and each segment has its own improvement program, but there were the consolidation of our distribution centers, safety stock reduction, supplier agreements, and then, liquidation of the problem inventories. And we're seeing traction with all of those things and we're pleased with the success.","In fact, we expect further progress in the current quarter, because as Andy mentioned, there were certain things that hampered some of our revenue at the end of the quarter, so we had some finished goods inventory that we expect to flow through in the current quarter. And then, over time that we'll see just a more \u2013 not as significant of improvement, but continued improvement because these are long-term programs that we'll be working on.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Yeah. That sounds great. It sounds pretty systematic now. So that's excellent. And then, just was wondering if you could provide any color on the Armasight deal. My sense is number one, it's a pretty competitive market, I'm wondering what your estimate is of the size, but kind of how do you differentiate, and then, anything you can give us in terms of price paid or revenue outlook will be great.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So let me just talk about the thematics of the deal first and what the industry landscape looks like. We have a business today that is part of Surveillance that we call PVS, Personal Vision Systems, and that is a tactical scopes and sight business. The products that we've launched there are products that were designed to create new opening price points in that market. So we have typically been the price leader in that space.","Also, in our Surveillance business though, we have some higher and more CDMQ oriented tactical scopes and sights. And Armasight in the thermal space actually kind of fills in the gap between those two product ranges between our true consumer and a military product with products that are more prosumer and paramilitary oriented.","The other thing that Armasight has is a fairly large business of enhanced night vision products. So these are combination of I2 technology Gen 1, Gen 2 and Gen 3 I2 technology and also low light CCD and CMOS based products.","The opportunity here I think is quite good for two reasons. Number one is the outdoor hunting market, night time operations of outdoor hunting is increasing and also the interest in digitally based scopes and sights is going up, both with the availability of lower cost thermal technology and the availability of lower cost low light visible technology.","So Armasight really brings a capability to us particularly in the low light visible space and I2 space, but also will allow us to create more of a center of excellence and provide some scale to the business around that tactical outdoor scopes and sights areas. So we're pretty excited about the space. It's a growing space. We also see the international market as a pretty strong opportunity for us as most of Armasight sales are U.S. based at this point and we've got a little bit larger footprint internationally that we can leverage their products through.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay, very good. Very good. I'll squeeze one more in. Andy, can you talk about \u2013 I think you've introduced this, but this idea at Security of integrating the DVTEL VMS system with some of your command and control software, what the name in that new product is, if you started selling it yet and kind of what kind of growth opportunity you think is there?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It's an interesting opportunity for us actually, because what it does is it brings C2 or command and control capability into the traditional VMS environment. So we have a group that's called 360 Surveillance that was part of our Surveillance group, and we have moved them out of the Surveillance group into the Security group at the beginning of this year.","And fundamentally, what it does is it creates a full end-to-end solution between a network of visible and thermal security cameras, combined together with radar, ground-based sensors, with the video management system, and then, 360 brings in that top-down view of the C2 system, and that will be utilized both for stationary systems and for mobile systems. So this is also a technology that we've deployed in the new LTV-X product that Tom mentioned earlier that was launched in the Surveillance space.","That level of capability of having a true C2 layer on top of a VMS is something that really not many people are offering in the market today, and I think we're going to have a very unique product offering there. And particular for the markets where we're particularly strong, which is sort of the outdoor perimeter surveillance market, this gives us a true end-to-end solution which has been one of our strategic goals for the year to produce more solution-oriented solutions for our customers.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please state your question.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning. I just wanted to start with some of the cost containment initiatives that you guys have talked about, just given sort of the company's history of going through and restructuring, what do you see as the low-hanging fruit, what's the pattern that we should expect in terms of the cost containment initiatives to show up, and can you just give us a sense of that pattern?","Thomas A. Surran - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. I think, Jonathan \u2013 this is Tom and it's not so much a category, but rather a model. And it's structuring the expenses to an expected level of revenue and making sure it's in line. So we had certain growth expectations in, say, Security that we didn't achieve, but we can clearly structure our business for our expected level of revenues and that means all the way through the business and all the areas and the line items for the spending on both the cost side as well as on the operating expense side.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, can you talk a little bit about the competitive dynamics in the Security business, particularly around Lorex? Should we just expect the growth rates in Security to be lower at the current levels? Is there much concern for in terms of future inventory issues? I just wanted to understand sort of the dynamics that you expect in that market, as you start to transition upstream.","Thomas A. Surran - Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer","Yeah, so the competitive dynamics, you particularly focused on what we would call the retail business or consumer business. So there's three \u2013 we divide the market and we talk about in three ways. We have kind of the consumer business, we have a small business or SMB, and the Enterprise-class.","And the consumer business is highly competitive. The differentiation is relatively low. We have very good products. The amount of inventory we hold, it moves almost in the quarter we receive it. So it's not a large inventory balance. That's pretty competitive on price. It's a very high volume business. And I think that's not where we're focusing.","SMB is the business, where Andy mentioned, we're seeing the major Chinese manufacturers enter and competing primarily on price. Again, there are certain things we can add a little more differentiation and we're participating in that business, but is again not the focus.","What Andy was referencing is that third market is the Enterprise where we can create differentiated products and solution, the ability to have healthy margins, and that is much stronger, the importance of thermal in an end-to-end solution is stronger. And so that's where we're focusing our efforts and that's where we can achieve the superior margins and that shift towards the Enterprise products will improve the margins for the business overall.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please state...","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. A number of obviously my questions on Security have been answered, but just as a point of reference axis, which does go toward the Enterprise segment also and pull out of the SMB and small business area has tried to cast about a 6% to 7% growth rate for that Enterprise area.","So I'm wondering with regard to DVTEL, above and beyond the amortization issue, what \u2013 and above the command and control issue potential there, what can you do to essentially get individual sales forces from other divisions to start using the technology that DVTEL can bring because it's not just a high-end VMS or camera company, it obviously, is a technology company that could be used across various division lines, is there a way to incentivize the sales force to do that?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think the issue, Jeff, it's an interesting point that you raise, is how do we leverage technology from the Security segment into the other portions of the business and they're actually quite applicable.","There are really two fundamental technologies there that can be used elsewhere and those are the VMS technology and the cloud-based technologies that the DVTEL engineering team is working on. Those are applicable. The cloud-based technology is fundamentally applicable across each of our segments and the VMS technology can be utilized in Surveillance, in Maritime, and of course, it's already being used in the Security segment.","The opportunity for having high level integrated VMS system tied together with the C2 system and then backed up with cloud access capabilities is something that is quite attractive for boaters, for example, in terms of being able to keep an eye on what's going on in a boat both while at voyage and while the boat is at harbor.","And also, on the Surveillance segment, at the end of the day, what we do on the Surveillance segment is we provide ISR capabilities across a variety of platforms and the ability to both record and disseminate that information is becoming increasingly important and that's fundamentally what the Security segment capabilities will bring to the other segments.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. One other question that is in your refinancing, you obviously now have some dry powder, and you clearly are looking at anything that's opportunistic for you. Is there a general, some broad-based comments you can make about where you feel the inorganic or acquisition related types of capital employment can be focused?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. We continue to look at opportunities to leverage our core technology and there are still a lot of opportunities out there where thermal technology can be leveraged into other business spaces and examples there include machine vision, automation, there's additional opportunities in Security and Surveillance and the UAS space, there are a number of different opportunities there.","You look at channel expansion opportunities out there as well. So we have the ability to pick up organizations that will expand our footprint and reach to the market with our existing products. And then, we're also looking at technology expansion, so looking at other wavelengths in the imaging spectrum. So today, we cover sonar and radar, visible imaging, thermal imaging, but there are opportunities in other products of the spectrum that I think can be leveraged as technologies that they can be complementary to the imaging technologies that we do today.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Finally, given your strong cash flow generation in the first half, but also your expectations for both margin and, more importantly, revenue growth in the second half, which may mitigate cash expansion a little bit, do you have any \u2013 can you provide us with any guidance with regard to where you see cash flow from operations for the year going?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll ask Amit to talk about that.","Amit Singhi - Senior Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. I think overall, we expect to stay \u2013 it won't be quite as strong as the second quarter compared to the net income. We were a little bit behind in the first quarter, we made up in the second quarter. So as a percent of net income, it won't be quite in the same range, but it will still be a very strong second half that would still generate over a 100% of net income in terms of operating cash flow.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Jeff.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just some quick ones for clarity here. Have you guys disclosed or can you \u2013 how much of the Security segment revenues are being driven by thermal related sales?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't break that out, but what I will tell you, Michael, is that it was lower in Q2 than the norm and primarily as a result of the changes that we made in our export licensing processes that delayed some shipments into the second half. So we expect that to normalize in the second half.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We also \u2013 we mentioned in the prepared comments also the Security comp for Q2 last year was a pretty tough one, because we had a significant amount of cooled long range shipments in Q2 2015 and very few in Q2 2016 and that's just lumpy. We've a very competitive product line there, but those programs tend to be lumpier than the normal cadence of uncooled cameras in the security space.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then, just on OEM & Emerging, obviously, the 20% plus growth, how much of that growth was contributed by defense customers? Were there any meaningful defense shipments in the quarter?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","They were \u2013 I'm going to have Shane see if he can have that breakout. I'm not sure if we have it at that level of fidelity, but we have seen a strong order uptake there \u2013 our \u2013 as we mentioned in the prepared comments, our overall government revenues were up 32% and DoD was up 17%, and we had very strong growth in the Federal area, it was up 140%, but that's not specific to OEM & Emerging. Do you have a number there?","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Shane R. Harrison - Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy","Yeah, Michael, the growth in the core business that's going in (48:43) government customers was strong. It was north of 15% in the quarter.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a last one on kind of trends here. Maybe if you can comment on defense, what you're seeing in terms of sales and orders in the Middle East. And then, obviously, you've got this strong second half, how you guys are thinking about your European markets in the context of Brexit? Does that pose any risk? Are you seeing any disruption?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So if we first just look at what things went on from a geographical standpoint, in Q2, we saw the highest growth coming out of the Middle East, that was up 10%, U.S. was up 9%, Asia was up 4% and Europe was down 12%, as mentioned previously. And then, as we previously mentioned, the U.S. government oriented revenue was up 32%.","In terms of Brexit, our exposure there is not terribly significant. Our total revenues in GBP are less than 4%. From a cost standpoint, we think we're properly leveraged there. So we don't see that we'll \u2013 we don't expect to see a significant change in margin.","I think the big question here and I'm sure everybody is talking about this is what will the impact be on the EU in total. We're currently expecting our European revenues to be flat with H1. We actually had some aberrations last year. H1 was stronger than H2 from a European revenue standpoint, and this year, we're going to \u2013 we believe that that will flatten out. Last year, we saw that delta primarily because of the fact that we had price increases on a few of the segments in Q2 of last year and it pulled the order from H2 into H1, and this year, we won't see that recur.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Okay. Perfect. And then, just anything on order trends in the Middle East? I know you said 2Q was strong in terms of revenues, orders, presumably then tracking with revenues.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so I mean thematically, the demand there continues to be high, interest level and demand continued to be high as a result of the relevance of our intelligence, reconnaissance targeting and explosives detections technologies are I think quite relevant and our CDMQ model, thematically, I think is quite well received by customers in the Middle East, and we're spending a lot of time right now. We're quite strong in border surveillance platforms, and then, airborne ISR platforms in the Middle East.","The wild card there is it's just, it's a market that's very difficult to predict. Timing is \u2013 it's the most challenging market that we deal with in terms of predicting timing, but that said, we're reasonably bullish on the performance that we'll see out of the Middle East in the second half.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, good morning, everyone.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","What's the right long-term segment operating margin range that an investor should expect to see for FLIR?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We expect the long-term range to be in the low 20%s.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Got it. The $20 million of international that's left that you mentioned, I may have missed it, but did you \u2013 can you provide more detail on exactly what that was and when you get it?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, fundamentally, we have revised our export licensing practices, tightened those up and added some additional documentation and process to that, and that's an effort that Todd has been heading up, that was carried out in Q2, and it had some aberrations in terms of the delay of the receipt of export licenses for international customers and that's revenue that won't go away. It's revenue that will come back into the plan in the second half of the year, but it was an aberration for us in terms of our normal cadence of the execution of international revenue.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Do you have any of it yet in July?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, some, but I don't have it quantified. There were some licenses that were delayed from Q2 and they have been received in July.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Would you expect to have all of that in the third quarter or the majority of it?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. The majority of it, we'll get back in the third quarter.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. A few questions ago, when you were saying highest growth came from the Middle East, and then, it was up 10%, was that a total FLIR or a government growth rate?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's total FLIR.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And could you speak to just the government growth into the Middle East in the quarter or the first half?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll have Shane look at it.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Shane R. Harrison - Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy","For the quarter, Noah, Middle East, for Surveillance, we have the detection business as well, but for Surveillance, which I think is the crux of the question, it was up...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, it is.","Shane R. Harrison - Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy","...it was a little over 5%. And for the year...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Up 5%?","Shane R. Harrison - Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy","...yeah, 5%. For the year, I'll have to crunch in some numbers here.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then, last thing I wanted to ask, do you guys have numbers on \u2013 I know you have a partnership with DJI in the commercial unmanned world. Do you know how many units you're selling in that business and how it compares to how many units are sold in that entire end market and what, if there's any penetration rate you are thinking of as reasonable in that product?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So we do \u2013 I mean we know exactly what we're selling in that space, but I don't want to go to that level of fidelity on unit volumes. But I can tell you a couple of important factors here. In terms of the number of thermal imaging cameras that are being flown on drones, both commercial and military today, I mean we dominate that space by a long shot. And we not only have a relationship with DJI, but we have a relationship with several of the other leading commercial drone manufacturers today. In fact, most commercial drones that are being flown today with thermal cameras on are being flown with either the FLIR Vue Pro or the DJI FLIR Zenmuse XT.","Growth in that business has been quite strong and the penetration is extraordinarily low. As a percentage of the total number of commercial drones that are being sold today, it's still quite a small number, but we expect that to continue to grow through three potential initiatives here.","One is this product expansion line. So we're expanding the product offering there to be beyond the current product offering, which is primarily Tau-based. So we'll be adding in Lepton-based platforms as well. We've just added radiometric capability, which is remote temperature measurement capability in the FLIR Vue Pro R and that will get expanded across other manufacturers as well. So temperature measurements can be done.","And the third issue is the back-end software processing. So at the end of the day, these drones get the cameras in the air and the cameras capture images, but ultimately, what you do with those images is really where the value gets delivered. So the ability to create 3D Orthomosaics and how those be radiometrically calibrated are important characteristics for that market and we've been working very aggressively both independently and with partners to develop that capability and we'll have more to talk about that during the second half of the year.","Shane R. Harrison - Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy","Noah, the year-to-date, Middle East is similar. It's up about 6%.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Noah.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I will now turn it back to management for closing remarks.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Thank you.

Also with me on the call today is our CFO, Tony Trunzo; our COO, Tom Surran; our Chief of Product Strategy, Jeff Frank; and our Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill.","This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $369 million, and GAAP earnings per share of $0.31. This EPS result included after-tax charges of $3 million related to continuing severance and relocation costs of our previously announced restructuring and realignment plans.","Excluding these charges, Q2 earnings were $0.33 per share. Revenue declined 5% versus the second quarter 2013, driven by declines in our government oriented Surveillance and Detection segments. Helping to offset this decline was double-digit growth in our Commercial businesses.","Gross margins improved versus both the prior year and the prior quarter. Operating cash flow of $71 million during the quarter was again, well ahead of our net income.","Tuesday, we began taking orders for our FLIR ONE iPhone accessory. We anticipate to begin deliveries during the week of August 4. FLIR ONE represents 1 of 2 new products we have announced to date, that incorporates our new Lepton thermal micro core, the other being our Mini Bullet security camera.","The FLIR ONE is our first step in bringing powerful thermal imaging capabilities to consumer applications. Our strategy continues to be focused on using the product to evaluate mobile applications while building the awareness of both the FLIR brand and thermal imaging in general.","FLIR ONE provides us not only with a strong platform that can be leveraged into new smartphones in the future, but also a deep new experience base for developing and certifying products for the mobile handset market. This should result in quicker development and certification cycles for future products created for this market. We will continue to incorporate Lepton into new products throughout the business and anticipate new launches later in the year.","In addition to these FLIR-branded products utilizing Lepton, we continue to develop OEM customers for Lepton and began shipping units to these customers in Q2. The addition of Travis as our Chief Marketing Officer has already had a positive impact on our business. The marketing team recently launched a new, more user-focused FLIR.com homepage in the U.S. that will soon be extended worldwide. This new page is designed for higher user engagement, greater focus on customers and youth cases, and a continual evolution in order to facilitate the changing needs of our customers and markets in which we operate.","Additionally, we have implemented a new structure for our marketing organization, that for the first time, places dedicated marketing directors in support of each of our segments, as well as creating centralized, creative and PR teams. We have also launched more cohesive brand standards that will align our various segments, products and operating sites in a way that presents an interconnected and coordinated FLIR.","Based on our second quarter results and our current view of the business, we are maintaining our outlook for the full year of 2014. We continue to expect revenues between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion for the full year, and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.40 to $1.50, excluding expenses related to restructuring actions.","I will now ask Tony to review the second quarter financial results. Tony?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Thanks, Andy. Unless otherwise stated, the following discussion of Q2 2014 results at both the consolidated and segment level excludes restructuring cost totaling $3.5 million pretax. Overall, we finished the quarter with revenue of $369.4 million, a decrease of 5% compared to last Q2, but up sequentially by 5% from Q1.","Surveillance revenue declined by $42 million or 28% from last Q2, while in aggregate, the other 5 segments saw a 9% increase in revenue from last year. Consolidated gross margin of 49.5% was 70 basis points better than last year and 1.4 percentage points better than Q1, due to improved mix and production efficiencies in several segments.","Segment operating expenses excluding restructuring charges were 1% lower than last year at $102.8 million. Corporate expenses of $17 million, while 10% higher than last year were down 9% sequentially and in line with our expectations for the quarter. Net income before restructuring expenses was $47.5 million and earnings per share excluding restructuring was $0.33.","At the segment level, we saw our performance ranging from good to excellent across 5 of our 6 segments. Unfortunately, Surveillance revenue and operating income were significantly below last year, largely due to a number of orders planned for late quarter shipment that we were not able to deliver. Surveillance gross margins were ahead of last year by 1.8 points due to a shift away from poor margin deliveries of MSC program units.","Operating expenses declined by 8% from last year, but segment operating income was down 43%, due to the flow-through of much lower revenue. The Instruments segment performed well during the quarter, as good unit growth and strong reception to new products led to a 5% increase in revenue, while operating income rose by 3%. Gross margin remained strong at 59.7%.","Year-to-date, Instruments revenue was up 6% and segment operating income before restructuring was up by 11%. OEM and Emerging segment operating income of $17.7 million was up 45% from last year. The segment saw a 21% increase in revenue on strength and uncooled cores and Personal Vision Systems products. Gross margins were down versus Q2 of 2013 due to the inclusion of lower margin revenue from our Optical Components Group, which was acquired in August of last year. Operating expenses were 7% lower than last year, as benefits from our restructuring more than offset higher-than-planned engineering spending on FLIR ONE. Segment operating margin in Q2 was 30%, 4.9% percentage points better than in Q2 last year. Year-to-date, OEM and Emerging revenue was up 14% and segment operating income was up 11% compared to the first half of 2013.","As expected, our Security segment performed very well in Q2. Revenue increased by 30% compared to last year due to strong sell-through and expanded distribution of our Lorex products, as well as growth in our thermal camera product line. Gross margin was 2.2 percentage points better than last year due to improved retail margins and higher sales of thermal cameras. Operating expenses declined 150 basis points as a percentage of revenue. As a result, operating income of $5.9 million was up 81% from last year. Year-to-date, Security segment revenue is up 16%, while operating income is down by 1%.","Maritime revenue was up 1% from last year and operating margin reached 17.6% on stronger gross margins attributable to improve margins on Raymarine branded products. As a result, operating income rose by 4% versus Q2 last year. Detection saw a significant sequential improvement as revenue rose 42% from Q1 and Q2 operating income of $3.3 million represented a $4.5 million improvement over Q1. Strong orders and deliveries under the DR SKO program aided results in the quarter. Revenue was down 12% compared to Q2 of 2013, due to a $3.3 million decline in contract R&D revenue, while operating expenses were 11% lower than last year, reflecting the positive impact of our restructuring efforts.","On a consolidated basis, bookings were strong during the quarter and we saw a 7% increase in 12-month backlog to $548 million. Year-to-date, backlog has increased by 12%. Also, on a consolidated basis, U.S. government revenue declined by 32% year-over-year, while all other revenue increased by 6% for the quarter. Total sales to the U.S. government were 21.3% of the total in Q2, down from 29.5% of revenue in the second quarter of 2013.","International revenue was 48.3% of the consolidated total in Q2, up from 45% of revenue in Q2 of last year. Cash flow from operations including the impact of restructuring was $70.6 million for the quarter, representing 158% of net income.","During the quarter, we paid $14.2 million in dividends and spent an additional $41.2 million to repurchase approximately 1.2 million shares of our common stock. We ended the quarter with cash on hand of $602 million, providing ample liquidity to continue returning capital to shareholders, as well as to pursue strategic acquisitions. We are actively seeking opportunities for strategic M&A to enhance our competitive position, expand and attract new business segments and effectively deploy our capital. While it's always difficult to predict M&A timing, we feel we are in an excellent position to act as opportunities become actionable.","As Andy indicated, we are reaffirming our full year 2014 outlook for revenue and earnings per share, excluding certain restructuring items. We expect Q3 performance to be similar to Q2 followed by our usual strong Q4. Both quarters should see improvements in cost structure as a result of our restructuring efforts. Today, we also announced our regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share will be payable at September 5 to shareholders of record as of August 19.","That concludes my summary of our second quarter financial results. I'll now turn the call over to Tom to cover the segment operating highlights.","Thomas A. Surran","Thanks, Tony. While we saw a significantly improved revenue growth in the second quarter in many of our commercial end markets, it was more than offset by continued weakness in our government-funded markets. Order flow from these customers remains lumpy and several order delays caused shipment pushouts to the second half. Segment operating margin, excluding the Q2 pretax restructuring charges of $3.5 million, were essentially flat in the second quarter of 2013. Total order backlog grew versus both Q1 2014 and Q2 2013.","Revenue in the Surveillance segment declined 28% versus the second quarter of 2013, in part due to the significant deliveries of MSC units in the prior year, but also due to reduced shipments of our airborne gimbal systems and man-portable products. Surveillance book-to-bill was $1.2 million, resulting in backlog of $308 million up $28 million over Q1 of this year. As a result of the reduced revenue and despite improvements in gross margin and lower operating expenses, surveillance operating income excluding restructuring charges declined 43% year-over-year.","We are taking several actions to improve our execution within the Surveillance segment that we believe will enable us to gain market share. The first of these actions is a reorganization of our sales team. We have put a highly capable leader, Steve Williams, in charge of the team. Steve has recently made a number of changes to the Surveillance sales organization that we believe will allow it to significantly improve in its execution.","Next, we have adopted a number of processes that will provide greater detail and key execution for understanding the quarter. This visibility will enable a faster corrective action response to issues as they arise. Further, we have adopted many of the product development processes, which have been highly effective in the former Commercial Systems businesses. Finally, we will be scaling expenses in the segment to the level of revenue we expect to see going forward and in accordance with our business model.","While the benefit from some of these actions will be longer-term, we do expect to see sequential improvement in the Surveillance segment through the balance of this year. The Instrument segment achieved revenue growth of 5% versus the second quarter of 2013 and camera units shipped by the segment increased 37%. This growth was driven by the continuing success of our entry-level EX-Series camera, our K-Series firefighting camera, as well as our Extech test and measurement products. The automation line of business continue to do well in Q2 with 35% growth over the prior year.","The OEM and Emerging segment grew revenue 21% over the second quarter of last year. The driver of the growth came from the shipments of our uncooled camera cores to OEM customers. The PVS line of business contributed to the growth with the combination strong sales of the new R-Series thermal rifle scope, as well as solid performance from our BHS line of thermal binoculars.","In addition, there was the contribution from our Optical Components Group, which was acquired during the past year. Organic revenue in the OEM segment, excluding the results of OCG, was 14%. The operating margin improvement, both sequentially and year-over-year, was the result of lower operating expenses, as well as improved utilization from the increased production volumes. It should be noted that during the quarter, we shipped a record number of camera cores.","The Security segment saw a 30% increase in revenue versus the prior year, with all 3 product lines showing double-digit growth. Lorex revenue was up 25% versus Q2 of 2013 from a combination of strong retail sell-through and expanded distribution. Additionally, FLIR-branded visible security systems grew 28% versus Q2 of 2013 as we gained share on our distribution channel.","Our largest gain from the segment were made by our thermal security products, which grew 40% over second quarter of last year. Security operating margins improved 370 basis points over the last year with stronger gross margins, as well as reduced operating expenses as a percentage of revenue.","The Maritime segment saw revenue grow 1% compared to Q2 2013. Strength from the Raymarine products, particularly multifunction displays, sonars and autopilots was offset by weaknesses from FLIR-branded thermal cameras due in large part to reduced deliveries to the municipal first responders market. Maritime operating margins increased slightly compared to Q2 2013, as gross margins improved as a result of our new products having higher margins than prior generation products.","Detection segment performance in Q2 exceeded our plans from a bookings, revenue and profitabilities perspective. While second quarter revenue decline 12% versus the prior year, margins were largely in line with the prior year, given much of the revenue shortfall was attributed to lower contract R&D during the quarter as compared to the prior year. As a general rule, the contract R&D work generates lower margins in comparison to product sales.","That concludes my summary of the segment's second quarter. I will now pass the call back to Andy.","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Tom. As our 2014 outlook suggests, we continue to anticipate a stronger second half of the year. Over the past few years, approximately 50% of our earnings have come in the second half. 2013 was an exception due to weak second half demand in our Surveillance and OEM cooled cores business. We expect 2014 to look more like the historical trend given the impact of the restructuring, the increase in our backlog and the growth trends in our Commercial segments.","Upon becoming CEO of FLIR on top of realigning and restructuring our businesses, I also laid out to our employees 5 key initiatives that are intended to drive long-term growth and profitability in the business. These include: launching several new products based on Lepton, stabilizing our government-oriented businesses, improving our margins, expanding the use of shared services, and generating and deploying our cash efficiently.","We've made excellent progress on each of these points but we have more work to do. I want to thank the FLIR employees for supporting these efforts as we continue to grow and improve the company. That concludes our comments on the second quarter, we'll now open the call up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","There's a lot going on at FLIR these days, that's for sure. Let me ask one on Surveillance, guys, on the big decline. It sounds like you get some orders shipped right. For the first half of the year, it's down, maybe call it mid-teens or so. Is that kind of what you're expecting for the full year at this point in Surveillance or will -- or are things going to -- are those orders going to come through pretty strongly in the second half?","Thomas A. Surran","This is Tom answering that. There's 2 pieces to it. First, there were orders that were missed at the end of the quarter that actually have been now captured in Q3. So we started Q3 nice and solid. And the second piece is the overall performance of how H2 looks compared to H1, and we expect to see improvement as we progress through the year.","Andrew C. Teich","Pete, this is Andy. Obviously, I have one other thing. I mean, we did see nice growth on the backlog, so we'll be executing on that backlog in the second half. The order flow for the second half looks pretty good at this point. It's -- we're not fully back to kind of historical levels, but it does -- the pipeline looks pretty strong. And as Tom indicated, the early weeks of the quarter here have executed pretty well. So at this point, we're feeling okay about what the order prospect looks like.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Are you thinking for the full year? Are you thinking international can be up but U.S. down?","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, in the second half, we expect to see strength and it's particularly in the EMEA region.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And last one and I'll get back in queue. But can you update us on how FLIR ONE pre-orders are coming along?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, so Pete, I don't want to go into specific unit volumes. That's something that we've never done at the company, talk about order unit volumes at a single-product level. We did open up the order site for pre-orders the day before yesterday. And then yesterday was the first day that we took orders from the general public. We've had a good response thus far but it's really too early to tell in 48 hours\u2019 worth of data. And particularly at this point, we're only taking orders from the U.S. markets. It's really too early to call a trend on this.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Quillin with Stephens Inc.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I think I heard you say in the prepared comments that Q3 would be similar to Q2. I'm wondering if that specifically referred to earnings in terms of Q3 earnings being similar to Q2. And then regardless, so there's -- Andy, you noted there's a pretty strong implied back half and I think implied stronger, significantly stronger margins probably, mostly in 4Q. But if you could go through maybe the -- either the segments where you expected the margins to be up significantly, or what kind of mix, specific mix improvements that you might see that would drive those stronger margins in the latter part of the year?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Tim, it's Tony. Yes, in terms of our -- what we see for Q3, it is a similar quarter. It's looking like a similar quarter to Q2. There are some segments that are going to be a little bit better. Seasonally, we will see a softer Maritime segment. That's just kind of the way it plays out, so there's a several million dollar headwind there. Pretty much everything else is going to be flattish to up a little bit in Q3. Q4, as you know, is seasonally strong in a couple of our businesses. I would say we've taken, in terms of loading the outlook for Surveillance for the second half of the year. I would say we've taken the approach of being cautious in terms of when we expect deliveries of some of the orders that we have in backlog and that recently came in simply because of what we saw in Q2, where some of the late planned deliveries for the quarter didn't happen. And as a result, we think we will see -- our expectation is that we'll see meaningfully stronger deliveries in Q4 than in Q3 in Surveillance despite the strength in the backlog. Overall, looking at the second half, I think everybody is going to see some lift from the restructuring. So overall, expenses on a gross basis are going to come down. Net-net, we are going to invest more in marketing. So you'll see that tick up a little bit. And overall, the engineering expense -- engineering spending continues to be at a pretty meaningful level as well. So globally, for the second half, you're right, Q4 is looking like it will be materially stronger, that's not unusual. It certainly happened in years past and I think a lot of the dynamics from a segment standpoint are laying out pretty much as we've seen historically. As I said, with a possible exception of Surveillance, where we've clearly been cautious about, particularly, with respect to international orders when we expect them to revenue.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Great. And then in terms of the Surveillance bookings, the $1.2 billion book-to-bill was actually pretty good and it looked like bookings weren't all that bad. What did you see in terms of a split geographically between U.S. and other parts of the world in the Surveillance bookings. And were there any notable orders that you would call out?","Thomas A. Surran","Tim, it's interesting. We had a larger-than-usual number of kind of medium size orders in the low to mid-single digits. We didn't have a lot of -- sometimes, we didn't really have any blockbuster orders during the quarter. It's actually a pretty nice way to make the number. I think if we had to talk about how we'd like to see that business flow, that would definitely be it. Demand internationally was good. Deliveries there, as we've talked about before, are lumpy. It's tough to predict them. But from a bookings standpoint, we saw good demand pretty much across the board. Sequentially, orders look good as you know, Q2 of last year was an unusually strong quarter. So compared to last year, it wasn't a great quarter but from a book-to-bill standpoint and in terms of the momentum in the business, it was pretty good.","Andrew C. Teich","Tim, this is Andy. I'll add one other thing to that, that we expect to start to see order flow from some of the new products that we've developed in last 12 months in the surveillance space. There are 3 in particular that we'll see order flow most likely from U.S. customers in the second half, and that is our 380-HDc, which is our new compact high-performance gimbal; our SeaFLIP 280, which is the product that was sold into the U.S. Coast Guard PB-EOS program. We delivered the first couple of those units but we expect to see a follow-on order for that product in H2. And then also our Recon 5, which was a product that we've just launched, a really terrific product in terms of its execution on the size\/weight\/power reduction front, and we expect that we'll start to see some US-based orders for those products in the second half.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Tony, maybe just a couple of housekeeping items on the numbers. What are you expecting for the full year tax rate? It looks like the tax came in a bit lower this quarter. And then I also noticed there's about $1 million of other income in there, can you just maybe elaborate on those items?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes. So I'll answer the second one first. There's a couple of things in other income. We have a Non-Qualified Deferred Comp Plan and the expense on that is typically pretty much neutral because we don't make company contributions to it but there is an expense related to the growth in those balances when the market does well that's offset by a shadow account that we've got of those securities. In this particular quarter, you saw a pretty strong performance in the market, which led to some other income on the NQDC line, that was basically offset by expense up in the corporate segment. So it's just kind of a push from one place to another. We also had a bit larger-than-usual currency gain. If you go back 4, 5 years, we used to have some pretty meaningful quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in other income because we didn't hedge our -- some of our foreign currency exposures. We started doing that I guess, 3, 4 years ago, I guess, 4 years ago and that significantly dampened that activity but I think we had currency gains of a little over $600,000 in the quarter, something in that zip code. In terms of the tax rate, the effective rate for the year is pretty much where we thought it was going to be. There are some discrete items that benefited Q2. There will probably be some discrete items in Q3 and Q4 that will benefit the rate as well or benefit the expense. So yes, for the second half of the year, you'll probably see tax expense if you calculate it as a percentage of pretax income, be a little less than that 23.75% number, 23.75% that we had in Q1. That's really going to be the result of things like expired statutes more than it's going be the result of the tax rate itself on a global basis coming down.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just on FLIR ONE, I mean, how are you guys thinking about, you just have the -- obviously, just taking orders and pre-orders now, iPhone 6 is going to be coming out, do you guys have another version for the iPhone 6? I mean, I was thinking that you are targeting, I think, the tech geek market. Those guys do tend to go out and buy the latest and greatest iPhones. I mean, is there any holiday planning in your process? Will you have another product out to capture that holiday push?","Jeffrey D. Frank","Hi, Michael, this is Jeff. Thanks for that question. It's a good one, it's one we think quite a bit about obviously. Break the answer in the kind of 3 pieces first. First is our ability to respond to new platforms or new mobile handsets as they come out. And over the last year, we've spent a lot of time developing what we think is a great product with the FLIR ONE but probably, more importantly is the platform aspect of the design. It's powerful, it's expendable, it's adaptable, and we think we have a great design base to work from as new mobile devices emerge. Another piece of that is, the learning curve we've gone through with physically interfacing to cellular devices, this in general is not as easy as it sounds to do and we've gained a tremendous amount of domain knowledge in the organization. And both of these things kind of combine to -- as a really great foundation so when these new mobile models do emerge, then we can respond much more efficiently with much shorter design cycles. And we've experienced so far this with the FLIR ONE. The second piece, though, it's what do we respond to. The iPhone 6, we know as much about that device as everyone else does, which is basically nothing but rumor. So it's really very difficult for us to take any specific design activity around that until we know what it is. So we're going to be watching that launch carefully. When we see the launch, we're in a position to very rapidly evaluate any design issues and respond appropriately around that. The last piece of this is kind of what's going to happen with the FLIR ONE itself as we get this out in the customers' hands. We're going to be meeting a lot of new customers. We\u2019re going to be learning a lot of things from these customers. These things, with this input that we get from them may impact future design and future product roadmap decisions. So all that's going to play into how we respond to the iPhone 6 and Android devices as they come out. But right now, we're focused -- we're laser-focused on the FLIR ONE launch and making sure that's a success.","Andrew C. Teich","Mike, this is Andy. I'll just add one other thing to it. If you look at the iPhone 5\/5s installed base, it's huge. Our penetration into that could be very small and we would still have an extremely successful product. And the other interesting about it is that the FLIR ONE, of course, is still useful even if somebody moves to a different platform. The product, of course, can still use the predecessor hardware. Without a SIM card activated, it's still a functional product. So we think that it's got a lot of legs with the existing platform and then as Jeff says, we will evaluate both our experience set and what the new platforms look like in terms of forming the path forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JPMorgan.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","The overall results seemed quite predictable and it's commendably so. As you look at the segment level revenue in particular, the surveillance, OEMs, Security and such, the year-over-year growth rate fluctuates quite widely. I'm just wondering why is that and do you anticipate the sort of the growth rates starting to sort of normalize and be a little bit more predictable at the segment level moving forward?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, I think it depends on the segment, Paul. If you look at our Instruments business, for example, it's a fairly predictable business. Also, if you look at our Security business, it's growing quite nicely right now. We've got a lot going on there in terms of new product introductions, channel development and so forth. So I expect those 2 businesses to continue to execute on the path that they have been so far this year. The businesses that get a little bit more lumpy of course are the ones that have government back end to them or government customer base of surveillance detection and to some extent, the OEM business, and those are a little bit harder to predict. OEM has done well this year and we've had pretty good visibility into what our OEM core customers demand looks like, so I expect it to continue on a nice path for the second half of the year. Maritime, this business is very seasonal. And again, it's one that we understand, the seasonality of that business is quite well understood at this point. It's been modeled into the second half of the year. Second half of the year for the Maritime businesses tends to be softer than the first half of the year.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then Andy, as you think about the full year guidance that you've issued, what are the sort of main sort of puts and takes to that guidance in terms of assumptions that might flex us in one direction or another?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, probably the biggest input piece on it is what happens with the leading edge of the business, the book and bill component for the various businesses. We try to take objective and a very measured look at what the book and bill requirements are for the second half of the year based on the experience that we've seen over the last 12 months. And that results with the model that puts us within the guidance. The biggest wildcard on that is -- continues to be the government funded customer portion of the business. I would say that the Commercial businesses should execute to plan then, if anything, there may be some upside in those businesses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Yair Reiner with Oppenheimer.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I think on the last call, you mentioned some potential risk. If -- should the U.S. pass incremental sanctions against Russia, I think those have now gone into effect. Do you anticipate any impact there, either to your Surveillance business or any of the OEM core business?","Andrew C. Teich","There is clearly some impact, I don't think it's material in the overall results of either of those 2 operations. We have had customers that we unfortunately, couldn't fulfill their requirements from us because of that, but it's been small. And knowing that that's kind of the rules of the game at this point, we'll be focusing our business development in other areas. Most of the -- most of our products that go into Russia that are controlled products are in our OEM group and they tend to be products that are non-itruck [ph] controlled that are produced in Sweden. We don't sell a lot of surveillance product direct into Russia. So I guess, primarily focused on the OEM segment.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. On the DR SKO program, it looks like funding is currently there in all the versions of the FY '15 budget floating around Washington. Assuming that it remains there in the final version that gets passed, what do you anticipate will be the delay between when the budget gets passed and then when it translates into revenue for you? And then also, what is the margin profile look on that program as it moves into a flow rate production?","Andrew C. Teich","So there is -- where we stand with that program is, yes, it's in the budget and the present -- the potential budget actually has been incrementing it up. We are currently in a process negotiating with the customer about the delivery's minimum qualities, timing of those, so that's something that we're real time. In terms of the turnaround time for first orders or when we expect to have that concluded in first orders, it could be in the second half of this year but clearly, by the first part of next year. There's a lot of variables in terms of what those minimum order quantities will be, what the expected volumes will be and then the presidential budget numbers. So we're expecting to see some first flow rate production orders probably in the second half of this year but definitely by the first part of next year.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Got it. Good, I'll just try to sneak in one more, if I could. The security margins were pretty impressive in the second quarter, should we think of that as a new basis, kind of hard to understand what the run rate in that business given the volatility over the last 3 quarters.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes. So there is -- the security business, we've opened up some channels. And we also introduced some new products and we're expanding the product line quite a bit, in fact, most of our segments were expanding our product line breadth. And as part of that, we had some new products in the recent quarters, which we introduced that some of them were bundles, some of them were our new offerings, that we were a little too aggressive. And as we kind of calibrated ourselves at where we could price those products, we were able to improve our margins. And going forward, we would expect to see kind of the margins that we obtained in this past quarter going forward.","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, Yair, this is Andy again. The one other variable that affects security margins is what the content of thermal is in the overall profile. We had a pretty strong content in Q2, we expect that to continue. We've got new products that are being launched in the thermal space that will come out in the second half of the year. That's kind of a key kind of towards our overall margin improvement in the security business. It's a deeper penetration with thermal technology into the customer base and distribution base that we've established there.","Yair Reiner - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And on that front, any early indications of a demand for the IR bullet camera?","Thomas A. Surran","We haven't. It's not shipping yet. So no, it's too early to tell.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair & Company.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just wanted to get a little bit more detail around the sales management changes that you guys were making or self-structure change that you guys are making in the Surveillance division, and what types of actions are you guys taking? And sort of what sort of the goal or the direction that you think this can accomplish?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes, sure. So Steve Williams was within our organization. He is a demonstrated performer. He formerly, was in the Reservoir [ph] business for the Surveillance. He is now in the top position. He is very disciplined. His execution is extraordinary. I think that what he'll be focusing more is a deeper engagement earlier with some of the program offices to make sure that we are aligned with where our customers are going on their needs going. And he's also restructured some of the staff, assigning people to those that kind of align the organization with that goal.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just as we think about sort of the FLIR ONE, do you guys have much baked right now into the guidance or into expectation? And can you give us maybe a sense of whether this is a fairly modest amount or this is a pretty significant amount, just looking for some rough color around how we should think about the actual FLIR ONE contribution?","Andrew C. Teich","Tiny stuff, John -- Jonathan. We had some expectations. We initially expected that we are going to ship in Q2 and that we would see some revenue in Q2, we didn't. In fact, OEM's performance of -- the strength of that performance is -- on the revenue line is despite the fact that we had some expectations for FLIR ONE deliveries that didn't happen in Q2. H2 expectations are very modest as to be I think not at all significant in terms of the outlook and how the performance of that product is going to affect the second half of the year. We've been very, very cautious there.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then, you guys talked a little bit about sort of the Lepton core and some new products that are going to be coming out. Is there any sort of sneak preview you can give us? Just trying to get a little bit of color around that.","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, at this point, we obviously don't want to disclose specifically what we're doing from a product standpoint, Jonathan, but the focus will be new categories within existing segments.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee Group.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Andy, I wondered if you could just give us a little bit of some more color around I guess, how you're developing the OEM customers for Lepton. You've been in the cores business for a long time. Is this -- because it's different channels that you're going after initially, is there --this comes with more challenges or is it very similar?","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, that's a great question, Peter. The interesting thing is that the -- in many cases, the types of customers that we're dealing with are different than historically what we have dealt with. We're seeing more consumer and industrial-oriented customers that have an interest in Lepton. And so I think that the development cycle of those customers are historically but the long-term potential is greater. Early -- very early interest was -- has been particularly strong in the UAV space. So we've engaged with several manufacturers that are manufacturing small, lightweight UAVs that fundamentally, there is no other alternative out there for them today than in Lepton. But we also think that there are a number of new opportunities that are being pursued right now in industrial automation and in some home intelligence products and those are markets that are new that wouldn't have necessarily been attainable using our previous Quark and power cores.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And how would you, I guess, gauge the level of interest comparing it to the CES to where 7 months later now where we are with, like, kind of a lot of those discussions?","Andrew C. Teich","It's been quite steady. The cores group has been quite busy and the level of engagement has been steady. And as I've mentioned in the prepared comments, we've started shipping units at this point. So we've got 2 or 3 OEMs that are already now receiving shipments of product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.","Brian Denes - Imperial Capital ","This is actually Brian Denes filling in for Jeff. Just a couple of questions for you guys. First one, we see the margins in the Surveillance segment come down from 29% during the first quarter of 2013 to now about 18%, with the backlog that's growing, what cost reduction measures are you guys taking to get those margins back up to historical levels?","Andrew C. Teich","Yes. So we are taking some actions there specifically, in the functional area but we'll also be looking at production operations to make sure we improve the operating margins sequentially through this year and going forward.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Brian [ph], it's Tony. There's some mixed dynamics associated with that as well. I would say that the margins in that business that we saw in Q2 were unusually low. The margins that we saw earlier in the year were pretty good given where the business is currently. But as we see shifts in the mix in that business, it can vary fairly meaningfully.","Brian Denes - Imperial Capital ","All right, great. And this is my last question, so we hear and we believe that long-term trends of the U.S. government business is a reduction of revenues, so with the exception of FLIR ONE, how else can we see the infusion of the Lepton technology in commercially viable products?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, there are a number of different opportunities that we're pursuing with Lepton. We believe that Lepton has sockets within each of the segments that we have in our business today. And again, I don't want to go into specific products that we're working on, but fundamentally, the fact that it is thermal imager that has both night vision thermal imaging capabilities, high sensitivity and temperature measurement capabilities, fundamentally, lends it to any of the markets that we're in today where we're offering thermal imaging technology. And it fundamentally creates a new category of products that can have a considerably lower selling point and also, a reduced feature set. But we believe that each of our markets has an opportunity for that type of product. As we've mentioned a couple of times already on this call, during the second half of the year, we'll bring products to market that will underscore what we're thinking here.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Mas with Needham & Company.","Brad Mas - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","This is Brad filling in for Jim. First off, with regards to Commercial business, wondering about the timing of new product releases and if it's going to be skewed more to Q4?","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, it will be skewed more towards Q4, yes.","Brad Mas - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then instrumentation is usually seasonally strong in the fourth quarter, do you see that staying the same or changing with the decline in the ASPs?","Andrew C. Teich","Sorry, what segment?","Brad Mas - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Instrumentation.","Andrew C. Teich","Oh, instruments. I don't expect that you would see a meaningful difference in the way we execute in Q4 relative to historical levels.","Brad Mas - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last one from me. With regard to Security, obviously a strong quarter, just wondering how you would characterize the growth rate on a normalized basis?","Andrew C. Teich","Security is a market we feel very positive about its future opportunities. So you're going to see some stair-stepping going on, we're going to have some products that will become available at the back half of this year. We've talked about some of those at some of the recent -- some of the major trade shows. But we're going to expect to see long-term growth in that marketplace. Now, it's going to be stair-steps so we'll see through the balance of this year, maybe not. We'll see nice growth over prior year but relative sequential, then we'll introduce the new series of products. We're going to add a lot of products here in the second half of the year. We'll be expanding our distribution, especially internationally, on some of our visible offerings and combination of those, we should see kind of the next step, then the distribution bring it to the next step.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Brad, I'll add one other point to that. If you look at our Security business, it's really got their 3 legs to the stool, there is the Lorex consumer DIY space, there is the FLIR-branded professional integrator class of visible product and then there's the FLIR thermal. The latter is probably the most lumpy, the FLIR thermal business, but as we expand that more deeply into commercial and industrial channels, I think it's taking some of the noise out of the volatility in that market. The thing frankly I'm most pleased about is how well that middle segment is doing, the FLIR-branded professional-grade visible products, it's growing at about the same rate that the DIY market is on the kind of high 20% range. But I'm very pleased to say that, frankly, because that's a very competitive space, and it's a space where there's some very strong brands in that space. So to see the FLIR brand getting traction in that space is a very positive thing for us. And also from a offering standpoint, it really strengthens our position because it allows our salespeople and it allows our integrated partners to go in with a complete solution of both visible and thermal products to address a specific customer need.","Operator","We have a follow-up question from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","A couple of follow-ups on FLIR ONE, I thought it was a great break that you are going to be in all the Apple Stores, on Apple.com, I just wanted to verify, are you really going to be in every Apple Store nationwide or just kind of select major urban ones? And then do you expect to kind of move on to get into the big box retailers and other distribution channels thereafter?","Travis Merrill","Hi Pete, this is Travis, thanks for the question. As we mentioned in the press release a couple of days ago, we're actually going to be starting selling FLIR ONE direct to consumer initially and soon thereafter, we'll be rolling out in Apple Stores. And that's really going to be done on a regional basis. And we really can't say more than that at this time with respect to the Apple Stores. But the second part of your question, which is sort of expansion beyond that, we're really taking a wait-and-see approach based on the initial dynamics of FLIR ONE, what the demand trends are. And we will -- we'll react accordingly, but we're clearly preparing for additional expansion and channels for that product. But at the same time, given the new nature of this category for us, we will sort of wait and see as we go into the fourth quarter.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And then one follow-up on the apps. You guys mentioned in your July 22nd release, 3 apps in particular, and I was wondering would those be the only 3 apps available initially or will there be others. And then I wanted to know if -- are you going to actually get a fee for when people buy apps, I want to ask you about that?","Jeffrey D. Frank","Yes, thanks, Pete. This is Jeff. We are initially launching actually 5 apps that will appear on the Apple website. Hopefully, they'll all be out there at the time of launch, there is the FLIR MX app, which is kind of the core operational app. Then there's 4, what we're calling accessory apps, that will come along with it: the TimeLapse, which goes kind of what it implies; our Close-up one that allows you to take images closer than the -- closer to the camera than with normally the parallax issues associated with having the MSX algorithms running would allow you to do. With the Paint application, which is sort of more of a fun application that allows you to combine thermal and visible imagery together in creative ways; and then the Panorama, which is relatively self-explanatory. All of these apps will be -- are developed by FLIR and will be available for free.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then I know you've had tons of developers interested in further apps. What's your sense of how those will become available, sort of a timeframe?","Jeffrey D. Frank","Well, we signed up originally about 2,500 developers, which was both exciting and encouraging. Kind of validated our thought of the FLIR ONE like the product was going to encourage innovation and create a bunch of new apps would emerge out of this. But we sort of came to the realization that 2,500 developers was not a manageable number. So we've taken a more structured incremental approach to how we're working with those folks. We've picked a handful -- we've culled through the 2,500 and we picked a handful, fewer than 20 developers that were deemed as early development partners, and each of these were kind of picked based on their viable interesting app idea, their ability to execute it and their willingness to act as a beta tester with our software developer kit that we've launched. And all of those folks currently have pre-production units, they've got beta versions of our SDK and we're giving them a lot of one-on-one support through the engineering team. So we're hopeful we'll start seeing new interesting apps emerge soon. We can't give you specific dates in terms of when it's going to come out or what those are going to be, but I'll just say that there's a pretty broad range of things that I think will be interesting to many different people in the marketplace associated with this.","Operator","We have a follow up question from Tim Quillin with Stephens.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on cash flows. But first, if you could give us an update on your strategy for improving inventory turns and how quickly you can get to your target levels. And then also, I think so far this year, cash from operations has been about 1.7x net income. Do have targets of where that might end up for the year?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Tim, it's Tony. I would say that Q2 was -- we did okay, but it wasn't the greatest quarter we've had in the last couple, in terms of making progress on working capital. Part of that relates to what was happening at the end of the quarter on our expectations for some shipments on the Surveillance side of the business. Part of it relates to building inventory in advance with some expectations for deliveries under some programs later in the year. We've -- without going into detail about each individual segment, the performance in Q2 range from really good to kind of flattish. And it's those segments that didn't advance their objectives in Q2 that are going to get the focus in Q3. In terms of when we get to our targets, I'm of the view that you never get to your target because you're always wanting to make it better. But I think that between now and the end of next year, is the window for us to see some pretty meaningful improvement. We're still working to establish what we think the right targets are for each individual factory and that'll eventually roll up to the segment level, where we'll have a perspective in terms of what we think segment inventories ought to look like. We've made good progress over the last 5 or 6 quarters. I would like to see us make even more in terms of proportion. I'd like to see the next 5 or 6 quarters look even better than that previous 5 or 6. To your question about cash from operations, you're right, it was around $170 million relative to net income in H1. We don't typically give guidance in terms of what we expect cash flow to look like throughout the year. But I would anticipate, given kind of what I just described to you, and absent any other kind of major changes to the business that we'd see performance in H2 that was similar to or maybe a little bit better than what we saw in H1.","Andrew C. Teich","Operator, we'll take one more question.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.","Andrew C. Teich","Great. Good. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for joining on the call today. Again, we continue to be focused on executing against the restructuring and realignment that we've put in place, leveraging the new technologies that we've introduced to the market, and improving our marketing communications as we develop the new markets for our products. We're looking forward to the second half, and we'll see you after Q3. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Todd DuChene, Senior Vice President and General Counsel for FLIR Systems.

And we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","Let me now turn the call over to Andy Teich, President and Chief Executive Officer of FLIR Systems. Andy?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Todd, and thank you all for joining us for FLIR's third quarter 2016 earnings call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and SVP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison.","I will start the review of the quarter with slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $405 million, an increase of 6% compared to the prior year. Commercial product revenues grew 10% over the third quarter of 2015 and government product revenues grew 2%. Driving the year-over-year growth in commercial products were the newly-acquired products from DVTEL and Armasight, strengths in fire and PPM\/building products, and increased Lepton core sales.","On the government products side, increased deliveries of military thermal camera cores, land-based imaging systems, and Man-Portable systems were partially offset by slower activity from our airborne gimbal products. Earnings per share for the quarter were $0.43, which were negatively affected by a $2 million charge we took in the quarter for the expected cost to remedy product quality issues that were identified with certain of our SkyWatch surveillance towers that are in the field.","Excluding this charge to cost of goods, earnings were $0.44 per share. This represents 10% growth in EPS versus the third quarter 2015, when you adjust out the discrete tax benefit we saw last year of $0.12 per diluted share. Growth and operating profit margins in the third quarter improved significant on a sequential basis, up 170 basis points and 380 basis points, respectively, compared to Q2 of 2016. Stronger product mix and better absorption of overhead costs helped increase gross margin, while lower OpEx spending drove further improvements in our operating margins.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $89 million, our highest quarterly cash flow from operations since 2013. On a year-to-date basis, operating cash flow has grown 9% over the first nine months of 2015, the result of our focus on improving our accounts receivable collection and controlling inventory levels.","Total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter up 13% year-over-year to $644 million, our highest since 2008, and our fifth straight quarter where we've shown sequential growth in backlog. Backlog in the Surveillance segment is up 16% over the balance at the end of Q3 2015.","On the new product front, the Instruments segment launched a new and improved A35 and A65 thermal temperature sensors for continuous monitoring and automation systems. The Security segment released the newest version of Latitude enterprise-class VMS software, and our OEM & Emerging segment's traffic business introduced the RSX-F thermal sensor for passenger, train and railcar applications. And just a couple of weeks ago, the Detection segment introduced the new R100 personal radiation detector.","On October 3, we announced our agreement to acquire Point Grey Research. You'll see on slide 4 a summary of the transaction and the business. Point Grey, which is based in Vancouver, BC, is a global leader in developing and selling machine vision cameras. These are advanced visible imaging cameras and solutions used in industrial automation systems, people counting systems, medical diagnostic equipment, intelligent traffic systems, military and defense products, and advanced mapping systems.","We're enthusiastic about the potential of this transaction, as we feel machine vision and retail people counting are very attractive end-markets and are two largely underpenetrated application spaces for thermal imaging. Point Grey will provide us a scalable platform from which to grow the business and integrate our thermal technology.","Thermal imaging provides a differentiated data set for a wide range of machine vision applications to include the ability to remotely measure temperature, accurately analyze thermal patterns and see through factory obscurants, including smoke, dust and steam. Common applications include monitoring welding, drying, sealing, molding, curing and extruding processes, as well as a range of food processing and non-destructive testing applications.","Additionally, thermal technology can improve people counting solutions, giving us ability to accurately detect, track and quantify living beings in a wide range of environmental condition. Point Grey's product and selling strategy is very similar to our OEM camera cores business, in that itself camera modules on a B2B basis to makers of imaging and automation system, and as such, the business is expected to be a very strategic fit for our OEM & Emerging segment. We look forward to bringing the Point Grey team aboard and getting started on innovating the next generation of machine vision solutions.","We expect to close the transaction during the fourth quarter and the acquisition price of approximately $253 million will be funded by our current foreign cash balances. While we're not discussing the financials at Point Grey specifically, we do expect transaction-related cost to negatively impact FLIR's fourth quarter earnings by approximately $0.01 per share; however, we expect the acquisition to be accretive in 2017 and thereafter.","On slide 5, you'll see our outlook for 2016. We continue to expect full-year 2016 revenue to finish in the range of $1.6 billion and $1.65 billion, and an EPS to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.65, excluding the SkyWatch costs, the impact of the potential acquisition of Point Grey, the Q2 investment write-down and certain discrete tax items.","This outlook represents a revenue growth rate of between 3% and 6% and an EPS growth rate of 3% to 6%, and compared to the 2015 results after adjusting to exclude the 2015 restructuring charges, investment gain and discrete tax items. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.12 per share, which will be payable on December 2 to shareholders of record as of November 18.","I'll now ask Amit to review the third quarter financial results. Amit?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Andy. On slide 6, you will see our third quarter financial results. Consolidated revenue was $405 million, a 6% increase compared to the third quarter of 2015. The largest drivers of the revenue growth came from the OEM & Emerging and Instruments segments, increasing 22% and 11%, respectively. Security segment revenue declined by 5%.","Recently, revenue increased in the U.S., Europe, Middle East and Africa and Asia by 6%, 9%, 12% and 11%, respectively, while it declined in Canada\/LatAm by 19%. Sales to the U.S. government increased $33 million or 42% and represented 28% of total revenue compared to 21% in the third quarter of 2015.","In this quarter, we recorded a charge of $2 million with certain expected costs to remediate previously-disclosed product quality issues associated with our SkyWatch surveillance towers. We've not yet completed our analysis of all affected units that might require such remediation. As we gather more information and finalize our assessment, this charge will likely increase. Consolidated second quarter gross margin was 47%, 10 basis points lower than last year, primarily due to the charge for SkyWatch repairs, partially offset by favorable segment mix. Gross margin improved 170 basis points sequentially compared to second quarter, primarily driven by improvements in the Surveillance and Instruments segment.","Our operating margin for the quarter was 20%, 6 basis points better than last year, despite the $2 million SkyWatch repair charge mentioned earlier. Our third quarter tax expense was $16.6 million. We now expect our 2016 effective tax rate to be 24% excluding certain discrete tax items. Net earnings for the third quarter of 2016 totaled $58.6 million or $0.43 per fully diluted share. Third quarter 2015 net income of $73.1 million was aided by $17.4 million favorable discrete tax item related to the release of a previously recorded tax reserve.","Excluding the impact of the SkyWatch repair charge, adjusted EPS for third quarter of 2016 was $0.44 compared to $0.40 in the third quarter of 2015, a 10% year-over-year improvement. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter increased 20% from year-ago levels to $88.6 million, or 151% of net income, driven by continued improvements in working capital as a result of our special initiatives. Our days sales outstanding and days inventory on hand improved year-over-year, driving an improved cash conversion cycle.","Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $6.8 million, significantly reduced from the higher levels a year ago when we were in the midst of consolidating our manufacturing facilities in Santa Barbara. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares for $36.3 million and returned another $16.5 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We repaid the entire $250 million principal amount of maturing notes in early July. With this repayment and the second quarter issuance of the $425 million five-year notes and the upsizing of our credit facility to $500 million, we've completed the implementation of our previously communicated capital strategy.","We've increased our gross leverage ratio from 1 turn to about 1.4 turns, while maintaining a strong balance sheet and an investment-grade rating. We've also increased our liquidity, lowered our weighted average cost of capital, lowered our interest rates and increased our borrowing flexibility. We closed the second quarter with cash of $677.7 million. We intend to use our foreign cash balances to fund the potential acquisition of Point Grey in the fourth quarter.","This concludes the summary of our third quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights. Tom?","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Amit. Slide 7 is a summary of the third quarter results by segment. All segments, except Security, showed higher revenue than the prior year. Segment-level operating profit was up 8% as a result of the top line growing 6%, a steady gross margin and improved operating leverage.","Moving to slide 8 to cover the Surveillance segment, third quarter revenue for Surveillance was $136.4 million, up 4% over the third quarter 2015. Increased revenues from land and Man-Portable products as well as from the new Outdoor & Tactical Systems line of businesses, each contributed to the growth, while our gimbaled products showed decline on a difficult comparable to the prior year that included significant RAID and MEDEVAC program shipments.","Operating profit for the Surveillance segment was $38.4 million, which was down slightly from the prior year. However, if the SkyWatch costs are excluded from the results, then Surveillance's operating profit would have grown slightly. Compared to the second quarter of this year, Surveillance operating margins improved 520 basis points as product mix returned to normal levels.","Surveillance backlog increased to $22 million from the end of Q2 to $363 million and is up 16% from one year ago. Strong follow-on orders from U.S. and Middle East programs helped drive the growth in backlog. Surveillance segment book-to-bill ratio was 1.2x in the third quarter, which was the fifth time in last six quarters that book-to-bill has been above 1.0x.","On slide 9, you will see a summary of the Instruments segment's results. Revenue increased 11% as compared to the third quarter of 2015 to $82.7 million. The success of our new T1K premium handheld camera helped our Plant Predictive Maintenance & Building product line grow over 20% year-over-year. Instruments firefighting line of products continues to gain traction in the market, growing revenues 77% over the prior year.","Additionally, FLIR-branded Test & Measurement products grew 60% over the prior year. Many of the FLIR Test & Measurement products now feature our Infrared Guided Measurement or IGM technology that is uniquely enabled by our Lepton camera core.","Instrument operating profit in the third quarter grew 25% over the prior year to $27 million or 33% of revenue. Gross margins were equal to last year and SG&A expenses declined slightly to improve operating margins. On a sequential quarter basis, operating margin improved by over 8 percentage points as a result of improved manufacturing efficiency and cost containment initiatives.","During the third quarter, Instruments introduced upgraded versions of the A35 and A65 thermal imaging temperature sensors. The new sensors which are used for advanced process control, quality assurance, condition monitoring, and fire prevention, feature a more robust housing, higher vibration tolerance, new field-of-view options, and extended temperature ranges. The sensors feature leading digital communications standards, including GigE Vision compatibility and GenICam protocols for seamless integration with existing customer systems.","On slide 10, you will see the Security segment results. Security's third quarter revenue of $56.4 million was down 5% compared to last year's third quarter. Reduced shipments of consumer-grade Lorex security bundles created a significant headwind to segment performance. Partially offsetting this, retail softness was higher enterprise-class product revenue and 13% growth in thermal security cameras.","Security operating margin was 5% in the quarter, well below the prior year. While gross margins were slightly better than last year, increased operating expenses and amortization related to the DVTEL acquisition pushed down profitability. During the third quarter, we reduced Security segment operating expense by 8% and we continue to work to find cost improvement opportunities in the Security segment.","In September, the Security segment released the latest version of the enterprise-class Latitude Video Management System. This latest release adds communication protocols with all FLIR thermal security cameras and recorders, support for pan\/tilt\/zoom tracking and cell-based motion detection support of FLIR's Quasar cameras. This Latitude software solution enables our customers to be able to integrate large sites of up to 10,000 cameras and to control and monitor all of them with one user-friendly software interface.","The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on slide 11. Reaching an all-time high, OEM & Emerging third quarter revenue was $62.7 million, increasing 22% over the prior year. Growth was seen in nearly every product line with particularly strong results from military-grade thermal camera cores. Lepton cores also showed significant strength with delivery to OEM customers for products such as the Cat Phone. And the FLIR ONE mobile accessory continues to perform well with revenue growing 131% compared to the prior year.","OEM & Emerging operating profit also reached an all-time high for the quarter, increasing 40% over the prior year to $19.9 million. During the third quarter, OEM & Emerging's intelligent traffic system line of business introduced the RSX-F sensor for railcar monitoring. This new product integrates a thermal and visible camera to provide passenger and cargo train operators the ability to pre-emergently detect fires with advanced software algorithms running on the thermal data streams, as well as enable the monitoring of railcar activity.","Also during the quarter, one of our OEM customers Snap-on Tools introduced a Lepton-based handheld thermal imager that is specifically designed for automotive diagnostics and utilizes advanced software to help mechanics and technicians easily detect engine, HVAC and electrical issues in a car. As Andy mentioned, we recently announced that we have agreed to acquire Point Grey Research. Once completed, the acquired business will become the integrated imaging solutions line of business within our OEM & Emerging segment.","Turning to slide 12, Maritime segment revenues were $40.6 million, representing 4% growth versus the prior year. Higher sales of thermal cameras drove the revenue growth. Maritime operating income was $2.4 million in the quarter, representing a 6% operating margin in the segment seasonally low quarter. Operating income grew 29% over the prior year as lower operating expenses helped operating leverage.","The Detection segment results are summarized on slide 13. Detection's third quarter revenue was up 2% year-over-year to $26.4 million as DRSKO shipments were up slightly over the prior year, offset by year-over-year decline in explosives product revenue.","During the quarter, Detection's booked its largest-ever order for radiation products, a $9 million order from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for our R300 personal radiation detector. Consistent gross margins combined with reduced operating expenses resulted in a 26% growth in operating income year-over-year. Detection finished the third quarter with $68 million of backlog, declining $6 million since Q2 due primarily to shipments under previously received large DRSKO orders.","Two weeks ago, Detection introduced the R100 personal radiation detector. The R100 is the new entry-level price point for our Detection's radiation product line and is the industry's only IP67-certified and American National Standards Institute drop-test compliant personal radiation detector. It is a belt-worn detector for use by first-responders, law enforcement, military and security personnel, and features an integrated Bluetooth radio for sending reports wirelessly to central command.","That concludes my summary of the segment third quarter. I'll now pass the call back over to Andy.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. Overall, the quarter was in line with our expectations. Our guidance for the year is unchanged as we've not seen indications that the fourth quarter will be materially different from previous expectations, including a second-half gross margin that is approximately 2 points ahead of what we saw in the second quarter.","We're encouraged by our backlog levels and expect growth and operating margins to improve sequentially and year-over-year as we realize the results of our cost containment activities. We're excited about our product roadmaps and are looking forward to an exciting next 12 months with new products coming from all of our segments and from our recently acquired businesses. In the near term, we're focused on finishing the year with a strong fourth quarter.","That concludes our comments on the third quarter. We'll now ask the operator to open the call up for questions. Kevin, can you go ahead and open the call for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We'll now be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question today is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to focus a little bit on the commercial security market, and I wonder if you could talk a little bit about the decline you're seeing there. And you mentioned \u2013 you highlight Lorex as being down significantly. Can you give us some sense as to how much that's down and whether that's just market related? Is there some share shift going on? And what are the steps that you're taking in terms of driving some growth back into this business?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure, Jim. This is Andy. In that business, the largest piece of the decline was related to the Lorex consumer retail piece of the business. And there, you can have some rather dramatic shifts based on retail placements. And in this case, we had two SKUs in the Costco stores and we've dropped down to one SKU in the Costco stores, and that's a bit of a cyclical business. So, we expect in the future that there will be a strong probability of us recovering that SKU. But in this particular case, we've been displaced by a lower-priced product offering. We have some new product and technology that is coming in that space, which we feel that can help to regain the position that we had there.","Relative to your question about what are we doing longer term, it's really about product development, in that particular case. We're looking for continuing to inject features into the product suite and improving both the support and the backend software capabilities for those products to differentiate them from a rather commoditized space.","Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Andy, are you satisfied with the other pieces of the business? How is DVTEL performing relative to your expectations?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So, I would say, DVTEL from a technology standpoint is performing well. The integration of thermal camera capabilities into the Latitude VMS that Tom mentioned in his prepared comments has gone very well. We've also taken our Surveillance 360 software capability, which is our mapping capability, and integrated it into the Latitude VMS suite. So, we offer a very good and differentiated capability there, particularly for large outdoor perimeter security applications. That said, I would say the frontend, the integration of the frontend of the DVTEL business has not gone as well as we would have expected. So, we've had a little bit of a delay there in terms of integrating those businesses together. We expect that to come to conclusion here this quarter and we should see the sales growth return in that business as a result.","Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ben Hearnsberger from Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I'm looking at Surveillance, and we've had three positive revenue growth quarters, backlogs improving. I guess, given what you're seeing in the end-market, do you have confidence that this momentum continues into 2017?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure, Ben. Surveillance has done well and we've seen growth on the revenue side, particularly in the U.S.-based business. From a backlog standpoint, we've seen growth coming from our international customers. So, in subsequent quarters, I think you'll see a higher concentration of international systems shipments. In terms of the long-term outlook, there are a couple of things to consider. I would say that from an international perspective, we can expect to see continued demand there as there is continued political unrest internationally and our systems are very well received for ISR applications and border-control applications.","From the U.S. perspective, there's still a question mark about what happens relative to the continuing resolution that's set to expire on the December 9 of this year. So, that's a bit harder for us to predict in terms of what the budget situation is going to look like. We're hopeful that Congress can seek a successful budget resolution and get that situation resolved for us and for the nation.","We're also \u2013 as we've mentioned on previous calls, our business is more of a short-cycle-oriented business, which makes it a bit more difficult for us to forecast. But we do like what we're seeing in terms of the competitiveness of our products in the marketplace, and we do have some new products in development that will get launched in the early part of 2017 in this market that we expect will help to drive demand as well.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then, looking at the Security business, within the enterprise piece, when do you expect to release a hybrid product that I know you guys have talked about in the past?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So, we don't talk specifically about when we're going to launch products, but what I can tell you, Ben, is that we've got a very rich stream of thermal-based products, targeted at the enterprise class that we'll be launching later this year and early next year.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter. I want to give a shot at the Point Grey deal. Maybe you could talk about, in terms of your M&A hurdles, if this deal meets your M&A hurdles? And then if there's anything you can say in terms of \u2013 I'm curious if it will be dilutive to OEM margins on an ongoing basis? And when the deal closes, should we get more financial details at that time?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure, Pete. So, first, the deal does meet our M&A hurdles, and we've put quite a bit of diligence into this deal. We're particularly excited about the fit, I would say, both from a product standpoint and from a cultural standpoint. The machine vision space is a space that's been growing quite well and Point Grey is involved in machine vision. They're involved in mapping applications. They're involved in people counting applications. And each of those are growing markets and they're markets where we believe that there will be a bidirectional transfer of technology between Point Grey and FLIR that will benefit both sides of our business.","Certainly, the injection of thermal technology, as I mentioned in the prepared comments, is something that brings a significant opportunity to Point Grey. And then we also think that there are elements of Point Grey's business and particularly their knowledge relative to visible sensors that will benefit our OEM business and also some of our other segments businesses, as many of those other businesses use visible cameras within them.","To your last question, we will have more details about the acquisition in subsequent calls. We're very much looking forward to getting the team on board and integrated, and moving forward with our plans thereon.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. If I could, just one follow-up on Instruments. I thought that segment might struggle a little bit until your new mid-level products come out next year. But it had a real solid quarter, clearly. So, I'm wondering if you could just \u2013 you touched on it, but could you just give a little more color on what led to such a strong quarter this quarter for Instruments? And so, is the new mid-level products next year just going to be additive to that essentially?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. It's a combination of things, Pete. One of the things that we talked about previously is that we have spent quite a bit of time focusing on the low-end product offering in the Instruments segment and creating the IGM product line, also creating some other Lepton-based products in the lower spectrum of the Instruments product range. Those products are catching on and doing quite well now, so we saw very strong growth in the FLIR-branded Test & Measurement product line. Most of those products are IGM\/Lepton-based products.","The second thing that we talked about was that we move from the low end all the way up to the high end of our product range and we refresh that with the product we call the T1K. So, that's in production and shipping nicely during the quarter, and we saw a very good uptick there in our PPM & Building business and that was largely driven by traction that we saw with that T1K product. We've been messaging for the last few quarters that we've been working on the mid-range of our product value ladder. It's a fairly long-term development and it is scheduled to launch in early 2017, and that certainly will help to drive growth in that segment.","The one other thing that we've done in that segment is we also are selling FLIR ONE through the Instruments' industrial channels, and that's a separate channel relative to our retail pursuits with that product, and that's been helping to get traction as well. And the combination of both the FLIR ONE and the IGM products are, I think, very helpful in the market as they not only introduce the FLIR brand, but they fundamentally create new thermographers in the market, which we hope over time would be looking to move up the value ladder with higher capability instruments that we coincide with the launch of the new mid-range products.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. That's interesting. Thanks very much. If I could just sneak one last one and then I'll kind of get out of the way. Amit, did you say \u2013 do you have an upper bound on what the SkyWatch, I guess, liability is?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Right now, we booked to the low-end, which is the $2 million, based on all the units that could be out there, and we've been at this for several months now to trace all the units that are out in the field and what are affected, but the upper bound could be as high as $20 million.","Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Peter Arment from Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Good morning, Andy. One clarification. Did you specify what the organic growth for the overall company was in the quarter? And then, if you could also just maybe give us a little bit of how you're viewing the Lepton product, etc., rollout? I mean how many products, I guess, do you kind of \u2013 if you can give us that, how many are \u2013 where Lepton is now embedded in the overall product base in terms of instruments, and how you see that growth being accepted? Thanks, Andy.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. So, the organic revenue growth for the company was a little over 2%. And then, moving over to the Lepton-based question, Lepton has been doing quite well. Total growth in Lepton sensors that were shipped were up over 200%. And we've got quite a broad range. I think we're approaching almost 20 products now internally that are using Lepton, and really quite a broad array of products externally that are using Lepton. Tom mentioned in his prepared comments that one of our OEM partners, Snap-on Tools has launched a product that is specifically focused at automotive mechanics, for automotive maintenance applications.","We also launched a product last quarter with Scott Fire and Safety and that's a firefighting product, where the camera is embedded in the SCBA, breathing apparatus mask. So, there have been a number of applications out there that we've been serving with Lepton externally. And also, we mentioned a couple on this call. We're quite excited about the products that have been launched in the traffic space. There have actually been two new products that we launched in the traffic space. One is for railcar monitoring and the other is a Lepton-based product that is designed to be used at crosswalks.","So, we think the opportunity set there is really quite large, and our manufacturing base for Lepton has been ramping quite rapidly. And of course, we've got a high volume of units that have been shipped and are going into the Cat Phone as well. So, we're quite pleased with the way that business is developing.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. That's great color. Is the firefighting channel still your biggest channel, or is there another channel that's overtaken that yet?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","No. The Cat Phone is by far the largest user of Lepton at this point. It's quite large.","Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","As a follow-up to that last question, could you give us a little bit more color in terms of Cat Phone user volumes as well as initial reception?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure, Jonathan. We don't specify the specific volumes of products that are sold. But I would tell you that the Cat Phone business has been going well. The customer there, that's the manufacturer of the phone has actually come back and reordered a subsequent order ahead of their initial forecast for the year. So, the demands are exceeding their expectations. They're also expanding their channels for the distribution of the product. So, I think, frankly, it's actually still early days to really understand what the total traction is going to be for the phone. We've also seen the introduction of that phone generate interest with other rugged handset and tablet manufacturers. So, we're fairly optimistic that we should be able to see other platforms adopt the technology.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then with regards to the Security segment, I mean, clearly, there's some challenges at least in the short run. But how should we think about the operating margin performance? Should we think about this as maybe structurally being lower over time? Or can you just give us maybe some thought process to follow in terms of where those operating margins should rebound back to?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","For the time being, the margins are going to be lower there. They're going to be single-digit margins for some time as we develop the platform, integrate DVTEL, and ultimately inject low-cost thermal technology into those products. It's a very competitive space, but it's a very large space with a lot of opportunity. So, we're going to be in an investment phase for at least the next 12 months in that business. And we expect over time, though, as the thermal products get traction and take on a larger portion of the total unit sales in that space that the margin will move up into the double-digit range.","The traction for thermal products in the Security space continues to be quite good and the margins, both gross and operating, there are quite good. It's just that the visible piece of that business is very competitive space. The total demand in China has been declining, and as a result of that has forced many of the large Chinese suppliers to look elsewhere for business, and that comes more into the spaces that we compete in.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Hi. Good morning, Andy.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","A question for you. Two things on our end, the first one being is, as you talked about the reduced operating expenses on the Security side, where exactly is the cost cutting taking place within that segment, and how do you ensure that you can improve the efficiency of the overall business while reducing the costs?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So, the reduction in expenses there has really been across the board, Saliq. We're quite judicious in making those cuts. Particularly after you do an acquisition, I think there are opportunities to set the business up to run more efficiently and that's fundamentally what we've done. I would say that FLIR has a pretty long and demonstrated history of managing operating expenses through a prescribed model for business segment. And fundamentally, that's what we've done here. We have a specific model that prescribes how much money we spend on R&D and selling, marketing and G&A. And in this particular case, we've looked at this business and what its likely revenue projections are, and brought those expenses in line with that model.","Again, in terms of the long-term predictability of the business, I think we've got a pretty good track record of managing expenses to the top line of our individual segments. And we're comfortable at this point that the expenses have been right-sized in this business. And particularly looking at the product pipeline that we've got in place right now, we are much more confident that we can deliver the results in the coming quarters.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","And there has also been a lot of conversation surrounding drones and what that could mean for the camera manufacturers as well as the thermal camera manufacturers. Could you give us an update on what you're doing right now to be able to better capture this market and how your relationship with DJI is evolving?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. We're very excited about the drone market. We talked about it a little bit during the last call as well. At the end of the day, there are an awful lot of applications for thermal cameras where the application is better served as the camera's in the air, and a drone, of course, is an ideal platform to make that happen. Our partnership with DJI has been going quite well. So, that's one of the vectors that we have to the market. So, we're doing customized product for DJI, and the first of which of those that's on the market right now is the Zenmuse XT, and that's been selling quite well.","We also have our own line of products. The FLIR Vue and Vue Pro and Vue Pro R products are direct products that can be connected to a wide variety of drones that are on the market. And we also have a vector into that market through our OEM channels. So, there are people that are integrating both our Tau cameras and our Lepton cameras directly into those drones and there are some that are actually under development right now that will get launched in the next quarter or two.","So, overall, it's a market that we're very excited about we think it presents quite a large opportunity and it's one that is very, very thinly penetrated. I will remind you, though, that the concept of putting thermal cameras on drones is something that we've been involved in for quite some time. I think today, unquestionably, we are the world's leading supplier of uncooled cameras that are flying on drones through our partnership with AeroVironment, who has been using our camera payloads for many years now, primarily in the military space. But we do see consumer and industrial applications as a very nice opportunity going forward.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Andy, just one last one on my end, if I could squeeze that in?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","You talked about the lower expended products, and I may have missed this earlier. However, to me it sounds like you're still committed to that product line. However, with the increased competition that we're seeing within this product line, particularly within the retail space, you're seeing the thinning of the overall margins, not just for Lorex-branded products, but across the board from some of the other DIY solution providers that we follow. What could the future look like for Lorex? And does it still make sense the way that it sits right now with overall FLIR?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yes, we're continuing to \u2013 we constantly do portfolio analysis on the assets that we have within the business, and Lorex is one that we're looking at, at this time. That said, though, this is a business that's still growing. Lorex has a good presence and a good brand in the space, and I think it's really about two things. It's about maintaining the retail channels that we have in place and creating products that are differentiated and easy to use.","There's also continues to be an opportunity for thermal in that market in that the primary application of these products is to alert people when there are activities going on in the camera field-of-view and it's very difficult to do that reliably using only a visible sensor as the input source. And we know from our experiences in this business that thermal provides a much more accurate and valid data stream.","And it really ties to the acquisition of Point Grey, where Point Grey has a business of \u2013 in the people counting space, primarily oriented at retail analytics, where we believe that we can utilize technology and processing capabilities that Point Grey has developed, augment that with thermal and create a solution for specific verticals within the consumer security market that we feel will be differentiated and defensible.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We've a follow-up from Ben Hearnsberger from Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I think you guys mentioned something on unit volume growth in Instruments. I'm sorry if I missed that number. Would you mind providing that?","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","I don't have it at my fingertips. I do \u2013 did we disclose that?","Todd M. DuChene - FLIR Systems, Inc.","I don't think you mentioned that, I believe.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","I know in the past, you guys have, at times, provided it. I guess, the point I'm getting to is, it seems like unit volumes have been growing significantly within Instruments, primarily driven by Lepton. And the idea is we've got more product in more people's hands, and as the mid-range comes out next year, I guess, I kind of hypothesize that we may have a larger-than-normal upgrade cycle. I guess, can you just speak to that? It seems like next year sets up well for Instruments based on this.","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, I think \u2013 so you're referring to the fact that we decided and are pushing the low-end to create that awareness for the value proposition of thermal imaging into the Instruments market, and that's absolutely what we did. Just to give a specific number, year-over-year, we saw the increase in the unit volume. And I'm doing kind of a calculation in my head, so forgive me if I'm off a little bit, but I believe it's 75% increase, plus or minus a couple of points there.","And the reality is we do expect that those users who are exposed to it at some of the low end will understand how the higher-end solutions we provide can do things for their work, for their businesses for efficiency, for accuracy, so that they can provide higher-level services. And we would absolutely expect them to migrate up into our midline products. And we hope that with the new midline products that we'll be introducing, there's a number of new features that will be coming there that we would see a nice upgrade cycle with that, not only for our existing customers that are in the mid-range, but also these new customers that we've exposed with the entry-level price point products.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And so, we have 75% unit volume growth. Can you give us the percentage of volume growth that was Lepton-based?","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah, Ben, I don't think I want to go into that level of fidelity. But, certainly, one can assume that there's significant growth at the low-end, when you look at the combination of the volume growth relative to the revenue growth. But that said, I do want to underscore what Tom said. The strategy here in terms of creating IGM products, for example, is not only to provide thermal imaging into the hands of a much broader audience and, I would say, a different type of demographic than we have historically been selling to in the Plants (47:28) Predictive Maintenance space that we're reaching to more to the technician level and putting infrared at their fingertips sort of on a daily basis instead of as a specialized tool.","I firmly believe that those people are going to see the value in the technology, and some percentage of them are going to want to have higher fidelity, higher resolution, higher accuracy, better distance capability, better recording capability that will come from the mid-range products.","We've also been expanding the product line in terms of going after specific vertical applications, like firefighting, like gas imaging, like continuous monitoring, permanently installed systems, things like that. And again there, the introduction of a product using IGM shows people the power of thermal imaging and they may choose to then pursue it with a specialized product that addresses that specific application with a much greater level of detail and accuracy.","Ben Hearnsberger - Stephens, Inc.","That's great. Thank you very much.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","My pleasure.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.","Andrew C. Teich - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Kevin. I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on the call today. We continue to be enthusiastic about the traction we're getting in our core markets and are encouraged by the successes we're seeing with a wide range of new products that incorporate our Lepton micro camera core. We remain focused on broadening our footprint from our high-end surveillance and targeting systems, down to our consumer-oriented instruments and situational awareness products. We look forward to addressing the growing machine vision and people counting business with the addition of Point Grey.","I want to thank our employees around the world for continuing to enable our mission of becoming the World's Sixth Sense.

A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in this morning's earnings press release.","With that, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Jim Cannon, President and CEO of FLIR Systems.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Jay. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining FLIR's fourth quarter 2018 earnings call. With Jay and me today are Carol Lowe, our CFO; Todd DuChene, General Counsel; Travis Merrill, President of our Commercial Business Unit; Frank Pennisi, President of our Industrial Business Unit; and David Ray, President of our Government and Defense Business Unit.","On today\u2019s call, our plan to review the results for the full-year and fourth quarter 2018 highlight our full-year 2019 financial outlook followed by an update on our strategic priorities, including discussion of the two recent acquisitions Aeryon Labs and Endeavor Robotics. Carol will provide further detail on the financial results and outlook before we open the call for your questions.","2018 was truly a defining year for FLIR. During the year, strong organic revenue growth and margin expansion drove record adjusted EPS and operating cash flow. I\u2019ll start the review with full-year 2018 results on Slide 3 of the presentation. This year\u2019s financial performance was historically strong across the board. We finished 2018 with revenues of $1.78 billion, organic top line growth with 6%, with all three business units achieving organic revenue growth above 5%.","Our margins expanded reaching adjusted gross margin of 51.8% and adjusted operating margin of 22.7%. Adjusted EPS grew 18% to a record $2.22 per share. Cash flow from operations also achieved record performance, increasing 21%. Strong cash flow enabled us to repurchase 144 million in shares in the fourth quarter brining total 2018 repurchases to 244 million. This morning, we announced initial expectations for our full-year outlook.","We expect revenue growth of 8% to 10%, which includes organic growth of approximately 5%. Strong order momentum heading into 2019 and recently announced key franchise program wins give us confidence in delivering our organic growth target. I will note the effect of the partial government shut down has created challenges. However, we view this largely as a matter of timing and are committed to recovering any impact over the balance of 2019.","We expect 2019 adjusted operating margin of approximately 22% to 23%. This includes our recent acquisitions and incorporates accelerating investments in our long-term strategy, including unmanned solutions, ADAS, and intelligent transportation systems or ITS. Finally, we expect full-year adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.30 to $2.36, which includes $0.06 of dilution from the acquisitions.","Slide 4 provides information on or results for the fourth quarter. Organic revenue fell below our expectations. The natural lumpiness of the business was aggravated by the government shutdown, which challenged our ability to secure licenses and ship products. We estimate $8 million or 2% of revenue delays in the fourth quarter, primarily impacting the government and defense business unit.","While fourth quarter revenue growth was less robust than previous quarters, we\u2019re well positioned for 2019 with organic bookings growth of 20%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017, as well as significant recent program wins. We also announced a 6% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.17 per share, which will be payable on March 8 to shareholders of record as of February 22.","Turning to Slide 5. I\u2019d like to remind you that in May, we shared our strategic priorities to Fuel, Feed, and Focus the business with the FLIR method as its foundation. I\u2019d now like to update you on our progress. Starting with Fuel, on Slide 6, we advanced many near-term opportunities to gain scale in the business with recent franchise program wins, as well as strong non-programmatic bookings in the fourth quarter we\u2019re well-positioned for continued growth in 2019.","In the government and defense business unit, over the last 60 days, we were awarded two contracts to deliver Black Hornet Personal Reconnaissance Systems. In January, FLIR was awarded a $40 million order from the U.S. Army for the next phase of the Soldier Borne Systems program or SPS.","The second was an award in December of an $89 million IDIQ from the French Armed Forces we expect to deliver over the next five years. The first task order has already been received for approximately $12 million. I'm really proud of the government and defense team's ability to deliver backlog equal to the fourth quarter of 2017. ","During 2018, we successfully addressed the sunsetting EO\/IR-FP and DR-SKO programs, which represented approximately $92 million of backlog at the end of 2017 as compared with $35 million ending 2018. Recent franchise program wins, strong non-programmatic bookings, and consistent book-to-bill of over 1.0 gives us confidence in our ability to drive future growth.","Our industrial business unit won the largest optical gas imaging camera order in FLIR history in the fourth quarter. This family of offerings can detect errant gases such as methane, carbon monoxide, and sulfur hexafluoride, and we\u2019ve invested in this business with the intention of expanding the market to help address health and safety regulations aligned with our mission to save lives and livelihood. We\u2019ve also earned several machine-vision wins across numerous manufacturing and process verticals.","During the fourth quarter, the commercial business unit was awarded the contract to secure the Haramain high-speed railway of Saudi Arabia, representing the largest project win in FLIR's commercial security history. Commercial was also awarded a large-scale intelligent transportation project in Hamburg, Germany. Utilizing FLIR\u2019s differentiated thermal solutions with deliveries over 2019 and 2020. This represents a significant win in our ITS division that fuels our strategy to expand offerings in the smart and connected city platform solutions.","Turning to Slide 7. Our efforts to innovate differentiated technologies to save lives and livelihood were brought to fruition with one of the most compelling recent quarters for new product introductions. I\u2019ll highlight just a couple of them those. In December, the industrial business unit announced three advanced additions to the Neutrino family of cooled, midwave camera cores, continually innovating at the central level is a key advantage to our technology to fuel growth for the entire business.","The Neutrino LC is the smallest, lightest weight, and lowest power consuming Neutrino model available. We also introduced to performance Neutrino models offering the highest resolution midwave camera performance on the market. The Neutrino SX12 produces high definition thermal video, while the Neutrino QX is FLIR\u2019s highest resolution midwave camera core. Both performance models provide crisp imagery at long distance while maintaining a wide field of view.","Also, in January, as an extension of advancing our unmanned strategy in the commercial business unit, we introduced Raymarine DockSense. DockSense is a groundbreaking assisted docking system that automates and simplifies the both docking experience. DockSense leverages technologies from across the company to integrate intelligence gathered from surrounding imagery to assist boat owners in tight quarter docking maneuvering. DockSense is an example of our continued effort to move from providing sensors to offering full solutions.","Turning to Slide 8. You\u2019ll recall from our Investor Day in May, we articulated a strategy to feed the long-term market opportunity in unmanned solutions. We\u2019ve made two acquisitions to start 2019 to significantly advance that strategy. Building upon the success of the Black Hornet Nano UAS last month we announced the acquisitions of Aeryon Labs to further expand our UAS portfolio.","Aeryon Labs is a leading developer of high-performance UAS Solutions for military, public safety, and critical infrastructure markets. Aeryon Skyranger UAS is a vertical takeoff and landing quad-copter with larger payload and lift capability that integrates multiple sensors, including FLIR\u2019s thermal technology, a strong user interface, and advanced flight management software.","20 different militaries around the world use Aeryon\u2019s market leading products for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance operations. The acquisition further establishes FLIR as a leader in the Group 1 UAS space, and reinforces our long-term strategy to provide complete turnkey solutions.","Turning to Slide 9. On Monday, we announced a second acquisition in the unmanned space with the signing of an agreement to acquire Endeavor Robotics. Endeavor Robotics is a leading developer of battle-tested, tactical unmanned ground vehicles or UGVs for the global military, public safety, and critical infrastructure models. They are highly mobile and easy to operate ground robots utilize advanced sensing to provide explosive ordnance disposal, reconnaissance, inspection, and hazardous material support at stand-off range.","The talented team at Endeavor has a heritage of innovating solutions that are proven to save lives in the field. Having shipped more than 7,000 UGVs to customers in over 55 countries, they are one of the largest UGV providers to the US Department of defense. Having recently won the U.S. Army's Man Transportable Robotic System Increment II, better known as MTRS, Endeavor has momentum with the DoD and is well-positioned for several other franchise program wins.","Upon completion, Endeavor will join Aeryon in the unmanned systems and integrated solutions division within the government and defense business unit. The additions of Aeryon and Endeavor significantly advance our strategy to be a leader in unmanned solutions. Furthermore, combined with Prox Dynamics, these acquisitions expand the market penetration of our sensor suite for CBRNE and applications. ","Aeryon was funded with cash on hand, while Endeavor will be partially funded with existing cash, as well as borrowings under our current credit facility. While we\u2019re not discussing financial specifically, we expect the combined acquisitions to dilute 2019 adjusted EPS by approximately $0.06 per share. We expect the acquisitions to be accretive in 2020 and thereafter.","Turning to Slide 10. Along with the inorganic efforts we\u2019ve made to build out the unmanned systems and integrated solutions business, we\u2019ve continued making significant organic investments in the high-growth markets of unmanned, ADAS, and ITS. Harvesting savings from the FLIR method or TFM we're self-funding the talent, processes, and tools to win in these categories long-term. TFM enables us to rapidly advance our long-term strategies and maintain operating margins in-line with our 2021 targets.","As an example of our feed efforts in ADAS, at CES in January, the industrial business unit launched our second-generation thermal vision ADK, featuring the high-resolution Boson core. Paired with machine vision algorithms for object classification. The ADK leverages thermal to provide critical data to improve decision making and safety of autonomous vehicles where other sensors experience challenges, such as darkness, shadows, sun glare, fog, smoke, or haze.","Also, at CES, we introduced the industry\u2019s first thermal camera equipped commercial test vehicle. FLIR\u2019s autonomous car features multiple FLIR ADK cameras that provide a 360-degree straight view and demonstrate thermal integration capabilities with radar, lidar and visible cameras found on autonomous vehicles today. The autonomous car also features thermal camera enhanced automatic emergency breaking. We will continue to feed target opportunities to position our differentiated solutions in attractive markets with long-term growth trajectories.","Turning to Slide 11. As detailed at the Investor Day in May, our strategic priority around focus was largely targeted at re-orienting certain commercial businesses towards the professional, and divesting businesses that did not fit our long-term strategy. In 2019, efforts will focus on one of the most critical parts of FLIR\u2019s mission, the customer experience. I believe there is substantial opportunity to improve all of the touch points our customers have with FLIR and our products, how we communicate? How we quote and sell our products? How we ship and service our products? And most importantly, our customers end-to-end experience using our products in their mission.","The FLIR method continues to service the foundation behind our efforts to transform into a world-class operating business. We made significant gains over the past 12 months to 18 months, principally focused on lean manufacturing and continuous improvement. As we go forward, 2019 will include an increased focus on building out other elements of the FLIR method, notably acquisition and integration discipline and global talent development.","I will now turn the call over to Carol for her review of financial highlights. Carol?","Carol Lowe","Thank you, Jim. On Slide 12, you\u2019ll see a summary of our fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results. Please note with the exception of cash flow, all of these financials are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the filed appendix. Consolidated revenue for the fourth quarter was $448 million, a 9% decrease year-over-year. Organic revenue growth was in-line with the fourth quarter 2017.","While fourth quarter revenue growth was less robust than previous quarters, we are well-positioned for 2019 with organic bookings growth of 20%, compared to fourth quarter 2017, as well as significant recent franchise program wins. Our 12-month backlog finished the fourth quarter at $602 million. Fourth quarter adjusted gross margin improved 300 basis points year-over-year to 52%.","Gross margin expansion was driven by favorable mix and productivity gains, driven by the FLIR method. Fourth quarter adjusted operating margin was 24%, 150 basis point higher than last year with margin improvement in all business units. Solid operating leverage led to adjusted net income of $86 million, up 5% for the fourth quarter of 2018. We achieved record adjusted EPS in the quarter of $0.62 per share, 7% higher than the prior year.","Adjusted net income was favorably impacted by a 600-basis point decrease in our effective tax rate versus Q4 of the prior year. This was primarily due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as a jurisdictional make shift of our taxable income. During the quarter, we generated cash flow from operation of $98 million. This brings our cash flow from operation for the full-year 2018 to a record $374 million, representing a 21% increase over the same period last year, driven by solid earnings growth and working capital improvement.","Turning to capital allocation. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased approximately $3 million shares at an average price of $47.80 per share, bringing our total 2018 repurchases to 5 million shares or $244 million. We expect to continue covering delusion associated with our equity compensation programs, as well as being opportunistic with our share repurchases. We also returned $22 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends increasing our full-year dividend payments to $88 million.","Our solid liquidity and $512 million year-end cash balance is enabling the execution of the recent acquisition, primarily with cash on hand. Including the impact of our announced acquisitions, we do not expect our net leverage to exceed 1.9 times by the end of 2019. On the right side of Slide 12, you\u2019ll see our full-year financial results, which Jim covered in his opening comments.","Moving to Slide 13, I will highlight performance from each of our business units in the fourth quarter. Beginning with the industrial business unit, fourth quarter revenue was $182 million in-line with fourth quarter of 2017, driven by strength in cooled thermal cores, industrial UAS and automotive solutions, but offset by declines in instruments and uncooled cores and strong prior year comparables.","Operating income for industrial was $57 million, 3% higher than the prior year. Operating margin improved 90 basis points year-over-year, due to favorable product mix and productivity gains. The Government and Defense Business unit saw revenue decline 2.5% year-over-year. Deliveries of UAS solutions, integrated system, and maritime systems were top line strength.","Revenue growth was offset by declines in CBRNE systems and impact from the government shutdown. Government & Defense operating income was down 2%, compared to the fourth quarter of 2017. Product mix and productivity gains contributed to a 20-basis point margin improvement over the prior year. The commercial business unit\u2019s fourth quarter revenue was down 30% year-over-year, due to $47 million of revenue in the fourth quarter 2017 from the retail security business divested in early 2018.","Excluding the divestitures, Commercial Business Unit's fourth quarter revenue grew 5% over last year. We saw continued momentum in ITF, and renewed strength in security. Operating income for the Commercial Business Unit decreased 7% year-over-year. This decrease was impacted by $2 million in prior year operating income from the divested security businesses and $1 million in U.S. import tariff affects. Despite these challenges, operating margin expanded 400 basis points year-over-year. Margin expansion was primarily driven by improved product mix.","Turning to this year, we have outlined our 2019 outlook on Slide 14 and I\u2019d like to provide more color on the guidance. Jim has noted the impact of the government shutdown on our fourth quarter 2018 revenue, as well as first half 2019 impact. With that backdrop, we expect revenue for the full-year 2019 of $1.92 billion to $1.95 billion, representing 8% to 10% growth over 2018, including results from the recently announced acquisitions.","We expect organic revenue growth to contribute approximately 5%. We also expect the first quarter to be in-line with first quarter 2018, and while 2018 was front-end loaded for revenue growth, we expect 2019 to have stronger revenue growth in the second half. We estimate adjusted operating income margin of 22% to 23%. ","Adjusted operating margin expectations and include impacts from the previously mentioned acquisitions and incorporates funding accelerated investments in our long-term strategic priority via top line growth and productivity wins from the FLIR method.","Finally, our full-year adjusted earnings per share expectation is $2.30 to $2.36 per share. Adjusted EPS guidance includes $0.06 of dilution from the recently announced acquisitions. It also includes a 20.5% adjusted effective tax rate and $25.5 million in net interest expense, as well as diluted share count of 137.7 million shares. In addition, we expect our CapEx to be approximately $50 million to $60 million in 2019.","I will now pass the call back to Jim.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Carol. Last month, I had the honor of joining World Wildlife Fund, or WWF, CEO, Carter Roberts at CES to announce the Kifaru Rising Project, a collaboration between our organization to bring an end to illegal rhino poaching in 10 parks and game reserves in Kenya using FLIR technology. Our collaboration with WWF in the Kifaru Rising Project signifies the broadest scale deployment of FLIR Technology for wildlife protection and represents a vital step to help save these endangered animals.","We\u2019re confident in the project's purpose, based on the dramatic results we\u2019ve observed in smaller scale testing with WWF and rangers in Kenya. The Kifaru Rising Project is our first key flagship program introduced as a part of FLIR Hero, the company's new corporate social responsibility platform introduced last year. Please visit flair.com to learn more about this important effort. ","Again, 2018 was a transformational year for FLIR. We published the new strategy and set the conditions for its success. In 2019, we will work to rapidly advance that strategy. It\u2019s our vision to revolutionize human awareness and perception so that professionals can make better decisions that save lives and livelihood.","Lastly, I could not be more proud of the FLIR team for their efforts in 2018 yet never satisfied. I want to thank all of our FLIR teammates around the world for their commitment to our customers mission.","I\u2019ll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Peter Arment from Baird. Your line is now live.","Peter Arment","Yes, thanks. Good morning, Jim, Carol.","Carol Lowe","Good morning.","Peter Arment","I know you're not going to get into a lot of the financial details on Endeavor and the deal hasn't closed yet, but just given that what seems to be a very high purchase price given what the private equity firm purchased the company a few years ago, you know, can you maybe just give us some color how the business has changed, just get a better understanding of the business?","Jim Cannon","Absolutely. And we're not going to give specific details, as you cited around the deal and we\u2019re yet to close of course, but if you look at the unmanned space in general, particularly in DoD, as you know in the past three years there\u2019s been great stride. Principally coming together when the 6 strategic modernization priorities were detailed by the secretary of defense and since that time the Army, as well as the other branches have worked to adapt TTPs, also understand the right technologies and how they\u2019re going to conduct that manned\/unmanned teaming.","So, Endeavor over that period of time has seen a lot of progress working in collaboration with customers around end use cases, and programs have begun to come to fruition. We mentioned the man transportable robot program win, they got MTRS II, but there are several other programs that over the coming 18, 24, 36 months will come to a decision that certainly amplifies the value of Endeavor. And as we look forward into the future and it\u2019s why we're so excited about unmanned opportunities, not just unmanned air and ground, but air ground teaming, manned unmanned teaming, we just see that opportunity continuing to grow. And at our core being a sensor company, all of these unmanned solutions deliver some sort of sensing capability for decision-making purposes. ","Whether it\u2019s CBRNE detection, EO\/IR, et cetera. Also, and lastly, I\u2019ll touch on, you know we mentioned ADAS, a lot of work that we're doing in our industrial business unit around ADAS. And as we build out our unmanned capability in DoD, we see a lot of synergies between work that we're doing with passenger, commercial vehicle trucking with ADAS, with intelligent transportation systems, and infrastructure speaking to sensors on vehicles, as well as the sensor suites and software algorithms machine learning required to have more autonomous flight and unmanned ground vehicles. So, we couldn't be more excited about the future of what Endeavor can bring to FLIR.","Peter Arment","Yes, that\u2019s great. And just as a follow-up, just if I could ask, are you expecting all three segments to show organic growth in 2019 or does the offset, since CBRNE continuing to really kind of \u2013 should we expect to have a down year in government?","Jim Cannon","We are targeting all three business units to deliver organic growth. Again, we mentioned at our Investor Day last year, we\u2019re targeting a 5% organic growth CAGR. And we expect all businesses to contribute to that. Certainly, there are some divisions that have a more optimistic outlook of 2019 than others. But on the whole and again, we do expect all three business units to deliver that organic growth and that\u2019s an important metric for us. As we\u2019re moving forward now and have executed the first, let's say sizable acquisitions that we\u2019ve done in some time, making sure that core business is healthy and continuing to grow is an obvious priority for us.","Peter Arment","Appreciate the color and thanks Jim.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Peter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Your line is now live.","Michael Ciarmoli","Hi, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions here. Maybe, Jim, not to harp on it, but just to follow-up on Endeavor and that, you know what looks to be a very healthy evaluation based on sales. They\u2019ve got this upcoming complication, the CRS-I contract. I think QinetiQ is the other player there. You know, how did the potential outcome of that award factor into the purchase decision? I mean, did Endeavor where they lacking in certain capabilities or scale, did you hear anything from the customer that would provide you with additional confidence that pulling Endeavor under your sort of umbrella would kind of increased the hit rate of that program? Just trying to figure out how you got comfortable with some of those programmatic unknowns and why make the acquisition so close to a contract decision?","Jim Cannon","That\u2019s right. Well there are several programs that are coming up. You mentioned one that\u2019s immediately, let's say before us, and as we look into due diligence, we looked at all the various programs that are out there in the future. The timing of which knowing also that these programs often slide to the right they really happen sooner than you think and probability of when, because you know there are a lot of folks interested in the unmanned space, but we believe Endeavor, with the fielding of the technology that it already has with the lessons that it\u2019s learned with the IP portfolio that it has is, well-positioned.","You know, we also looked at non-programmatic opportunities and other allied military opportunities. Endeavor has been largely focused on U.S. DoD programs. A lot of our strength in the government defense business, as you know, historically has been non-programmatic whether it's trying to capture OCO funds or special operations, forces or with allied nations. So that\u2019s an area that we feel like we could bring some synergy to Endeavor going forward. And then, you mentioned our sensor suites. You know, we\u2019re pretty proud of our CBRNE detection capabilities.","We're pretty proud of our ability when it comes to SWaP-C around EO\/IR sensors, and those are core capabilities, sensing capabilities that Endeavor will utilize if they bring their products forward and compete on these programs. So, that\u2019s an area of technology synergies that we see, again strengthens their position going forward. But I guess to specifically answer your question, if we did not win any one program that\u2019s pending that would not have dampened our appetite to bring Endeavor to be a part of FLIR.","We have a lot of conviction about the future long-term growth trajectories of unmanned capabilities, not just in DoD, but also critical infrastructure, industrial applications that require stand-off, hazardous material management, you know, all the areas where we see ourselves participating in the long-term. Unmanned will continue to grow in the decades to come.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it. No, that\u2019s extremely helpful. And then, Carol, just if I may, the operating margin and guidance from 2019, 22% to 23% flattish year-over-year. Could you maybe just a little more color or kind of bridge to year-over-year? I mean you\u2019ve got the investment spending assuming there\u2019s maybe a step up in R&D and SG&A, but even what the organic margins may have looked like or how much dilution is on those margins from the acquisitions?","Carol Lowe","Yes, so we\u2019re not breaking out other than providing the dilution associated with EPS for the acquisitions in total. A portion of that dilution is attributable to additional interest expense that we\u2019ll have for the year because of the borrowings that we\u2019ll utilize to fund a portion of the Endeavor Robotics transaction. Overall, Jim commented about the need for investing in our long-term strategies and we\u2019re leveraging the FLIR Method, as well as the topline growth to be able to maintain at that 22% to 23%, and make sure we deliver on our long-term strategic plan commitment we shared in May, which was a target of approximately 23% operating margin.","And it's not just about the reinvestment, but if you think about just standard inflationary type increases around compensation benefits, the fact that we\u2019re absorbing that, also absorbing some of the investment needed in the businesses to address the Consent Agreement and other things to move towards a world-class operation. We\u2019re actually very happy that we\u2019re able to fund these investments and maintain our margins in 2019 at what was a 2021 operating margin target of 23%.","Michael Ciarmoli","Perfect. No, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much guys. I\u2019ll turn back in the queue. ","Jim Cannon","Thanks, Michael. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Noah Poponak","Hi, good morning everyone. ","Jim Cannon","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak","I hate to ask the same question three times, but I just had so many questions already this morning from your stakeholders that I imagine will continue to get them, and I think rightfully so, so just wanted to kind of take one more shot at the price paid for these last two acquisitions, just on \u2013 I can sort of backup the inorganic revenue in your guidance, and as somebody just asked, we can see the price paid only three years ago, and it\u2019s just quite a high multiple and you\u2019ve sort of changed your balance sheet position pretty significantly. It would seem like you must see something very considerably different than what was in this business three years ago, are the margins much different? Is there something already in the backlog you\u2019ve secured? Just wanted to take one more shot at that. And then, also related, Jim, I thought you had sort of discussed a strategy to want to go more into software and data analytics in acquisitions? And these are pretty hardware oriented, and if you could address that as well?","Jim Cannon","Sure. Well, I mean I won\u2019t retread a lot of the ground that I mentioned earlier, except to say, as we look at long-term growth opportunities that we think are uniquely, you know, fit FLIR\u2019s strength, growth in the unmanned space is compelling for us. It\u2019s a compelling \u2026","Noah Poponak","The industry must have seen that three years ago, right? So, why would the number be so much lower\u2026?","Jim Cannon","Yes, three years ago, technology and industry was in a very different place, I mean these are technologies that are moving weekly, monthly. I mean, if I look at the SWaP-C, that we could drive three years ago, were sensors that we could put into unmanned capabilities three years ago, it was not nearly where it is now. I mean, if we look at what we have with Black Hornet, from Black Hornet 1 to Black Hornet 3 and the capabilities this has on board and something that weighs 33 grams, a very different position, and if you look at it from the user standpoint three years ago, you know, these things and they still have so much more room to go, could be very awkward to employ, you know, requiring a real dedication of the operator that would take them, in a military application, in many cases, out of sight, you know, just operate the equipment.","Now more and more we want head up, you know, hands up with the manned\/unmanned teaming, you know, working, you know working semi \u2013 ultimately, we hope fully autonomously. So, I think in three years, the technology has moved; I think user adoption is continuing to move quickly, but still immature and that's why we\u2019re particularly attracted to this right now. Also, when I think about unmanned going forward, it fits where FLIR historically has been strong. It proliferates the sensor suite that we continue to push with SWaP-C; it has defense applications, as well as industrial applications, you know, professionals that need standoff in autonomous, and the question about software and data analytics, I think couples with these two acquisitions perfectly.","We mentioned a lot of the organic investments that we need to continue to make around unmanned and ADAS and ITS in particular, and a lot of those organic investments are to build out a stronger capability around software, machine learning, data analytics, artificial intelligence because we feel, you know, really good about Aeryon and Endeavor\u2019s, you know, hardware capabilities and they have software capabilities, you know, as well. Certainly, it\u2019s a strength of ours with CBRNE sensors and EO\/IR sensors. But that piece in between how we, again, get these sensors to be more intelligent, more autonomous, more processing, you know, at the edge et cetera, is an area of specific investment that we\u2019re making organically.","It will benefit these two deals, Aeryon and Endeavor, as well as, you know, just about all of our legacy businesses. If you recall, last year, we made a minority investment of a company called CVEDIA that built a synthetic artificial learning city, if you will, that we can populate with imagery, so our cameras can get smarter, and we\u2019re just now, you know, beginning to get that technology end-to-end products. So, certainly appreciate the, you know, the PE firm had a healthy return on their investment. But we believe that this is \u2013 has got tremendous growth potential as we go into the out years because more and more as we look specifically at DoD, we know that a direction is set to build out more and more unmanned capabilities, but I think with that, you know, industrial and other first responder applications is \u2013 price points and costs, you know, come down will proliferate.","Noah Poponak","I appreciate all that detail. Just one more question, in the organic government and defense business, you had coming into this year the two major program roll-offs. You just made a comment about those being addressed, and then, you\u2019re forecasting the segment to grow organically. Have you had expansions on those programs or have the wins you\u2019ve secured just totally filled the gap? And I guess, you know, how much of the revenue forecast for the year is covered in backlog at this point?","Jim Cannon","Yes, so as we mentioned earlier, right now \u2013 last year, we had I think about $90 million between DR-SKO and EO\/IR-FP in our backlog. Right now, we\u2019ve got about [30 million]. They do not extend formally as programs; however, we did receive the last tranche of DR-SKO for $28 million just in the backlog now. Now for both, demand continues for EO\/IR-FP under the rate program. There is a continued need for those products. How they meet that need going forward is yet to be decided upon. There is potentially a program out there called G-BOSS(NYSE:E) that could fit that need or there could be continued demand, you know, under the current vehicle that they have.","DR-SKO will likely evolve. We think that, you know, with new challenges and new threats, also with the advancement of technology, DR-SKO could look very different going forward. Again, there\u2019s still very much a need for that type of product. But that\u2019s an area where perhaps in the future unmanned solutions are included in the future DR-SKO to get standoff perhaps, but there's work to do to understand that clarity. Other smaller program wins, as well as just the non-programmatic business that we historically drive has accounted for the EO\/IR and DR-SKO programs, you know, coming in the life.","David, do you want to add any color to that?","David Ray","No, I think that was a great answer. The only thing I would add is that when you look at our backlog versus 2018 versus 4Q17, it says the picture that \u2013 that we\u2019ve covered that $90 million of backlog that Jim previously discussed, that does not include the $40 million SBS award, which we got the week \u2013 first week of January. So, if you count that in, week 1 to week 1, we\u2019re actually $40 million up where we were from Q1 2018 first week of the month of January. So, it speaks to the good thing, all the work being done by our teams to continue to accelerate those program ramps coupled with what we call the scrappiness of those non-programmatic bookings. So, really positioned the business long-term for continued and predictable growth quarter-in and quarter-out.","Noah Poponak","Okay, thanks so much. ","Jim Cannon","Thanks, Noah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Your line is now live.","Josh Sullivan","Hi, good morning. Just a clarification on the 8% to 10% revenue guidance. What\u2019s the assumption for the timing of the close of the two acquisitions? You know, I know you said Q1 is going to look like Q1 2018, but just curious on the timing on when the acquisitions actually start contributing in 2019?","Jim Cannon","Yes, Endeavor should close in 30 days is the expectation of when it will close. And Aeryon, obviously, is closed now.","Josh Sullivan","And just one on the, you know, the machine vision market. You know, how is consumer electronics market looking at this point? You know, has it bottomed and just what you\u2019re looking at into 2019 from here?","Jim Cannon ","Yes, the machine vision business, you know, in 2018 had really tough comparables in the back half \u2013 second half of 2018 given all the demand in Asia with mobile, smartphone production, et cetera. You know, since that time through, you know, 2018, the team has worked really hard and won a lot of new business and new process verticals, I\u2019ll say, around fruit inspection, et cetera. But that consumer electronics business right now is pretty slow for us still. We expect bookings growth through 2019 in that business, but booked pretty modest growth because of those dynamics. Frank, do you want to add any color about the business?","Frank Pennisi","Yes, I\u2019ll reinforce some of what Jim said. You know, the smartphone market, the consumer market in general, was huge in 2017. So, we had some really large comps to go up again. Essentially in 2018, we worked a lot of that through our system and pivoted ourselves. We\u2019re in a lot of test and measurement related equipment whether or not to its \u2013 whether inspecting optics or life sciences that sort of a thing, as well as people counting, which has been a large growth engine for us where we put our machine vision cameras. So, that\u2019s been able to largely offset the consumer electronics businesses and set us up for really strong bookings growth in 2019.","Josh Sullivan","Good. Thank you. I\u2019ll get back in the queue.","Jim Cannon","Thanks Josh.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question today is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham and Company. Your line is now live.","Jim Ricchiuti","Hi, thanks. You did allude to some wins on the machine vision side, several million-dollar contracts, can you talk a little bit about the types of applications that they were for?","Jim Cannon ","Sure. Frank?","Frank Pennisi ","Yes, basically the same thing that I mentioned before. The bulk of those were in systems that are sold to other customers that do test and measurement whether that\u2019s inspecting something, whether its spectroscopy, whether its life sciences. We\u2019ve gotten ourselves designed into a number of those systems. The other are people counting where you\u2019re looking at tracking whether it\u2019s in a retail environment, a large growth engine of airports, a lot of those areas happen to be areas where we're designing in as the semiconductor and consumer electronics industry is. If you have strong penetration in is low and we have something they will offset it over time.","Jim Ricchiuti","Got it. On the gas imaging order that you highlighted, we\u2019ve been waiting for this market to develop for a while, is this potentially one of those types of breakthrough wins that may be gets this market where it needs to be in terms of adopting your technology?","Jim Cannon","I don't think that order in particular. I wouldn't characterize it as of breakthrough, but I will say throughout all of 2018 we just saw continued strength in our optical gas finding products. We have also been focused on a lot of innovation around optical gas finding and you will see more of that with the new products and developments through 2019 to make the product more available and accessible to markets that need it.","A lot of the growth that we saw in 2018 is tied to regulation, right, around health and safety in various industries, but it\u2019s interesting as we think about and I\u2019ll go back to unmanned for a moment, but as we think about unmanned capabilities and industry the ability to be able to go out and see and quantify gases with autonomous solutions across neighborhoods and such, you know, we see an interesting kind of conversion of unique sensing capabilities we have like optical gas findings with other ways to deliver that sensing solution.","Jim Ricchiuti","Got it. And if I could just slip one more in, just with respect to Endeavor, have you continued to work with them over the years on the explosive detection side of the business I know you were supplying the Fido detector into a bunch of these PackBot robots. Has that relationship been maintained over the years?","Jim Cannon","David, do you want to answer?","David Ray","So, it has been, but it has been through the partnership with the Army and the Joint Program Office for chem-bio detection. So, they have a relationship and have had a historical relationship through that office. And as we've developed our capabilities, there have been opportunities to collaborate in concert with that customer. You know, this acquisition now gives us an opportunity to leverage the R&D power within FLIR and the capabilities that exist today to really be able to take a step function move forward and delivering those total solution and accelerating that next-generation chem-bio detection capability through those UGVs now that were now that were one under FLIR. But principally, it's been as a partnership through our collective conversations with the U.S. Army. Does that make sense?","Jim Ricchiuti","Yes, it does. Got it. Thanks a lot.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Jim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Pete Skibitski from Alembic Global. Your line is now live.","Pete Skibitski","Good morning guys. Couple of very quick ones on the two deals. First, for both of them, is the revenue split in terms of government and non-government? Are they both kind of [18% and 19%] government in terms of their revenue? That\u2019s the first one. And then the second one is, do they both sell to the government on commercial terms like most of the rest of your business does?","Jim Cannon","Yes, both of the businesses are almost entirely focused on military and government applications. Principally, as I mentioned with Endeavor a lot of DoD- related programs, and Aeryon does have some first responder and non-DoD government business, but yes both businesses right now are principally focused on government specifically military applications. We think over time, as I mentioned earlier, we have some commercial synergies as we bring together the UIS business, we look at some of our historical strength in non-programmatic, in allied military spending. But their go-to-market and commercial teams operate much like ours.","David Ray","The only thing I would add is, your question about commercial terms that we operate. Largely in a non-programmatic world that\u2019s the case. I will say for some of those franchise programs like MTRS that\u2019s a traditional government program where you have a EMD development phase that transitions to production, which increases the level of customer engagement, but to more traditional DoD approach, and I think that\u2019s an opportunity space that allows us to grow inside of that customer because as the opportunities get bigger they will look more like that than a traditional commercial transaction.","Carol Lowe","David, since you mentioned the MTRS, and we have three questions initially about the valuation around Endeavor Robotics and what was different in terms of what the PE firm paid versus FLIR's assessment of the value. The MTRS is specifically a new program that has been awarded. The team at Endeavor robotics has really focused on winning the program programs of record in a very strategic way and they\u2019ve been really successful. That program is very meaningful. We referenced it in our press release about the acquisition. ","Also, the Department of Defense has been very vocal about shifting their funding towards UGV significantly over the last couple of years. Jim noted that in his response that just wanted to really emphasize that. We see the opportunity as much greater that the business has created value in the last couple of years, including introducing two new robots. And that\u2019s very differentiated.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. And last one \u2013 thank you very much guys, and then last one from me, Jim. There\u2019s been some consolidation ongoing in the defense space at kind of the OEM level, the bigger level, and some of them I think are talking about portfolio shaping and evolving night vision units and I'm just wondering post these deals, are you guys kind of still in the market for deals of similar size kind of that $200 million plus size or maybe take a breather on that for a while and focus on integration?","Jim Cannon","Yes, right now, I mean the principal task ahead of us is to execute a successful integration. As I mentioned in the FLIR method, one of the elements is integration acquisition discipline that\u2019s something particular focus for us right now. Over the longer-term, we\u2019ll remain an acquisitive company. We mentioned with our long-term guidance at the Investor Day. We want to grow organically, but throughout we want to advance very deliberately our strategy. ","We worked for the better part of the year to develop these opportunities specifically to gain scale in the unmanned space. So, you'll see us continue to be very deliberate, strategic in deals that we approach. But right now, for the near term, our focus certainly is to integrate successfully these deals.","Pete Skibitski","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Louie Dipalma from William Blair. Your line is now live.","Louie Dipalma","Good morning. Jim and Frank in the third quarter the industrial business in Europe experienced double-digit sales declines, while the U.S. industrials remained very strong. Your pie chart shows the Europe being down $12 million year-over-year in the fourth quarter. I was wondering in general is there anything extraordinary that is occurring in Europe for the Industrials business unit?","Jim Cannon","Frank do you want to?","Frank Pennisi","In general, what I'll just say is, the macroeconomic things or indicators going on in Europe are a little bit sluggish relative to the rest of the world. Europe is actually one of the things that why our growth is a little bit sluggish. I would say Europe was one of the key drivers of that along with large prior year comparables that we had tied to some big transitions that we had. ","As we move from consumer to professional, we had some smaller-type buys or as we moved over everything over to Boson, we're transitioning customers over. So, we had very large transitions side of that, that gave us some of that prior year comps. And I'll also say that Europe macros were actually playing into that and that's one of the things that we're seeing. Nowhere else in the world, this is largely Europe though.","Louie Dipalma","Okay. And for Carol, in what inning are we in in terms of FLIR Method-related margin expansion? Are there any specific margin expansion projects on the horizon for 2019?","Carol Lowe","So, we have ongoing initiatives and focus around the FLIR Method, and just as a reminder and Jim noted this in his comments that beyond just lean and continuous improvement, there are multiple elements of the FLIR Method, and we're leveraging most all of them across all three of the business units, as well as looking at some of our back-office processes that sit across the entire company. So, we're ramping up on that, we realized actual results we could see in the P&L in 2018 and they are modeled in our guidance for 2019.","Of course, we've highlighted that we want to take a large portion of those and invest them back into the business to support our long-term strategic goals for the company. So, we do think at a future date, we will be able to see some margin expansion, but at this time we're still staying with the 23% targeted operating margin over our strategic planning horizon, which runs through 2021.","Louie Dipalma","Okay. And last one for David, the Soldier Borne Sensor was a really nice win. Is all of that $40 million in units to be delivered in 2019? Or will some of that extend into the future years?","David Ray","So, we expect that production program to deliver over 18-month to 24-month period. As part of what we're trying to drive we're looking at how we increase our production capacity to deliver, but short answer is 18 months to 24 months.","Louie Dipalma","Okay. And is there any update on the time line for the G-BOSS infrared and radar prospects?","Jim Cannon","No. That's something that, again there's no update we have right now. It's still to be determined when that will be decided or if that's the path that they go.","Louie Dipalma","Okay, sounds good. Thanks everyone.","Jim Cannon","Thank you, Louie.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Reed Motulsky from Imperial Capital. Your line is now live.","Reed Motulsky","Hi, speaking on behalf of Jeff Kessler. What civil security applications in markets do you see as important focuses going forward specifically regarding cameras and unmanned vehicles?","Jim Cannon","Yes. So, we mentioned that we've had \u2013 we've been awarded our largest commercial security project to-date securing the railway in Saudi Arabia in Haramain, which is very important for us. We continue to look in our core markets at critical infrastructure applications etcetera. Why don't I have Travis the CBU President add some more color?","Travis Merrill","Yes sure. I think if we look at the commercial security market, we can look at it from a few different segments that are attractive to us and really where we're focusing our resources. Critical infrastructure still tends to be our bread-and-butter for our thermal line of products and it will continue to be so. That's the way to look at the future, but we are also taking that thermal technology and looking to expand it into outdoor perimeter protection for commercial applications, which is largely unpenetrated today things like public parks, auto and car dealership lots, etcetera.","So that will be a longer-term new market development for us leveraging our thermal technology capabilities in a new security vertical. And then finally on the enterprise side, which is largely our visible technology, safe and smart cities continue to be an attractive vertical, and we've had a lot of successes in the last 12 months to 24 months in that key segments as well.","Jim Cannon","And it's interesting, the effort with safe and smart cities coalesces in some ways touches our ADAS effort as we make intersections more intelligent, cities more intelligent, they can communicate with sensors on vehicles. We also think about it, not just from a commercial security standpoint, but ultimately autonomous and assisted driving solutions as well.","Reed Motulsky","Thank you. That was good color. And what types of cores do you guys see being used in these applications? Camera cores?","Jim Cannon","I mean right now our leading SWaP-C core will be the Boson, but depending on the need it could be cooled, uncooled camera cores, again we continue to push the boundaries with size, weight and power to be able to develop and have the best high-rate production for both cooled and uncooled.","Travis Merrill","We'll use Lepton when necessary as well.","Jim Cannon","Yes, Saros is a good example where we've integrated two Lepton cameras, so you can have great perimeter security applications with thermal with analytics that can determine if it's a dog or a pedestrian and initiate EO cameras. So, Lepton is being used as well, but the full suite of FLIR core sensing capabilities is available for the commercial security folks.","Reed Motulsky","Great. Thanks for taking our questions.","Jim Cannon","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","Jim Cannon","Again, I want to thank you for joining us on the call today and your interest in FLIR. We look forward to updating you on our progress when we report our first quarter 2019 financial results. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today."],"9562":["FLIR Systems, Inc.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to turn the call over to your host, Shane Harrison. Please go ahead.","Shane R. Harrison - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Please note that our earnings press release and presentation slides that will be referred to on this call are available under the Events & Presentations section of www.flir.com\/investor.","Before we begin this conference call, I need to remind you statements made on this call other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on our current expectations. Words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, and believes, and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

The forward-looking statements we make today speak as of today and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statement to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","We will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of our core ongoing operating results and facilitate consistent comparison of results over time. A full reconciliation between GAAP and these adjusted measures is in our press release this morning.","Let me now turn the call over to Jim Cannon, President and CEO of FLIR Systems. Jim?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Shane, and thank you, everyone, for joining FLIR's first quarter 2018 earnings call. With Shane and me today are Carol Lowe, our CFO; Todd DuChene, our General Counsel; Travis Merrill, President of our Commercial Business Unit; Frank Pennisi, the President of our Industrial Business Unit; and David Ray, the President of our Government & Defense Business Unit.","The first quarter was successful on many fronts and was a strong start to the year. We grew our top-line double digits organically, significantly expanded our gross margin, and saw very strong operating leverage down through earnings per share. All three of our business units grew over 10% organically, while business unit level operating margin expanded nearly 300 basis points.","I'll start the review of the first quarter on slide 3 of the presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter revenue of $440 million, which was an increase of 8% over the first quarter of 2017. When you exclude first quarter 2018 and 2017 revenue of the Security businesses that we divested in early-February, organic top-line growth was 13%. Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income grew 13% and 26% over the prior year respectively, with adjusted operating margin expanding approximately 290 basis points over the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter were at $0.48, which represents 33% growth versus last year's adjusted earnings per share of $0.36.","At the bottom of slide 3 is our updated expectations for full-year 2018. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $1.76 billion to $1.79 billion, and full-year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.11 to $2.16. When you exclude the results of the divested businesses from 2017, these ranges represent expected organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 15%. These updates incorporate our first quarter performance in comparison to our operating plan as well as our conviction and our ability to execute in what we feel are strong industrial and defense end-markets. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share, which will be payable on June 8 to shareholders of record as of May 25.","Related to the $15 million charge that we took to GAAP operating income in the quarter, we reached an agreement yesterday with the U.S. Department of State to resolve alleged civil violations related to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. As a result of this consent agreement, we'll pay a penalty of $30 million over four years with $15 million of that $30 million suspended and credited against past and future remedial compliance expenditures that will enhance our compliance processes. This agreement is the result of a long review process, where we cooperated fully and have devoted considerable time and expense to improve our compliance processes. The bigger picture here is that we're fully aligned with the U.S. Government in achieving its policy objectives, including the most important one and that is protecting the lives of the U.S. war fighter.","Moving to slide 4, I'd like to now touch on some of the new innovations our team has introduced since our last earnings call. In the Commercial Business Unit, the Security division introduced our new F-Series ID line of thermal security cameras. This camera sets the standard for critical infrastructure customers needing threat detection as it features 300% more thermal sensitivity than our previous system, and has onboard video analytics for automated detection low false alarming.","In March, at the Intertraffic show in Europe, the Commercial Business Unit's Intelligent Traffic Systems (sic) [Intelligent Transportation Systems] business announced the ThermiCam V2X. A new thermal traffic detection sensor for Smart Cities and connected vehicle applications that utilizes emerging crash avoidance technology called vehicle-to-everything also referred to as V2X. The ThermiCam V2X enables vehicles and traffic infrastructure to communicate and share data in a system that aims to improve motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists' safety and efficiency. This sensor personifies the differentiation FLIR delivers to its markets by using thermal technology to improve our roadways and help save lives and livelihoods. In February, the Commercial Business Unit's Raymarine business introduced their newest maritime radar, the Quantum 2. This is Raymarine's most advanced solid state radar featuring doppler target identification technology that color codes both moving and stationary targets to greatly improve a boater's situational awareness. It's also 50% lighter than traditional radars in the market, showcasing our ability to significantly reduce the size, weight and power consumption of our advanced sensing solutions.","Also in February, the Industrial Business Unit introduced two new handheld thermography cameras for use in electrical, mechanical, and building applications. The E53 is the latest in our Exx series of cameras and represents an entry level price point for the popular series of cameras, enabling more professionals access to the benefits of thermal imaging. Also launched was the new T1010, a high-definition thermography camera. This is a new entry level price point for the T1K premium series in our thermography camera lineup. It generates images up to 3.1 megapixels, thanks to our unique UltraMax image enhancement software, and like all T1K series cameras, it uses high-fidelity optics, which FLIR designed specifically to work with HD thermal sensors for greater image clarity and measurement accuracy.","Turning to slide 5, we recently introduced our new Thermal by FLIR cooperative product development and marketing program that supports original equipment manufacturers or OEMs and their product innovators, who use our thermal imaging sensors in their products. At the Mobile World Congress show in Spain this past February, Thermal by FLIR partner, Bullitt Group, a leading maker of highly ruggedized smartphones announced that they've integrated our Lepton microcamera in their latest Android phone, the Cat S61. Building on the success of the Cat S60 that was launched in 2016, the new Cat S61 features an improved temperature range, a better HD visible camera, an updated MyFLIR app and live streaming capability.","Also at Mobile World Congress, Panasonic announced their new fully ruggedized Panasonic Toughpad FZ-M1 thermal imaging tablet. This device utilizes Thermal by FLIR by integrating our Lepton microcamera to enable industrial professionals to realize the benefits of detecting temperature issues, seeing through obscurants, and seeing in the dark. Our Industrial Business Unit announced another collaboration with the world's leading civilian UAS or unmanned aerial systems maker DJI. Under the Thermal by FLIR program, a jointly developed product that is DJI's first dual sensor UAS camera called the Zenmuse XT2, designed for industrial and public safety applications. This UAS payload integrates a 4K visible camera and a high-resolution FLIR thermal camera, as well as features our patented MSX, image enhancement algorithm.","Lastly, I'd like to highlight a strategic minority share investment we made in DroneSense, a young and innovative company that develops software platforms that greatly enhance and optimize public safety and first responder organizations in their use of unmanned aerial systems. As a part of the investment, FLIR and DroneSense will collaborate and share respective expertise and relationships to develop mission-critical solutions that will enhance situational awareness, act as a force multiplier and ultimately save more lives as organizations continue to integrate UAS into their daily missions.","Let me now turn the call over to Carol, and have her review the first quarter financial and operational highlights. Carol?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Jim. On slide 6, you'll see our first quarter financial results. Please note with the exception of cash flow, all of these financials are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the filed appendix. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $440 million, an 8% increase year-over-year and 13% on an organic basis. Geographically, revenue increased 45% in the Middle East, 17% in Europe, 14% in Asia, and 2% in the U.S. The strength in the Middle East region was due to deliveries from the Government & Defense Business Unit.","Revenue to the U.S. government was 27% of total revenues and increased 1% versus the first quarter of 2017. Adjusted gross margin improved 210 basis points year-over-year to 50%, driven by product mix and new products. First quarter adjusted operating margin was 20%, about 290 basis points higher than last year, driven by the improved gross margin and controlled operating expense growth relative to our top-line growth. Adjusted net income for the first quarter of 2018 was up 38% to $68 million, and adjusted earnings per share was $0.48, 33% higher than the prior year.","Quarterly cash flow from operations declined 43% to $43 million and was 63% of adjusted net income, primarily driven by repatriation tax payments and the timing of other tax payments. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.7 million of our shares at an average price of $49.34. With these repurchases and $22 million in dividends paid, we returned a $117 million to shareholders during the first quarter. We finished the first quarter with $452 million of cash.","At the business unit level, we saw meaningful growth in Industrial and Government & Defense and strong growth across all three of our business units on an organic basis. Business unit level operating margins increased 300 basis points over the first quarter of 2017. As Jim mentioned, our guidance for full year revenue is now $1.76 billion to $1.79 billion, and full year adjusted earnings per share is now $2.11 to $2.16, representing organic revenue growth of 6% to 8%, and adjusted earnings per share growth of 12% to 15% when you exclude the divested Security businesses. This guidance reflects our current view of 2018 after seeing how Q1 outperformed our plan, the effects of delivery pull-ins from our second quarter and how our teams see the rest of the year unfolding. We continue to expect higher year-over-year growth in the first half versus the second half of 2018, as we began to lap the strong performance in the second half of 2017.","Detailing the business units a bit more, you will see on the left side of slide 7, a summary of the Industrial Business Unit's first quarter results. First quarter revenue for the Industrial Business was $171 million, up 10% from the first quarter of 2017. Sales strength was seen in many of the Industrial product lines. The sales volumes in plant predictive maintenance handheld, FLIR ONE mobile accessories, gas imaging cameras, and thermal camera cores were particularly noteworthy compared to the prior year. Operating income for the Industrial Business was $45 million, 6% higher than the prior year. Operating margin declined slightly year-over-year, mainly due to the impact of planned investments and production improvements related to FLIR Method initiatives.","The Government & Defense Business Unit had revenue growth of 15% year-over-year. Deliveries of gimbaled systems for our EO\/IR-FP program, high resolution camera border protection to Middle Eastern customers and DR-SKO shipments helped drive this top-line growth. Government & Defense operating profit increased 39% compared to the first quarter of 2017. Healthy product mix and controlled operating expense growth resulted in significant operating leverage in the quarter with operating margin expanding 490 basis points. During the first quarter, Government & Defense received a $26 million DR-SKO order and a $22 million order for BRITE Star gimbals from the U.S. Navy. Year-over-year backlog declined 7% to $357 million due to timing of international bookings into later quarters of 2018 and the wind down of the DR-SKO program.","On the right side of slide 7 is a summary of the Commercial Business Unit. Commercial first quarter revenue was down 4% year over year, due to the comparable to the prior year that included retail and SMB Security business that was divested in early February of 2018. Excluding the divested revenue from both 2018 and 2017, the Commercial Business first quarter revenue grew 12% over last year. Continued market embrace of Raymarine's Axiom line of multifunction displays was the primary driver of the performance, augmented by good growth in maritime thermal cameras, and in our Intelligent Transportation Systems business.","Operating profit for the Commercial Business increased 45%, driven by gross margin improvements across many product lines, but with particular improvement in Raymarine and Enterprise security products. This gross profit performance and low operating expense growth resulted in a 440-basis-point improvement in operating margin.","This concludes my summary of the financials and the business units. I will now pass the call back to Jim.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Carol. We're pleased with how we've kicked off 2018. We saw good growth across the portfolio and improvements in profitability. But there remains work to be done to fulfill our objective. Simply said, I'm proud but certainly not satisfied. Timing of various tax related items negatively impacted our cash flow in the quarter and we look to improve our cash generation throughout the balance of the year.","Our working capital turns improved slightly in the quarter, but we have a lot of runway ahead of us. The robust operating leverage we saw in the quarter was the result of high volume, favorable product mix, better margins on new products, and our team's commitment to better utilization of our operating spend. We've just began the rollout of various FLIR Method initiatives across many of our businesses. And while these will take some time to develop into meaningful improvement programs, we're excited about the opportunities to further expand our operating efficiencies, product value propositions, and customer experience.","Deploying our cash effectively and in a value-generating manner is a cornerstone of our long-term strategy. We returned over $100 million back to our shareholders in Q1 and while completing multiple minority share investments. We continue to evaluate several opportunities for further deployment and we build our rationale for such investments around the delivery of strategic and financial value to FLIR and our shareholders. We hope to see you at our Investor Day in New York on May 16. At this event, we'll communicate our strategic priorities and financial objectives for the coming years, as well as provide you an opportunity to interact with our products, technology and some of our leaders. Please RSVP if you've not done so already.","I'll remind everyone of our daily task, our task to consistently exceed our commitments with integrity, and our purpose, which is to innovate The World's Sixth Sense to enhance perception and awareness in order to save lives and livelihood. Within this construct, our focus is on growing our business organically, while maintaining or improving margins and deploying our cash effectively and in shareholder-friendly ways. This task and purpose is reinforced by our be FLIR values to be brave, be bold, be ready and be ambitious and fueled by The FLIR Method.","In closing, I want to thank all FLIR team members past and present, and congratulate them on FLIR's 40th Anniversary, a milestone that we reached this past March. Over the course of four decades, we've worked hard to provide our everyday heroes with technologies to improve their perception and awareness. We're proud to be their sixth sense.","I'll now open up the call for questions and answers. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question is coming from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning, Noah.","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","So the pace of organic revenue growth clearly shrunk across the entire business. The 15% in Government & Defense, on the one hand, a really nice acceleration, obviously a big number; on the other hand, you've called out the EI\/OR (sic) [EO\/IR] program, DR-SKO program. So I just want to try to parse out the sort of underlying growth, excluding programs that may be don't last much longer, if that makes sense. So perhaps, you could quantify what those contributed to the quarter, what their growth was excluding this? How much longer those do last? And then I guess, Jim, if you could just speak to the efforts to backfill the backlog to be able to sustain growth beyond those programs?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. I'll give some comments and then David Ray is here, and he can add some color. The majority of our growth in Government & Defense came from outside the United States in the first quarter. And if we look at the EO\/IR-FP program, you know that we were awarded last year $74-some-odd-million. We did ship altogether a little under $20 million of that so far. So the bulk of that really is yet to ship in the next two quarters. DR-SKO, as you know, is a program that's winding down last year. In the first quarter, we booked about $50 million of orders. This quarter, we booked about $27 million of orders. But again, the bulk of that revenue growth in Q1 really came from outside the U.S. David, any color you want to add to Noah's question.","David Ray - FLIR Systems, Inc.","I'll add to that. So at the end of Q4 last year, we had a really solid backlog coming into the year. And as Jim mentioned, EO\/IR-FP program as well as our DR-SKO program (26:14) for that. Domestically and internationally we had a lot of deliveries there.","I won't go back too far on that. What I'll talk about moving forward is, as we think about our business moving because of our backlog and our ability to execute, it really positions us now to look for larger program of records, and we're in the process of working those this year to create those long-term sustainable programs in DOD and more domestic customers that will fuel long-term growth and predictable growth for the business inside each quarter.","And so the focus from kind of more of the smaller opportunities but a better mix between large programs of record and what we're doing with inside our mid and small programs really give us the strength as we win those programs to drive more predictable growth quarter-in, quarter-out over the next few years.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","David, can you actually maybe elaborate on that because your hire is interesting given you've come from Raytheon, which is a large player in military infrared and a defense company that is on large programs of record that are longer cycle in nature. And so the strategy you just articulated resonates and makes a lot of sense. But on the other hand when I think about the implementation, it's sort of like how do you just kind of go out and out of nowhere find those things. So can you may be \u2013 I don't know if you can give a few examples or just elaborate on precisely how you can transition the segment in that manner and how long it'll take?","David Ray - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Right. So it won't take long in transition. I think the company already has the DNA to go do that. I will say that with a certain budget that's been approved over the next three years, it really firms up the government's intent to really drive modernization for the existing assets that are in the DOD. What we've been able to do inside of my short time in FLIR is not necessarily have to wholesale make changes inside the company but really it allowed us to focus on fewer bigger deals as opposed to many of the smaller deals we normally go after. And so it's just about allocating resources and really driving the focus and attention on things that really move the needle for the long term.","I'll tell you the investments we make inside of FLIR really position us not only from the technology that we leverage from the commercial side of our business and industrial side, but also our ability to drive scale and that partnership really positions us well for future platforms as we execute against our strategy.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And I'll just ask one more just on the gross margin. You've sort of been asked this question before, but I'll try it again, which is it's a good margin. It's up a decent amount year-over-year. It's one of the better quarterly gross margins in a while. And just curious to know how much of that is new management efforts and strategies being implemented and having an effect versus it's actually just that organic revenue growth has accelerated and had a nice drop-through and the FLIR Method and the new operational initiatives have actually yet to flow through and could take margins even higher.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, it's a great question. We certainly benefited from leverage that came in the volume growth in the quarter and our business does lever nicely. We also had nice mix in the products that we had across the quarter. We've also made a lot of investments in the FLIR Method and we're self-funding those investments. So when we think about the FLIR Method in the longer term and as we've talked about, we really believe that the pricing and productivity benefits that are going to manifest themselves more in the second half and carry over into 2019, but now in the first half we have to make those investments and do in a way that we maintain or continue to expand margin.","So I do think that we benefited both qualitatively and quantitatively from the business reorganization from six segments to three BUs. I think that some of those benefits have enabled us to self-fund many of these resources for the FLIR Method. And then certainly in the quarter, the volume leverage and the mix, I think I would point to really on top of those things that drove the gross margin improvement year-on-year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks so much.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Asher Carey from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now live.","Asher Carey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey good morning, everyone.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Morning, Asher.","Asher Carey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","You've mentioned the creation of like a pricing analysis function as a priority for 2018. I'm going to ask you a question about that. How much is the pricing strategy beginning to play a role in driving any organic growth, or is it still mainly volume being in the early innings of implementing the standardizing process across the platform? Thanks.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, putting together a pricing initiative is a part of the FLIR Method, is a core component. And going out and getting some very talented pricing leader to lead this effort was one of the first steps that we took forward because I do believe, we all believe that we could do a much better job and consistent job, right, in making sure that we extract full value in how we price our products.","Most of that effort right now is focused on data collection. As you implement these kind of pricing initiatives, it's not simply a matter of trying to go raise price on current products or something of that sort. It's much more complex and certainly takes time to mature and develop. So there's a data collection piece and that's really what we've been focused on now. There's a training and education piece with the product management and sales organizations.","And then as we move forward, we're really focused on new product introductions. So many of the new products that I mentioned when I went through the innovations since the last earnings call have benefited from some of this methodology and rationale. And now as they get into the market, we're really kind of getting our first taste of how successful the effort could or couldn't be. But again, it's still very early days. We have a small, relatively small amount of resources dedicated to it but very talented, and the enthusiasm inside the company, the adoption is spreading pretty quickly. But as I stated, with productivity and pricing, I think we're going to really be able to quantify much better in the second half and carry over into 2019 as these new product innovations hit the market their real effect on the business.","Asher Carey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks, Jim.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Drew Lipke from Stephens. Your line is now live.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning. Thank you for taking the question.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Morning, Drew.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","You called out a pull-in from the second quarter in terms of deliveries there. I'm curious where did you see this and could you guys maybe quantify the pull forward that you saw?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. So, Drew, we're not going to break out the exact amount. It was largely within our Government & Defense business is where that occurred.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then you talked about stronger growth in the first half relative to the second half. Is that prevalent across each segment or is that more pointing to industrial and the tough comps that we've seen there?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So it is across all three of the business units because if you look at the growth that the three business units delivered in the last half of 2017, that's when we really started to see the ramp up and the acceleration of that organic growth and we'll start to lap that. And so that makes the comps a little tougher as we move into the second half of the year.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then just last one, on the ITAR consent agreement, how long are you under the compliance review? What's the expected incremental cost going forward? And does this impact your defense international sales and your ability to see direct commercial international sales going forward?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. Well, the consent agreement has been in negotiation for some time. This is a multi-year period, in some cases going back 10 years. So we're very pleased to come to an agreement and be able to put it behind us and more importantly focus on our processes from a compliance standpoint. Again, we have the exact same policy (34:41) objective as the U.S. State Department to protect our warfighter. As I mentioned earlier, there is a civil penalty of $30 million. $15 million of that penalty is suspended. $15 million we accrued and it's paid over a four-year period. The term of the agreement is over a four-year period. There'll be two external audits in the course of that and there will be a special compliance official to oversee compliance.","Drew Lipke - Stephens, Inc.","All right. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Hi. Good morning, Jim.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning, Saliq.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Yes. Just a couple of questions for you. The first one being is over the years there have been a lot of conversation surrounding drones and what that could mean for the camera business as well as the thermal camera manufacturers. So how do you view the FLIR's involvement in this space? And could I expect some material acquisition in the near term?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, UAS is an area of emphasis for us on several fronts. First, with the production of sensors and working with the leading UAS civil manufacturer, DJI, we have a very close commercial relationship and provide them with their thermal sensors. As I mentioned earlier in the innovations, we introduced with them the first dual use sensor, the Zenmuse, with DJI. And, again, we're very excited about continued collaboration and growth in that space.","At the same time, as I mentioned in the minority investment DroneSense, we want to bring solutions to first responders in industry so that they can conduct inspections, their missions, whether it's search and rescue, helping firefighters, identify and attack the fire with a holistic solution, not just an airframe with a thermal camera but the software required and the algorithms to deploy the product, to make sure they capture the right information, to go back and also do administrative things to service the products, et cetera.","And on the military side, you know with the acquisition of Prox Dynamics, the Black Hornet product, it is a truly differentiated nano drone for personal reconnaissance and surveillance incorporating both a visible camera and a Lepton camera, fits in the palm of your hand. Again, we're very proud of that product because it is deployed and has been deployed in combat all over the world and has been battle tested.","So when we think about UAS applications going forward, we think about it even more broadly than just UAS but unmanned. And there's a whole host of unmanned vehicles, whether it be sea, air, and land, and all of which need the sort of sensing capabilities that we are developing and we'll continue to put a lot of effort behind. So it's a particular area of focus for us.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. And then one more question on my end. If I take a look at your product profile, you've introduced a number of products that are aimed at the Smart Cities market, and earlier you mentioned the V2X sensor as well. Can you talk a little bit about the growth and the potential margin opportunities or the outlook in this growing market for you guys?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, it's something that, again, we're also very focused on. We've talked on calls in the past about ADAS applications, sensors on vehicles themselves. We mentioned on the last earnings call when we launched at CES, an automotive development kit, a kit that we can provide OEMs to examine the capabilities of thermal sensors on their vehicle.","On some high-end vehicles, we have thermal sensors now, but when we think about ADAS, when we think about automation, Smart Cities, et cetera, there are certainly sensors on the vehicle, but there's got to be sensors in the community. We have a small but rapidly growing business, our Intelligent Transportation business that specializes in this. And with this V2X technology, it enables the vehicle to communicate again to the environment around us. If we think about pedestrians and bicyclists in particular, well, they're not going to have sensors on them as they move around communities. So you need to have infrastructure that can speak to the vehicle. But on the call here today is Travis Merrill. He leads that business. Travis, do you want to add some color to that?","Travis D. Merrill - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Jim. Hey, Saliq, how are you doing?","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","(39:39)","Travis D. Merrill - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So in addition to Jim's comments, beyond the ITS business, which was obviously a key part of the safe and Smart City place, where we're seeing it kind of take root early on is on the security side of the house, a lot of municipalities really building out city infrastructure around security. And then when we think more broadly within FLIR, really outside of the Commercial Business Unit, longer-term we feel that we're well positioned to take advantage of this opportunity given the products that we have in technologies like detection or other things that serve law enforcement, firefighters, first responders. That's all going to be part of that safe city ecosystem and Smart City ecosystem. But overall, it's pretty early days in that space and there are a lot of developments kind of constantly coming out, but it's unclear what the platform is going to look like longer-term, but we feel like we're pretty well-positioned there.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Awesome. Travis, thank you.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC","Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you could characterize the machine vision industrial camera business in the quarter because I know the comps get much more difficult as you go through the year, but I'm just wondering how you started the year, what you're seeing there?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, now as we talk about the business units, I don't want to get into specifics about our IIS business in terms of their numbers growth, et cetera. I'll suffice to say this, you know the business grew organically at a rapid clip through the year last year. We built strong backlog. The business continues to improve. We're very enthusiastic about the machine vision space. We've got a lot of work to do to work down frankly, the backlog that we built. And we've yet to go after some of those synergies introducing like we mentioned in the past, thermal cameras. But again on the call here is Frank who owns that business unit as a part of the Industrial Business Unit. Frank, any color you'd like to add?","Frank Pennisi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","I think Jim made a good point, good strong point that we built a lot of backlog over time. And I'll say that the Industrial Business Unit has been one of the early adopters of The FLIR Method, and we put it into the machine vision space very early on, so we could actually double our production rates over time. And so as a consequence that increased production has been really paying off and gaining fruit for us. So overall, it's been a terrific business for us and we expect that growth to continue.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC","And then just shifting into the Commercial, the CBU, there's clearly been some moving parts in that, but the organic growth rate was impressive. And I'm just wondering, was there anything unusual or are you just seeing now traction in the maritime market that maybe reflects new products as well as I guess just stronger end demand than we've seen in that market in a while. Is that one way to think about what's going on there?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, there's an arbitrage I think certainly. You know divesting the retail security piece buoyed the rest of the business certainly. If we think about our Raymarine business, the Axiom, the Quantum, the Axiom Pro products that we've introduced through the course of 2017 are really being well adopted and that business in particular is a driver of the organic growth and margin improvement that we're seeing in that space as they've introduced them. Really differentiated products there.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Your line is now live.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Just wanted to get a sense in terms of the Industrial business, I think you guys called out an improvement in both the Cores as well as the Gas Imaging cameras. Are you starting to see sort of a pickup in demand from that from the end-market or has there been any sort of shift there in terms of that pickup?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, that's a great question. We certainly are seeing increased demand from end-markets, in particular with the optical gas foundries. Whether it's regulation, whether it's more awareness around safety, and the kind of applications where those products go, there is a real need for them. I mean, they indeed save lives and livelihood when you look at the capability they bring to the market. So I think there is more awareness, certainly more adoption, and we continue to improve upon its capability.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just regarding the DR-SKO program, I don't think I clearly understood this, but when you say that the program is wrapping up, are there additional sort of variants that are expected to come in future years or is there any potential for a gap there in terms of that system?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, we got in Q1 a $20-plus-million, I think $26 million booking for DR-SKO in Q1. We expect that there's going to be another tranche later in the year that we're going to receive as well. Now based off the need, based off the threat in the world that we're in now and certainly CBRNE is front and center in that threat environment we're facing, could there be additional DR-SKO orders that we see potentially, but that program formally is winding down. It's going to be replaced with other programs, the next gen chem bio-detector that we're competing on now. So while it winds down, there'll be other programs that replace it and we're certainly working hard to make sure we're well-positioned for those programs now.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Your line is now live.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Nice quarter. Maybe, David, on the Government side, I think you talked about the backlog down year over year. Any color on the sequential change and maybe just a general update, did you have any impact in the quarter from the budget, from the shutdown, continuing resolution, did that have an impact at all on the bookings and has there been any change in, maybe I'll call it, contracting velocity since we've had this budget deal?","David Ray - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, I'll just say quickly that we're well into 2018, in the first quarter we didn't see any notable difference in spending habits from Department of Defense. We think that's more going to come towards the end of this year in 2019. And frankly, we're not right now alarmed by the bookings in Government and Defense. I mentioned the biggest driver being DR-SKO, a lot of activity, some timing of international orders. On whole I think we, David, feel strong that we can continue to grow our Government and Defense business and well positioned as we get into the surety of the budget for the next three years.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Can you maybe give us a sense of, you mentioned trying to get larger programs, programs of record, is there anything else the GBOSS-E is out there, I'm assuming there could be potential content on the next gen combat vehicle Soldier Borne Sensor. Are there any big programs on the radar screen that we should be aware of that you guys are going after?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, you mentioned three that we certainly are going after. So I would count all those in the inventory for certain GBOSS-E is extension of the EO\/IR-FP program or RAID before that, and it's a product we're very proud of for force protection. With Black Hornet and Soldier Borne Systems again, we have a battle proven solution for personal reconnaissance that have been used by friendly forces around the world for some time now, and we're very proud of its battle record. It's down range as we speak, and if we think about all the modernization efforts; next generation vertical lift, long range precision fires, reconstituting air defense artillery, fighting in a contested air space, CBRNE or NBC battlefield, we know as we focus on near-peer we're going to face the realities of fighting on a nuclear, biological and chemical battlefield and that fits with our detection business and the solutions that they bring. So when you look across all of the key modernization efforts underway and the programs that come with them, whether it be a solution, an intelligent sensor or a sensor integrated under other platforms we are keen to and intend to participate across the board.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. That's helpful. And then just Carol, I don't want you to kind of sitting there quiet here. Lots of focus on working capital, turns improvement. I think there's been talk about optimizing R&D, other continuous improvement, how should we think about free cash flow for 2018 and maybe conversion. Can you give us any color there?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So, we \u2013 and everything you referenced is obviously something we're working on, it all falls under the FLIR Method initiatives. We're in very early stages for that, but we have high confidence that we will continue FLIR's record of operating cash conversion, and being well over 100%. The first quarter was impacted largely by timing on tax payments, but very confident that we'll continue to deliver as FLIR always has in the past from a cash flow conversion standpoint.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. And housekeeping, any change to the full-year tax rate for 2018?","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","No, not compared. It's consistent with what we have, we communicated previously, the 24.5%.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","I'm sorry, 21.5%. Yeah.","Michael Ciarmoli - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it.","Carol P. Lowe - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Your line is now live.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning, Josh.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Just following up on the FLIR Method, maybe you can dig into where it's executed as expected? And then maybe some things you've seen that you didn't expect. I mean, as far as timing, what do you think that the long-term timing of the rollout of the FLIR Method is at this point?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, that \u2013 I welcome that question. Again, I could talk about the FLIR Method all day long, I'm so excited about it. We're here in Billerica doing the call; and yesterday, we went down to meet with a team of folks, we've got a new FLIR Method leader, dedicated to facility here. We want this facility to be a showcase, because with these kind of efforts, it's important to kind of get some quick wins and demonstrate to the rest of the organization, the real tangible benefit that you can have. So we got a chance to meet with a dozen folks that are being our first round of champions here, getting trained on the various tools. Now, this is in a manufacturing setting, so they're focused on a lot of the manufacturing tools that you'd see value-stream mapping, et cetera, PQ analysis, spaghetti flow diagrams, you name it.","As Frank mentioned earlier, at our IIS business, they've probably been the earliest adopters. And as we mentioned, they had a very strong backlog and they went in using the FLIR Method and several Kaizen events, reengineered several production lines. And in those production lines, we've seen an exponential improvement in the output that we're able to get weekly, as well as an improvement in yield.","There's another area, I was in Belgium not long ago visiting with a sales operations team that do purely transactional work, right, processing orders, they're a touch point with the customers, and I was thrilled to see that they on their own took the tools, value-stream mapped every process, they identified every touch point, quantified that touch point, and had improvement plans in place.","So those are three early examples of where it's beginning to take root. A lot of work to get it embedded into the entire company, and it's the kind of thing you're never done with, right. You're always working on to get better, but still very, very early days and we're self-funding this effort to dedicate resources to it, as we're seeing some of the savings. But as Carol mentioned, the FLIR Method in terms of continued cash generation, that's a principal driver as we really strive to drive our working capital turns and take what's already historically strong cash generation really to the next level and we're going to talk much more about that at the upcoming Investor Day.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Great. Yeah. And just as a follow-up to that with the Analyst Day coming up, are there any other themes you can preview for us here, what we should be expecting to see?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","You'll get a chance to see yourself in infrared, I can guarantee you that.","Josh Ward Sullivan - Seaport Global Securities LLC","Great. Thanks, Jim, and everyone.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is now live.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","I'm sorry that Imperial Capital is doubled up here, but \u2013 you folks had an impressive booth at the ISC West Show. I'm wondering if you could update us on what is going on in some of your core technology improvements, what you're doing to get better \u2013 smaller, better, more efficient, cameras around those cores. And maybe more importantly, what you think you can do with this core technology going over the next three to five years to essentially leave the competition behind and present a value proposition to basically make you guys \u2013 put you guys out there alone when it comes to looking at taking size and cost out of thermal?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, that's a great question, Jeff, and it's something that we're heavily focused upon in our Industrial Business Unit that focuses on producing these infrared cores and providing them to the other business units, and the Commercial Business Unit with our Security business where they integrate those cores into broader solutions. You know that we launched the Boson camera, the Tau has been a mainstay camera, uncooled camera core for us for some time, and with the introduction of the Boson, we continue to push that capability in terms of size, weight and power consumption.","So notably smaller, great product with great adoption across many, many applications, security cameras being one. I mentioned our focus earlier and product introduction around critical infrastructure, parameter security, more thermal sensitivity, less false alarming. We're looking also in the ITS business, at how we can introduce thermal more and more in smart cities and in tunnels and in trains to detect fires and do other safety applications like that. And I think you're also going to see as we go forward, we're going to integrate more and more of our sensing technologies together into products in particular looking at critical infrastructure, perimeter security, et cetera.","So, it's a real area of emphasis for us certainly. It's an area where we feel like given the scale of our business and the fact that we provide these cores into so many different applications; we get some real leverage inside the company. And with the shift in our Security business from retail back into enterprise, critical infrastructure, et cetera, there's some real needs to provide at many of these facilities robust sensing capabilities with a whole suite of sensors and intelligent sensors.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Just one related question, as the security industry moves toward a much more converged model of a lot more analytics and cyber, if you want to call it, merged with the physical aspects of it, how do you envision the sensor technology \u2013 the core technology that you just talked about, as part of this \u2013 I guess, as part of this growing wave of convergence?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, across the entire company, when we think about our technology roadmap and how we've been evolving it, it's moved from sensors to intelligent sensors to solutions, sensing solutions. And you see that more and more with products that we're introducing now, that have onboard video analytics, that have incorporated algorithms for sharper focus and functionality, and you're going to see that \u2013 I think, that trend continue certainly. Cyber security is always a concern, right. It's a omnipresent threat that we face all the time.","As a U.S. manufacturer of these products we take it very seriously, and when we think about our customers in U.S. and critical infrastructure around the world and allied nations, ensuring that we can provide them a cyber hardened solution to meet their needs, because of the cyber risks that they face every day is a primary mission of ours and we always have a lot of work to do in that regard.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Just quickly there was a room at the security, at this large conference that was full of essentially Asian \u2013 small Asian manufacturers, a lot of whom had thermal and infrared capabilities. And the reaction to them was, well, again relative to your company is, there was \u2013 I would just say there was some suspicion toward their capabilities and the use of them in critical infrastructure integration. So, it would seem that you have at least here at home a market that you've just talked about if you can develop that market.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","That's right. We agree and we're absolutely working hard to develop that market. We're committed to our customers' missions and the kind of places these products go, you know critical infrastructure, our purpose, lives and livelihood can be in the balance.","Jeffrey Ted Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you very much.","James J.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow with formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Jay Gentzkow. Please go ahead.","Jay Gentzkow ","Good morning, everyone. Please note that our earnings press release and presentation slides that will be referred to on this call are available under the Events & Presentations section of www.flir.com\/investor. Before we begin this conference call, I need to remind you statements made on this call other than historical facts are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on our current expectations.","Words such as anticipates, estimates, expects, intends, and believes, and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. Please refer to the press release we issued earlier today for a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecasts. ","The forward-looking statements we make today speak as of today and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statement to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today. We will be discussing our results for the quarter primarily on an adjusted non-GAAP basis. We believe that non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of our core ongoing operating results and facilitate consistent comparison of results overtime. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning.","Let me now turn the call over to Jim Cannon, President and CEO of FLIR Systems. Jim?","James Cannon ","Thank you, Jay, and thank you, everyone for joining FLIR second quarter 2018 earnings call. With Jay and me today are Carol Lowe, our CFO; Todd DuChene, our General Counsel; Travis Merrill, President of our Commercial Business Unit; Frank Pennisi, President of our Industrial Business Unit; and David Ray, President of our Government & Defense Business Unit.","The second quarter was another successful quarter from a growth and profitability standpoint. We grew our top-line double-digit organically, meaningfully expanded gross and operating margins, created strong operating leverage down to the bottom-line and improved cash flow generation.","I\u2019ll start the review of the second quarter on slide three of the presentation. This morning we reported second quarter revenue of $453 million, which was an increase of 4% over the second quarter of 2017. When you exclude the second quarter 2017 revenue of the Security business, we divested in early-February, organic top-line growth was 11%. Adjusted gross profit also grew 11%, expanding 330 basis points over the second quarter of 2017.","We also saw adjusted operating income growth of 26%, expanding 390 basis points in comparison to last year. We demonstrated strong leverage, by growing operating income well ahead of revenue growth. Adjusted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.55, which represents 31% growth versus last year\u2019s adjusted earnings per share of $0.42. EPS was favorably impacted by 100 basis point decrease and our effective tax rate in the quarter versus our operating plan expectation. Due to geographical mix of taxable income.","Operating cash flow for the first six months of 2018 increased to $153 million and grew 46% over the same period of 2017, driven by improved profitability and lower working capital levels. Total company 12 month backlog finished the quarter at $596 million, equal to the balance at the end of the first quarter. The team has been deliberately working to lower backlog in certain divisions, utilizing the FLIR Method, particularly in instruments and integrated imaging solutions. ","These efforts are aimed at reducing lead times to more consistently position the division closer to a book and build level. We remain confident in our ability to continue to grow our long cycle backlog.","While we expected first half 2018 growth to be stronger than the second half performance exceeded our expectations. As a result, we are updating our outlook for the full year 2018 results shown at the bottom of slide three. We now expect revenue to be in the range of $1.78 billion to $1.8 billion and full year adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.17 to $2.22.","When you exclude the results of the divested Security business from 2017, these ranges represent organic revenue growth of 7% to 8% and adjusted earnings per share growth of 15% to 18%. This outlook assumes our effective tax rate will be 20.5% through the remainder of 2018. We also announced today a quarterly dividend of $0.16 per share, which will be payable on September 7th to shareholders of record as of August 24th."," Moving to slide four, we launched a host of new products in the quarter, which we\u2019re very excited about. The Commercial Business Unit\u2019s Raymarine business introduced the XL version to its Axiom line of multifunction displays. Designed for premium yachts and glass bridge installations the Axiom XL offers the largest screen size in the Axiom family and the superior performance and simplicity that the award winning Axiom line has delivered since it was introduced last year. ","In May, the Raymarine business also introduced the Magnum high performance open array marine radar, including many of the same radar technologies trusted by the United States Coast Guard. Magnum provides enhanced target tracking, reliable performance and superior image detail packaged in a sleek open array pedestal, built to withstand the harsh marine environment.","Also in May, the Commercial Business Unit Security division launches Saros, FLIR's next generation outdoor security camera line. Saros combines various parameter protection technologies, including multiple Lepton thermal sensors into a unified solution to deliver accurate, actionable alerts and verified alarm data. The Saros camera line represents the new security paradigm for wide area commercial businesses to utilize reliable, state-of-the-art outdoor intrusion detection in a cost effective manner.","In June, the Government & Defense Business Unit announced our latest Nano UAS, or Unmanned Arial System the Black Hornet 3. This third generation of the Black Hornet PRS or Personal Reconnaissance System adds longer range indoor flight capabilities and incorporate sharper image processing featuring our Lepton Thermal Micro Core. At 32 grams, it's still the world's smallest, combat proven Nano-UAS equipping warfighters with immediately actionable intelligence, target acquisition and reconnaissance capability.","The Black Hornet 3 is representative of FLIR\u2019s new focus on providing full solution technology, and we look forward to playing a role and helping modernize our military customers. At the Special Operations Forces Industry Conference, or SOFIC, the Government & Defense Business Unit announced three new products for use by global militaries and government agencies, including border petrol and the dismounted warfighter.","Two additions to our Ranger Family of radars, the R8SS-3D in the R8SS offer mid-range detection capabilities, filling a critical mission gap. The R8SS-3D detects both air and land objects and can report the altitude and location of small drones that ranges of up to 2 miles. Both the R8SS-3D and the R8SS the latter of which offers land detection only can detect over 500 threats and their exact location simultaneously.","The third product announced is the latest in the FLIR Recon series, the Recon V UltraLite. This lightweight thermal monocular weights less than 3 pounds and can be used as a handheld device or mounted to a fixed location for advance surveillance capabilities. These new products demonstrate our commitment to delivering the most advanced equipment to our military customers, our heroes. ","In June, the Industrial Business Unit OEM business announced the availability of a machine learning thermal dataset for development with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems or ADAS, featuring a compilation of more than 10,000 thermal images, it's the first of its kind to include annotations for cars other vehicles, people, bicycles and even dogs.","The machine learning thermal dataset enables automotive researchers and developers to accelerate testing of thermal sensors on self-driving systems. Recent high-profile autonomous driving related accidents show a clear need for affordable intelligent thermal sensors to enable safer autonomous vehicles.","Also in June, the Industrial Business Unit's Instruments division introduced FLIR InSite, a new mobile application and web portal for organizing client information and thermal inspection data in one location. Ideal for electricians, electrical contractors and thermography service professionals, the InSite workflow management tool reduces inspection preparation time, increases efficiency and helps to deliver results quickly. As we move more towards intelligent imaging solutions InSite empowers inspection professionals to deliver a better customer experience and visually demonstrate the value of their services.","Let me now turn the call over to Carol and have her review the second quarter financial and operational highlights. Carol?","Carol Lowe","Thank you, Jim. On slide five you\u2019ll see our second quarter financial results. Please note with the exception of cash flow all of these financials are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the filed appendix. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $453 million a 4% increase year-over-year and 11% on an organic basis.","Geographically and on an organic basis revenue growth in the U.S. was 14%, while Asia was up 22% year-over-year with strength across all business units. Europe and Middle East regions were largely flat compared to the prior year and Canada and Latin America revenues declined by 7% compared to prior year due to expected Government and Defense delivery timing.","Revenue to the U.S. government was 27% of total revenue and increased 8% versus the second quarter of 2017. Adjusted gross margin improved 330 basis points year-over-year to 52%, driven by product mix, new products and the FLIR Method\u2019s impact on sensor yield improvements. ","Overall adjusted gross margin improved across all three business units. It was also our sixth consecutive quarter of gross margin expansion. Second quarter adjusted operating margin was 23% 390 basis points higher than last year, driven by the improved gross margins and controlled operating expenses growth relative to top-line growth. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2018 was up 33% to $77 million and adjusted earnings per share was $0.55, 31% higher than prior year.","Adjusted net income was favorably impacted by a 540 basis points decrease in our expected tax rate versus Q2 of the prior year. This was primarily due to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, as well as a geographical mix shift of our taxable income. We now expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 20.5% for 2018.","Cash flow from operations for the first half of 2018 increased to $153 million, a 46% increase over the same period last year, driven by earnings and improvement in working capital levels. During the first half of the year we repurchased 2 million shares at an average price of $50.52. With these repurchases and $44 million in dividends paid we returned $144 million to shareholders during the first half of 2018. Despite these uses of cash, we increased our cash balance by $56 million during the second quarter to $508 million.","At the business unit level we saw double-digit growth in Industrial and Government & Defense and strong growth across all three of our business units on an organic basis. Business unit level operating margins increased 350 basis points over the second quarter of 2017.","As Jim mentioned, we have revised our guidance for the full year. Revenue expectation is now $1.78 billion to $1.8 billion. And full year adjusted EPS expectation is now $2.17 to $2.22, representing organic revenue growth of 7% to 8% and adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 18% when you exclude the divested security businesses.","This guidance incorporate our first half performance in comparison our operating plan and a lower than expected tax rate. We continue to expect slower growth in the second half than we saw in the first half. And we begin to lap the strong performance in the second half of 2017.","Turning to slide six to review how each of the business units contributed, organic revenue and operating income increased across the board. On the left side of the slide, second quarter revenues for the Industrial Business Unit was $188 million, up 14% from Q2, 2017. Broad product line growth year-over-year drove this increase, with particular strength in optical gas imaging, automotive and industrial UAS.","Operating income for the industrial business was $58 million, 23% higher than the prior year. Operating margin improved 230 basis points year-over-year, mainly due to product mix and productivity gains driven by the FLIR method.","The Government & Defense Business Unit have revenue growth of 11% year-over-year. Deliveries of gimbaled systems for the EO\/IR-FP program, DR-SKO shipments and UAS system helped drive this top-line growth. Government and Defense operating profit increased 19%, compared to the second quarter of 2017. Healthy product mix and controlled operating expense growth resulted in positive operating leverage in the quarter, with operating margin expanding 210 basis points.","During the second quarter, Government and Defense bookings grew 6%, driven by orders for gimbaled systems and handheld recons. While year-over-year backlog declined 12% to $352 million, mainly due to timing of orders and the DR-SKO program our book-to-bill of over one-time for the quarter is a strong indication of our continued focus on winning new programs and executing our growth strategy.","Notably in the quarter, we booked a $2.6 million order for the Black Hornet Nano-UAS system from the U.S. Army for the first phase of the Soldier Borne Systems program, a franchise program for FLIR Government and Defense that continues to cement our worldwide leadership in the Nano-UAS market.","On the right side of slide six is a summary of the Commercial Business Unit. Commercial second quarter revenue was down 17% year-over-year, due to a prior year comparable that included the security businesses that were divested early this year. Excluding the divested revenue from 2017 Commercial second quarter revenues grew 5% over last year. Continued market embrace of the Raymarine Axiom line of multifunction displays was the primary driver of the performance in the second quarter.","As a reminder, the second quarter is the strongest calendar quarter for the maritime division. We also showed revenue growth in both Outdoor and Tactical System and Intelligent Transportation Systems division. Primarily driven by increase thermal product sales.","Operating income for Commercial business increased 12% year-over-year, operating margin improved 430 basis points over the prior year, primarily due to product mix including a prior year comparable that included the previously mentioned lower margin Security businesses, as well as productivity gains driven by the FLIR Method.","As part of our continued effort to fuel, feed and focus our business, we have made the decision to reorganize our Outdoor and Tactical System or OTS division in the Commercial Business Unit. Utilizing the FLIR Method to reduce complexity, strategic initiatives are underway including product portfolio simplification, facility consolidation, channel optimization and shifting the focus of the business, primarily to professional end users, including law enforcement and government agencies.","While this will require a near-term investment, we believe it will yield revenue growth and stronger profitability in the long-term, this will position the business for sustained success.","This concludes my summary of the financials and the business unit. I\u2019ll now pass the call back over to Jim. ","James Cannon ","Thank you, Carol. The quarter was a success on many fronts. We delivered strong organic revenue growth, expanded margins, created solid operating leverage and improved our cash flow generation. This enabled us to raise our full year top and bottom-line guidance. Our performance is a testament to the team\u2019s execution and commitment. But we still see areas where we can improve as a company.","Our working capital turns improved slightly in the quarter, but we have work ahead to achieve our commitment of 4.5 times by 2021. And there are still many opportunities for continuous improvement by leveraging the FLIR Method, as we progress on our journey to become a world-class operating company. With the second half of 2018 already underway, we\u2019re committed to sustaining our momentum to deliver for our customers, employees and shareholders.","I want to thank everyone who attended our Investor Day in New York in May. It was an outstanding turnout and we were thrilled to have the opportunity to communicate our strategic priorities. Our strategic priorities to fuel, feed and focus our business with the FLIR Method as the foundation, as well as our financial objectives for the coming years. We\u2019re certainly enthusiastic of what\u2019s ahead for our company.","In closing, I want to remind everyone of our daily tasks to consistently exceed our commitments with integrity and our purpose, which is to innovate the world\u2019s six sense in order to save lives and livelihood. We operate with our be FLIR values to be brave, be bold, be ready and be ambitious. These values are center of the FLIR Method and they drive speed, innovation, integrity and a winning culture.","I\u2019ll now open up the call for Q&A. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question is coming from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Noah Poponak","Hey, good morning, everyone. ","James Cannon ","Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak","Jim, I wanted to follow-on the free cash flow and sort of the comments you made just in your closing remarks there, where you indicated that you had sort of started to get some working capital improvement, but maybe a long way to go on that. Because the free cash in the quarter is really strong, I mean, if I just annualize that quarter that would your 2021 target. And your 2021 target looks to imply only kind of 3% to 4% growth in the free cash flow dollars annually from here to there depending on where you are in this year. And so maybe give us -- put a little more color around why it was so good in the quarter? And then, I know you just gave the number, but how you\u2019re feeling about that 400 given that it actually kind of looks a little light relative to where you\u2019re trending there?","James Cannon","Well, we\u2019re certainly going to work hard not stop at 400 if we can exceed that number, but I would say in the quarter and in the first half really driven by the increased profitability. We\u2019re not seeing yet the kind of improvements that we want to see through the FLIR Method in working capital. So we really had very modest improvements in working capital turns in the first half and certainly in the quarter, but beginning to make some momentum. Lot of room as we talked about at the Investor Day with our inventory levels not arbitrage between AR and AP.","But though the work that we\u2019re doing with the FLIR Method is really not manifested itself there. So really the performance in the first half is driven by the increased profitability. Carol, you have anything to add?","Carol Lowe","Jim I agree 100%, Noah, I will note that as you start to focus on working capital you usually will identify a few areas of some low hanging fruit and especially on our receivables as we focused on some past few balances. Again as we\u2019ve discussed before or not because there was risk from a bad debt exposure, but just the discipline around it the teams did a good job at going after some of those past dues and reducing the percentage there. So we benefited in addition to the strong profitability for the quarter, getting the benefits of some of that low hanging fruit.","And going forward, we know the challenges get tougher especially as we focus on improvements in our inventory turns. ","Noah Poponak","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then, Carol, can you quantify how much Lorex revenue comes out in 2018 versus 2017, just like in square up the organic versus the reported for the year?","Carol Lowe","So the total revenue for the divested Security businesses was approximately $140 million in 2017 and there\u2019s only -- there\u2019s about $9 million that made up Q1 of 2018 and we divested of the business in early February 2018.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Drew Lipke with Stephens. Your line is now live. ","Drew Lipke","Yes, good morning Jim, Carol. Thanks for taking the question.","James Cannon","Morning, Drew.","Drew Lipke","So you called out strength in automotive and industrial and you also highlighted industrial UAS, I think, this is the first time I can recall auto being a driver here. And I know these are you franchise opportunities for you and it sounds like maybe this would be more material contributors maybe sooner than expected. I'm curious how material were each of these and how quickly should we expect that growth to ramp for both of these franchise opportunities?","James Cannon","Well, as we\u2019ve discussed at Investor Day ADAS is a key area of focus for us not just with thermal sensors, but also with our Intelligent Transportation Systems business working on infrastructure smart and connected infrastructure, through technologies like V2X to be able to communicate to the vehicles to see oncoming threats as well. We\u2019ve done a lot of work to put more business development effort and commercial effort behind that ADAS team and there\u2019s much more to come.","While the results are beginning to manifest themselves certainly not to where we aspire them to be quite yet, you mentioned the Industrial UAS business that\u2019s something that from albeit at a small base we saw a lot of growth from that small base in the quarter where it is beginning to indicate that we\u2019re having good success developing that market. And that\u2019s not just sensors that we\u2019re selling to other UAS manufacturers it\u2019s complete solutions that we\u2019re providing to first responders for example fire fighters or search and rescue personnel. But Frank is here the President of the Industrial Business Unit. Frank do you want to add some commentary?","Frank Pennisi","Sure, in the short-term in the automotive category because of the fact we\u2019re the only auto qualified sensor we\u2019re in 500,000 cars today that gives us a scale advantage that allows us to get into more and more price points. So consequently, we can grow in the existing automotive market as well as get us qualified to get into the ADAS market. We reorganized our team to be able to do so. Because it\u2019s the check of its ability to see the rain and fog and shadows and sun glare four times further than headlights.","It\u2019s also wanted to more affordable ones. It's allowed us to put out analytics, it's allowed us to complement the V2X solution in ITS. And it allows the target not only the tier 1s, and the OEMs, but also the commercial taxies, commercial trucking and autonomous military prospects as well. Those are going well, we're seeing good progress with our reorganized team, we're raising our awareness, we're investing in that throughout the remainder of the year.","And as you're well aware, the ADAS opportunity in the class 4 and 5 fully autonomous type vehicles aren\u2019t really going to start materialize until 2021, 2022, 2023, but we're making sure that we're going to be a part of that when it happens.","Drew Lipke","That's helpful. And then maybe follow-up for Carol, you have this $87 million net cash position now. You stepped up repurchase activity to some degree. How should we think about the cash build and the optimal capital structure here in light of both acquisition opportunities in the pipeline today and just share repurchases as we go forward.","Carol Lowe","Drew, as we stated before, we'll continue to be opportunistic as it relates to the share buyback, the primary focus is definitely around the M&A. We continue to have a pretty robust pipeline and are always looking at different opportunity and studying them. And so that's where the focus will be. The other thing to note that a meaningful portion of that cash actually sits outside of the U.S. And we always want to be -- make sure we're very efficient in how we repatriate those dollars to make sure they're also left in regions where we believe we have M&A opportunities.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Your line is now live. ","Michael Ciarmoli","Hey, good morning guys, thanks for taking the question and nice quarter. Carol, maybe just on the guidance. And I get it on the tougher year-over-year comps 2017 versus 2018, but even the high end of the guidance, I mean, it only implies about 1% growth second half versus first half. I mean are there any indications that these growth trends you're seeing in all of the business segments either change or slow or is there -- was there just a roll-off of some of the government strength in the back half of the year that we should know about. Just trying to understand why there is so much deceleration from first half to second half. It doesn't seem like you guys would lose any momentum here.","Carol Lowe","Okay. So -- and Jim is going to have more color on this, I'll give a few numbers as a reference point. And then he can add more color from a business perspective. But just as a reminder, we can't lose in spite of the fact that for the Security businesses that were divested, I referenced earlier to Noah\u2019s question the $140 million for the full year 2017, but it's important to note that 65% approximately of that businesses generated revenues actually fell in the second half of 2017. So that present somewhat of a headwind.","We talked about the fact that our maritime business is -- it does have more seasonality than the other businesses and the second quarter and the first half it is much stronger than in the second half of the year. Also the DR-SKO, while the numbers for the full year 2017 compared to 2018 should be very comparable. There is a shift in terms of how it's earned throughout the year, with the second half of 2018 falling below what was delivered in 2017. So those are some big impacts from a pure number standpoint. And Jim, if you had other color you'd like to add about just the business outlook in total.","James Cannon ","Yes, I think that's a good summary certainly on the revenue comparable to prior year. A couple of other things in the second half as we go into it that I want to highlight. And Carol mentioned in her prepared remarks is the OTS reorganization. So we're taking a pretty bold move a part of our strategy to fuel, feed, focus a part of focusing the business is the reorganization of the OTS business, shifting to government law enforcement, other government agencies, facility consolidation cost associated with that. We also have a bit of tariff related inflation that's beginning to creep into the business in maritime and instruments components, while not significant in the second quarter, there\u2019s a bit uncertainty in the second half.","And then the other two are investments that we\u2019re making in our compliance programs to make sure that we\u2019re 110% moving quickly to adhere to the consent agreement. And fuel these strategic investments we talked about, one of the primary ones being ADAS as we mentioned a bit earlier. So all of those things in sort of concert is what we have baked into our considerations for the second half.","Michael Ciarmoli","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then just last one maybe for David. I would have thought the defense bookings perhaps might have been higher on a sequential basis; maybe can you give us some color on what\u2019s happening from the DOD perspective, now that the budgets in place are you seeing any -- that short cycle contracting velocity pick up or sort of what\u2019s the pipeline look like here?","David Ray","So, let me just state for the current quarter, I am really excited about the team hitting the greater than 1.0 book-to-bill. I think that\u2019s a leading indicator and predictable backlog growth. And so the team has really -- as part of our strategy really looking to drive consistency in that 1.0 book-to-bill throughout this quarter and future quarters. I think the budget is firming up for 2019, I think it\u2019s a good thing for us, when you look at the modernization account. More so from the standpoint of assurance that these franchise programs on our modernization and readiness that we\u2019re pursuing as part of our franchise efforts are stable and in place and we\u2019re expecting those proposals Q4 and Q1 of next year.","Our goal this year is to continue to be predictable around 1.0 a better book-to-bill. I think that drive predictability in our backlog growth and then wining most franchise programs continue to drive at the higher rates as we move into the year. But today where I am sitting with respect to Q2, our ability to hit our 1.0 book-to-bill or better and our ability to hit that on a successive level is really going to be key to driving that backlog and driving that predictability around bookings.","James Cannon ","And I\u2019ll just add as we mentioned at Investor Day, a lot of the franchise programs that we\u2019re targeting are late 2019, 2020, 2021 programs. In the meanwhile as DR-SKO comes to a close towards the back half for this year, we\u2019re really pleased to see that for the first time in a long time, DOD will have a budget before the end of the fiscal year and those $69 billion of overseas contingency operations fund in that budget. So we\u2019re going to compete hard to make sure we can bring the best solutions to our DOD customers as they face ever evolving and growing threats.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Asher Carey from Robert. W. Baird. Your line is now live. ","Asher Carey ","Hey, good morning guys, thanks for taking my call. ","James Cannon ","Good morning, Asher. ","Asher Carey","I wanted to ask about machine vision in your near-term opportunities to gain scale there. You have mentioned that M&A pursuits are still priority, but there are also some headwinds in the space, can you provide some more color around the opportunities that you\u2019re seeing there? Are there more Point Grey type deals are these niche technology type transactions?","James Cannon ","That\u2019s a great question, machine vision is the particular interest for our Industrial Business Unit and the Point Grey acquisition now remained our IIS business, you know at FLIR we love Acronyms, has done fabulously since acquisition, last year in particular its organic growth was tremendous, fueled by mobile and smartphone production and launches.","To the point that we got to a backlog that we really couldn\u2019t sustain we had to reduce. I mentioned earlier, two businesses in particular IIS and Instruments, we leverage the FLIR Method to reduce lead times, try to get backlogs back where we are that book-to-bill business. Now that said, even with a really tough comparable to prior year, our IIS business is growing organically this year.","So while we have seen some other competitors in that space have flattish growth because the comp again is so strong, our businesses is continuing to grow and benefiting from the lead time reductions that we\u2019ve had.","We are acquisitive in that area and we\u2019re looking for opportunities, it\u2019s a very fragmented market space in some cases, with a lot of regional players involved as well. But you can expect to see us continue to be very active, looking for more Point Grey like targets to consolidate the market space. ","Asher Carey","Great, thanks Jim. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham and Company. Your line is now live.","James Ricchiuti","Thank you. Good morning. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the FLIR Method. And whether you can give us some sense as to where you're might be seeing some of the more significant early benefits to margins in the three segments with respect to the initial implementation. ","James Cannon ","I could talk the rest of the day about the FLIR Method. It's something I'm really excited about. And I\u2019m most excited because of the effect that its having in our various teams. The folks in our factories, in our distribution and supply chain that actually do the work every day to get things done.","There has been various efforts launched across the company and the FLIR Method has six components. But the first component we\u2019re really focusing on is introducing lean manufacturing and lean practices to drive productivity and lead time reduction. We committed to 150 basis points improvement, 50% reduction lead time and a 10.5 improvement that we want to attributable to the FLIR Method over the horizon of the strategic plan that we communicated at the Investor Day.","In the quarter, can I point to a big movement because of the FLIR Method in margin? Hard to put your finger right on it, but for example yesterday, we're hearing Bill Rick [ph] went down to the shop floor to look at the result of some [indiscernible] events that the teams have been driving. And they're significantly reducing lead times and driving velocity, starting closest to the customer and working backwards. So it's got that pull effect as we do it overtime.","Probably the most notable example and we mentioned it I believe at Investor Day and perhaps on our earlier call I've referenced it earlier is with the growth that we had at IIS we just couldn't meet the demand and we created this backlog that created some customer dissatisfaction. And we went into one camera line in particular that was producing between 500 and 700 cameras and we've almost now more than doubled that output. Without having to add any sort of capital or incremental resources.","So we're still early days, but it's taking these little wins these base hits and turning the little numbers into big numbers, that I believe as we exit 2018, we enter into 2019 will give us carryover to begin to really get some momentum. Because the company that we are today won't be the company that wins three years from now. As we've mentioned, we've got to move from sensors to sensing to intelligent sensing that means new muscles around artificial intelligence, machine learning and ADAS, et cetera, et cetera and those take investments.","And the FLIR Method is critical to drive margin improvement so we can self-fund those investments in the business. But it's something again I'm really excited about and I\u2019m most excited because I talk to folks in the business. And the empowerment it gives them to own their workspace and make improvement is contagious.","James Ricchiuti","Thanks. And if I may one final question, I'm still a little surprised to see you talk about the growth, the organic growth in the IIS business and the Point Grey business. And just in light of the weakness in the smartphone market. Can you say where that growth is coming from?","James Cannon ","Well, I mean, certainly the smartphone market is not comping itself. It's coming from a whole host of different machine automation, industrial automation outside of just smartphone production. There is a lot of move to automate various manufacturing processes for quality control, et cetera, or as production moves back into higher cost countries, automation is how many of our customers remain competitive.","So we\u2019ve seen kind of the growth, I can't point perhaps to one place, but just in general around the trend for more automation and the need for machine vision. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Louie DiPalma from William Blair. Your line is now live. ","Louie DiPalma","Hi, good morning. Carol, at the Analyst Day, you discussed your 2021 goal for the operating margin to expand to 23%. And this quarter you nearly reached that mark. With your growth initiatives for ADAS, machine vision and the defense franchise programs, should we still expect FLIR's research and development expense to remain in the 10% of revenue range, or are you planning for R&D as a percentage of revenue to trend higher over the next several years?","Carol Lowe","So, thank you, Louie. And we\u2019re not really planning on that amount to trend higher, as we have talked about the $180 million that\u2019s been invested in total from an R&D engineering perspective. If you look historically and the fact that prior to this year we were generating around 2% growth in most years, we don\u2019t consider that a good return on investment for the dollars that have been spent.","So, it\u2019s really more about how those dollars are going to be allocated, as we go forward to make sure we can move faster on the opportunities that will generate the highest return as well as continuing to support and maintain the strong technologies and solutions that have us at the point where FLIR today as a very strong market leader in all the markets that we serve and support.","Louie DiPalma","Okay. And on a different topic for Jim, in January FLIR announced the partnership with NVIDIA and Intel as part of the ADAS software development kit. And I was wondering how that partnership and the interest in the development kit has progressed. And also on the call, you mentioned that the different ADAS opportunities probably won\u2019t be material until 2021, 2022 or 2023. And I was wondering in terms of a timeline when do you think like OEM vendor selection will take place for ADAS?","James Cannon ","That\u2019s a great question. And some of that I wish I knew the answer to. There is obviously white hot interest in that space, when there\u2019s going to be big Tier 1 selections and decision on technology is a hard thing to predict. But if I backup a bit, the automotive developers\u2019 tool kit, the work that I mentioned earlier with machine learning that we offer to researchers and automotive developers with annotation to note various objects from pedestrians, to dogs, to bicycles, et cetera all of that is to help continue develop awareness around thermal sensors that we think are one of many technologies that need to be incorporated to really get to the level of autonomy that the automotive manufacturers are striving to do. ","I will say, I think that developments in commercial trucking and unman military applications may develop themselves in the market quicker. There is a heavy emphasis on unmanned applications, unmanned ground combat vehicles, obviously we know that one of the biggest threats that our warfighters have faced have been IEDs as they move along roads and if that\u2019s done with unmanned vehicles there is obviously a great opportunity to save lives in that regard. You also don\u2019t have the concerns that you do about operating in a city where you have a lot of vehicles that aren\u2019t communicating or pedestrians et cetera.","So, not able to answer definitively when, the big automotive OEMs are going to make decisions in selection criteria, but we are putting a lot of effort in to providing education for those researchers and developers. Because again we do believe we know thermo is a compelling technology to have offered there. And as we talked about earlier we\u2019re also building out our business development commercial capabilities around that effort as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital. Your line is now live.","Jeffrey Kessler","Thank you for taking my call, good to talk to you folks again.","James Cannon","Good morning. ","Jeffrey Kessler","Hi. At the last couple of large trade shows that we attended, at the beginning it was fairly high scenario, you have obviously -- you have got on your website development of the dual Lepton core Saros camera and off shoots of it, which can play both in the Security world and I know you talked a little bit about this, but also it can play in the -- you want to call the safe cities and it can play in the world that\u2019s developing in the larger state cities programs, which are springing up. ","I am wondering if you could comment about the technology behind getting two sensors, again two sensors in getting a much higher definition for a sensor in the same price in these cameras and where and what goal -- what verticals and what goal niches inside of these verticals you can sell this into because from a take technology point of view it sounds great where is the market for this?","James Cannon","Absolutely, we\u2019re really excited about the launch of Saros and if I back up from a broader perspective and you mentioned it we\u2019re excited with the amount of collaboration that\u2019s happening between our Security teams, our intelligent transportation teams and our machine vision teams others as well. But we\u2019re seeing for example now from our Government and Defense radar businesses technologies that can come into intelligent smart and connected cities for ITS. As I referenced earlier ITS that that smart connected traffic management business that we\u2019ve got also has synergies with ADAS, with V2X and certainly with Security as you mentioned. ","Our team work very hard to be able to incorporate the dual Lepton sensors as the trigger initiators, the key detectors for the Saros camera. And when you think about false alarming and verified responses, I mean, they can be programmed so that small movements aren\u2019t setting off the sensor that other motion activator to the technologies would have will know it\u2019s a person. That illuminate LEDs begin to roll and collect video to have that verified response.","And as you state there\u2019s a wide range of markets that we\u2019re going after. Certainly outdoor parameter security, commercial applications where they have wide area surveillance it could be an equipment yard, could be critical infrastructure, airports, water treatment facilities, power plants, there\u2019s a whole host.","I'm going to put one on my back door, so again the market opportunity is really abound with what we can do. And I\u2019ll say while our teams have worked hard for a long time we\u2019re really now starting to see the technology roadmaps and the commercial efforts begin to coalesce between our smart safe city team, between for example the government defense radars business, ITS and our core security market. But we\u2019re really proud of that Saros product and stand by for more to come.","Jeffrey Kessler","And just to follow-up to that realizing that it is a different sensor, but for the last couple of years the Boson has been a big part of the growth, are there -- are you able to essentially stratify the way you put these sensors into various product lines so that you can start -- so you can offer the end-user an array of technology depending on what they need. In other words giving the end-users whether they\u2019d be commercial or agencies of government more choice or are you going to be primarily focused on Saros for these types of programs?","James Cannon","No we\u2019re going to very much offer choices to customers. Needs that they have that might be bespoke or unique we\u2019ve got a range of different camera cores to satisfy those requirements. So we\u2019re absolutely going to remain focused on what\u2019s the right product for the right solution for that customer need. Boson as you know is really ramping in production now, we\u2019re really again proud of that product as well, but never satisfied. We\u2019re going to always continue to push SWaP-C in our uncooled thermal camera cores.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Sullivan from Seaport Global. Your line is now live.","Josh Sullivan","Hey, good morning Jim, Carol. Nice quarter you here. ","James Cannon","Morning, Josh. Thank you.","Josh Sullivan","The ADAS machine learning effort FLIR InSite web portal, two efforts you highlighted with software needs. You feel FLIR\u2019s internal software assets are robust enough at this point do you need to bolster those. I think you mentioned some self-funding for those programs or can you get to where you need to go with some of these joint ventures you\u2019re doing?","James Cannon","Yes, well, I mean you essentially gave the answer there. It\u2019s a bit of both, we certainly have right now our own organic capabilities and we\u2019re investing in more. When we think about the talent that we\u2019ve got to have as we go forward certain areas have to evolve. We\u2019re over strength in some places under in others. So as we move forward we\u2019ll make organic investments to build out our software AI machine learning capability in competences.","But that takes a lot of time, to go out recruit, retain all those things, so as you know we\u2019ve augmented that with these minority investments we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve made a handful so far again there are companies that we may never own, but we want to invest in. And we want to partner with them to get really unique technologies. And in all of the cases that we've done so far that's exactly the kind of talent that we've partner with.","Companies that have robust software and AI capabilities so that we can rapidly develop our technology roadmap, but at the same time organically these are skills that we have to have in long-term. So we're making those investments now to create the conditions to attract the very best talent that we can in that regard.","Josh Sullivan","Okay. And then, I mean, you had some product launches this quarter, which now look like they're beginning to reflect your efforts for a more integrated FLIR profile. How should we think of the product refreshes kind of across the portfolios, portfolio Recon V as well as the industrial portfolio? Should we see an accelerated product churn over the next 12 months? Just how you're thinking about that?","James Cannon ","So I don't think I would say you\u2019d see an accelerated product churn. Frankly, when it comes to product, a lot of what I've told the team is we want to do less better. We want to understand the real needs of our customer with the example of InSite. That's a perfect example of where you've got electrical contractors, electricians, it's app and a web portal that really helps them organize their work, communicate to their customers better. It's moving from sensors to sensing again to intelligent sensing solutions.","So as we move forward, I don't know if you\u2019ll see an acceleration, but we certainly intend for you to see products that we're bringing to market where we're working hard upfront on the user need and solving a real mission requirement that they have across all of our business units.","Josh Sullivan","Okay, thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. We've reached end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.","James Cannon ","Again, I want to thank all of you for joining our call today. As always, I especially want to thank the over 3,500 FLIR team members across the globe for their continued passion and dedication to our task and purpose. I look forward to speaking with all of you again soon. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time.

Andy?","Andy Teich - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Wit and thank you for joining us this morning for FLIR\u2019s first quarter 2014 earnings call. With me on the call today is our CFO, Tony Trunzo; our COO, Tom Surran; our Chief of Product Strategy, Jeff Frank; and our new Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill.","This morning we reported first quarter revenue of $352 million and earnings per share of $0.21. Excluding one-time charges, Q1 earnings were $0.25 per share. Revenue increased 1% versus the first quarter of 2013. We saw nearly double-digit growth in our commercial end markets. Margins were in line with our expectations for the quarter. Operating cash flow of $60 million during the quarter was again well ahead of our net income. The success of new products including our EX series thermography camera, the K-series firefighter camera, and the NV-3 automotive camera help drive over 50% growth in the number of thermal imaging products shipped versus Q1 of 2013.","The launch of our Lepton microthermal camera core, the introduction of several new products that will incorporate the significantly lower cost core and other new products we have announced recently are anticipated to drive our unit volumes higher in the near-term. As you know, unit volume is a very important factor in our strategy to lower cost and is integral to our mission to become the world\u2019s sixth sense. These first of these Lepton based products is the FLIR ONE thermal imager accessory for iPhone 5 and iPhone 5S. We are targeting making FLIR ONE available later this quarter and we have seen a notable increase in the awareness of both thermal imaging and of the FLIR brand since our introduction of the products at CES in January.","We have strategy to broaden our market reach by entering more consumer oriented spaces as we bring the prices of thermal technology to levels that are affordable to everyone. A part of that strategy involves investing in our marketing and this month we hired a Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill who will head up our global marketing and branding initiatives. Travis was previously Head of Marketing for the U.S. Samsung tablet business and we welcome his insight and leadership as we navigate the many new opportunities that are arising. Additionally, we added two new members to our Board of Directors during the quarter. Kathy Halligan brings broad experience in e-commerce marketing and Kathy Stauffer adds significant consumer electronics retail product marketing knowledge to our brand, to our board.","Our realignment activity continued in the first quarter, as we closed a facility in France, relocated several assets to existing locations and reduced staff in certain locations. As a result of this work, we have removed our divisional structure and re-segmented the company. As mentioned last quarter, there are now six segments that are better aligned to our growth, go to market and product development strategies. Based on our Q1 results and our current view of the business, we are maintaining our outlook for the full year 2014. We continued to expect revenues of between $1.45 billion and $1.55 billion for the full year and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.40 to $1.50 excluding expenses related to restructuring actions. We continued to expect the second half of the year will drive much of our growth in 2014 as improved product mix and the realization of our realignment initiatives help to drive better margins.","I will now hand the call over to Tony to review the first quarter financial results. Tony?","Tony Trunzo - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Andy. The following discussion of Q1 results excludes restructuring and other one-time costs totaling $8.4 million. Of this amount $7.8 million is reflected in a line item titled restructuring and an additional $600,000 is contained in the cost of goods sold line. First quarter consolidated revenue was $351.5 million, an increase of 1% compared to the first quarter of 2013, primarily due to strength in our Instruments, OEM & Emerging and Maritime segments. Consolidated gross margin of 48.1% was below last year, but in line with our expectations for the quarter. As we indicated in the February call revenue mix in Q1 was skewed towards lower margin product lines resulting in the margin contraction.","Segment operating expenses were well controlled during the quarter falling just over 1% compared to last year, while corporate expenses were up by $4.4 million due to higher costs associated with several litigation matters. During the quarter we resolved two of these matters, which should reduce our legal costs going forward. Surveillance segment revenue of $117.2 million was essentially flat compared to last year and above our expectations for the quarter. As anticipated gross margins were affected by deliveries under two large lower margin programs, we expect margins in this segment to trend upward throughout the remainder of the year. The Instruments segment performed well during the quarter as good unit growth and strong reception to new products led to a 7% increase in revenue. Gross margin remained strong but when combined with essentially flat segment operating expenses resulted in a very good 20% increase in segment operating income to $24 million.","OEM & Emerging saw a good sales growth during the quarter as well. The gross margins were negatively impacted by the inclusion of our Optical Components Group which was acquired in August of last year. Operating expenses increased due to higher R&D spending related to the development of FLIT ONE and Lepton which combined to create a 19% drop in segment operating profit to $11.9 million. Securities segment revenue was down 1% compared to Q1 of last year. Lower volumes of high end thermal cameras negatively affected gross margin, which combined with increased marketing and engineering investments led to a $2.7 million decline in operating income to $1.7 million. We anticipate improved thermal camera volumes and better margins from this segment going forward.","Our Maritime segment which now includes FLIR branded maritime thermal imaging line as well as the traditional Raymarine business posted a 4% increase in revenue and a 7% increase in operating income. Both the FLIR and Raymarine brands businesses formed well. The Detection segment swung to an operating loss of $1.2 million in Q1 as sales dropped due to the conclusion of the DRC program which contributed substantial revenue in Q1 of last year.","Bookings, however, were very strong and backlog stands at a record level. On a consolidated basis bookings were strong during the quarter as we saw a 5% increase in 12-month backlog to $514 million. Also on a consolidated basis international revenue growth with 7% for the quarter will U.S. government revenue declined by 8%. As a result international revenue accounted for 54% of the consolidated total in Q1, up from 50.9% of revenue last year.","Total sales to U.S. government were 20.4% of the total in Q1, down from 22.3% revenue in the first quarter of 2013. Cash flow from operations including the impact of restructuring was $59.8 million for the quarter representing 200% of net income. During the quarter we have returned $14.1 million to shareholders through dividends and an additional $1.8 million through share repurchase. We ended the quarter with cash on hand of $584 million providing ample liquidity to capitalize on strategic opportunities as we more throughout the year. Also of note, we have reduced net inventory and accounts receivables by a total of $87 million or 13% over the past 12 months. This is a good progress, but there is more to do and we expect continued improvements in working capital going forward.","As Andy indicated, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for revenue and earnings per share excluding certain restructuring and one-time items. For the full year 2014, we currently expect revenue to be in the range of $1.45 billion to $1.55 billion and earnings per share excluding restructuring and one-time items to be in the range of $1.40 to $1.50. Restructuring costs in Q1 of $8.4 million were in line with our expectation. We will continue to see restructuring costs in the next few periods associated with decisions made in 2013 that could not be reserved for at that time. We anticipate additional restructuring costs to be approximately $3 million in Q2 and then decline rapidly in the second half of the year. Today, we also announced our regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share, which will be payable on June 6 to shareholders of record as of May 20.","That concludes the summary of our first quarter financial results. I will now pass the call over to Tom Surran to cover the segment operating highlights.","Tom Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks, Tony. Total bookings in the quarter increased 13% over the prior year. However, the associated delivery of the significant portion of the products, were outside the quarter resulting in Q1 revenue being flat with the prior year. While there was improved revenue growth in many of our commercial end markets, it was offset by continued weakness in the government-funded markets.","Geographically, we saw the EMEA region grow revenues 21% versus Q1 of 2013 primarily due to growth in the surveillance segment. We also saw meaningful growth in the EMEA region in our instrument and maritime segment. Americas and APAC were down 5% and 15% respectively with the Americas being impacted by reduced revenue to government funded customers.","Sales of lower margin product in the surveillance segment and companywide restructuring charges were key drivers to a 6.5 percentage point decline in total segment operating margin. The restructuring charges amounted to $8.4 million as we continued to execute our previously announced realignment plan during the first quarter. Investments that we believe will show significant long-term efficiency and cost improvements.","Revenue in the surveillance segment which now includes the non-severity products of integrated segment declined 1% for the pro forma first quarter for 2013. Growth in the surveillance land product line was offset by reduced shipments of surveillance maritime products as well as less service revenue. There was a significant drop in the gross margin percentage for this segment as a result of two large low margin programs being shipped during the quarter, which in turn negatively affected segment operating profit. Also impacting operating profitability was $4.1 million of restructuring charges in the segment.","Notable bookings in Q1 included a major order for our Middle East for various security and border protection products including $30 million to the surveillance segment versus Star SAFIRE III HDC airborne gimbals and MVSS integrated vehicles, which is the international variant of the MSC truck we have sold to the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Southern Border program. U.S. Navy ordered $18 million worth of our BRITE Star systems for their Fire Scout unmanned helicopter program. Additionally, we booked two orders totaling $16 million for III HD gimbals to two international customers.","Revenue in the instrument segment which represents our thermography and test and measurement product lines was up 7% versus the first quarter of 2013. All regions had healthy growth led by APAC of 13%. Our EX series performed very well and set a thermography product record for units shipped in the quarter. K-series firefighting cameras continued to gain traction in the first responder market contributed meaningfully to the top line growth in the quarter.","Our automation line of business grew nearly 30% due to our continued improvement of this product line. Combined, these successes drove 37% year-over-year increase in instruments total unit volumes and a 3 percentage point increase in segment operating margins, excluding the restructuring charges recorded this year.","The OEM and Emerging segment grew revenues 7% over the first quarter of last year, with the APAC region nearly tripling revenue from the prior year. Our automotive product line continued to perform well with year-over-year revenue growth of 40%. Uncool thermal camera cores grew nearly 40% while the PVS line of business grew 12%. This growth was partially offset by declines in our high end cooled camera cores as military OEM markets remain challenging.","Volume growth in the OEM products were strong, up nearly 80% over the prior year. Operating margin declined 22% from 29% in the prior year due to the inclusion of relatively low margin micro-optics components business that we acquired last summer as well as increased product development costs associated with new products, including the Lepton camera core and the FLIR ONE product Andy spoke about earlier. The Security segment which includes our commercial thermal security systems, our visible security systems and our Lorex consumer security systems recorded a 1% decline in revenue versus the prior year.","All three of the regions were relatively stable in comparison to last year. Lorex revenue was up 25% versus Q1 of 2013 and our FLIR branded visible systems grew over 20%. Adding FLIR branded visible camera system to our security products suite has proven to be significant with integrators and distributors embracing the quality and innovation FLIR has introduced into the market segment. Security operating margins declined due to the introduction of NVR bundles to the professional market. At the ISC West Security Show in Las Vegas earlier in this month, we introduced 30 new security products in our thermal and visible camera lens, significantly broadening our offering.","We showed a mini bullet thermal camera which utilizes our new thermal Lepton thermal core and will break a new price barrier in the industry with its $499 price point. We expect this product to open up the benefits of thermal imaging to a whole new base of commercial customers. Also shown at ISC was our new Pro series full-size thermal (bullet) cameras. Later this year we will be bringing integrated analytics to the market as well as megapixel product offering. The Maritime business saw revenue growth 4% compared to the first quarter 2013. Sales of multifunction displays were the primary driver of the growth and Dragonfly was a key contributor.","Maritime\u2019s EMEA region continues to perform well with 10% year-over-year growth it will be economic concern from the area appeared to be easing. Maritime operating margins increased slightly compared to Q1 of 2013 as unit volume improvements positively impacted gross margins. Detection segment first quarter revenue decline 33% versus the prior year, which has been adjusted to include (indiscernible) related products that used to accounted for under the integrated systems segment. The year-over-year decrease was primarily the result of wind down of the domestic response capability or DRC program which had significant deliveries in Q1 2013. The lack of DRC deliveries and $600,000 of restructuring charges contributed to Detection having a negative operating margin in the quarter.","From a bookings perspective Detection had a very strong first quarter with orders of over 70% versus the prior year. The driver of this growth was an $18 million reduction in development order for our Dismounted Recovery Sets Kits and Outfits known as DR SKO and formally known as J2. This direct response system provide an integrated (indiscernible) detection, identification, sample collection, testing and personal safety kits for all branches of the U.S. military, National Guard, and civilian support teams. Perhaps more importantly we also received full rate production decision from the Department of Defense for the DR SKO program that has a significant five year procurement plan in the President\u2019s 2015 budget proposal.","In addition, we received the first $2.8 million booking associated with the blade program for the development of institute chemical threat neutralization using foams. That concludes my summary of the segments first quarter.","I will now pass to call back to Andy.","Andy Teich - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks Tom. Our first quarter results were in line with our expectations and while we see positive signs in many of our market we remain cautious about the government markets. Overall, however, we continued to anticipate sequential improvements throughout the year. It\u2019s now been nearly a year since I became CEO. During that time we reduced costs, re-segmented and realigned the business for better operating efficiency added necessary new talent to the management team and created several new product categories which will drive revenue growth.","The product portfolio we are able to offer is unique and powerful as demonstrated by the recent major order from the Middle East customer that Tom mentioned earlier. This order totaled $50 million and contained content from five of our six segments. This order would not have been possible without this broad product suite and the seamless coordination of our various businesses. Our ability to identify, innovate, execute and invest in value-creating opportunities has led us to an unprecedented point in our history. Our CDMQ model is unique in the worldwide government markets and we intend to leverage that differentiator further with new products that will give our customers mission-ready capability at a fraction of the costs they are accustomed to.","We have introduced and continued to develop new products across our existing lines of business that will enable in existing customers to benefit from our technology and solutions in more ways than they have in the past. And with the launch of Lepton and the products it will enable, the opportunity to offer infrared everywhere and become the world\u2019s sixth sense is closer than it has ever been.","Last, I would like to thank our employees who have not only fully supported me and the rest of the management team through the transition period, but also for facilitating the seamless transition that has taken place as we have realigned the business. They too see the tremendous opportunity ahead of us and have strongly embraced our vision for growth.","That concludes our comments on the first quarter. We will now open up the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning everyone.","Andy Teich","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","At the Investor Day, you guys had some good hard data on FLIR ONE demand and interest metrics thus far and I think specifically from CES, any ability to update us on how those numbers have progressed? I don\u2019t know if you have the specific numbers or if you can talk about pace of acceleration or deceleration there?","Andy Teich","Sure, Noah. So it\u2019s actually quite encouraging, the inquiry level on the product and the sort of related demand that it\u2019s been generating has continued to grow which is actually a little bit surprising given that we have the PR coverage of it obviously dropped off after CES and then we will pickup again after we launch the product. I am going to pass it over to Jeff who can talk about some of the numbers that we have been seeing in both pre-registrations and product developer requests.","Jeff Frank","Hi, Noah. I think when we were at the last conference we were talking about numbers that have come in from the sales side of this thing. For the pre-registration, I should say that we are on the order of 6 I think what was the number again?","Andy Teich","I knew it was in the high-teens.","Jeff Frank","Yes, 16.","Andy Teich","16K, 17K.","Jeff Frank","I think we are over 2,000 on those numbers now.","Andy Teich","No, those are\u2026.","Jeff Frank","Well, I am sorry, yes, it\u2019s not going the developer stuff. So we had like 1,600 developers that were signed up in 1,600 level, I think that\u2019s over 2,000 now. And at pre-registration, I think we are over 30,000. So those numbers continue to grow dramatically. We are really \u2013 the response from the developer side has been really most interesting to us. We would be releasing our software developer kits and in our screening those interest of developers for a few that will be act as beta testers before we have a broad release of the SDK. We are really excited we are opening up this third-party, because we are quite sure we are going to see tremendous innovation there.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. I appreciate that color. And then just as a follow-up, on the surveillance margin, if I add back the restructuring that fell there, I guess it was in the low 20% and it looks like \u2013 or I know you are citing the two low-margin programs you had there. So, just wondering if you can help us with the pace at which you expect that to pick up and before the resegmentation you guys had discussed kind of a medium to long run right margin there. I just wondered if you could maybe update us on your thoughts on that?","Tony Trunzo","Yes. So, Noah, it\u2019s Tony. You are right your calculation is right, I think it was without pulling out, it was 20.4%.","Andy Teich","20.9%","Tony Trunzo","20.9%, yes for the quarter excluding the charges. We will see improvement in that business going forward. We spent a fair bit of time this week looking at the gross margin profile, because that\u2019s really where we have seen some fairly meaningful shift. Our BRITE Star product has lower margins than our Star HD line and we have seen a pretty significant delivery bolus if you will in Q1 of BRITE Stars that mix shift should begin to normalize a little bit. And then as Tom mentioned we have some shipments on an international order that were materially lower margins that we typically see in that case the products that we are shipping is a relatively old product and the replacement product that will be coming into the market later this year not only it is a better product but it should have meaningfully better margins as well. I think from a spending standpoint that business is well controlled as it typically has been. This is all really at the gross margin line.","And when you really break it down and you look at the product level gross margins and the mix shift dynamics you can pretty clearly see given the context of our backlog but we should see a reasonably good recovery in the second part of the year. I wouldn\u2019t tell you that we see visibility to that business getting back into the 30 point margin range in the next few quarter. I still think over the longer term that\u2019s a reasonable objective, but when we look at the content of the backlog and the current outlook I don\u2019t think that\u2019s likely nor was it expected to get back to that level in our outlook for the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Hi, good morning guys. I want to I guess focus on a couple of question on FLIR ONE, the first is I am just interested in the progress you have made and your thoughts on distribution channels for FLIR ONE as you get closer to the rollout day?","Andy Teich","Yes, Pete, so this is Andy. We are working distribution partners on two fronts, one on the master distributor side and two on the retail side. And both of those are progressing very nicely. We are at a phase right now we can\u2019t talk about who they are but safe to say that when the product is complete from a production testing and certification place. We are confident that we are going to have meaningful retail channels in place. We are also going to be opening up an ecommerce portal for the product on the flir.com website so people can buy it direct from the company as well.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Okay so when rollout actually happens like on that day there will be multiple channels?","Andy Teich","It will actually be \u2013 there won\u2019t be day one. On day one it will be ecommerce only direct through the FLIR channel and then shortly thereafter retail channels will come online.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Okay, okay, got it. I guess just a follow-up, I have heard some questions from people about the prospects for inventory obsolescence on the FLIR ONE and so far as Apple tends to turnover it\u2019s iPhone models fairly frequently have you guys kind of thought about the financial risk to you if you have the FLIR ONE come out there and that Apple changes models and maybe that the model that FLIR ONE is available for isn\u2019t the hot smartphone anymore?","Andy Teich","Sure, well certainly something that\u2019s on our radar screen and it\u2019s an issue that we will have to deal with in terms of our production planning. I mean the reality is that that anybody who is making an accessory for Apple products deals with this problem. And the switchover doesn\u2019t happen as fast as you might think because people they do continues to sell the previous model and will act quickly to respond to what the new hardware is that\u2019s come out in the market.","Tony Trunzo","Pete, it\u2019s Tony, a couple of things I think I heard embedded in your question a concern about inventory build and some obsolescence there that\u2019s not going to be an issue. I mean the obviously the Lepton cores going into that product we are building up some Lepton cores but they are at a pretty generic level and we don\u2019t have an obsolescence issue there. In respect to the other components given the volumes that we are expecting and the cost of those components I don\u2019t think you are going to see anything significant. The other \u2013 the under the worst of circumstance I don\u2019t think you will see anything significant. The other thing to bear in mind is we have had conversations with other folks who sell similar products to this. And you have to keep in mind the installed base of these products in addition to where they are in their own product cycle. And the unit volumes that we are anticipating for FLIR ONE relative to the installed base of the iPhone 5 and 5S is so trivial that I think we can expect that we will see even if you do see an accelerated introduction of new products that installed base continues to live pretty long time. People tend to keep those products for a fairly long period of time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Tim Quillin with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Quillin - Stephens","Hey, good morning. So excluding the restructuring charges, I think operating expenses were about $118 million in the first quarter, does it stay at that level or does it go notably down after you fully implement the restructuring charge or just maybe how \u2013 maybe help us understand how we should think about timing and magnitude of benefits from the restructuring charge?","Andy Teich","You should \u2013 I am not sure how to define notably, Tim. If you look at Q1, if you break it into the corporate piece and the segment piece, segment OpEx was actually down a little bit from Q1 of last year. So in that respect we are in pretty good shape. We will certainly see benefits associated with Q \u2013 with the restructuring for the second half of the year. Not sure I want to tell you that, that\u2019s going to ultimately for that second hall of the year drive segment OpEx down, but it will certainly mitigate any increase. With respect to corporate, the increase in corporate spending is really what drove the delta in total OpEx for the quarter. And that was almost entirely driven by legal. I mentioned that we have settled a couple of cases in Q1 that should help fairly meaningfully going forward. We have also entered into some agreements that I think will mitigate the ongoing cost of some other litigation that we have, but you will see corporate expenses be meaningfully higher than that they were last year. And you can see the data on that when we file our Qs. You can see our corporate expenses broken out separately in the other line. So you will get a little bit of visibility to what\u2019s happening at the segment level on OpEx versus at the corporate level.","Tim Quillin - Stephens","Okay. And then with FLIR ONE what \u2013 and you alluded to them, but what are the exact steps that need to happen before that can be available for sale? And then how should we think about the timing of the next new products that utilize the new Lepton core and what is kind of generally the tempo of new product introductions that you are hoping for over the next couple of years? Thank you.","Jeff Frank","Hi, Tim. This is Jeff. I will take that one. We are still working within our original plan to have FLIR ONE in customers\u2019 hands in the second quarter as Andy mentioned in his opening statement. Right now, design is looking solid. Our contract manufacturing partner is gearing up quite nicely in Asia. We are working to complete compliance testing under Apples made for iPhone program requirements. Other than that, the hardware \u2013 other than the hardware or the MX app that goes along with this thing will be available for free on Apple Store is now feature-complete. That\u2019s in the hands where beta testers are also working hard to get a few other useful apps done before release. Probably the long pole in that tent is relates to the MFI testing process that we have to go through with Apple.","Andy Teich","Tim, you also asked about, what\u2019s the follow-on product cadence look like for Lepton-enabled products and we have launched the first of a series of products that will be Lepton-based products that will come out in 2014. Tom talked about that in his prepared remarks and that\u2019s product called the mini bullet, which is a $499 thermal camera in a weatherized enclosure designed for security applications that\u2019s both analog and IP connectivity. And we have several other products that will get launched later in the year in the various segments of the business. So we are pretty excited about the prospect that those products bring to the market because they will create new categories of product and I don\u2019t think present cannibalization risks to the existing business.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Yes, good morning everyone. My question, Andy, I guess is maybe on the security market, down 1%. It sounds like all three regions were stable. Just curious to see why we aren\u2019t seeing maybe a broader uptake, given I think their general view is that the infrared adoption within the security market continues to be very attractive. And just you have launched 30 new products, I am just curious to get a little more color on that?","Andy Teich","Sure, Peter. If you look inside the data actually both Lorex and FLIR brand that professional grade visible cameras did very well during the quarter. So the mission that we have set out to accomplish of Lorex and the conversion of Lorex\u2019s program under the FLIR brand is executing well and a acuminating with the launch of thee 30 products that we launched at ISC West to round out the line. So we are in good shape on that side of it. The other side of the business is the thermal side of the business and there is two dynamics going on there. Number one is that business is just lumpy, it\u2019s just a reality of that business and I think we will see that as the data comes in throughout the year that we are going to see ups and downs in that business related to some major infrastructure programs that we are working on.","The second thing is that we have augmented the thermal side of the business with lower cost products both on the Lepton base side, which I spoke about a moment ago and then also for our higher resolution QVGA and VGA thermal products. And we expect the new price points and IP connectivity feature set that comes from those new products will drive higher adoption rates. In general I am feeling very good about the security business going forward.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Okay. And if I would sneak one in on Lepton just related to that, Andy you talked a lot about the Investor Day that long-term on the OEM channels is really going to be an attractive area for Lepton, it\u2019s been four months since you launched it how are those discussions going and any color you could provide would be great ?","Andy Teich","It\u2019s going well as I mentioned during the Investor Day that we expect that the adoption cycle is going to have a fairly long time related to it that it takes 9 to 12 months for somebody to integrate a product into end solution. With that said, the number of requests that are coming in to our OEM team for lepton are really high and we are in a mode of really filtering those to go after what we feel are the highest value add and long-term potential once. We have already received our first major order during the quarter for a Lepton customer it\u2019s going into a UAV and we will be shipping units into that \u2013 into Q2. So we think that the promise there is good but I think the really high volume applications there we are going to have longer gestation period because we are dealing with people that have not historically dealt with normal cameras and need to do product integration and some market evaluation.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Got it. Thank you, Andy ","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is coming from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Company","Thanks. Good morning. Question just with respect to the government business in Q2, last year I believe it was a reasonably good quarter as it related to the rest of the year, how much of the headwind do you have with that comparison just in the context of your bookings and your backlog right now for Q2, how should we think about your government business in Q2?","Andy Teich","Well, the comps for the government business get easier quarter-on-quarter as we move through each year obviously Jim. We are going to \u2013 we have got \u2013 we are doing okay on the backlog front bookings held up reasonably well in Q1. I think we feel pretty good about where it\u2019s going to play out over the next couple of quarters. The \u2013 it\u2019s more in the second half of the year where the comps get meaningfully easier Q2 of last year was a reasonably good quarter as well. So from this I don\u2019t want to necessarily get into how that specific business is going to perform in Q2 versus last year, but it\u2019s more towards the second half of the year where you will start to see things improve meaningfully both in terms \u2013 primarily really there in terms of margins but also in terms of revenue.","Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Company","Okay. And then just I will switch gears a little bit on the Maritime business it looks like you are seeing some signs of strength there the amount of strength that looks like the end markets are improving, can you talk a little bit about that business and perhaps how we should think about it in the current quarter only because I think seasonally this is normally a good quarter for that businesses?","Andy Teich","Yes, the Q1 and Q2 are the strong quarter that it tappers off Q3 is the low and Q4 is starting to be the bounce back. As you can imagine it\u2019s outdoor activity and therefore that\u2019s where that seasonality is. Q2 will be a strong quarter and in terms of the business overall we are happy with the progress we are seeing and you will look across the product lines we have seen strength in the MFDs, but it\u2019s in other associated or attached product. We are seeing strength in the auto pilots with the new evolution. We\u2019re seeing strength in our sonar or fish lining and sonar products with the introduction of DownVision and our CHIRP technologies. So it\u2019s pretty broad that we\u2019re seeing a nice uptake. Now that market doesn\u2019t move in rapid swings, there is a slower adoption cycle but I would say the trend is a deposit for us, we\u2019re happy with it.","Jeff Frank","The other thing I would mention Jim is that thermal continues to do very well in the maritime space. FLIR-branded thermal product had very strong bookings in Q1 and it was against a relatively easier comp from last year, the comp was up in Q2. But the business continues to do well and we still like the adoption curve that we\u2019re seeing on the thermal side of the house.","Tony Trunzo","Jim, its Tony. I think our operator maybe in the process of moving on to the next caller. But I wanted to put a little finer point, I went back and look well Andy and Tom was speaking. Last year Q2 was the strongest revenue quarter of the four in the surveillance business. And that\u2019s an unusual level of \u2013 that\u2019s an unusual seasonal trend typically Q4 is the strongest quarter and I think what\u2019s included in our outlook for the year is that we returned to that more normal season is the strongest quarter and you don\u2019t see the highest revenue in Q2. So I just wanted to make sure that we\u2019re \u2013 I was a little clear on that point.","Jim Ricchiuti - Needham & Company","Got it. Thanks, Tony.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Hey, good morning, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Andy or Tony kind of a big picture question. It seems like you guys are getting substantial unit growth in a lot of your product lines. You\u2019re getting the adoption. But the financials are still being dictated by your high-end products and I\u2019m just trying to understand is as you guys morph more into a lower end consumer-oriented more price competitive marketplace, how are you thinking about this financial model as it evolves? What sort of things are you planning on for pricing pressure; we mentioned the obsolescence issues that came up already on this call. I don\u2019t know if it happens or not but you get this FLIR ONE into the Chinese market; I\u2019m sure knockoffs are going to happen. So I mean can you talk to me about how you guys are planning strategically for changes to your sort of just kind of financials as this transition evolves?","Andy Teich","Sure, Michael. Well one issue is that the volume products that we\u2019ve launched to-date and that we have in the product pipeline support very good gross margin. So at this point this really isn\u2019t an issue for us. I think that the thing that we go to navigate through is how we support the higher level of spending on the marketing front. The \u2013 I think it will be quite sometime before someone is capable of knocking off of FLIR ONE type product as the technology is fairly unique there and the Lepton core took quite a long time to develop and has a very significant amount of intellectual property in it. So I think that we\u2019re going to have quite some runway ahead of us with those products.","The other thing that I\u2019ll mention is one of the key pillars of our strategy that we outlined during the Investor Call is that Control the Corners concept. And that means that we\u2019re going to continue to be active in the very high-end market, that\u2019s not a space that we\u2019re walking away from by any stretch of the imagination, in fact we continue to make significant investments there right from the read-out integrated circuit and detector level right up through the system level. And we\u2019ll have product launches in the coming months in that upper corner as well. So I think that blended model of having both the high-end product and low-end product is a good platform for which we can maintain the kind of finance model that we\u2019ve had.","Michael Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets","What do you have to do to educate your customers not to make that trade down to lower end products, I mean as they see more compelling, richer features, what do you do I mean inevitably customers are probably especially corporate customers looking to cut costs and if they can do the same or more with less, how do you attack that strategy?","Andy Teich","There is two issues. First is the segmentation is to appropriately segment our products both from product feature positioning and application point solution capability with our products. And that\u2019s something that I think that we\u2019ve been pretty good at and it\u2019s something that we\u2019re focusing on more so going forward. So you\u2019ll see more products that are specifically targeted at specific markets. And within those have a value ladder that we\u2019re capable of up-selling too. We\u2019ve seen in this market a very good ability to up-sell the products that particularly in the industrial markets when people buy a low-end product to become a thermographer, it\u2019s fairly common that they over time budget for higher end capabilities, they find this technology works well and they want more capability is the one that they\u2019re using.","Michael Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, okay, fair enough. Last one, I think you mentioned APAC down 15%. I didn\u2019t know if that was units or revenues and if you could just give us some color as to what\u2019s happening there?","Andy Teich","APAC down 15%.","Tony Trunzo","In total.","Andy Teich","Yes, that was revenue, yes.","Tony Trunzo","That was consolidated.","Andy Teich","Yes.","Tony Trunzo","","Yes, yes. Mike we can give you a little bit of follow-up on that. There were some puts and takes in APAC in terms of each segment and what happened there. I don\u2019t have that right in my fingertips, but.","Michael Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay.","Tony Trunzo","","The consolidated minus 15 masks some shifts and some in \u2013 at the segment level that there were ups and downs.","Michael Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Okay, okay. We follow-up. Thanks. Thanks guys.","Andy Teich","It\u2019s a pleasure.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair","Hey guys. This one is for Travis. I just wanted to understand what you see as some of the opportunities and challenges relative to extending FLIR\u2019s brand into the consumer markets?","Travis Merrill","Sure. Good morning. Take what I\u2019d say with the caveat that I\u2019ve only been here for about three weeks. But it\u2019s very apparent that there are opportunities in a few key areas. The first one is really extending that strength that exist today in some of FLIR\u2019s more traditional markets to the consumer market by bringing the brand to life in a new way, right by leveraging some of those core elements. And I think those two distinct groups of markets are becoming more blurred anyway and having a more robust brand strategy in general of raising the awareness, focusing on the preference of the brand can really help them feed off the strengths of one another.","Secondly I think it\u2019s really around continuing to develop and horn new channel capabilities particularly those that are more consumer-centric and really understanding that new customer\u2019s needs through both research as well as robust CRM activities. And then finally I think you\u2019re really connecting with those new customers directly and potential customer\u2019s enthusiast to the technology via social media, via a friendlier FLIR.com to ultimately try to create new FLIR customers and create customers for the life.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair","Got it. And just in terms of the high-end cores market and some of the high-end ThermoVision business. I know this has been an area that\u2019s slowed for a little while at this point. Can you maybe give us a sense of what\u2019s happening there and what could maybe cause stabilization or improvement in terms of maybe the higher end products over the next couple of quarters?","Andy Teich","Jonathan, are we talking specifically about cores or more broadly than that?","Jonathan Ho - William Blair","So, I think with the change in the segment, it\u2019s going to be both the cores as well as the high-end ThermoVision products?","Andy Teich","The cores and instruments.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair","That\u2019s right.","Andy Teich","So Jonathan there are a couple of things there. On the high-end cores businesses is sort of largely driven by a couple of our major military OEM customers and that business also tends to be a bit lumpy, but we\u2019ve got a pretty good outlook on that for the rest of the year and it looks pretty solid. And I think the bigger question there probably in the some of the higher end cores are what happens with some of the export markets. That\u2019s an area where it could tend to be a little bit more volatile giving current political than some terms, things are going on in Russia and so forth if we see any restriction in terms of exportability in the markets like that.","Relative to the instruments business, high-end product manifestation there is what we call the science segment. That segment was slow in Q1. It\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s largely driven by capital spending, it\u2019s a business that also tends to be a bit lumpy. So that\u2019s one that we\u2019re going to watch closely here in the second quarter and as we move into the second half. The product, the prospect pipeline there looks good. It\u2019s just getting our customers to release funding to authorize procurements there. And then the last piece you mentioned is this ThermoVision I think there you\u2019re talking about products like our HRC product that are used in long-range surveillance programs or patrol kind of activity.","That product continues to do well. We\u2019ve launched a high-definition version of it also recently. Again a business that can be lumpy at times, but we find that we have a very strong competitive advantage in that market and we\u2019ve got a good business development team that are pursuing a pipeline that looks pretty good right now. So again it\u2019s just going to be conversion of that pipeline and some orders.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Saliq Khan with Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital","Hi, good afternoon. I\u2019ll be speaking on behalf of Jeff Kessler. I believe that you guys may have already answered this question, but I\u2019ll ask anyways. Could you give us the update on Lorex from a perspective of DIY along with the commercial business particularly as we\u2019re looking at the Digimerge subsidiary?","Andy Teich","So, two things there, Saliq. The business did well in Q1. Tom talked about the increases in revenues there, I think was low 20s.","Tom Surran","20%.","Andy Teich","Yes, low 20s for Lorex and high-teens for the professional brand under the FLIR brand, so both of those segments did well during the quarter. I think that\u2019s going to be further bolstered by the product introductions that we\u2019ve mentioned, we introduced 30 new products at ISC West. Many of those were focused at the FLIR professional brand both on the visible and thermal side. So having a broader product offering having megapixel cameras, having cameras with IP connectivity or all going to enable growth in that market.","We also launched under both the Lorex and FLIR Pro brand, a new technology that we call MPX which is \u2013 gives you the ability to have high-definition cameras connected via conventional coax cables and it also allows you to transmit to a audio and pan-tilt-zoom control signals over single coax wire. That opens up a nice upgrade market for us as many of the home and small business markets already have wiring installed in the walls and to analog coax wire and this gives you fundamentally the ability to move to the capabilities of the digital system using existing analog cable.","Saliq Khan - Imperial Capital","Great, thank you for that. Actually what you answered my follow-up question as well so thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up question coming from the line of Tim Quillin with Stephens. Please proceed with your question.","Tim Quillin - Stephens","Hi, thank you for taking my follow-up. Just a couple, three quick hitters. But one, what is the \u2013 Jeff could you share the government fiscal year 2015 funding for DR SKO? And what\u2019s your general expectations are for revenue? And then if you \u2013 maybe you did, but if you can talk about surveillance book to bill? And then lastly in terms of guidance and I know you don\u2019t like to give quarterly guidance, but should we think about EPS comparisons being positive in 2Q or not? Thank you.","Andy Teich","I\u2019ll answer the last question. Well actually let me come back to the last question. I just want to do a couple of things with some numbers here before I answer that piece.","Jeff Frank","Yes, I don\u2019t have a firm number on DR SKO funding for FY \u201815 at this point. I know that we think it can be in the $20 million to $30 million range, but we\u2019ve got some gap between what we understand is going to be in the President\u2019s budget more to customer expectation is, so we\u2019ll have to.","Andy Teich","Grabbed the transition. They\u2019ve ordered as many as they could under the low rate initial production and therefore as we migrate to full rate production that order has been released is a fairly large volume and it\u2019s over about an eight year timeframe. So the amount of orders that will be placed in the timing of those over that is still the open issue.","Jeff Frank","Right.","Tony Trunzo","Tim, without giving quarterly guidance we\u2019re plus or minus \u2013 we\u2019re going to be a lot closer in Q2 to last year than we were in Q1, hey that we\u2019re going to get over the hurdle to growth in Q2 but we\u2019re going to be a lot closer than we were in Q1.","Tim Quillin - Stephens","Okay. That\u2019s fair. And then the surveillance book to bill?","Tony Trunzo","I don\u2019t have that right in my fingertips.","Andy Teich","Last question.","Tony Trunzo","No, it\u2019s Q1.","Andy Teich","Book to bill, the number was, right.","Tony Trunzo","Well it was 1.01.","Tim Quillin - Stephens","Okay, over one.","Tony Trunzo","It was over one.","Andy Teich","Yes, yes.","Tim Quillin - Stephens","Alright. Thank you very much.","Tony Trunzo","Well operator while you\u2019re queuing up the next question I have an answer for Mike Ciarmoli for the \u2013 your inquiry about APAC by segment. That 15% decline that Tom mentioned from a dollar standpoint it was more than all made up from surveillance. Instrumental is up a little bit, OEM and maritime were up a good bit, they were very strong, security and detection were down a little bit, but they are small dollars because of the squeezing of those markets to the U.S. and to the Americas and EMEA. Hardly enough there is a good chance that you\u2019ll use a flip in surveillance in Q2 from where they were in Q1, so it\u2019s really just lumpiness in the surveillance business in terms of deliveries into Asia that accounted for that profit. Systemically the commercial businesses are staying perfectly good, if not better than good performance in Asia.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please proceed with your question.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Hey guys, I just wanted to ask on sort of the preorders for the FLIR ONE continuing to rise pretty nicely in advance of the introduction. I mean are you guys starting to think that maybe actual orders for this year are going to be maybe well above what your initial expectations were and if they are, can you actually deliver in the timeframe that you\u2019d like?","Andy Teich","I\u2019ll answer the second question first. I think that we\u2019re not going to be production constrained on this unless we have a much higher response than we\u2019re thinking about and I think we\u2019ll have a production constraint issue. We\u2019re producing Lepton\u2019s that reasonable volume at this point and the assembly line for FLIR ONE is coming up to schedule. Going back to the first question that you asked Pete it\u2019s really a function of two things. Number one is what kind of conversion rate do we get out of these pre-registrations. We have some anecdotal data on that because we did the same thing with the ThermoSight RS which is the \u2013 it\u2019s a thermal weapon sight for recreational non-game hunters that we launched.","And so we have some data in terms of an understanding of the kind of conversion rate that we saw in that because we did a preregistration situation there as well. But we are not sure how that\u2019s going to convert to more of a consumer curiosity oriented product like the FLIR ONE. So at this point I wish I could give you a better answer than that, but we\u2019ll really have to see how things play out and what kind of interest we get from the second wave of PR that will come once we start shipping the units.","Jeff Frank","It\u2019s probably we\u2019re saying that based on the pre-registration we have, we haven\u2019t changed our business model internally based on that.","Andy Teich","That\u2019s correct.","Pete Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton","Thanks guys.","Andy Teich","We\u2019ll take one more question, operator?","Operator","Thank you. Our final question is a follow-up question coming from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Yes. Thank you. Tony, I couldn\u2019t let you get away without talking about capital deployment activities given that your cash flow continues to be very impressive in reducing inventories. How are you thinking about just in general the plan for this year as cash continues to build?","Tony Trunzo","Well the M&A market is interesting right now. Obviously pricing is a bit of a challenge, you\u2019re seeing valuations be pretty strong. But I would say that we\u2019re also seeing a few interesting targets out there, so I think that absent a compelling opportunity to deploy cash back to shareholders, I think we want to keep some powder dry because we do see some opportunities moving forward over the next couple of quarters. Having said that we\u2019re going to continue to approach capital deployment as a mix of returning capital to shareholders doing M&A and CapEx. And you will see an uptake in CapEx as we move through this year as we build out our facility in Santa Barbara. We acquired the facility there a couple of years ago and the tenants are finally moving out and we\u2019re in a position to consolidate our operations there. So you\u2019ll see an uptake in CapEx. All that said, I would ask maybe to have a little bit of patience with respect to cash building as we hopefully are successful in continuing to improve the working capital and generating strong cash flow, because we do think that there maybe some opportunities over the next few quarters to effectively deploy it. Love to see an opportunity to put that to work from an M&A perspective, while also making sure that we are attentive to shareholder needs, but at this point, we are just going to have to see what \u2013 where the market breaks. In Q1, we looked reasonably hard at one particular transaction and we did pass at least partly, because it didn\u2019t strategically pan out, but also partly because the price that the seller was looking for was higher than we thought was reasonable. So we are going to be disciplined in terms of pricing, but we do see some opportunities to potentially do M&A. And under that circumstance, we are going to probably be a little more cautious in terms of share repurchase.","Peter Arment - Sterne Agee","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Andy Teich","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Teich for any additional concluding comments.","Andy Teich - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, thank you everyone for joining us this morning. As I had mentioned earlier, the quarter executed very much in line with what we planned. We saw nice strong bookings in the quarter, particularly in our commercial sectors and we probably get a little bit more work to do on the expense side and we will see that improve as the efforts of our restructuring manifest themselves later in the year. We are very focused on executing on the new product development plans that we have in place to FLIR ONE and new Lepton enabled products and we very much look forward to getting those products launched and seeing how they perform in the market. And last I would like to welcome Travis to the management team and Kathy Stauffer and Kathy Halligan to our Board of Directors and all three of these individuals really bolster us from a management capability in terms of building knowledge in area that we are headed into which will require more marketing intelligence and brand building capability. So with that, I will thank you all and say goodbye.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s teleconference.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce you to your host, Todd DuChene, General Counsel. Please go ahead, sir.","Todd M. DuChene - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Please note that our earnings press release and presentation slides referred to on this call are available under the Events & Presentations section of www.flir.com\/investor.","Before we begin this conference call, I need to remind you that statements made on this call, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on our current expectation.","Words such as anticipate, estimate, expects, intends and believes and similar words and expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements.

We believe that non-GAAP information is useful because it can enhance the understanding of our core ongoing operating results and facilitate consistent comparison of results over time. A full reconciliation between GAAP and adjusted measures is in our press release this morning.","Let me now turn the call over to Jim Cannon, President and Chief Executive Officer of FLIR Systems. Jim?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Todd, and thank you all for joining us for FLIR's second quarter 2017 earnings call. With Todd and me today is our CFO, Amit Singhi; our COO, Tom Surran; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and SVP of Corporate Development and Investor Relations, Shane Harrison.","Overall, I'd say the second quarter was a sound quarter for full year. Our backlog, our revenue, adjusted gross margin, op margin, net income and EPS were all up year-over-year. I'll start with a review of the second quarter on slide 3 of the presentation.","This morning, we reported second quarter revenues of $434 million, which was an increase of 8% over the second quarter of 2016. Our commercial products revenue grew 12% over the prior year and our government products revenue grew 3%, with the addition of our recently acquired businesses that drove most of this growth.","Our organic revenues in Q2 were flat to slightly up on a constant currency basis. Surveillance, Instruments and OEM & Emerging segments, each grew over 8% organically; however, that growth was offset by declines in Security and Detection which we'll detail later in the presentation.","Adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income grew 15% and 16% respectively in comparison to the prior year, and adjusted earnings per share for the quarter of $0.42 which represents 14% growth versus last year's adjusted EPS of $0.37.","The total company 12-month backlog finished the quarter at $645 million, that's up $37 million or 6% over the end of the first quarter. And total bookings in the quarter were the highest we've seen since the fourth quarter of 2015. We also launched a host of new products in Q2 which we're really excited about, many have already made a nice impact on the marketplace, which Tom will detail as he discusses our performance by segment.","If you look on slide 4, you'll see our outlook for 2017. We continue to expect full year 2017 revenues to be in the range of $1.78 billion to $1.83 billion and adjusted EPS to be in a range of a $1.81 to $1.91. This assumes organic revenue growth in addition to the growth associated with our recently acquired businesses. We also announced today a quarterly dividend, quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share which will be payable on September 8, to shareholders of record as of August 25.","I'll now ask Amit, to review our second quarter financial results. Amit?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Jim. Good morning. On slide 5, you'll see our second quarter financial results. Please note all of these financials are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliation to GAAP data is included in the slide appendix. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $434 million, an 8% increase compared to the second quarter of 2016. Exchange rate changes negatively affected revenue growth by about 70 basis points.","Excluding the results of acquisitions made in the last 12 months and adjusted for exchange rate changes, year-over-year revenue increased by $2 million or about 0.5 percentage point. Furthermore, excluding the decline in the Security segment, organic revenue growth at constant currency was about 5%.","Revenue from the OEM & Emerging, Surveillance and Instruments segments grew 53%, 14% and 10% respectively. Maritime segment was about flat, and Detection and Security segments declined by 25% and 22% respectively.","Geographically, revenue increased across all regions except the U.S. which was flat. Sales to the U.S. government increased versus last year by 12% to about $112 million, representing about 26% of total revenue. Consolidated second quarter adjusted gross margin was 49%, about 290 basis points higher than last year.","Year-over-year, recent acquisitions contributed 40 basis points and segment mix changes contributed 70 basis points to the increase. This was partially offset by a 30 basis point negative impact from foreign exchange rate changes. Overall, adjusted gross margin improved across all segments except Instruments, which was flat.","Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 19%, about 130 basis points higher than last year, driven by the increase in gross margin. Our adjusted tax rate for the quarter and estimate for the full year remains at 25%. Adjusted net income for the second quarter of 2017 totaled $58.4 million and adjusted EPS was $0.42, both 14% higher than prior year.","Quarterly cash flow from operations was 52% of adjusted net income or $30 million, which was $58 million lower than prior year. First half operating cash flow was 97% of adjusted net income due to strong first quarter performance. Second quarter operating cash flow was negatively affected by higher accounts receivables and inventories, as well as exchange rate changes on the translation of our cash flows and timing of tax payments.","In the second quarter, our accounts receivables were up due to increased revenue both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year, revenue calendarization in the quarter and slippage of some collections. Inventories were up due to new product introductions and timing of shipments. However, our cash conversion cycle improved sequentially and year-over-year.","Some items slipped out of the second quarter which we expect to realize in the second half, thereby delivering operating cash flow at over a 100% of adjusted net income for the year, as I've mentioned in our first quarter call. We did not have any acquisition-related outflows in the quarter nor did we repurchase any shares.","Our capital expenditures for the quarter were $10 million, slightly lower than last year. During the quarter, we returned $20.6 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. $4 million higher than prior year as a result of our 25% year-over-year dividend per share increase announced earlier this year. We closed the second quarter with cash of $404 million. This concludes the summary of our financial results.","Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran, to cover our operational highlights. Tom?","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you, Amit. On slide six, you will see a summary of the second quarter results by segments. We saw a strong year-over-year growth from the OEM & Emerging, Surveillance and Instruments segments in the quarter. Growth in the segment level operating income was 18%, which outpaced revenue growth due to improved gross margins and controlled operating expenses.","Moving to slide seven to cover the Surveillance segment. Second quarter revenue for the Surveillance was $129.2 million, up 14% from the second quarter of 2016. Airborne, weapon sights and land products were particularly strong compared to the prior year, and the addition of the OTS and UAS businesses added inorganic revenue growth.","Operating income for the Surveillance segment was $33 million, up 24% versus the prior year primarily due to product mix. Surveillance booking growth of 24% quarter-over-quarter resulted in Surveillance segment backlog growth of $7 million during the quarter, to $327 million. Good order flow from Europe and Middle East customers helped generate a Surveillance book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 in the second quarter.","On slide eight is a summary of our Instruments segment. Revenue of $86 million was an increase of 10% over the second quarter of 2016. Strength in premium handheld plant predictive maintenance cameras and gas imaging cameras drove this increase. Our new mid-range Exx and our high-end T1K cameras helped drive premium PPM product growth of 18% over last year. Backlog for Instruments increased 15% during the quarter from broad bookings activity across many of the Instruments' product lines.","Instruments' operating profit in the second quarter increased 20% from the second quarter of 2016 to $23.6 million or 27% of revenue. The revenue growth on operating expenses that were held nearly flat to the prior year, helped improve Instrument's operating margin, 230 basis points versus 2016.","In May, Instruments launched the new T500-Series of premium thermography handheld cameras featuring advanced ergonomics, distinguished thermal image quality and auto-calibrating interchangeable lenses. This new product augments our premium PPM product line and sits between the new Exx-Series and the T600-Series.","The Security segment's results are summarized on slide nine. Security's revenue of $49.7 million was down 22% compared to last year's second quarter. This decline was largely due to continued softness in the retail channel for visible security systems. Delivery push-outs of approximately $4.5 million negatively impacted Lorex's results. These orders for new product rollouts including a 4K Ultra HD bundle and a wire-free camera system, make us optimistic about the Lorex business in Q3.","Security's thermal imaging business had year-over-year growth in the low-teens, which partially offset the decline in the retail business. Security operating income was down $3.1 million year-over-year due to the soft top line and despite improved gross margins from product mix.","This month, Lorex introduced two new product lines for the consumer and small business customer. First is the lineup of 4K IP camera bundles that feature 8-megapixel cameras and advanced video compression technology. These systems have approximately four times the number of pixels as their traditional 1080p HD camera, enabling better image zoom and improved identification of objects.","Also introduced in July was Lorex's first wire-free camera system. This bundle includes battery-powered HD cameras, advanced motion detection, a wireless DVR receiver, and cloud-based viewing and storage of video.","The results for the OEM & Emerging segment are shown on slide 10. OEM & Emerging second quarter revenue was $87.4 million, increasing 53% over last year and reaching another all-time high for the segment. The acquired Integrated Imaging Solutions line of business was a significant driver of this growth, while the organic business also increased double digits with strength in the cooled military camera cores, Lepton cores, and Intelligent Traffic Systems.","During the quarter, we commenced shipments of the third-generation FLIR ONE and the FLIR ONE Pro Thermal Imaging accessories for mobile phones. OEM & Emerging operating profit also reached an all-time quarterly high of $26.3 million, with an operating margin of 30%. Product mix helped drive higher gross margins versus the prior year. And order backlog in the OEM & Emerging segment increased 13% during the second quarter to $159 million.","Turning to slide 11. Maritime segment revenues were $55.1 million, essentially flat versus the prior year. Shipments of our recently introduced Axiom multifunction display drove MFD revenue growth of 16% year-over-year. Maritime operating income was $9.4 million in the quarter or 17% of revenue, up 340 basis points from the prior year. This was primarily the result of the new Axiom products providing higher gross margins and operating expenses being held largely flat with the prior year.","Since last quarter, Maritime has expanded the Axiom line of multifunction displays with the introduction of the Axiom Pro. The Axiom Pro was designed for the serious offshore boater and professional captains by adding a HybridTouch interface to be able to operate the system at all sea conditions and a more powerful CHIRP sonar for superior deep water performance.","The Maritime segment also introduced the M500 thermal imager to the boating market. The M500 is a multi-sensor camera system featuring a cooled thermal sensor with a 14x optical zoom lens for greater long-range imaging as well as an HD visible camera, gyro-stabilization, video tracking, and radar integration.","Our Detection segment's results are summarized on slide 12. Detection's second quarter revenue was down 25% year-over-year to $26.7 million. Timing of deliveries under our DR-SKO program explains the decline, which was partially offset by strong shipments of our radiation products. Operating margin was down year-over-year from 29% last year to 26% this year, as a result of lower revenue on the operating expense base.","Detection finished the second quarter with $86 million of backlog, increasing $12 million from the end of Q1, due primarily to a large order from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office for our R300 compact spectroscopic personal radiation detector.","In the second quarter, Detection introduced the Griffin 510 Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer for using chemical hazard identification. This new man-portable chemical analysis equipment provides the first responders, lab-quality, in-field analysis of solid, liquid and vapor threats.","That concludes my summary of the second quarter. I'll now pass the call back to Jim.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Tom. The second quarter was encouraging from many perspectives. We saw meaningful margin improvement sequentially in year-over-year and our orders were strong. Our recent acquisitions fueled top line growth of 8%, which flowed nicely down to adjusting earnings per share which grew 14%.","As we entered the second half, we were focused upon holding these gains while driving organic growth. I'd sum it up by saying that I'm proud of the team, but not satisfied, as we have a lot of opportunity ahead of us.","Starting the third quarter with the largest backlog since 2008, leaves us well-positioned for a strong second half. I also want to take this opportunity to thank Amit; thank Amit for his contributions to FLIR. As you're aware, he announced his departure in order to be closer to his family. Over the past several weeks, Amit's worked with the team to ensure a very deliberate handover. Shane will serve as our Interim CFO, while we undergo a search for Amit's successor.","And let me close by expressing how excited and humbled I am to serve as the CEO of FLIR Systems. Having been an end user of FLIR technologies throughout the course of my career, as a soldier, as a manufacturer and security integrator, I know firsthand the distinct advantage that our products provide in the marketplace.","I've spent the past month on the road visiting with our teams and it's the pride, professionalism and talent of our people that has me most impressed. As I visit with our teams, my message has been focused around a simple task and purpose. Our task is to exceed shareholder commitments with integrity and our purpose is to innovate The World's Sixth Sense in order to save lives and livelihood. I take great pride in that purpose.","My priorities in the near term are straightforward; identify how we can create the most shareholder value, organize the business around that effort, and establish the right operational cadences to ensure its execution.","I'll now open the call up for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question today is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Co. Please proceed with your question.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Yeah. Two questions. First, on the industrial camera business. We're just hearing about pretty strong demand in the factory automation market. And I'm wondering to what extent is this driving growth within the IIS business? And are there some specific verticals where this has been particularly strong for you, if that's the case? And then I have a follow up on the Security business.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. Well, our IIS business has done quite well. It's an acquisition, we're really proud of its performance. And this quarter has been outstanding and we are pretty bullish on it going forward. But I'll let Tom answer the question specifically.","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. As Jim mentioned, we're thrilled with the performance of the IIS team. And as you mentioned, the machine vision business has done quite well. The optical inspection aspect of the business, particularly for the generation changeover in the mobile phones, has driven some recent bookings growth. We expect that revenue to be executed over the next couple of quarters and it's been something that's really been a bit of a surprise for how strong it has been. And we're very pleased with the ability of the team at IIS to capture that share of business.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. Thank you. And then just with respect to the Security business, I'm wondering, if we strip away for a second the consumer retail portion of the business, I'm wondering how you view the remainder of the business? How satisfied are you with the performance of the professional-grade business, the DVTEL business? Can you give some sense as to maybe how that business, the various segments are performing? Thank you.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. See, if we look at our Security segment, you look at the core thermal business. As we mentioned earlier, it grew in the mid-teens in the quarter. So it had a very healthy quarter. And the retail business really comes down to timing. Already product that was delayed at the end of the second quarter shipped into the channel. So we expect that to return to organic growth.","I'll just say for Security on whole. It's an important part of our company. Now, going forward, we need to think about how we focus it, certainly. But if you think about critical infrastructure, perimeter security applications, the kind of technologies we provide in the current threat environment, there's a real value there in that business.","Now, we've got two products that we mentioned earlier, that Tom noted, that are launching into the retail channel, that'll help bolster that a bit. But no doubt, as we go forward, we're going to continue to work to improve the organic trajectory and profitability of that segment.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Thanks a lot, Jim. Best of luck.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Asher Carey from Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Asher Carey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, Jim. Good morning. I'd kind of just a general question here. If you could comment on your acquisition philosophy. I'm just curious how you see your philosophy compared to what you've seen FLIR execute on within the many different end markets? And any high-level thoughts on the acquisition criteria? Do you see any room for divestitures? And how quickly do you think you plan on rolling out your formal plan? Thanks.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. Well, I will start by saying, acquisitions are a core part of our future growth strategy; no doubt. And when I think about acquisitions, I kind of put them into three buckets, right. There are going to be investments that we make to gain specific technologies, joint ventures perhaps. There are going to be bolt-ons that we do and some of which that we've done many of over the years. Then there are going to be those deals of scale that will be more transformational.","First, I want to affirm what our go-forward strategy is. And again, I think five weeks on the job, so I'm going to stop short of publishing that wholesale on this call. But first and foremost, I again affirm what is the clear strategy for the company, and then go out actively work to build an aggressive pipeline of targets that we can go after, be disciplined about the financial hurdles that we have to get over and gain scale. As you know, we have a pretty sound balance sheet. You'll, again, see us very acquisitive as we go forward, but very disciplined as well.","As I look across our business, again, acquisitions are going to be critical because we have a lot of segments that frankly we need to gain a lot of scaling, right, to be more competitive. So suffice it to say, it'll be an important part, a critical part of our strategy going forward and it'll be a very disciplined approach.","Asher Carey - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Saliq Khan from Imperial Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Hi. Good morning, Jim.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Good morning.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Hey Jim, I know you've only been on the job for the last couple of weeks, but as you spent last several weeks visiting with employees and learning about the business, can you give us a bit of insight into your initial perspective of the FLIR business and the potential improvements that you're seeing?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Absolutely. I could talk the rest of the morning about this. I've been on a kind of business tourism trip for the past month trying to get out to as many of our sites as I possibly can. By the end of the quarter, I intend to visit all of our major sites of scale. By the end of the year, I hope to be everywhere I possibly can. I have to say, there is a consistent theme as I've gotten out into the business.","Now, we have very different segments with different technologies that serve different end users. But the passion of the people and their connection to our end users has been consistent throughout. As I mentioned earlier, our purpose to innovate The World's Sixth Sense to save lives and livelihood, it's pretty compelling.","We're here in Billerica today where the Surveillance business makes weapon sights, man-portable sights, et cetera. And again, when you talk to the folks whether it be in management, in the functions that serve it, on the shop floor that develop the technology, again that real commitment and passion to the end user and the talent of the folks is just absolutely impress me.","Now, is there opportunity for us to improve? Absolutely. As I mentioned earlier, there are parts of our business that we need to fuel where we see immediate opportunity, there are parts of the business that we need to feed to gain scale, and there are parts of the business that we need to focus, again, to incubate and develop technologies and\/or focus to get them to be accretive with the rest of the businesses. But again, I could talk all day about how proud I am of the folks that work in this company and their talent.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Got it. And then, if you take a look at your past and the work that you've done on the commercial side of Stanley, are you still committed to the retail channel for the Security business with FLIR? And if so, what changes do you envision that you can bring about and where do you think there could be room for opportunities to be able to improve the retail channel more?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. Well, no doubt, the retail channel has been a struggle for us, as the business has been lumpy in the second quarter. As we mentioned, as orders didn't get into the channel or product didn't get into the channel, it caused a timing delay and dilution for the whole business. As I mentioned earlier in the third quarter, those products are shipping. We have two new products that will go into the retail channel, so we're going to continue to compete hard on that front.","But you're also going to see us focus heavily, as I mentioned, on the critical infrastructure side of the house. Our thermal side of Security grew in the mid-teens in the quarter. And if you think about the current threat environment, you think about the kind of technologies that we apply into critical infrastructure, into force protection, into perimeter security, there are so many opportunities. So you're going to always see us focus on the Security segment, but especially focused upon those perimeter security and force protection, critical infrastructure kind of applications.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Just one last question on my end, guys. If I take a look at the SG&A, that was a larger percentage of revenue as it was same period last year. How do I think about that in the out quarters?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So \u2013 this is Amit. The overall increase year-over-year, you will see some of that continue in the second half. Some of this is related \u2013 in the specific quarter, it's related to some accruals of compensation expense that was calendarized differently last year. But in addition, there's investments in our export licensing processes that we've talked about and some higher legal and CTO investments that we've made, as well as some IT calendarization and personnel adds. So, you won't see the same level of increase in the second half, but the second half will still be higher than the second half of last year.","Saliq Jamil Khan - Imperial Capital LLC","Great. Thank you, Amit.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Ho from William Blair. Please proceed with your question.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, and welcome on board, Jim. Just wanted to start out, what specifically caused the security orders to be delayed? And just given the volatility that we've seen in that business so far, what should we be thinking about in terms of maybe a growth rate or a general range for that business for this year?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. Well, the delay was really retailers taking inventory into the channel at the end of the quarter. They delayed the orders into the third quarter and, again, that product now is beginning to ship. As I mentioned, the thermal business grew quite nicely. As we go into the second half, we do expect the Security segment to return to organic growth on whole, albeit in the low-single digits.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. And then in terms of the DR-SKO program, like how large were the orders that slipped out to the subsequent quarter? And do you expect that to be recognized in the third quarter or just in the second half of the year?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","I expect more shipments for DR-SKO in the fourth quarter. Now, there are still I think $40 million left to ship on that program. That program goes well through 2018. I think Q3, we're going to see continued kind of slowness in the program, but in Q4 we expect a lot of activity. And I also want to highlight for Detection, the Griffin G510. Tom mentioned it, it's a new product that we've launched this quarter. You'll hear more about it. It's something we're really excited about. Across our Detection business, right now if we look at all the programs that are out there to capture, it's probably one of the largest addressable markets we've seen in recent history.","Now, a lot of work to go do to capture those programs. That will be going throughout the second half. But specifically to your question with DR-SKO, I probably expect Q3 to be a bit slow, but Q4 to be a strong quarter for it.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Ciarmoli from SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Les Sulewski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Good morning. This is actually Les in for Michael. Question actually to backtrack a little bit to your approach on acquisitions and maybe take a look at another approach to it. Any thoughts on the long-term strategic direction of the company and \u2013 specific to portfolio reshaping, and perhaps any product line that you might see fit for divestitures?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, again, five weeks on the job, I'll stop short of a wholesale reorganization of the company, our announcement of some big departure of strategy. But suffice to say, there are going to be parts of our business, as I mentioned, that we're going to fuel because we see immediate near-term opportunities. Parts of the business that we need to feed to gain scale, parts of our business that we need to focus.","Now, part of that focus, no doubt, will encompass evaluating the portfolio and piece of the portfolio we may need to divest. As I mentioned, we've got a strong balance sheet and the opportunity ahead of us I think to make a lot of sound acquisitions. And you'll see it being pretty balanced, right. We want and we love our Surveillance and Detection business, the government business. In the near term, I think, next three to five years is going to be really strong for us.","So we want to focus certainly on that side of the business. But do it with a very balanced approach that we're also continuing to make sound investment on the commercial side. We know the government business is very lumpy at times and hard to predict. And that commercial business smooths out the overall business, if you will, and keeps us whole through those troughs when the government spending slows for a quarter or for a year. And if you look at the commercial side of our business, in particular, IIS and OEM, just outstanding performance in the quarter that we want to really fuel those kind of opportunities.","Les Sulewski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thank you for that. I guess, as a follow up on the government side. What are your current thoughts on the DoD budget environment? Any sort of major rewards that you are tracking?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, I mean there is a whole host of programs that we're tracking. I'll just say, with regard to DoD spending, we're bullish in the coming years. We believe absolute dollars on the DoD budget will reach near war-time highs of years ago. There are a lot of programs out there as well as discretionary funds for us to capture. We've got a bevy of new products that we have launched over the past 12 months and that are in the process of being launched that you'll hear about in the second half of the year.","And again, it's a critical part of the business. As I mentioned, Detection, in particular, has an environmental programs right now that's greater than they've seen at anytime in recent history, but a lot of work to go do to capture them, and difficult to predict the timing of the DoD spend on these various programs. But suffice to say, there's just a heck of a lot of activity underway.","Les Sulewski - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Got it. Thank you. And just, I guess, one more from me and I'll jump back in the queue. In regards to your Maritime business, can you talk a little bit about what drove the margin expansion there and is this rate sustainable? Thank you.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Tom, why don't you touch on that?","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. As we mentioned in the text, in Maritime we introduced a new product called the Axiom, which is a new generation of MFM and it brings a lot of features to the market. It's faster. It has a new user interface. It's easier to use. And the market has basically identified that as being a great offering. And it's carried much improved margins from us versus the historic product we were offering as an MFD.","The improved margins in our MFD line went straight to the bottom as we held expenses. So that's why we saw that improvement. Now, you also heard us talking about expanding that Axiom product line with the new Axiom Pro. So we'll have (34:48) bringing more products to market, which will also have similar improved margins.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brian Gesuale from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Brian A. Gesuale - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. Good morning, guys, and welcome, Jim. Wanted to ask a little bit about the Security business. I think there is a coveted asset there in the thermal side of things that maybe being overshadowed by some of the residential or Lorex-based stuff. Is the Lorex business profitable? And maybe can you talk about the penetration of thermal content in that, whether any exists today or what the rollout for that might be in the future?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, again, as you mentioned that thermal part of our business is coveted; it's a core, again, component of the company. And if we think about its applications, critical infrastructure, the perimeter force protection, et cetera, in today's threat environment, we're very bullish on it. It's profitable certainly. As I mentioned, it's grown in the mid-teens.","When it comes to Lorex and the retail channel, the adoption of thermal technologies, it's a slower curve, right, than you see in some of the critical security applications, enterprise customers, as I mentioned. But there is a lot of capability that comes with it, as you know. There is a lot that we can do in maybe not residential, but in homecare, with thermal technologies that can drive better data analytics, that can help folks that are aging in place, caregivers, et cetera.","So again, Security, core part of the business, no doubt. Lorex has been lumpy and we've had some dilution with it. But we do have new products go into that channel. As I mentioned, it's going to return to growth in the third quarter and you're going to continue to see us bring technologies into the Security space, because again of the threat environment. There's also some seasonality with Lorex. So you'll see, as we go into the back half of the year, some improved strength in that retail channel.","Brian A. Gesuale - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks, Jim. Wanted to maybe follow up in maybe a broader context. Can you maybe talk about, as you go through your analysis of the portfolio, what are some of the key benchmarks you use to kind of make the decision whether something is core to the FLIR brand? Is it the potential margins, is it the ability to penetrate with thermal content? What are kind of those broad mile markers there that you use to kind of evaluate the business?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. Well, as I mentioned, I kind of think of it in these three pieces; fuel, feed and focus. And there are parts of our business right now that are doing spectacular, that we need to really fuel to capture the most near-term gain that we can. I mentioned OEM, I mentioned IIS. Those businesses are doing absolutely phenomenal. We need to make sure that we maintain that tailwind.","And then, there are parts of our business that we need to see, in particular, if we look at Surveillance and Detection. We're bullish on the DoD budget going forward for the next three to five years. We want to go out and capture as many programs that we can as well as discretionary funds. And that takes some effort as well as some patience, because the timing to develop those again is hard to predict.","And then, as we've mentioned, there are parts of our business that we've got to focus. Certainly Security, as we've talked about on several questions now, is one of those. When I think about, is it core or not core, it's not necessarily thermal. If you look at our Detection business for example, we're applying all sorts of technologies there that aren't thermal that increase awareness. So with our core, we're about increasing awareness and perception to help again solve critical problems that save lives and livelihood.","From a business standpoint, I want to kind of tick that box and then be able to lead in that space; have a market space that's defendable, that we can capture first or second place of and gain scale. Obviously, our margins are very important to us. We guard them well. We also want businesses to constantly compete to be accretive.","Brian A. Gesuale - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's great. I'm going to get off the Security business here. I think there is a lot of really interesting things going on in the OEM business. Tom, this maybe a question more geared for you. But can you maybe just take us through the mix of that business, now that we have Point Grey in there, and how we should look at kind of the major buckets within that segments?","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Yeah. Okay. In the OEM business, we have our legacy business which is the camera core business. We have the cooled military camera cores, which are doing quite well at this point in time, primary customer being Northrop Grumman. We've seen strong order demand that will be executing the revenue starting at the end of this year and through 2018.","We've got our traffic systems which has had a fantastic quarter, as they've done a lot of work in Europe for tunnels that are being put in. We saw nice revenue growth there. We have our mobile accessories business, which we're just bringing the new FLIR ONE Generation 3 and the FLIR ONE Pro to market. We're starting to ship those. You'll start seeing those at retail outlets very soon, and they're available today on our flir.com.","And then, we've got the addition of the IIS business which we spoke about a little while ago. It's done fantastic, not only in the machine vision, but also on the people counting business. They've had a nice revenue growth there. So that's kind of the portfolio that's sitting inside OEM & Emerging.","Brian A. Gesuale - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks so much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Thomas A. Surran - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Noah.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Jim, question on your strategy for revealing your strategy. Recognizing it's been a month and so you're not ready to, as you said, give a lot of detail today. I'm actually wondering what milestones we can look for and what you're planning going forward? Are you going to hold an Investor Day? Are you planning to give longer-term targets or are you planning to get in detail about the portfolio or should we be thinking more of you wanting to just deliver and let the results speak for themselves?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Well, I think a bit of both. And I like the way you frame it, the strategy to reveal my strategy. I didn't know I had a strategy to reveal. But as we go forward, again, five weeks on the job, today is not the day to do it. But when I think about, again, my path forward, as I mentioned, I want to identify where we think we can drive the most value. I want to focus then on how we organize the business around it, and then get really sharp on the operational cadences required to ensure the execution. If I had to frame it up, I'd say, I want to do a little bit less better.","Now, first of all, FLIR has a pretty sound strategy across the segments. If you get into the segments and you talk to the segment leaders, et cetera, and Tom could go segment-by-segment and talk about the things that they're doing both near term and long term to capture business, to develop disruptive technologies. And you saw a bevy of new products that came into the market this quarter that do just that, disrupt us and our competitors as we go forward.","But, no doubt, in the coming quarter and quarters, you're going to see the business evolve. It will be just that, an evolution, not a revolution. I don't want to have wholesale change for change's sake, but we will state a concise long-term objective. We will demonstrate the method that we're going to do to accomplish that. But we really want to back it up with deeds not words. We'll spend more time focus on executing and demonstrating to you the results than talking about that strategy.","Now, we do intend to have an Investor Day. The date's not set, it will be next year probably end of Q1, beginning of Q2. We've got some work to do again to get that on the calendar and work out those logistics, but you will be seeing an Investor Day get on the calendar for us.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. Anything you can tell us about your CFO search. Do you have a sense for when you plan to make a decision there?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Sure. It's well underway, we've engaged an outside firm to help us with that. Now, the good news in the interim was Shane Harrison. He's been here seven years, he knows the business well, has a very strong background. He's worked now for several weeks with Amit through this transition and with the teams to make sure that we've got very deliberate coverage.","We hope to get through a selection process to a decision probably practically in the next, I'd say, four to six weeks. And then whatever time it takes on board, whatever individual that is. But we're moving as quickly, but deliberately as possible in that regard.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one more question. On the margins for the total business, there has been more than a 100 basis points \u2013 call it, a 125 basis points of adjusted segment operating margin expansion first half 2017 versus first half of 2016. Your revenue plan calls for a faster rate of revenue growth in the back half of the year than the first half of the year, which should help the margins. You've taken cost out of the business. Any reason we shouldn't be looking for a similar level of margin change year-over-year in the back half compared to what you had in the first half?","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Amit, do you want to touch on that?","Amit Singhi - FLIR Systems, Inc.","So Noah, you will see margin expansion in the second half as well, as we go forward. As you pointed out, with the revenue growth and higher operating leverage, we should see. Not sure if it's going to be to the same magnitude. There's obviously some level of benefit with the new product introduction that we've gotten close to the launch in these quarters, but there will be an expansion as we go into the second half.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Thanks, Noah.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.","James J. Cannon - FLIR Systems, Inc.","Again, I want to thank you all for joining us today. I especially want to thank our customers for their trust in our products and our team members for their hard work. Everyone, have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

Andy?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Todd, and welcome, everyone to FLIR's second quarter 2015 earnings call. With Todd and me today is our COO, Tom Surran; Interim CFO, Dave Muessle; Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; Chief of Product Strategy, Jeff Frank; and Senior Vice President of Corporate Development, Shane Harrison.","I'll start the presentation today on slide 4. This morning, we reported second quarter revenue of $393 million and earnings per share of $0.36. Compared to the second quarter of 2014, revenue grew 6% while EPS excluding restructuring charges grew 9%. Operating income, excluding restructuring charges was $71 million, up 13% over the prior year.","On a constant currency basis, Q2 revenue was up 12% as the strong U.S. dollar resulted in a $20 million reduction in reported revenues. On a year-to-date basis, earnings per diluted share excluding restructuring charges have increased 21% versus the first half of 2014. Our profitability during the first half of the year improved considerably with adjusted operating margins reaching 19% versus 16% in the previous year.","We've been successful in improving profitability in our government-related business as we continue to operate in an environment with decreased demand particularly from the U.S. DoD. During the quarter, we launched several new thermal imaging, visible imaging and test-and-measurement products. These include two new firefighting cameras that are positioned at either ends of our product value ladder.","First is our new K2 product which is a Lepton-based camera that creates a meaningful new entry point in the fire safety market. The combination of the K2's economical price point, ease of use, and rugged fire service packaging will make thermal imaging available to a much larger group of first responders to include rural volunteer firefighting departments. Meanwhile, at the top of our value ladder, the new K65 firefighting camera is our first product to meet the National Fire Protection Association's NFPA 1801 standard for firefighting cameras, which has historically been required by many large cities and municipalities in the United States.","Towards the end of the quarter, we began shipping the second generation of the FLIR ONE smartphone accessory that is compatible with both iOS and Android-based handsets and tablets. This new variant has been selling well initially through our direct flir.com global eCommerce channel. Additional channels will be opened as our supply capacity ramps up. The security segment launched the FLIR FX, HD Wi-Fi home-monitoring camera that features RapidRecap, a technology that consolidates all motion events over several hours into a short video clip easing the burden of reviewing hours of unnecessary footage.","In our Test and Measurement line of business, we launched our MR160 moisture meter, which is our eighth product to feature our low-cost Lepton microthermal camera core. This product further demonstrates how this camera core can be integrated into a broad range of industrial instruments to create differentiated and highly valuable capability of infrared-guided measurement for trade professionals. And lastly, we addressed a new market vertical for thermal imaging with the introduction of our FLIR Vue plug-and-play thermal camera line that is designed for the commercial and consumer drone market.","Moving to slide 5 in our earnings release today, we reaffirmed our outlook for 2015. We continue to expect revenues of between $1.55 billion and $1.6 billion for the full year, and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.60 to $1.70. This range incorporates our current views of currency rates for the year. We also announced today our regularly quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share, which will be payable on September 4 to shareholders of record as of August 21.","I'll now pass the call over to Dave to review the second quarter financial results. Dave?","David A. Muessle - Vice President, Corporate Controller and Interim Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Andy. The following discussion on pre-tax operating results for the second quarter and year-to-date excludes net restructuring charges totaling $0.5 million in 2015 and $3.5 million in 2014.","On slide 7, you will see a summarized income statement. Second quarter consolidated revenue was $393.0 million, an increase of 6% compared to the second quarter of 2014. Our Security, Instruments, and Detection segments reported increases of 34%, 7%, and 77% in revenue year-over-year respectively. Our other three segments reported year-over-year declines.","However, the Maritime segment, which is heavily impacted by currency fluctuations due to its sales volumes in Europe would have shown an increase of 6%. Likewise, our Instrument segment would have shown an increase of 16% on a constant currency basis. Sales to the U.S. government represented 19% of total revenue in Q2, compared to 21% of revenue in the second quarter of last year.","International revenue was 47% of total revenue in Q2 compared to 48% in 2014. For the first half of 2015, revenue was $737.5 million, a 2% increase over last year. On a constant currency basis, first half revenue would have been up approximately 7% year-over-year. Consolidated Q2 gross margin was 48%, a single percentage point decrease compared to last year, driven largely by the currency exchange impact on our Maritime segment.","Our consolidated operating margin was 18% compared with 17% in the second quarter of last year. Segment-level operating expenses declined year-over-year by 2% due to currency. Corporate administrative expenses were $1.4 million higher year-over-year. Our tax rate in the quarter remained at 24%, which is very comparable to the 2014 rate when excluding discrete items from last year.","Net earnings were $50.8 million, an increase of 7% over last year, and earnings per fully diluted share were $0.36, an increase of 9% over Q2 of 2014. For the first half of 2015, operating income was $137.1 million, representing a 19% operating margin compared to 2014 operating income of $113.8 million or a 16% operating margin. Net earnings for the first half of 2015 were $99.0 million, representing an 18% increase over 2014. Our earnings per diluted share of $0.70 for the first half of 2015 was a 21% increase year-over-year.","Turning to slide 8, you will see that we closed the second quarter with cash at $560.2 million, an increase of $12.4 million during the quarter. Our cash flow from operations for the quarter was $48.9 million or 97% of quarterly earnings as we experienced increases in both accounts receivable and inventory during the quarter primarily due to timing of shipments.","For the first half of the year, our operating cash flow was $123.9 million or 126% of first half earnings. We had capital expenditures of $17.6 million in the quarter and returned $15.4 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We also repurchased 1 million shares of our stock during the quarter under the 15 million share repurchase program that we announced in February, and we expect to continue to repurchase shares through the remainder of 2015 with a level of such activity dependent on relative value and expected capital needs and M&A opportunities.","As Andy stated, we are reaffirming our full 2015 outlook for revenue and fully diluted earnings per share, while the stronger dollar particularly against European currencies during the first half of the year was a significant headwind on our revenue. The impact for the six months was largely in line with our expectations. This concludes the summary of our second quarter and first half results.","Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights for Q2. Tom?","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Thank you, Dave. You will see a summary of our segment results on slide 10. Second quarter consolidated segment operating income grew 12% over the second quarter of 2014, and segment operating margin improved 100 basis points to 23% excluding restructuring charges. Total order backlog finished the quarter at $536 million, which is 4% lower than the first quarter of 2015 as a meaningful amount of our DR SKO units were shipped during Q2, thereby, reducing that program sizeable backlog.","Moving to slide 11, during the second quarter, the Surveillance segment saw a revenue decline 5% year-over-year to $107.8 million as growth from our manned portable and land-based imaging systems was more than offset by softness in our airborne gimbals and PVS product lines. Surveillance segment operating income of $26.3 million excluding restructuring charges increased 13% versus the prior year, which represents a 400 basis point increase in operating margin, driven by improved product margins and reduced operating expenses.","Surveillance backlog increased 6% over Q1 to $286 million on bookings of $133 million, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1.2. Bookings from U.S. customers improved compared to last year driven by $20 million follow-on order we received from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's MSC program for our integrated surveillance trucks.","Our Europe region was particularly soft during the quarter as macro headwinds have negatively impacted order flow. Turning to slide 12, the Instruments segment second quarter revenue increased 7% compared to the prior year, finishing at $90.3 million despite a $7 million headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar.","Driving this growth was the new C2 pocket-sized thermal camera, record revenue from our Science camera products, and continuing strength from our Firefighting products. Stronger gross margin and flat operating expense helped drive 22% growth in Instruments' operating income versus last year and resulted in a 32% operating margin for the quarter excluding the impact of restructuring charges.","As Andy mentioned, we introduced two new firefighting cameras that significantly improve our ability to offer life-saving thermal imaging technology to every fireman regardless of budget size. The K65 is a ruggedized high-performance camera that meets the NFPA's requirements for certification and features our proprietary FSX scene-enhancement technology, while the new K2 utilizes our Lepton camera core to offer a new entry-level price point in the firefighting market.","Additionally, the Instruments segment introduced the MR160 imaging moisture meter as an addition to the FLIR-branded test and measurement product line. While moisture meters are a ubiquitous tool used by building professionals everywhere, we added the Lepton camera core and an LCD screen to create a highly useful and differentiated tool that will help users efficiently and effectively find trouble spots.","Slide 14 summarizes the results for the OEM & Emerging segment where second quarter revenue was down 9% versus last year to $46.3 million. This decline was driven by the divestment of the non-infrared portion of our OCG business, which contributed over $3 million of revenue in the prior year, as well as negative impact from foreign exchange. Excluding these two items, segment revenue was up slightly year-over-year.","Customer order push-outs for our high-end cooled products limited growth in both the first and second quarters of this year. OEM & Emerging operating margin, excluding the impact of restructuring charges was 23% in Q2, down from 27% in 2014 due to product transition cost and lower utilization rates in production.","Page 15 of the presentation shows OEM & Emerging's new Vue camera, a lightweight and compact camera for the small, unmanned aircraft system market. The Vue is the first of its kind in the high-growth unmanned aerial market where applications for the products include critical infrastructure inspection, agriculture and livestock monitoring as well as Security and Surveillance.","Turning to slide 16, the Maritime segment, which has significant exposure to currency movements given that over half of its revenue is built in foreign currencies. So, our second quarter revenue declined 6% to $52 million, with a $7 million negative impact from currency. Slightly offsetting the top line weakness was 20% growth in the FLIR-branded thermal camera revenue year-over-year.","Currency exchange impact flowed through to profitability with operating income falling 34% to $6.4 million excluding restructuring charges. And operating margin decreasing to 12% due to an increasingly competitive pricing environment.","Slide 17 shows an overview of the Security segment, which had year-over-year revenue growth of 34%, reaching $60 million. Thermal security cameras grew 45%. FLIR-branded visible cameras grew 33%. Lorex-branded product grew 29% compared to prior year. New security system bundles, expanding presence at brick and mortar stores, and recent product introductions including the MPX HD over coax line of product, as well as the FX, FLIR's first home monitoring camera, all helped drive the visible camera product line's growth. Security operating profit was $7.9 with operating margins in line with the prior year as product mix led to a slightly lower gross margins, which was offset by slower growth in operating expenses.","On slide 18 is a summary of the Detection segment second quarter. Revenue increased 77% over the prior year to reach $36.5 million driven primarily by deliveries of our DR SKO units to the U.S. government. Also contributing to the strong quarter for Detection segment was 42% growth on our explosives detection handhelds. Operating margin increased nearly 1,000 basis points versus Q2 of 2014 to reach an all-time high of 26% that the operating leverage that resulted from the revenue increase proved beneficial.","Detection backlog finished the quarter at $83 million, which was down compared to the end of Q1 2014 as we completed the 2014 DR SKO order, while deliveries on the $51 million DR SKO order received in March of this year will begin delivery later this year in Q3.","That concludes my summary of the segments' second quarter. I will now pass the call back to Andy.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tom. We're pleased with the growth we experienced in the second quarter of 2015. Setting aside the foreign exchange impact that we and nearly all U.S. multinational companies have faced, first half 2015 revenue growth is on the high-single digits, while operating profits have grown over 20% when compared to last year.","Product innovation, operational execution and company-wide collaboration are the heart of this performance, and we expect to continue to grow in both the near and long-term. With the launch of the MR160, we have introduced eight new products that are based on our Lepton camera core, and each have either created new opening price points in our markets or established new categories and customer bases for our technology. We intend to continue innovating across all of our markets as well as enter new ones with the ultimate goal of generating excess shareholder return through top-line growth, healthy and consistent profit margins, and strong cash generation.","On the organizational front, our search for a new CFO is progressing very well, and we anticipate having this role filled in Q3.","That concludes our comments on the second quarter. We'll now ask the operator to open up the call for your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Tim Quillin from Stephens, Inc. Please proceed.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Nice results, nice growth. You talked about the comparisons on gross margin year-over-year, but could you talk about the comparisons on gross margin quarter-over-quarter? I know there can be fluctuations based on mix, but gross margin was down a fair amount versus where it was in 1Q.","And then, second question would be kind of big picture. Which of the new products that you've introduced over the past couple of years, the Lepton-based products, do you think will be the biggest revenue contributor as we look forward? Thank you.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Tim. This is Andy. I'll go ahead and handle the second question first and then I'll pass it over to Tom to talk about the gross margin comparison quarter-over-quarter. At this point, Tim, we're really still at the tip of the iceberg relative to the Lepton opportunity in terms of products that we develop within the company.","I can speak a little bit to what's out there on the market today, and certainly, the most successful of those today and the one that will generate the most revenue has been the C2. It's done really well, for two reasons, I would say. Number one is that it's a new form factor that we found has really been embraced quite strongly by the building-user community, the super-slim format, the ease of use of touchscreen, the image quality and so forth have all really been warmly embraced by that market. And at this point, the volumes that we're seeing from that are well in excess of what we had initially planned for the product. And thankfully, we've been able to ramp up manufacturing very quickly on that product to meet that demand.","But there are a number of other opportunities out there. I'm particularly excited about the K2, for example. So, coming out with a firefighting product that has enough resolution to do the job properly, that is really well packaged for that extremely aggressive environment but at a price point that opens up thermal imaging to a very large universe of first responders that typically have not been able to afford this type of equipment. There's a really large base of firefighters and the volunteer firefighters in the rural sector that don't have the benefit of thermal imaging technology. And there, I think the Lepton-based K2 is going to open up a new market segment for us there.","Tom, why don't you comment on the gross margin quarter-over-quarter issue?","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Sure. So, Tim, the first thing is you're right. Year-over-year, the biggest piece \u2013 and I know your question was sequential, not year-over-year, but I do want to point out that the big impact for us year-over-year was the FX impact. In sequential, we had a very strong gross margin quarter in Q1. And if you look through two things that are kind of the big pieces, too and impact on the sequential, one is the product mix is always going to have a large impact on our gross margins.","And second, there were some specific things that occurred in the various segments that all brought it down just a little bit. None of those, I believe, are long secular trends, but they did impact us, such as there was a bit of product transition costs in the OEM. We had some aggressive price promotions as we introduced some leading products into the maritime market and there are few other things in the \u2013 but in things in the market such as the surveillance market, that was more about product mix than any kind of long-term trend.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Yes. Thanks. Again, morning, Andy. Andy, can you talk about what you're seeing on the \u2013 kind of the defense side of things in terms of potential as we're going to see another sequestration in the fall, and how you're looking in terms of the backlog and timing of shipments going forward?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Peter. Well, we had \u2013 in Q2, we actually saw an uptick in U.S. DoD orders and we're also seeing some increased demand as a result of some urgent needs requirement requests that we're seeing coming through from the U.S. DoD side. I would say that that added together with continued unrest that we see, particularly in the Middle East, are driving potential demand for us going forward.","The latter piece of that is a little bit harder to predict from a timing perspective. But I would say both of those increases in demand are very much co-linear with our CDMQ model and one of the strengths that we have at FLIR is the ability to respond quickly to requirements that emerge and get equipment fielded very quickly on a global basis.","It's still hard to predict in terms of what we're going to see relative to \u2013 from a sequestration standpoint. I think that's something that we're looking at and being relatively conservative in our forecasting model. And at this point, we feel pretty good about the backlog that we've got at this point and what the second half looks like. But into 2016, we'll have to see how the second half executes. We'll look at what we think the 2016 opportunity looks like.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. That's good color. If I can just follow up on just a question on overall opportunity, still within kind of reducing your inventory levels. You've talked about I think some of the initiatives in the past on trying to improve your inventory turns, maybe you could update us that because of the \u2013 I guess the opportunities there when you benchmark it against other consumer-oriented companies. Thanks.","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","So, Peter, this is Tom. The inventory, yeah, we would have liked to have seen more progress at the end of Q2. The reality is we had some inventory queued up for some shipments because, as Andy was talking about these urgent needs, we want to make sure we are prepared to respond to the demands of our customer. And so, we had quite a bit product ready to go to satisfy that. We expect that product to ship here in this quarter. We also do have a move of one of our major production facilities that produces our detectors. That will be occurring later in this year, and we'll be building some inventory to make sure that we can continue to meet our customers' needs during that transition period.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham and Company.","Jim A. Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you and good morning. You seem to be getting traction with the newer products, and I'm just wondering if it's meaningful enough now to perhaps if you would be able to even aggregate it for us and give us a sense as to how much this is contributing now to growth. Are you at that point or would you be willing to share that with us if you could?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Jim, this is Andy. We don't talk about specific contribution of each product in reporting our results. But I can say a couple of things related to that. Across many of our business, we've seen unit volumes increase significantly, and that's been in the face of ASP declines, but it has been driving overall growth. If you look at the growth in the Instruments business, if you look at the growth in the Security business that we've been obtaining, those are driven by very significant unit volume growth. And in both of those markets, the total available market opportunity is quite significant, and I think that we're still very thinly penetrated into those markets. In the case of where we've got markets that are quite price elastic, the developments that we've been doing in terms of developing lower cost products that open up this technology to a new class of buyers is really where we think the growth is going to come from in these markets. That said, we're also focused on the upper corner of our markets. And we've got several product introductions that are going to occur later this year in the upper end of our product value ladder. And we believe that that will drive a refreshed cycle in those areas.","Jim A. Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. And maybe just to follow-up on just the last comment about new products and presumably some of these will, if they're at the higher end of market, carry some better margins. So I'm wondering, is there anything we should be thinking about in terms of the mix of revenues in the second half of the year as it relates to gross margins?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think that the \u2013 as we look at the mix right now for the second half of the year, we think that there'll be a small improvement in gross margin relative to what we've seen in the first half of the year. At this point, though, the new products that we've introduced into the channel support our current gross margin levels. As you've mentioned, some of the products that will get launched at the upper end of our product value ladders tend to have higher gross margin levels associated with them. But I don't expect that to move the needle significantly in the second half.","Jim A. Ricchiuti - Needham & Co. LLC","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Good morning, guys.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Hey, guys. You have had some big receivables outstanding from the Middle East. Have you collected on all of them yet? Because I'm just wondering because it looks like working capital was a use of cash this quarter and I'm just trying to kind of get at what your free cash flow expectations are for the full year.","David A. Muessle - Vice President, Corporate Controller and Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. Peter, this is Dave. We did have some large receivables from the end of the year we're actively working that. Unfortunately, some of those did not come in, in the first half of the year like we had hoped. We do expect them to come in, a good portion of them come in, in the second half of the year. And right now, based upon our expectations, we would expect to see receivables come down a bit in the third quarter.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. And just to follow up, it looks like rest-of-world volumes were down pretty significantly in the quarter. Can you tell us, are you seeing a lot of headwind out of China or maybe the Middle East or both?","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Peter, this is Tom. No, not really at all. So, when we look at it, there's \u2013 I can talk to one headwind. But in total, our revenue in APAC actually showed nice growth. And there's a couple of places where that occurred. In particular, substantially in our Instruments business, we had very nice growth. And portion of that was related to the application of thermal imaging for screening related to the MERS crisis that occurred in Korea, but we also beyond that had substantial growth. We had nice growth in our security market as well. We had reasonable overall growth. So China, do we have headwinds? The one thing that does kind of hold us back perhaps a little headwind that we need to fight is that there are certain trade restrictions on our products that we have to face, and that always is something we have to deal with, but nothing in particular. No.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC","Okay. I just asked because your chart on slide 7 shows rest-of-the world going from $92.5 million last year to $77 million this year, so I just raised the question in my mind. But thank you.","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah. Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thank you. At the last two or three trade shows in the Security area that you've been at, there's been a state of new introductions from other companies touting either, obviously, LED-based or infrared-based cameras, but also being able to say that they also have visible light combinations with those infrared cameras. Given that you have a leadership position in this area, what are you doing to offset that \u2013 the competition for those who are claiming that they can produce a visible light infrared camera at a cheaper price than you? What's your value proposition to offset that?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey, Jeff. This is Andy.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Hi, Andy.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, there \u2013 in that particular case, they're using a standard CMOS visible camera and just opening it up to the short-wave IR wavelengths that enable through LED illumination. And at the end of the day, it's really completely different technology than what we're dealing with thermal imaging. That's still an active illumination technology that relies on light emitted from the LED illuminators reflecting off of the target back to the sensor.","And the problem with that is twofold. Number one, it's very short ranged so you can't get near the kind of range that you can get from a thermal sensor. And number two is that you have a significant issue relative to any kinds of obscurants that are between the camera and the object, and that can be anything from a spider web that forms in front of the camera because those LED illuminators give off heat and attracts spiders, all the way through to any kind of dust, fog, rain, smoke that is in the environment significantly inhibits the effectiveness.","The last thing and a real strength for thermal imaging \u2013 and we talked about this a bunch during our Investor Day \u2013 is the fact that the kinds of things that you're looking for with a security camera tend to be living objects, people or animals, and those stand out very strongly from the background in the thermal spectrum, and they do that in a passive way. So, there's no illumination that is required. As a result of that, video analytics work very reliably. You tend not to be affected by obscurants that are in the scene. And because it's a passive technology, it can't be detected. It's low power and it doesn't attract things like spiders that cause problem with the IR illuminated solutions.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. As a follow-up in the OEM area, we've just seen a introduction of \u2013 some of that could be very interesting in the unpiloted plane area or drone area. Without obviously giving away any company names or anything like that, what areas of OEM \u2013 now that you've had Lepton out in the field for a while, what areas do you think are the ones that have the greatest prospects for the next couple of years for us to see new product being adopted by new companies.","Jeffrey D. Frank - Senior Vice President, Global Product Strategy","Hi, Jeff. This is Jeff Frank.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Hi.","Jeffrey D. Frank - Senior Vice President, Global Product Strategy","So, the \u2013 on the UAS side, first of all, the product we just introduced, the Vue product, it has turned out it's not a Lepton-based product, it's Tau-based product.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay.","Jeffrey D. Frank - Senior Vice President, Global Product Strategy","So, it tends to be a higher-performance system. And it turns out that in the past we've been selling kind of Tau cameras into the community. And when I say that community, in the U.S. community, I'm talking about more of the professional virtual side of that community. But our \u2013 from a price point standpoint and also from an interface standpoint, the products we had were probably not as desirable as they could have been. And that's what we did with Vue, is we created a price point and modified the products such that the interconnect was much easier.","So it's just makes it very simple for somebody who isn't generally a professional user, these are people who are using it for things like agriculture, crop inspections, wildlife detection, that sort of thing. And the response from that has been pretty positive. We've had it out for two months now. We're very encouraged by the response we've gotten from it. And we're going to start pushing some more chips into that \u2013 onto that table now. We see it as a growth opportunity for the future.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Right. And then actually the other part of that question was if you could, in a general sense, talk about what other OEM areas do you think are, in a sense, most pregnant with possibility given the fact that you do have a success or an introduction in one area, what areas are we going to be seeing over the next year or so that you can talk about?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure, Jeff. This Andy again. A couple of areas that show opportunity there, the first covers the current verticals that we satisfy with our end solutions. There will be other players that will be in those areas, in Maritime, in Security, in Test and Measurement equipment. And we supply OEM components into those markets. Jeff talked about the UAS market. That's an area where we're getting traction with Lepton, for example, with other micro UAS manufacturers due to its low size, power and weight.","The other thing that presents a very significant opportunity for us is the Internet of Things space. Fundamentally, Internet of Things devices are sensors that are connected to users in an intelligent way through the internet. And a thermal imaging module, something like Lepton, provides a very rich set of data that can't come from other types of sensors. But it's a set of data that many Internet of Things devices would benefit from. And we're seeing a lot of inquiries there. We recently conducted a maker event where we invited a bunch of developers to a public event where they developed solutions around Lepton. And that was a very popular event for us and one \u2013 a model that we intend to replicate elsewhere in the world later in the second half of the year.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe if we could just go back to Pete's question on the international revenues. If Europe was up 27%, APAC was up, what was down that drove that 16% contraction in the other foreign (38:58) and what drove that down? And again, that's coming off your charts on slide 7, just looking at the revenues by geography. And you've got Europe at $109 million versus $86 million last year.","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Yeah.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","But you got the rest of world down significantly.","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","I think we're kind of slicing U.S. versus \u2013 so, we typically define Americas as one region. And that includes Latin America, and certainly the Brazilian market has been a major softness, down significantly. Also has the Canadian market. So, we've also kind of \u2013 it's a matter of how we are slicing between the regions.","And when I earlier referred to, in that case, APAC, I was referring to a division that had Americas, Europe, Middle East, APAC. This is slicing it with U.S. government, U.S. other, Europe, and the rest of world which is picking up Canada and Latin America. So, I think that's the difference between those two, it was the way the slicing occurred. And in rest of world, I would go to those countries, Latin America, Central America, Middle East that would all have different results.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the guidance, I mean, the second half really assumes a pretty big jump in revenues over first half. Same thing with EPS. I think you mentioned some pushouts from customers in your OEM. We're certainly seeing the broader industrial market look pretty choppy out there with China slowing. I mean, how much line of sight do you guys have into the remainder of the year and even tying in some government risks? I mean, do you guys have enough line of sight to sort of handicap for some weakening global economics out there?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, we do. We had some business that was slated to deliver in Q2 that we were not able to execute during the quarter that was staged for delivery, but we didn't have the orders complete at the point that we're able to deliver them in Q2 and those have come in now. So, that helps to firm up our view of the Q3 revenue situation. There's \u2013 of course, there's book and bill that still needs to happen for Q4 deliveries, but that's something that's not atypical for us at this point. We feel pretty good about the revenue forecast for the second half at this point and the revenue increase H1 to H2 is fairly typical to what we've seen in prior years.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Just wanted to start out with the DR SKO program and just understand maybe how you guys are thinking about order patterns this year? I mean, it seems like we got a lot of it in the second quarter. It was a little bit light in the first quarter, and you guys gave some commentary. But just wanted to get a sense of how we should be maybe modeling detection or thinking about the detection linearity as we go through the course of the year?","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Sure, Jonathan. This is Tom. So, there are two pieces to the question. There is the order and then there is the shipment. And on the DR SKO program, we had a $25 million order last year. That was delivered and we just completed in Q2, the final delivery on that order. In March of this year, we had a $50 million order. And the magnitude between those two are kind of where we would expect annual bookings on that program. $25 million to $50 million would be the orders. But they will come in typically in those large lumps in one particular quarter.","The revenue is distributed more evenly. Now that said, this year in Q3 we're only beginning to deliver on the March order at the end of Q3. The ramp will occur through Q4 and continue for deliveries over the next 12 months. We would expect then subsequently an order sometime into this year, early next year to replace that order, so that we could have a continuing relatively smoother shipment level.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. And then just in terms of the acquisition of Sikorsky by Lockheed, I mean, you guys have \u2013 historically had a pretty big presence in terms of the Blackhawk side of things. So, I'm just trying to understand, probably not for the near-term, but just longer term, is there potentially a competitive impact on your business there?","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","I think it's fairly remote, Jonathan. We have a very rich history, a very long lineage on the UH-60 Black Hawk platform. I would add to that that Lockheed really doesn't have a competitive product in that space. As a customer that has continually been looking for a better value proposition in terms of a sensor, they've been very focused on size, weight, and performance reduction, which the current generation of product that we're shipping into that platform progressed along that path in terms of being smaller, lighter, higher performance product. So, I think we're pretty solid on that front. Qualification process also for the customers on those platforms are fairly lengthy in time. It's not something we're going rest on our laurels. We continue to develop that product platform, listen to the customer in terms of their emerging needs and develop the product consistent with the needs of the customer in that space.","Jonathan F. Ho - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. It's a good thing that \u2013 yeah, I wouldn't anticipate any change either. Thank you.","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","David A. Muessle - Vice President, Corporate Controller and Interim Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I remember you all saying a few quarters ago that the acquisition target bucket was something along the lines of larger than it had ever been, but we haven't seen a ton of activity. Could you maybe just walk us through what you're seeing there? Across all industrials, we hear asking prices is a challenge. But maybe just update us on the latest there.","Shane Harrison - Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy","Sure, Noah. This is Shane. The pipeline continues to be very, very rich and full. You kind of hit on it. Some of the processes are moving slower than we'd like to, whether it be because of negotiating contracts or mainly in pricing. So, yeah, the valuations are pretty high especially in some of the spaces that we're looking at. That pipeline is pretty broad. We have six segments. There are opportunities across all those segments. We are focused on a few of them. A little heavier than the others, but it's particularly \u2013 like security, for example, it's a very hot space valuation wise. So, while the pipeline is pretty deep and rich, the valuation landscape has made it challenging. But it doesn't mean we're not going to be still doing things. I think there are pockets and gems of opportunity that we should be able to act on in the near term.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And what's kind of the range of size of asset you're looking at in a more serious way?","Shane Harrison - Senior Vice President, Corporate Development and Strategy","Well, if we tiered that pipeline, the top tiers that were active and talking to people on range anywhere from $25 million up to almost $300-ish million. And that $200 million to $300 million is kind of the sweet spot. There are some, let's say, Tier 2 opportunities that might be quite a bit bigger than that. But active things that we're looking at are in that range.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Could you guys give us a little more color on what drove Europe to be better in the quarter? For a while, it had sounded like you guys were still pretty concerned with Europe, so I'm just wondering what's potentially changing there or if it was more just a comparison or something like that.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","A little bit of comparison, yeah. The prior-year comparison on Europe was a bit soft particularly in Surveillance. We had some deliveries of some orders of the revenue side versus the order side. So, earlier comments about headwinds on the bookings that we've made related to what we're seeing going forward, in particular Western Europe, an area we have usually \u2013 typically have been very strongly and very good relationships with OEMs and customers there, that's where we're seeing some softness. The deliveries that we saw, the revenue that we saw, we saw a nice growth in this particular quarter. A, it was an easier comp; B, it was just some orders that we took at the end of last year, earlier this year.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So, from a revenue perspective, we shouldn't expect that rate to sustain in the back half necessarily, the rate of growth?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, no, no.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then in the Surveillance margin, anything you can tell us about what's in the outlook for how that Surveillance margin will compare to the back half of last year? I'm just \u2013 I'm still trying to gauge what the right mid-cycle normalized when things are normal Surveillance margin is on a go-forward basis given how much it's changed over time.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, for Surveillance going forward, it will be in line, I wouldn't say dramatically different. There's two things I assume. Gross margin or operating margin?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Well, operating margin, but if you could \u2013 whichever input matter most.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Operating margin. Yeah. So I would say the Q2 represents a bit of a low quarter because of just the size of the revenue in the operating leverage. And as we increase that revenue through the balance of the year based on our forecast, you should see our operating margin return mid to the high 20s.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Okay. Thanks very much.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Tim Quillin with Stephens, Inc.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens, Inc.","Hey. Thank you, for taking my follow-up. I just had a couple of questions about your consumer products that I think drive good brand awareness for you. But on FLIR One next gen, can you compare maybe the early response to that versus what you saw on the FLIR One first generation product and what your expectations are relative to what you saw on the first FLIR One?","Travis D. Merrill - Chief Marketing Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. Hi, Tim. This is Travis. Obviously, we won't disclose any specific product volumes related to either first gen or second gen, but I can give you some sort of more qualitative points relative to the FLIR One, both gen one and gen two. First of all, just kind of on the overall media coverage and acceptance, we've actually seen increased coverage across a number of different metrics on the PR front for the second generation versus the first generation, which I think is a pretty good accomplishment given the newness of the technology last year when we first introduced FLIR One.","Secondly, we took a slightly different approach this time with the launch. And rather than staging it geographically, we launched it globally on a single day. And by doing so, we obviously opened up a much bigger market from the start that combined with the much broader device compatibility has led to us servicing a natural pent-up demand that we weren't necessarily able to meet with the first generation given the constraints of the iPhone 5 platform.","So, I think looking at it from those two perspectives, we've been positive in our viewpoints and how it's doing but it is still very early and we're still, as Andy mentioned on the opening comments, ramping up manufacturing capacity. So, we'll have a better view really as time goes on throughout this quarter.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. And then on FLIR FX, I think that had some pretty good reviews, but how is that selling through your retail channels and what's the thought about potentially adding infrared into that product at some point? Thank you.","Travis D. Merrill - Chief Marketing Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. This space of consumer IT, home monitoring, obviously, is a very active one with a number of new entrants and a lot of different players trying to find their footing. We've been very encouraged by the progress that we've made in a couple of months that we've had it in market. Again, on the media front, and you sort of alluded to this, we've had some very, very good coverage, very good reviews that not only goes to drive demand for that particular product but it also helps us build our overall brand in that relatively new consumer market for us. Secondly, user feedback has been quite positive as well if you look at reviews online. And people are really valuing the differentiation that we've put for the RapidRecap and some of the other features.","And the third thing I would mention \u2013 and I think you might have alluded to this as well \u2013 is this product has \u2013 really had the strongest retail coverage of any FLIR branded product that we've launched to-date. We've obviously got placement in Best Buy and Target, many regional retailers, and a whole host of e-tail partners. So, I think that also not only serves to open up the market for us from a pure consumer demand standpoint but, again, also helps us build the awareness for our brand, introducing our brand to those folks who may have not heard of us previously.","On your second question regarding the injection of thermal imaging technology into this, we obviously have nothing new to announce at this time. But, clearly, there's a very strong value proposition there, thermal in security cameras. And it certainly helps to solve common pain points in this space. So, it will be something that we continue to explore and look at.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tim, this is Andy. I'll just add other thing to Travis' comments that has merit relative to FLIR FX is that from a technology standpoint, it's also a platform for us to develop things like cloud connectivity, which the FLIR FX has, mobile apps \u2013 it's got a broad suite of mobile apps to go with it and also a recurring revenue model. So, those are all platforms that are important for us as we go forward and broaden that product line to include thermal and other capabilities that will spread across the total security business.","Operator","Our next question \u2013 our final question, I should say, comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Thanks. Just a quick follow-up on Detection. It took a little while for you to get your \u2013 say get your sea legs with regard to Detection and the acquisition of the company that comprised a lot of it. Now, are you set with the \u2013 do you believe that you were set with number one, lines of product that are going to sell best for you and also the connections or the actual connections with those parts of the government that are going to \u2013 or states that are going to buy these products? Are you set with them so that you have an infrastructure both in terms of the people as well as the products in line with what you think the demand will be?","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Jeff. This is Andy. We've made really good progress in this business. The segment required some work, I think, to get it aligned with the FLIR model. But a couple of things specific to the questions in terms of customer base, I mean, we saw quite a good response in Q2 if you take out the program and CRAD (56:08) portion of this business and just look at the sort of standard product sales. They were \u2013 bookings were up north of 50% in that segment during Q2. The other thing that we've been doing there is fairly aggressive product development program, of which we'll start to see the fruits of that emerge in the second half of the year.","So, overall, from an operation standpoint and a product development standpoint, we're bringing it much more in line with the way we conduct our business from the other segments of FLIR. I'd add to that also that Travis' group has been quite active there as well. The Detection segment for FLIR I think was fairly undermarketed prior to Travis' arrival. And he's got a vertical marketing director focused on it. They've done quite a bit of work. And if you look at the sort of outward-facing promotions associated with our Detection segment and products, the activity there has markedly improved versus the past. Tom, do you want to add anything else to that?","Thomas A. Surran - Chief Operating Officer","No. That's a very good summary. I think we've restructured the business to be efficient. We are working on new products. It's been well-adopted by the customers. We're seeing the results. And, yeah, we're going to have \u2013 through the balance of this year, we think a nice overall year for the Detection.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Andrew C. Teich - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us on the call today and for your continued interest in FLIR's growth as a company. I'd also like to thank the nearly 3,000 FLIR employees around the globe for their continued focus, dedication and execution against our vision of making FLIR the World's Sixth Sense. We're very excited about the opportunity ahead of us, and we look forward to updating you relative to our progress on that front at the end of Q3. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Thank you.

Andy?","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Todd, and thank you, everyone, on the line for joining us this morning for FLIR's third quarter 2014 earnings call.","With me on the call today is our CFO, Tony Trunzo; COO, Tom Surran; Chief of Product Strategy, Jeff Frank; and our Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill. I'd also like to introduce our new General Counsel and Secretary, who you just heard from, Todd DuChene, who joined FLIR last month. Todd brings more than 20 years of public company experience, most recently with Nuance Communications, National Semiconductor and Solectron. His experience with commercial contracts, litigation, intellectual property management and M&A will be a welcome addition to our team.","This morning, we reported third quarter revenue of $375 million and GAAP earnings per share of $0.37. This EPS result included after-tax charges of $3 million, related to continuing severance and relocation costs of our previously announced restructuring and realignment plans. Excluding these charges, Q3 earnings were $0.39 per share. Revenue increased 5% versus the third quarter of 2013, as 11% growth in our 4 commercially oriented segments was partially offset by a 4% decline in Surveillance and Detection segments.","Our profitability continues to improve, with operating margin before restructuring charges increasing 200 basis points over the prior year and reaching 20% in the quarter. Our restructuring efforts are nearing completion, and we experienced approximately $6 million of benefit from these actions in the third quarter, with similar savings expected going forward on a quarterly basis.","Additionally, our total backlog grew $31 million over Q2 to reach $579 million, which is our highest backlog in 5 years, and was driven by strong order flow in all segments except Detection.","Our Lepton-enabled FLIR ONE iPhone accessory began shipping in August and is currently available on the FLIR website, at Apple Stores and on apple.com. Customer and media feedback has been positive, and we're very encouraged by the exposure the FLIR ONE launch has provided to the FLIR brand and by the many new potential customers who've been educated on thermal imaging and its applications. We expect to continue to develop and launch additional FLIR ONE variants for other mobile platforms in 2015.","During the quarter, we announced 2 other products that incorporate our revolutionary Lepton thermal core, the AX8 unattended temperature sensor, and the $499 TG165 imaging spot temperature gun, both of which will begin shipping in Q4. These products create new categories for us, which we expect to drive incremental demand.","Based on our third quarter results and our current view of the business, we are narrowing our outlook for the full year 2014. We now expect revenues of between $1.48 billion and $1.53 billion for the full year and earnings per diluted share in the range of $1.43 to $1.48, excluding expenses related to restructuring actions.","With that, I'll now pass the call over to Tony to review the third quarter financial results. Tony?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Thanks, Andy. The following discussion of Q3 2014 results excludes restructuring costs totaling $4.1 million pretax or $0.02 per share. I'll also refer everyone to the summary presentation of third quarter financial results available on our website at www.flir.com\/investor.","Overall, we finished the quarter with revenue of $375.4 million, an increase of 5% compared to last Q3. Consolidated gross margin was 49.1% and was 80 basis points better than last year. Segment operating expenses, excluding restructuring charges, were up by 1% compared to last year, while corporate expense of $15.1 million were unchanged compared to last year and down by 11% compared to Q2 of this year. Net income before restructuring expenses was $55.9 million and earnings per share excluding restructuring were $0.39, an increase of 22% compared to Q3 of 2013.","Surveillance segment revenue of $119.1 million was 6% below last year, but up 13% sequentially, while segment operating income improved by 2% compared to last year, due to a 3 point increase in gross margin and a slight decline in operating expenses. Year-to-date, Surveillance operating income before restructuring is down by 24% on 13% lower revenue.","The Instruments segment continued to perform well in the quarter, with a 7% increase in revenue and a 31% increase in operating income. Gross margin improved by 2 percentage points, and operating expenses before restructuring were 7% below last year. Year-to-date, Instruments operating income of $74.5 million represents an increase of 18% compared to last year on a 6% increase in revenue.","OEM and Emerging segment revenue increased by 2% compared to Q3 of last year, while operating income of $16.1 million was down by 4%. Segment gross margin declined slightly, while operating expenses increased by 6% due partly to higher research and development spending. Segment operating margin in Q3 was a strong 28.7%, but down 2 percentage points from last Q3. Year-to-date, OEM and Emerging revenue is up 10% and segment operating income is up 5% compared to the first 9 months of last year.","Our Security segment performed very well again in Q3. Revenue of $48.6 million represented an increase of 37% compared to last year due to very strong sell-through and expanded distribution of our Lorex-branded products as well as growth in our thermal camera product line. Operating income increased by 57% to $7 million as gross margin improved by 1.2 percentage points and operating expenses declined by 60 basis points relative to revenue. Year-to-date, Security segment revenue is up 24%, while operating income is up by 20%.","Maritime revenue increased by 8% from last year, led by strength in our Raymarine product line. Gross margins were up 60 basis points from last year and operating expenses were flat, resulting in a 3.2 percentage point increase in operating margin. Year-to-date, Maritime revenue is $152.5 million, up by 4%, while operating income of $23 million is up by 13%.","Detection revenue increased by 6% compared to Q3 last year and operating expenses were down by 13%. Operating income was up by 2% and was negatively impacted by lower gross margin due to unfavorable mix. Year-to-date Detection revenue of $59.5 million is down 13% from last year, while operating income of $6.3 million is down 40% from last year.","Operationally, the restructuring actions we announced in Q4 of last year are nearly complete and we are seeing meaningful benefits. As Andy mentioned, during the most recent quarter, we saw cost savings in excess of $6 million from these activities and anticipate benefits at this level in Q4 as well.","Restructuring costs during the quarter totaled $4.1 million before tax. $3.7 million of this amount was booked in our Instruments segment and was due to additional employee termination costs related to the closure of our former French operations.","During the quarter, we concluded the sale of certain noncore assets of our Optical Components Group for $12 million in cash. Post-sale, we retained the strategically important intellectual property and other assets associated with the fabrication of wafer-level optics. The transaction resulted in a pretax gain of approximately $4 million that is reflected in other income.","On a consolidated basis, during the quarter, we saw a 6% increase in 12-month backlog to $579 million. Year-to-date, backlog has increased by 18%.","Revenue from the U.S. Government declined by 24% compared to Q3 of last year and constituted 18.2% of consolidated quarterly revenue. Consolidated revenue from sources other than U.S. Government increased by 14% compared to Q3 of 2013. Year-to-date, U.S. Government revenue is down by 23%, while revenue from all other customers is up by 8%.","Cash flow from operations, including the impact of restructuring, was $33 million for the quarter, representing 62% of net income and the poorest showing in 3 years. This result was primarily due to higher accounts receivable in our Surveillance and Detection segments, which we expect to reverse during Q4. Year-to-date, cash flow from operations of $163.4 million represents 128% of net income.","Our Q3 tax provision of $17.6 million was equal to 25% of pretax net income, reflecting a 50 basis point uptick to our expected tax rate for the year.","During the quarter, we paid $14.2 million in dividends and spent an additional $33.6 million to repurchase 1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $33.62 per share.","Capital expenditures were $15.1 million in Q3 and are expected to tick up in Q4 as we progress the build-out of our new facility in Santa Barbara, California. We ended the quarter with cash on hand of $565 million, providing ample liquidity to continue returning capital to shareholders as well as to pursue strategic acquisitions. We continue to actively seek opportunities for strategic M&A to enhance our competitive position, expand and attract new business segments and effectively deploy our capital.","Today, we also announced our regular quarterly dividend of $0.10 per common share that will be payable on December 5 to shareholders of record as of November 18.","This concludes the summary of our third quarter financial results. Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover the segment operating highlights.","Thomas A. Surran","Thank you, Tony. We saw year-over-year revenue growth in 5 of our 6 segments in Q3. While Surveillance was the only segment with a decline in revenue versus last year, this segment grew revenue sequentially, improved operating margins and generated good order flow. Segment operating margin, excluding the Q3 pretax restructuring charge of $4.1 million, was 2 percentage points better than the third quarter of 2013. Total order backlog reached $579 million and was up materially over both the prior quarter and prior year.","Revenue in the Surveillance segment declined 6% versus the third quarter of 2013 due to higher shipments of MSC and its international variant in the prior year, as well as weaker revenue from man-portable systems this year. This softness was partially offset by good growth in our airborne systems.","Surveillance had strong order flow with a book-to-bill ratio of 1.3, resulting in backlog of $340 million, which is up $32 million over Q2 of this year. With cost savings from our restructuring initiatives, beneficial product mix shifts and improved product costs, Surveillance operating profit, excluding restructuring charges, grew 2% over the prior year and 56% over the last quarter.","The Instruments segment. Third quarter revenue grew 7% versus the third quarter of 2013. This growth was driven by our entry-level Ex-Series cameras and our automation products. This revenue growth, combined with improved gross margins and lower operating expenses, resulted in a 31% increase in operating profit, excluding restructuring charges, which represents a 600 basis point improvement.","The Instruments segment introduced a host of new products during Q3, including the 2 new Lepton-based products mentioned by Andy. The AX8 is a Lepton-based, small-format network thermal camera that supports multiple network protocols and video formats and is designed to provide automated equipment monitoring and pre-emergent fire detection. This product's small form factor is optimized for constrained environments, such as electrical panels, engine compartments and factory production lines. The AX8 also utilizes our proprietary MSX software, so users can stream pure thermal, pure visible or MSX video for reporting and monitoring.","The second Lepton-based product introduced was the TG165 handheld imaging thermometer. This rugged product mixes a non-radiometric thermal image of a scene with a spot temperature measurement of a laser thermometer. Priced at $499, the TG165 fits nicely between standard spot thermometers and our thermal imagers. Both of these products will begin shipping in volume during Q4.","Instruments also introduced the G300 a, a gas-imaging camera core for integration into either fixed or mobile enclosures to provide continuous monitoring of pipelines and installations. Also introduced were 4 new additions to the FLIR-branded test and measurement product line. We will be continuing to expand this product line as we establish it as a premier test and measurement brand.","The OEM and Emerging segment grew revenue 2% over the third quarter of last year. The introduction of the FLIR ONE added new revenue to the segment. However, that growth was partially offset by reductions in our intelligent traffic business and our low-light camera core products. In September, the OEM business launched our latest camera core called Muon. This low-cost thermal core utilizes industry-standard interfaces to ease system integration for OEM customers. The Muon core will begin shipping in Q4.","The Maritime segment achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 8%, driven by strong sales of Raymarines, multifunction displays, autopilots and instruments. Maritime's thermal camera revenue was flat versus last year. However, we built backlog during the period of the recently introduced MU, MV product line, which was recently awarded the 2014 National Marine Electronics Association, or NMEA, Technology Award. The MU, MV was 1 of 3 of our products winning awards from the NMEA, with the other 2 being the Evolution autopilot for Best Autopilot and the MV-604 thermal imager for Best Marine Specialty Product. Also introduced during the quarter was the CP200 sonar, which provides Raymarine's proprietary SideVision technology to network systems. Maritime operating margin increased over 300 basis points, resulting in a 57% growth of operating profit as compared to Q3 of 2013.","The Security segment grew revenue 37% versus Q3 of 2013, driven by strong results from all lines of business. Our thermal security business saw over 50% growth year-over-year, driven by high-end cooled camera projects.","Lorex-branded product revenue was up 30% versus the prior year as a result of an expanding retailer footprint and better sell-through.","Additionally, FLIR-branded visible security systems grew 37% versus Q3 of 2013, as we continue to penetrate the professional level of the market with our brand. Security operating margin improved 180 basis points in comparison to the prior year and 120 basis points compared to the prior quarter.","The Detection segment's third quarter revenue increased 6% versus the prior year, due primarily to shipments of low-rate initial production units to the DRSKO program. Detection operating margin was largely in line with the prior year, as restructuring cost savings experienced during the quarter were offset by weaker gross margins.","That concludes my summary of the segment's third quarter. I will now pass the call back to Andy.","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Tom. We're pleased with the results of this third quarter and are seeing the positive effects of our new organizational structure. Our key initiatives to drive long-term growth and profitability in the business continue to pay off. As we look forward, we expect to see further leverage -- we expect to further leverage our core technology platform, product innovation cadence and our rapidly developing marketing capability. I also want to thank the employees of FLIR for their continued support and dedication to executing against our growth plans.","That concludes our comments on the third quarter. We'll now open the call up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Andy, so what's your feeling on Surveillance now? I mean, you've had 2 straight quarters of pretty meaningful backlog growth. Does it feel like the business has about bottomed at this point? Should we expect to see it up year-over-year in the fourth quarter and going into 2015 with the backlog that you're seeing?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, a couple of things on that, Pete. First is that we did see good order flow in Q3, so more typical to what we would expect to see in a Q3 from a seasonality standpoint. I would say that that's what we're expecting for Q4 as well, and what I mean by that is more typical sort of, from a seasonal basis, orders in Q4. So it would be similar to what we saw in Q4 of last year. I think at this point, we're not in a position that we can call a bottom on this. There's still a fair amount of uncertainty in terms of funding availability where we've seen strength in the Middle East region, which has been a trend that we've seen over the last several quarters, but we're also seeing a little bit of weakness in the European region. So -- and I would say that the U.S. DoD environment continues to be one that we're concerned about in terms of its predictability.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay, got it. Understood. And then one last one, I'll hop back in the queue. Security, the growth has obviously been kind of blistering the last 2 quarters and you mentioned all 3 of the lines of business are up. Can you get to -- help us understand what's driving that? Is that all just -- I know Lorex you've been building out distribution. You've got some new product. Can you give us some more color maybe on what the driver is now and how long it can last?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Sure, Pete. I'll mention a couple of things, and I'll flip it over to Tom for a couple of comments as well. Lorex, the -- in the Security segment, as you mentioned, we've got a 3-segment approach to that market, and that is the Lorex brand for consumer, the FLIR brand for professional video and integrator class of product and then the FLIR thermal products. And all 3 of those cylinders are firing well at this point. It's fueled by good demand, so we've got a good product offering and value proposition there. It's fueled by new product development, so we've been -- had a fairly rich cadence of new product development there. And then we've also been building out our distribution strategy fairly aggressively there. We saw good growth in the first 3 quarters of the year. I think it will probably cool off a little bit in Q4 based on our current forecasts. But overall, we'll see the year finish quite strong. Tom, you want to add any comment?","Thomas A. Surran","Yes. The one part of it was the question about the sustainability of that growth. Clearly, the growth will not be perfectly linear, but we expect that the growth to be a long-term phenomenon. We are introducing a number of new products to all 3 of the markets that we're targeting, both the home, the professional visible, as well as the thermal that we think are going to be driving that growth. And as Andy mentioned, we are expanding our distribution outlets, both in the number of outlets we have in the markets we currently serve, as well as expanding geographically.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Tom, let me just do one follow-up. When do you drop a thermal core or a Lepton into the Lorex systems?","Thomas A. Surran","We would have liked to have had that already out there. But what we did is we pulled back and we're going to be introducing it here in the fourth quarter. And one of the things we've added to it is a multi-protocol kind of interface, so that one product can be used by an installer to have an analog stream of video, a digital stream of video, or a digital over coax stream with one product, and we'll have that here in this fourth quarter.","Andrew C. Teich","Pete just one clarification, that will come out under the FLIR brand, so we don't yet have a defined date when you will see thermal products under the Lorex brand [ph].","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Andy, I wondered if you could just elaborate on the comment you just made there about still being concerned about U.S. Government revenue. Obviously, sequestration's still flowing through, and so it's not the best backdrop. But you can see where sequestration ends, you can see the bottom in the total budget. Presumably, you can see that in some of your programs. You had good order flow. So I'm just wondering if that is something you see from a budgetary perspective in your specific programs or something your customer is saying to you versus just you're saying that because this business has been so brutal that you're just being cautious and you don't want to get ahead of yourself.","Andrew C. Teich","Well, some of your last statement in there is correct. But I would say 2 things. I don't think that we can clearly see the end effects of sequestration here. That's not what we're hearing from our customers. I think that they're increasingly concerned about it, having an increasing impact in 2015 and in 2016 as the full effects of sequestration roll out. The second issue is, is our conservatism, and I would say some level of concern in the space is also based on just trends that we're seeing in the marketplace, which are programs that get delayed and the lack of new program starts involving ISR technology. Generally, we feel -- we still feel that the equipment feeding into the ISR space has got a good future in terms of the futility. It's a great force multiplying technology. And as I've stated many times before on these calls, we very much believe in the concept of fielding equals funding, and FLIR technology was extensively fielded in the most recent conflicts, but that has yet to drive defined and funded programs of record that we see increasing our revenue in the near future.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So what has the peak to trough been now in your U.S. Government revenue?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I'll get that while we're -- Noah, it's Tony. I'll get that while we're talking here. I mean, quarterly, it was -- I can go back to...","Andrew C. Teich","If we look at it as a percentage of revenue, is that what you're asking, Noah?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Anthony L. Trunzo","So in\u2026","Andrew C. Teich","That was the highest on these.","Anthony L. Trunzo","On a quarterly basis, the highest we ever got was 48% in Q1 of 2009. And in that quarter, that was nearly $300 million in U.S. Government revenue.","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, we had 2 things going on there. We had the rate program at its peak in terms of revenues, number one. And then on the other side, there was some economic downturn drag on the commercial businesses at that time.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Yes, I guess the real question is what's the peak to trough been excluding that? But, I mean, we have the numbers, and I can take that offline. I also wanted to ask you if you could just speak to what you're seeing in the commercial businesses in Europe broadly, just given what we're all seeing from a macro perspective there.","Andrew C. Teich","Well, at this point, we're certainly a bit concerned about what the trends are going forward in the European market. We haven't yet seen any meaningful effect from that. I would say that Q3 executed within our expectations on the commercial side of our business for Europe, but we're a bit concerned about what we might see in Q4.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So you haven't actually seen much yet, you're saying? You haven't seen much disruption recently?","Andrew C. Teich","No.","Thomas A. Surran","No, we haven't.","Andrew C. Teich","You're talking about the commercial businesses there?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Tim Quillin from Stephens Inc.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Could you give us some sense of how we should think about margins as we progress from here? So it looked like you saw quite a bit the benefits of your restructuring in the quarter, and I think you said you expect that $6 million in savings to carry on. But -- and do you have any kind of gross margin or operating margin targets you could share with us or ways that you could help us think about where margins might go next year or the year after?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Tim, it's Tony. The way the business has evolved, you sort of have to look at margins on a segment basis. And the mix between segments is going to have some impact on margin. I would say, overall, from a gross margin standpoint, we'd like to continue to progress margins up, and we'd like to see them trend up back over the 50% line. I was -- just as we were getting ready for the call, I was looking at our sequential numbers, and we haven't -- the last time we had gross margins over 50% was in Q1 of 2013. I'd like to see us get up over that again. It's obviously going to depend on mix. We've got some businesses that have gross margins in the 30s, and we've got some businesses that have gross margins well into the 50s and products that have margins well above that. But overall, I think we'd like to see an upward trend in gross margins across the businesses. In terms of spending, we're going to try to grow spending slower than we're growing -- than we grow revenue. The benefits of the restructuring have been masked a little bit by the fact that particularly in Q3 -- last Q3, we had a slight reversal, basically a slight credit, globally in the company related to bonus accrual for the year. This year, we had an expense because the business is doing better. But overall, the restructuring, I think, is going to drive more than that $6 million a quarter as we roll into 2015. And I think you'll see a lot of what I'll call soft benefit from the standpoint of improved documentation of products, improved quality of products, maybe lower warranty costs, maybe some additional production efficiency associated with the fact that we've got fewer, small, relatively high-cost locations, and we've brought our production into a more consolidated, more sophisticated, better cost structure kind of environment.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And then maybe I'll have 1.5 follow-ups we'll call it. But first, you explained in terms of FLIR ONE the primary benefit of that product is in branding and exposure. But maybe if you could talk about how that has gone so far, the sales of that product and then maybe sales targets or where you are going to be relative to breakeven on it. And then the half question is if you could just discuss the currency impacts that you saw or might see in the future.","Andrew C. Teich","Well, I'll start with that, Tim. This is Andy. The -- in terms of sales volumes for FLIR ONE, we don't want to talk about specific volumes. But I would say that the sales of the product to date have been within our expectations. The channel development of the product has been going well. We've seen very good sales of the product online through the flir.com channel and through the Apple channels that we have. And at this point, the product has only been available from a geographic standpoint, largely in the U.S. and then we just recently brought a couple of channels on in Europe, and we'll continue that geographic deployment in Q4. The other issue though with FLIR ONE has been its exposure from a brand standpoint, which has been quite successful. And I'll actually pass it over to Travis to talk about that. But then you brought up one other thing, before I pass it over to Travis, which is the issue of breakeven, and that's not an issue. I mean, we're well through breakeven on the product right now. Financially, it's been very successful. So Travis, why don't you talk a little bit about the exposure metrics that we've seen on the product.","Travis Merrill","Sure. Thanks, Andy. As Andy indicated and as we've stated, really, since we introduced this product, one of the major objectives of it is really to raise our brand awareness, as well as introduce a lot of new customers to thermal imaging technology. We feel like thus far that's been going extremely well. We've seen essentially a doubling in the traffic on flir.com. Year-over-year, if you were just to look at Q3 period, which has been very encouraging, a lot of that has been driven by FLIR ONE as well as some development that we've done on our website and enhancements we've made to our website. Secondly, I would mention as well, just in terms of the media effort that we've had around it. First, in terms of paid media, we've developed a lot of video, both sort of educational as well as more consumer-focused humorous video. We've seen in excess of 20 million views on video related to FLIR ONE, both FLIR-developed as well as third-party video. So that's also been a banner for this company in terms of the number of eyeballs that we've received just over the past few months. And then the third thing I would mention is just around PR. It's also largely been the highest acclaimed launch that we've had at FLIR, and we've received over 600 articles on the PR side. So all of that combined really equals a lot of new people who know about FLIR, a lot of new people who are learning about thermal imaging technology. And from the data that we've seen thus far on the buyers of the FLIR ONE, the majority of those are using it for personal use. So we're really opening a new market and that was really the primary goal from the start.","Anthony L. Trunzo","And then, Tim, relative to your question about currency. This is Tony. If you look at Q3 of last year compared to Q3 of this year, currency was about a 20 basis point headwind to revenue, so not a huge impact. Obviously, the September strength of the dollar had a little bit more impact. So if you look at Q2 of this year to Q3 of this year, it was about a 1.3 percentage point headwind to revenue. I think you notice that we have a fair bit of costs in non-U.S. currencies. We've got a fair bit of euro costs, some sterling costs and pretty substantial costs in Swedish kroner. So the impact, when you flow it all the way through to P&L, tends to be muted by that natural hedge. But the number Q3-to-Q3 was -- frankly, was a little less than I had expected given what had happened with the dollar in the most recent quarter.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","The question, I guess, maybe for Tom. In the Instruments segment, you talked about, I believe, firefighting and the automation product revenue being up very strong. What's behind that? Is there -- I know you'd changed some of the distribution channels in firefighting going back. And maybe a little more color on that first.","Thomas A. Surran","Sure. Two -- so actually, the answer's just kind of the same for both, and it's the products. I mean, we've introduced 2 new products already to fire. And so year-over-year, we're gaining traction in the marketplace, creating greater awareness. And people who are experiencing the product are realizing the caliber and the quality that it offers to the firefighter. And in automation, we've introduced new products that are expanding the capability. Even prior to the AX8, we had some new offerings that were lower cost, had better integrations. We've modified our software. We've made it easier for installers to get information out of the units. And the combination of the stronger products has driven that revenue growth. And as we look forward to both of those markets, we're going to also have some new product introductions coming up in the next year in both segments that we think will further drive revenue growth.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And, Andy, just unrelated to that. On the OEM and Emerging, part of the strategy with Lepton is obviously to drive adoption for the Lepton sensor with OEMs. Can you update us on any color on the discussions with that and how that roadmap looks?","Andrew C. Teich","So 2 aspects to the roadmap. One is the market development, and we continue to develop new OEM partners for the Lepton product. And there is, as we've mentioned on previous calls, a fairly long time cycle related to that in terms of their integration of the product into their end systems and bringing those to market. But we've got several vectors that we're pursuing there, and the interest continues to be quite high on the Lepton product. The second area is with regard to product development, and we also have mentioned this previously, but I will underscore it, that the Lepton is the first product to come out, in that family of product, utilizing the core technologies that we've developed to enable that low-cost core. And we will have subsequent introductions around that product line in 2015. At this point, we've got Lepton available in a couple of different variants with different wafer level, optic configurations, offering different fields of view that allow the product to be fielded in different applications, and a couple of those we're using ourself right now in our security and automation base products.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Jim Ricchiuti from Needham & Company.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the OEM and Emerging markets. The deceleration in growth that you experienced in this past quarter, how much of that is just due to the fact that you had it looks like a pretty strong quarter a year ago? But just in general, can you comment on that? And then I have a follow-up, Andy.","Andrew C. Teich","Well, I think that the growth that we saw in OEM and Emerging came from each of the segments within there. We saw -- there was no real standout in OEM. Tom?","Thomas A. Surran","Yes, I can add some comments. So it is a lumpy business. So I think Andy has covered this many times about the nature of that business. And in particular, what we saw in the recent quarter was a bit of softness in our cooled cores for that customer. Now the timing of that particular customer, both in the product deliveries as well as the service for that customer is such that, that also is lumpy. And we have continuing business, and we would see that. Overall, we don't see other than -- actually, in our uncooled cores, we actually see fairly good strength in the base that we've seen as well as the take rates those customers that are taking.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes, there was good volume growth in uncooled cores. There's very good volume growth there. And as Tom said, we mentioned in the script that the intelligent traffic business, which is part of that segment didn't have particularly a great quarter. There were some deliveries in Q3 of last year that were pretty strong in that business that we didn't see in Q3 of this year. And the FLIR ONE is in that business, so it did -- it added to the revenue. And as Andy indicated, it's making money. But on an overall basis, the operating margin you see from that isn't quite what you would see, at least not yet, that you'd see from our cooled and uncooled cores business.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then just switching gears, just more broadly to the range of revenues that you're suggesting for Q4 and it's fairly typical wide range. But I wonder if you can comment a little bit more about what areas of the commercial business that there's perhaps more variability from where you sit today relative to your guidance?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I think the variability is not on the commercial side of the business, really at all, Jim.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you think it's -- so it's primarily on government? That's...","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes.","Andrew C. Teich","Yes.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes. I think we have a pretty tight range around what we think we're going to see from our commercial businesses.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And can you elaborate on what you're seeing in the government side that -- is there any one particular couple of programs? Or is it just more broadly, just in general, the environment with the U.S. DoD and maybe some international customers?","Anthony L. Trunzo","So a couple of things. Number one, you've seen -- it's interesting, in Q3, I think some of this data is in the deck that we put on the website, which I hope everybody finds to be useful. It's the first time we've done it, and we're anxious to get your feedback because I think it's something we'll do going forward, but there were not a significant number of large orders in the -- particularly in the Surveillance business in Q3. The bookings were -- they were pretty broad based, which is a good thing. But the U.S. Government portion of that business last quarter was only 33%, which is really low. International deliveries in Q3 and in Q4 are going to be substantial. And there are, I would always say, incremental risks with respect to timing in those kinds of businesses. You have acceptance exposure. You have licensing exposure. And even when you have the backlog, there's some variability in terms of establishing exactly what the timing of delivery is going to be. Tom or Andy or...","Andrew C. Teich","That's perfect. Yes, that's exactly the issue that international deliveries have more risk associated with them than U.S. deliveries, and that's what gives us the range of revenue.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Michael Ciarmoli from KeyBanc.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe if, Andy, we could stay on the commercial side and maybe look at the performance of some of the international markets. I mean, I guess, your European revenue's flat year-over-year and you've got a pretty tough comp. I think you did $110 million fourth quarter last year. What are the bookings trends telling you? I mean, do you think you can continue to remain flat in that sector or in that region? I mean, just trying to get a sense of what we've seen with the erosion in global growth and how that's going to impact kind of the go-forward business even in 4Q and maybe next year.","Andrew C. Teich","Well, so given what we're seeing going on in Europe right now, it is an area of concern for us in terms of growth. But that said, we saw better growth than we expected in the U.S. market in Q3 and we also saw good growth coming out of APAC. So at this point, we factor that into our plans for Q4. We're not expecting to see growth in the European market in Q4, but we do expect to see continued growth in the U.S. market. We combine -- as we look at the businesses, we combine Middle East together with Europe, so we get a little bit of offset from the Middle East region as we look at EMEA in total, where we are continuing to see growth. But we're being, I think, appropriately cautious about what we expect to see in Europe in Q4.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. What about APAC as well? I mean, we're certainly seeing slowing there. I mean, what are your bookings trends telling you on a sequential basis?","Andrew C. Teich","APAC had a good quarter in Q3. At this point, coming back from our sales forces, they're a bit more conservative about Q4, and that we've also rolled into our plans at this point.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, okay. And then just to get back maybe on Jim's line of questioning. Instruments declining on a sequential basis, I mean, was that just more product lumpiness? Or anything jumping out there that caused that deceleration or that decline on a sequential basis?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I think you're looking pretty deeply into the details. It went from $86.3 million -- no hang on. It went $83.9 million to $82.5 million.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes. Well, I mean, even that, Tony, I mean, it hasn't grown. It hasn't grown all year on a sequential basis.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Instruments?","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Anthony L. Trunzo","It's up 6% year-to-date.","Andrew C. Teich","Yes, yes.","Anthony L. Trunzo","I mean, Instruments is typically...","Andrew C. Teich","This quarter was...","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Well, on a sequential, I mean, it's basically been running about $83 million, $84 million.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Which is not unusual. I mean, you look at last year, it went $78 million, $80 million, $77 million in the first 3 quarters.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Okay. So nothing unusual there? I mean, even with the product introduction, everything performing as you guys expect?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes, nothing unusual there.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Jonathan Ho from William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just wanted to start out with sort of the new products that you guys are going be introducing, particularly on the spot thermometer side of things, as well as, I guess, the new industrial types of application. How big of a market do you think that can be? And sort of what's the time frame for the ramp that you're expecting, maybe size of revenue? Just anything that you can give in terms of color around what the opportunity looks like?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, the -- as you mentioned, there are 2 products that we're talking about here. First is the TG165. And the purpose of that product is to fill the gap in, in between a spot temperature gun and a full-featured thermal imager. So this is a new category for us and a new segment that we're addressing. The initial orders for the product have been quite strong. But largely, that's been channel fill. So at this point, I think it's too early for us to really understand what adoption rates are going to be, but the distribution channel really likes the product. So I would say in terms of a ramp of initial volume, it's one of the highest that we've ever seen in the Instruments segment. The second one is the AX8, which is a new low-cost product for automation and pre-emergent fire detection application. And this is an application that we've seen availability in that application for about a decade now, and Lepton really enables the price point that we believe could spark considerable demand in that space. We haven't started shipping that product yet. We'll start shipping it later in Q4. I don't expect that we're going to see strong results from that product in '14. It'll really be a 2015 product. It'll be largely channel fill in some initial market development of that product this year. Given that it is an automation machine vision product and some of the applications in manufacturing, that it'll suit, it'll require a system integrator involved in the loop to develop the complete closed loop solution for it. However, we also see applications for this product in data server rooms, engine-ing room monitoring, other equipment monitoring where it can be used as a stand-alone product with the basic built-in analytics capabilities that are in the product today.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And then you guys have talked about sort of doubling in unit volumes, pretty substantial increases in sort of the number of products that you've been selling. And yet, we haven't seen the revenue sort of growth rates on the commercial side pick up relative to that. I just want to get a sense of, number one, is this because there's still slowness in the high-end segment of the products? Or have we reached a point where we're going to start to see a bit more of an inflection point and these lower-end products that are presumably higher volume start to drive the growth starting in 2015? I just want to get a sense for how you guys think about that.","Andrew C. Teich","Well, Jonathan, I think you've hit on the 2 points. We haven't seen strong growth in the higher-end products. There's been slow growth there, and we do have some new product introductions that are coming in that space that we feel will stimulate some additional demand, both on the replacement cycle and as those people who have bought the lower-end products upgrade to higher-end capability because we have seen that historically as well. The other issue is, is that we do believe that these markets are still very thinly penetrated and that the overall awareness building that we're doing, both through the deployment of these low-end products directly in the market and through brand building in adjacent markets with products like FLIR ONE and in the security space, that ultimately, that will help drive demand to more of an inflection point in terms of revenue related to the volumes.","Anthony L. Trunzo","And, Jonathan, it's Tony. I mean, we'll see 60%, 65% growth in uncooled units this year, something in that -- no, a little less?","Andrew C. Teich","Just a tad less.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Something in that area. And the -- I think that's in line with what our expectations are going forward as well is to see that kind of unit volume growth. I think it's -- as Andy said, it's pretty early. I mean, if you look at TG165, it's almost a completely new product category for us, and it's Lepton-enabled, the same with AX8. I think the same thing is going to happen in the Security business. The high end is going to -- we're going to have to continue to push there to keep that business where it is and growing. But I don't know, I kind of like where we are in terms of unit volumes and the progress we're making at the lower price points.","Andrew C. Teich","Yes. And I think it's important to keep it in context; that Q4 will really be the first quarter that we'll be shipping Lepton product into our existing segments. Prior to that, Lepton shipments have only been through FLIR ONE, which is a new -- completely new category for us.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Jeff Kessler from Imperial Capital.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Even before the -- because you've introduced Lepton before the AZIS [ph] show, there's quite a bit of buzz about what would eventually come into Lorex, which hasn't come in yet, but what was going to go into the high-end -- higher-end cameras in Security. And clearly, what's happened is that there's been a lot of buzz in the security industry now about getting lower-cost thermal imaging into the cameras. Along with that, though, has come your major competitor in the area that you address [ph] as well as a lot of other small companies with a lot of unknown names have been trying to press lower-cost thermal cores when they can get them and imaging products, whatever quality they are. The question is, is to protect your brand, protect your high end and your product, what are you doing to build up an ecosystem and build up sell-through to the integrators to make sure that you're the guys who are chosen and that the other guys who are chosen are not chosen because they're just good enough; that even though your product may be cheaper or -- and it may not be cheaper in 6 months because they're going to just drop the price. And so the question is, is essentially, how do you protect your channel to make sure that the FLIR brand is the one that is continually being chosen going forward? Because it looks as if the security industry is going to -- is taking on this product and taking on for quite a long time and integrate it into visible light cameras as well.","Andrew C. Teich","Sure, Jeff. I'll mention 3 things here. And then I'll pass it over to Tom for some additional commentary. But 3 things come to mind right off the bat. Number one is, is our product breadth. FLIR is the only company out of any of those that you mentioned that offers a complete suite of products using our Control the Corners strategy. So we have everything from entry level to the highest performance, multi-sensor, cool product on the marketplace. So it's a one-stop shopping environment for an integrator. The second issue is, is the features and functionality. We have led the industry in developing features for these products, features like our patented MSX, features like our MPX, digital-over-coax capability, 3-in-1 camera signal capability that Tom alluded to earlier in his comments. And then the third issue is, is the launch of the FLIR cloud, which is part of our ecosystem for that market, where we will have cloud-based analytics, storage and a recurring monthly revenue model for our users that give an enhanced value in terms of both analytics and storage for our systems. Tom, anything else to add to that?","Thomas A. Surran","Yes. So part of the question is the fact of kind of a price war. I guess you were a little bit alluding to that somehow if you look at that marketplace and you say if someone wants to compete on price, how are we positioned? I believe we're positioned extremely well. We have the strength of -- the scale that we have in all of our thermal products. We have the technologies that we've brought to all of our markets, and we've talked about Lepton. We've talked about some of our optics. And then just to echo what Andy was saying about all right, once you go past the price and the cost and our ability to position, we're creating a product and a strategy and a product roadmap that really kind of take the thermal and then leverages what you can then do with that information and how that can be deployed in a situation to create greater awareness for the user, especially in the security market.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","Yes. There hasn't been anybody up until now who's launched any kind of analytics or, let's say, full-blown end-to-end solution around thermal yet. It's all been around the camera itself.","Thomas A. Surran","Correct, yes.","Jeffrey T. Kessler - Imperial Capital, LLC, Research Division","One quick follow-up, and that is, Andy, can you -- any update on the automotive side, in broadening your value -- your distribution base?","Andrew C. Teich","Sure. So I don't want to talk too much about our customers' customers. But we would expect, this is, again, kind of a stair-step growth that'll be going on. And the next stair step will occur with 2016 models. So for the first part of this next year, we will see relatively stable volumes, and then we would see another step-up on the stairway as we -- not only this piece but then as we look even farther forward for the next generation of technologies that'll be deployed in multiple automobiles.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from William Lee from Oppenheimer.","William Lee - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","On Raymarine, third quarter's typically the seasonally weakest quarter. And given the strength this quarter, was there any pull forward of sales from fourth quarter into third quarter? How should we think about the cadence going forward?","Andrew C. Teich","It was actually -- it was a very good quarter. And I think that if you look at kind of what drove the growth, it wasn't necessarily a pull forward. And typically, Q3 and Q4 are both pretty soft quarters, typically and they're typically of similar size. It wasn't a pull forward. It was some growth in the products. The MFD product line has done very well. The introduction and the expansion into the freshwater market has done very well for us. We're going to continue to pull on that lever. Our autopilot, which is the Evolution that's won the award recently is -- the awareness of the performance of that product is getting out, and that's a longer sales cycle type product and awareness product. And as that's gained traction, we saw nice growth there as well. So this was not just a pull forward. I can't say that 1 order or 2 orders didn't get pulled one way or the other, but that's not what this was.","William Lee - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Right. So it sounds like it was helped by new product launches. And just a quick question. On the Optical Component sale, was there any revenue attached to that?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes. There was, William. Year-to-date, it was $3-ish million, kind of in that ZIP code. It was actually -- it might have been a little bit more than that.","Andrew C. Teich","No, it's more like $6 million.","Andrew C. Teich","Couple of million a quarter. Yes, right, it's couple of million a quarter. Sold that business in the middle of the quarter in August. We did have revenue in this most recent quarter. But we won't, obviously, have any revenue in Q4. And probably, I should probably maybe give another highlight on that transaction though because it was one that ended up both strategically and financially pretty solid. Yes, 2014 year-to-date, OCG revenue -- sorry, William, I've got somebody handing me a number, was $8.8 million, so pretty robust, more than I recalled actually. But we acquired a group of assets a little over a year ago, owned them for about a year. We paid $15 million for them. And the critical technology was the wafer-level optics that we were -- that we wanted and the intellectual property around wafer-level optics that we wanted in association with Lepton and to continue with the development of our broad-based optics capabilities. We were able to retain over 100 patents and all of the intellectual property and manufacturing capabilities that we wanted, while selling the part of the business that was not core for $12 million. And in the year that we owned it, the profits that we made on that business nearly made up the gap between the $15 million and the $12 million. So all in all, we feel like that was a pretty good transaction from a financial perspective. But more importantly, we have been able to retain a pretty substantial chunk of very important intellectual property.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Pete Skibitski from Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Yes, guys, follow-up. Test and measurement, I think maybe it was Andy that mentioned early on that it sounds like you guys are maybe seeing something in the market there and that you plan to do maybe kind of a meaningful build-out. Can you add some color there on what you guys are seeing?","Andrew C. Teich","Build-out in what particular market?","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","The test and measurement units within -- I think it's within Instruments.","Andrew C. Teich","Oh, so a couple of things that are going on in that segment, Pete. One is, is that relative to the build-out, we launched, about a year ago, our -- the FLIR-branded test and measurement line with -- I think initially we launched 5 products in that space. And during the most recent quarter, I think there were 5 more products that were launched to help expand that line, and that's something that we will continue to do. These are premium-oriented products. It's -- these are products that are very rugged, very well designed, feature rich. And when compared with other products on the market from a sort of high-level specification standpoint, they tend to -- they're very high-performance products. The -- we consider the TG165 to be part of that line as well, so that will bring thermal imaging capability into that line as a new capability. And we just see it as a marketplace that has some opportunity for us, and it's a good extension of our Instruments business to extend to that lower corner. There are other test and measurement tools that would be benefited by the inclusion of thermal imaging that we'll be looking at.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay, very good. And then just the last one, you guys talked earlier about the high end of the market. It sounds like there's some high-end products coming out. Should we think -- are you working on a new high-end core as well? Or just taking kind of some of your existing high-end cores and maybe just adding some features to them?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, we've stated, as part of our strategy and one of the 6 pillars of our strategy is this Control the Corners concept, and we've spent a lot of time talking about the low end of the corner, which the Lepton core fulfills. But yes, we're also looking at the higher end as well. There's certainly opportunity there when you get to the higher performance cores. Obviously, we've got opportunity for higher price points, better performance, longer-range performance. And the customer groups that we serve are interested in those features, so you will see introductions in that space in the coming year.","Operator","Our final question today is a follow-up from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Tony, can you walk us back through why the company is choosing to keep running the balance sheet in a net cash position and not more efficiently utilize the balance sheet, especially given it's a pretty cash-generative company?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Well. So a couple of things. I think if you look back over the last 4, 5 years, the amount of capital that we've returned is a pretty substantial amount of capital. This quarter, we returned $50 million back to shareholders, give back over the last several years. It's a large 9-figure amount. So we've not increased our cash balances recently. We've continued to put money back into the hands of the shareholders, and we're going to continue to do that as part of the strategy. But we -- as I indicated, and it was pretty brief, we continue to believe that there's the opportunity to grow this company through acquisition. Specifically, some of our commercial segments have the real potential to be larger through M&A, and some of that M&A could be substantial. And I think we feel like we want to be in a position to act on that to the extent that it becomes available. I will say that over the last couple of quarters, we've passed on a couple of transactions, but not -- more because of the quality of the assets than it was really the strategic fit. And Andy can speak to this. But I think as a management and leadership team, we would like to find the opportunity to do more M&A, particularly to augment businesses like Instruments and Security, where we see some real opportunities for growth, and frankly, potentially, in emerging markets as well. So I don't think we're being overly conservative. We talked years ago about the fact that when we went out and sold bonds, we didn't want to do that until we got to an investment-grade credit rating and I think we want to run the company with an investment-grade credit profile. We've clearly got some excess capital relative to that profile today. But we'd like to find a way to deploy it strategically, and feel like there are opportunities likely to come up to do that.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess, I was a little surprised the buyback went down sequentially because the stock was down, and you guys have the super-impressive chart of regularly buying the stock low, which a lot of others don't show. Shall we look for that to step up in the fourth quarter? Or is the answer to that similar to what you just said, where you're keeping that lower than maybe otherwise would because you are keeping an eye on M&A?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I guess the answer I would give you that you could interpolate through our thinking is it was painful to watch the stock slide in September, particularly in the latter part of September and not be in a position to buy it back because of our fairly rigorous approach to...","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, right where you would normally buy it was...","Anthony L. Trunzo","Right. Yes, exactly.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then what's the tax rate we should look for in the fourth quarter?","Anthony L. Trunzo","So our tax rate for the year -- through the first 2 quarters, we had assumed that the effective tax rate, excluding discretes was 23.75%. We ticked it up 50 basis points in Q3 to 23% -- I'm sorry, 24.25%. There was a catch-up associated with that of about $1 million from Q1 and Q2, so the tax rate for the quarter came in right around 25%. You should see it be probably 75 basis points lower than that in Q4.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then should we just run that forward?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I think that's a good ZIP code to be in. Yes, I mean, we'll continue to do some planning work. We are clearly influenced by the mix of our income because there's some pretty significant differences in tax rates in the jurisdictions where we trade. But I think that's a reasonable go-forward number now.","Andrew C. Teich","Great. Well, thank you, everyone. Again, we were pleased with the execution in Q3 and we continue -- we've got some work ahead of us for Q4. But at this point, I'm very pleased with the way the management team has been executing in a way that it's been built out and we'll look forward to talking to you about our results after the New Year. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and have a wonderful day.

First Quarter 2013 Earnings Results Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Wit Davis, Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary for FLIR Systems, Inc. Thank you. Mr. Davis, you may begin.","William W. Davis","Good morning, everyone. Before we begin this conference call, I need to remind you that other than statements as to historical facts, statements made on this conference call are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and are based on our current expectations.","Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, believes, estimates and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. All of these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.","Please refer to the press release we issued earlier today for a description of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forecast. The forward-looking statements we make today speak as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","Let me now turn the call over to Earl Lewis, Chairman and CEO of FLIR Systems. Earl?","Earl R. Lewis","Thank you, Wit, and welcome to FLIR's first quarter 2013 earnings call. We finished the quarter with revenue of $349 million and earnings per share of $0.353 or approximately 1 halfway between consensus of $0.35 and consensus of $0.36.","We had a 13% increase in total from last year. Revenues were unchanged versus the prior year, as we saw slow or delayed deliveries, primarily to our U.S. customers. The total company backlog of $505 million at the end of the quarter was up 10% over the first quarter of 2012.","We improved both our gross and our operating margins from the first quarter of 2012. Commercial Systems' organic operating margin was up over 2 percentage points, excluding the impact of Lorex and Traficon, while our Government Systems improved its operating margin by 1.5 percentage points over Q1 of 2012. These results were in line with our expectations for the quarter.","The work we have done to lower cost has helped us maintain our strong margins in a challenging environment. The current state of the markets has also created opportunities for us.","In April, we borrowed $150 million under a 6-year loan that added very low cost capital to our balance sheet. We continue to generate strong cash flow, with Q1 operating cash flow up over 26% from the prior year, representing 120% of our net income. We intend to deploy this cash in a balanced and opportunistic way, bringing long-term results to our shareholders.","During the first quarter, we repurchased 3.8 million shares for $108 million and paid $13 million in dividends and invested $50 million into the business through R&D and capital investments.","Our outlook for 2013 has not changed. While we know markets -- some markets will recover faster than others, over different periods of time, we expect to see a gradual recovery out of the troughs that most of our markets have experienced lately. In addition, we are looking forward to introducing some new products that will help spur growth in the second half of this year. We continue to expect the year-end results to come in between $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion in revenue and earnings of between $1.56 and $1.66 per diluted share.","Andy Teich, our new CEO in waiting, will now summarize Commercial Systems division performance for the first quarter. Andy?","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Earl. The Commercial Systems division finished the first quarter of 2013 with a 5% increase in revenue and 6% increase in operating profit compared to the prior year. Organically, the Commercial Systems division saw a decline of 6% in revenue, but increased operating margin by over 2 percentage points versus last year.","The Thermal Vision and Measurement business experienced softness in the high-end government-related Cores & Components business, while Raymarine saw a continued but slowing declines in the EMEA region, as well as lower retail channel orders in the U.S. Raymarine did see good growth in Asia-Pacific, as well as in the non-retail channels in the U.S.","The Commercial Systems division Q1 bookings increased 6% over the prior year. TVM bookings dollars increased 11% over the prior year, while Raymarine bookings declined by 8%. TVM's thermography line of business saw bookings dollars decline 7% from a year ago, primarily due to a contracting European economy and a weak building market in the U.S.","During the first quarter, we launched our new K-Series fire fighting camera in Europe and, this week, in the U.S. The K-Series is a highly recognized thermal camera that is designed and tested to help first responders find people, locate hotspots and see through smoke under extreme heat and moisture situations. The response thus far has been very positive, and we look forward to launching the product to the rest of the world later this year.","TVM's Cores & Components line of business was negatively affected by lower order activity from large customers in the U.S. Order activity for [indiscernible] course was strong, however, with units booked growing over 60% versus the last year.","Organically, Security line of business bookings increased dramatically compared to last year and more than tripled when you include Lorex. The addition of Lorex is proving to be a very good combination, and we are excited about plan, design and feature revision that we expect will be highly attractive to the security market.","With the addition of our other acquisition, Traficon, we've created a new line of business within TVM called Intelligent Traffic Systems, or ITS. This business will be focused on providing traffic monitoring solutions for stoplight control and traffic incident detection applications. Traficon saw nearly 15% growth in bookings over its first quarter of last year, driven by $2 million in orders for traffic and tunnel projects in Asia.","As we anticipated, TVM's maritime business bookings were lower due to strong order from the cruise lines in Q1 last year in the U.S. and in Europe, partially offset by strength in the APAC region.","During the quarter, we launched 3 new products: a new fixed mount, low-priced thermal camera, the MV-Series, a third generation of our popular maritime handheld; and a high-end, multi-payload system that includes a long-range cool thermal imager called the MU-Series.","The Personal Vision Systems line of business was equal on a bookings basis compared to last year, as strong -- we had a strong Q4 in APAC and EMEA, which grew in demand for the first quarter. The Americas region grew bookings over 20% year-over-year, however.","Raymarine bookings dollars declined 8% versus the first quarter of 2012, mainly due to lower bookings in the U.S. retail channel and a decline in EMEA. The Asia-Pacific region posted good growth, however, and we are seeing Europe begin to level off.","During Q1, we launched our new Dragonfly sonar GPS unit, targeted at the freshwater fishing market. This unit represents not only a new market segment for Raymarine, but also the first product to feature our powerful new CHIRP DownVision capability. This powerful new imaging modality greatly enhances sonar accuracy and imaging fidelity. The Dragonfly also debuts an enhanced operating system that further improves ease-of-use and intuitive operation.","Commercial Systems' first quarter performance correlated closely to regional economic indicators. We've made adjustments to deploy greater resources in the regions that are growing and adjusting our spending at lower growth regions.","Lorex and Traficon did well in Q1, and the addition of their products has already benefited our business. We see signs of returning growth. But until it's reflected in our order book, we will continue to manage cost to maintain strong profitability.","I would also like to take a moment to thank Earl and the Board for their vote of confidence in me. Earl has been a strong mentor to me over the course of the last 12-plus years. And during that period, he's equipped me with the tools and vision to take this business to the next level. I look forward to continue and working closely with him as this transition takes place.","With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Bill Sundermeier, who'll discuss the results of our Government Systems division. Bill?","William A. Sundermeier","Thank you, Andy. Government Systems division revenue was down 6% versus Q1 of 2012, while operating margins improved by 1.5 percentage points.","Backlog for the division at the end of Q1 was $334 million. Expected stock order flow in the U.S. was partially offset by good international bookings. International orders accounted for 60% of total bookings in Q1.","The Surveillance segment finished the quarter with a backlog of $245 million. As expected, the quarter proved difficult for our U.S. customers, who faced the sequestration and continuing resolution uncertainties for most of the quarter.","At the end of the quarter, we had a last-minute delay of a major order for additional review that substantially impacted our bookings forecast. We expect the review will be completed, and we will see this order in Q2. We also saw customer-imposed delivery pushouts caused by program integration delays during the quarter.","The largest order, though, in the quarter for the Surveillance segment was $22 million to outfit the Afghani Air Force with our BRITE Star gimbals. This award was part of the Light Air Support program, where FLIR was selected as part of the team of suppliers to provide A-29 Super Tucano aircraft to the Afghan military.","Asia-Pacific region was active with major bookings in Japan and Taiwan. In Europe, we booked nearly $11 million in orders from customers in Italy, the Netherlands, the U.K. and Finland. And our success in Turkey continued with another $2 million order for our 380-HD gimbals.","In the U.S., we received an order from the U.S. Coast Guard for $3 million [ph] of our SeaFLIR imagers as part of the shipboard infrared visual sensor system or SIRVSS program. And the first order from U.S. SOCOM for the SOPMOD program, where FLIR was selected to provide both image intensified and thermal sights to U.S. Special Forces.","The Detection segment finished the quarter with $24 million in backlog, largely unchanged from the balance at the end of 2012. During the quarter, we released our Fido X3, a handheld explosive detector and received orders from our customers in China and Qatar, while shipping the first production units to an Australian customer.","Bookings from our Chem\/Bio and Mass Spec line of businesses exceeded plans, driven by good order activity for our Griffin Trace Detection units and IBAC aerosol for our Detection Systems from customers all over the world, including Russia, China, Iraq and the U.S. The order activity from international markets, which represented over 1\/3 of Detection bookings in the quarter, is encouraging and consistent with our strategy to expand our distribution and lessen our reliance on government-funded R&D.","Integrated Systems finished the first quarter with a backlog of $65 million. Our J2 program, now called GRSKO [ph], passed the milestone seat [ph] addition [ph] and is heading for LRIP and production. Our facility in Alberta, Georgia has been successful in delivering and passing acceptance testing of the first production units of MSC vehicles for the U.S. Customs and Border Protection with further shipments in the second quarter.","That concludes my comments in the first quarter. And Tony will now discuss the financial results in more detail.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Thank you, Bill. First quarter consolidated revenue was $348.6 million, essentially unchanged compared from the first quarter of 2012.","Commercial Systems division's first quarter revenue increased by 5% to $211.8 million. The Thermal Vision and Measurement segment posted first quarter revenue of $167.4 million, an increase of 8% compared with the first quarter of last year. Lorex and Traficon, 2 businesses we acquired late in 2012, accounted for $21.8 million of TVM revenue in Q1, while U.S. government-funded revenue in TVM dropped by 40% compared to Q1 of last year.","Raymarine revenue declined 5% compared to Q1 of last year to $44.4 million due largely to lower orders from a U.S. major retail customer. Other U.S. channels were up, however, and Asia performed well.","Government Systems' Q1 revenue was $136.8 million, a drop of 6% compared with $146.1 million in the first quarter of 2012.","Surveillance segment revenue was $110.2 million, down 4% from Q1 of last year. Surveillance experienced strong growth in non-U.S. markets, but this was more than offset by a 23% decline in revenue with U.S. government customers.","Detection segment revenue was $12.5 million compared with $19.4 million last year, while Integrated Systems segment Q1 revenue was $14 million versus $12.2 million in Q1 2012.","International revenue was 50.9% for the consolidated total in Q1, up from 42.9% of revenue last year, as international revenue increased by 18.7%, while U.S. government revenue on a consolidated basis declined by 21.1%, resulting in a 14% decline in overall U.S.-derived revenue.","Commercial Systems international sales made up 56% of its consolidated revenue in Q1 compared to 51.9% in Q1 last year, while 43% of Government Systems revenue came from outside the U.S. compared with 30.4% last year. Total sales to the U.S. government were 22.3% of the total in Q1, down from 28.3% of revenue in the first quarter of last year.","Consolidated gross margin was 52.8% for the first quarter compared with 52.4% last Q1, despite a 1 percentage point negative impact from the lower margins at recent acquisitions. All 5 segments saw improved gross margins on an organic basis.","Consolidated operating income was $69.1 million, an increase of 1% compared to the $68.3 million in the first quarter of last year. And operating margin was 19.8%, up slightly from 19.6% in Q1 of 2012.","First quarter operating income in Commercial Systems was $45.9 million, an increase of 6% compared to Q1 of last year. Thermal Vision and Measurement posted $39.9 million of operating income, up 2% from last year; while Raymarine operating income was $6 million, representing a 56% increase from last Q1 due to improved gross margins and continued cost containment efforts. Despite difficult market conditions, we expect Raymarine's profitability in this year to be meaningfully higher than it was in 2012.","Government Systems operating income was $35.7 million for the quarter compared with $35.9 million in Q1 of 2012. Surveillance segment operating income was $35 million, unchanged from Q1 of last year. Improved segment gross margin resulted in a 1.3 percentage point increase in segment operating margin to 31.7% in the quarter.","The Detection segment posted $600,000 of operating income last -- this quarter, down from $1.4 million last year due to lower revenue. Segment gross margin improved over 7 percentage points, however, and operating expenses declined by 16%. We expect the Detection segment to show improved performance for the remainder of 2013. Integrated Systems operating income was $200,000 in Q1 compared to an operating loss of $400,000 last Q1.","Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock compensation in the quarter were $89.2 million, a 1% improvement from Q1 of 2012. Our tax provision for the quarter was 23.1% pretax income and included a $1.6 million discrete benefit from the recognition of research and development tax credits from 2012. For the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate of approximately 25%, excluding the Q1 R&D credit.","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $62 million, representing 120% of net earnings. Between mid February and early April, we repurchased 4.1 million shares of our common stock at an average price of $26.20 per share, including 2.9 million shares pursuant to an accelerated share repurchase program. We also paid dividends during the quarter totaling $13.1 million. Q1 capital expenditures were $12.9 million.","In early April, we amended our $200 million revolving credit facility for the syndicated 7 banks to extend the maturity to April 2018 and to incorporate a new $150 million term loan to the facility.","This transaction adds to our already strong liquidity, lowers our overall cost of capital and provides us with great flexibility to act on investment opportunities as they arrive, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit ratings.","Today, we also announced our regular quarterly dividend of $0.09 per common share, which will be payable on June 7 to shareholders of record as of May 20.","Before I turn the call over to Earl, I want to take a moment and congratulate Andy on his appointment as President and CEO. His passion for the business is evident in everything he does, and I'm sure this will be a driving force for the future. Andy and I worked closely together for many years and shared commitment to grow FLIR and deliver value, and I look forward to continuing on that same path well into the future.","And finally, I want to thank you, Earl, for all you've done for FLIR, our stakeholders and me, personally. It's been my great pleasure to work with and for Earl for the past 10 years. His thoughtful leadership and dedication to creating value has had a profound impact on FLIR, and his mentorship has meant a great deal to me, personally. Earl, I know the people on this call appreciate all that you've done for them and for FLIR. On behalf of them, I wanted to thank you.","With that, I will turn it over to you.","Earl R. Lewis","Thanks, Tony, Andy, Bill. Of course, the most interesting part of your careers now will be producing enough money, so I can enjoy my retirement.","With that, we'll have the first question. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jeremy Devaney with BB&T Capital Markets.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","First off, Earl, I just want to thank you for the time over the last few years. I really enjoyed working with you. And best of luck in retirement. But as we look to the capital return strategy of FLIR, hopefully, this might mean that we're going to take another look at the dividend as you move to retirement and think about how to deal with that.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. I might come at it from a different trajection. You're right, yes, yes.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So tongue in cheek a little bit, but could you talk a little bit about your capital return strategy as we move forward? There's a lot of share repurchase here. Any thoughts on expanding the dividend?","Earl R. Lewis","Well, that -- I'm going to -- most of these answers are going to come from the team. So, Tony?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes. So, Jeremy, we -- if you look at what we've done over the last couple of years with the dividend, we introduced it 2 years ago at $0.06. We took it to $0.07 the first year, and then we took it to $0.09 this year. So we -- over the course of a couple of years, the dividends increased by 50%. And we put it in place. I think we said we were starting at a relatively low level with the expectation that it would probably grow as a proportion of our capital deployment over time, and that's effectively what we've done. I don't know that we will be seeking from the Board another change in the dividend this calendar year. But I think the long-term thinking is, as the business grows, we'll continue to grow the dividend and probably deploy a progressively higher, although probably still moderate amount of our net income into the dividend. As regards share repurchase, you saw we did a significant chunk in Q1. There was an opportunity to do a couple of things there in terms of the ASR. So we thought it would be meaningful and appropriate and we went ahead and did that. I would expect that we'll continue to be active buying back shares during the course of the year. So the activity, obviously, depends on the price. Clearly, in Q1, you saw that we were willing to put capital against the share repurchase program in the mid-20s. And going forward, we'll keep a close eye on opportunities to take chunks of shares out of the market at what we think are attractive prices to drive a higher return on equity and help support the EPS going forward.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","[indiscernible] for the colors. I really appreciate it. Looking at your order backlog and then also as for the tempo of conversion of backlog, I was wondering if you could comment on what portion of your business is more book and ship versus longer cycle and maybe even drill down a little bit on -- at a subsegment level. Could you stack your units from shortest cycle to longest cycle for us?","William A. Sundermeier","From a business unit perspective?","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes, sure.","William A. Sundermeier","In the Government Systems business, most all of the Detection business is book and ship business, a very small backlog there. Integrated Systems business, it's probably about 50-50, maybe more towards a 60%, 70% backlog covered. And Surveillance right now is running at about 50% backlog covered, which is more like late '90s, early 2000 kind of historical levels. So we don't have the luxury of what we had in the REIT [ph] days. So there's a lot of book and ship business that happens within the quarter in the Surveillance business right now.","Andrew C. Teich","And on the Commercial business, they are both, the Thermography business and the Raymarine business, are book and ship businesses. Lorex was 100% book and ship business basically. The Traficon business carried some backlog there. It's probably more than 50% of its quarterly revenue comes out of backlog. And in the CVS business, there's backlog both on the Systems side and on the Cores & Components side. And typically, there is more than 50%. Typically, it's probably in the high-60s of backlog coverage there, and that fluctuates around a bit quarter-to-quarter. We've seen it creep up a little bit lately, but our ability to fulfill book and bill has also increased in recent quarters.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Earl, the best of luck.","Earl R. Lewis","Thanks, Jim. You may see me around somewhere.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Sure. I hope to. And, Andy, congratulations, by the way. And, Andy, maybe you can take this question. I just wondered if you can comment a little bit about what you're seeing in EMEA. Do you feel that we're getting toward a bottom here? And what's your sense in terms of the outlook over the next couple of quarters?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, I'd like to say that we're seeing the bottom, and it tends to bounce around a little bit. So there are weeks that we feel like we're on a rebound, and then things slow back down again. The -- it depends on the segment as well and, of course, the country or region. So if I look at the Raymarine business, we've had both challenges in the OEM segment in places like France and Italy, which are large OEM components for us. And then, the weather there this past quarter -- it took a long time for winter to conclude in Northern Europe and the Scandic region, and we feel that had a weighing effect on Raymarine's bookings. In terms of the Thermography business, it's been a bit mixed depending on the segment there. So I would say that the biggest factor that we've seen there is Germany. The things continued to be slow in Germany, and we've actually reallocated resources out of that region into other parts of the world that show stronger growth. So, yes, in conclusion, I would say that we're hoping that we are at a nadir point in terms of the EMEA economy. But I think it is yet to be proven out.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And, Bill, a quick question for you. You alluded to some pushouts in the quarter. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about that? Was it meaningful in terms of potential revenue impact?","William A. Sundermeier","The first pushout was really a pretty substantial order that -- we had basically gotten our version of it from the government and signed it, sent it back [indiscernible] a very large delay in us receiving that. We hope to get that here very shortly. The rest of the pushouts were primarily in Integrated Systems, where we had done our part of the integration work, but the rest of the commissioning and the program there were -- the final airport installation and everything that was going on just delayed and delayed the program so that we couldn't count [ph] for revenue. I wouldn't say that it was significant to GS's total revenue. Certainly, it would have helped with the EPS for the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Congratulations, Earl and Andy. Earl, I'm glad to see you were able to work in the timing of the retirement with boating season.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. We had been planning on it for 2 years. That's easy to do.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes, I figured that. Andy, first question really is on the Raymarine profits. Very nice improvement there. How should we think about the sustainability here, what you're seeing in terms of how you guys have been able to reshape the cost structure there? And then, just -- as my second question, just as the K-Series that you're rolling out in the fire fighting, obviously, the first responder market is big and under penetrated. I mean, you went into a lot details on that at the Investor Day. Can you talk to us a little bit about how -- what's different about this rollout, or what exactly you see as the opportunity here?","Andrew C. Teich","Sure, I'll cover the K-Series one in a moment. Tom, do you want to just comment on sustainability of the Raymarine's profits? I got Tom Surran here, who runs our business. So...","Thomas Surran","So the first -- we will see continued improvement for the balance of the year until the fourth quarter. The actions that we're taking at the end of last year, a little bit -- again, this year, are going to be paying [indiscernible] for this time period. Subsequent to that, we are always going to -- we're introducing new products which have better margins. We're working on being more efficient with how we get those to the marketplace. So I think you'll see substantial improvement this year for the balance of it and then slower but hopefully continual improvement in margins from that point forward","Andrew C. Teich","Yes. I would also say, Peter, that I think, on the cost side, the work has largely been done there. So we're really just looking for those to roll through the income statement at this point. So the real change to the income statement should be in the top line growth that should be bolstered by the new product introductions that we mentioned in the prepared comments. Moving over to the K-Series, so this is a product that we introduced in March in the EMEA region, and we just introduced this week at the FDIC show in Indianapolis. In terms of its differentiating features, there are 2 primary ones. One is it has a very rich feature set. We know this market quite well. We participate in this market in a direct fashion about 10 years ago and have been a core supplier into the market for many years. So we have engineered this product with what we think to be the right feature set. And the second is pricing. We've offered these products at a very compelling price point relative to the feature set, and we're going to be selling the product through a broad-based distribution model. And we're confident that that's going to drive decent volumes as the brand is built and we build credibility for the units out in the marketplace.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Hey, Earl, I just wanted to echo my congratulations as well and also to you, Andy. Just to get the opportunity, it's definitely been a pleasure to work with you over the past few years, Earl, and definitely wish you the best of luck on the retirement.","Earl R. Lewis","Thank you.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just starting out with Andy. Here, now that you said the opportunity to take the reins -- I just wanted to -- it's maybe a little bit early for this, but just wanted to get -- I mean, any sense of -- any thought process around what you may potentially look at differently or whether there'd be any sort of strategic change that you'd be looking at? Or do you think you're just going to kind of continue along? I just wanted to get a sense from you what the general plan is at this point.","Earl R. Lewis","Let me just make sure you understand. Andy found out about this at 5:30 last night. So any answer he gives can't be held against him.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Fair enough.","Andrew C. Teich","I had all night to think about it. Well, schematically, Jonathan, I would just mention 2 things. One is a focus on getting the businesses back to stronger top line growth, and I think that's part of the reason that the Board selected me as that is a skill set that has been firmly in my wheelhouse. So it's going to be focused on that. And that will be executed through a combination of sales, marketing and product initiatives. I mean, those are the levers that I typically pull on in terms of driving top line growth. It's been challenging, even in my business in the last 18 months, to deliver that top line growth given the economic conditions. So I'm hoping a combination of some strategic changes and also some improvement in the procurement environment will allow us to deliver the kind of results that I'm expecting out of those initiatives.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. Sorry for putting you on the spot there. I didn't realize it was such a sudden decision.","Earl R. Lewis","The decision was made quite a while ago. The telling of it, due to the rules, at least, I'd say the decision -- that we're pretty sure who was going to take my place, but I wasn't exactly sure when I was going to leave. So that kind of compounded the whole thing.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Fair enough, fair enough. Just as a follow-up, when we look at the Detection business on the Government Systems side, how should we think about the revenue run rate going forward? I mean, is this sort of the correct level at this point, or would you expect that to sort of improve over the course of the year? Just wanted to get a sense, with the release of new product, how we should think about that trend over the course of the year.","William A. Sundermeier","The Detection run rate, I think now that we've got kind of a better stroke between CRAD and product revenue, this is the kind of sales run rate we're going to see. I anticipate it's going to continue to ramp throughout the year with continued strong bookings. But we're getting at where we really wanted to be. The CRAD is right around 20% to 30% and will continue to increase as we get the rest of the product revenue ramped up. We're going to see continued revenue growth that's going to be product-based, which -- the right way to think about this is, the more product revenue we have, the better margins we're going to continue to get out of that business and drop that to the bottom line. So I anticipate we're going to continue to see reasonable growth for Detection throughout the year.","Anthony L. Trunzo","And, Jonathan, just as a sideline, I mean, obviously, Detection saw a significant step-down in Q1. I don't have the exact number right in front of me. I can get it for you, but something north of 80% of that revenue reduction was less -- was lower CRAD. So the product revenue was down a little bit. Getting in the way -- into the detail of it was radiation, mostly.","William A. Sundermeier","We've got some pretty large orders in Q1 [indiscernible] last year.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Right, yes. But the CRAD proportion of that business has dropped fairly meaningfully over the last couple of years, as per the strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Tim Quillin with Stephens Inc.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And, Earl, I'm sure you'll be an active chairman, so I don't view this as you going away, just changing roles. And, Andy, it's -- I think I was telling somebody you've been in the industry for 30 years -- so since you were in grade school. So I'm -- I think we're probably in steady hands. Have you named a successor for Andy in the Commercial business?","Earl R. Lewis","Not yet, but we will do shortly.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, on the growth -- the question about growth, I'm just wondering if you could name -- and not beyond current strategy, but the current internal strategies, to jump start growth. I know end markets are challenging, but maybe there's a way that you can outrun the market fundamentals, and if you can just kind of highlight what you're doing to -- on the sales marketing and product initiative side?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, I would say that there are 3 things that address each of those 3 categories. So the first is look for revenue that we can derive from markets that we are not presently addressing, and you've seen that strategy execute in recent quarters in the CS business, and we've spoken about several of those here today, products like Dragonfly going into freshwater market; K-Series going into fire fighting; the MU-series going into high-end stabilized cool for the long-range maritime systems for luxury yachts. So those are all pursuits that represent market segments that we're not present in today. On the marketing front, it's really about promotions and how you communicate those promotions. So we've taken several steps here just within the last few months to change our marketing mix from sort of traditional marketing strategies, trade shows and print to move over to more digital and some direct selling activities via e-commerce. And then the third one is product. And I think those of you on the call that know me and have watched me over the years, I am a product person. I'm very interested in leveraging the technologies that we have internally here. And I think that a greater level of cross-pollinization of the technologies that we have within FLIR between GS and CS is something that you'll see come forward with a focus on creating greater value at a lower cost. And so, that's one that's going to take more work and will take longer time to manifest itself in the market.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And then, just more specifically around the guidance for 2013. You're starting with first quarter revenue at the same point that you started 2012. But yet, you're at the low end of guidance, about $100 million higher. So what are the drivers that bridges -- that bridge that gap?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, there is -- it's business that we expect to pick up in the second half of the year in each of our segments. So we haven't articulated the specific elements of growth in each of those segments at this point, but we see the growth coming in the second half of the year, particularly as the Commercial businesses pick up.","Anthony L. Trunzo","And Q2 of last year, I'll add, was unusually soft for a second quarter. So there's a softer comparison in Q2 on the revenue side relative to what we would typically expect in an environment like this.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Just to follow on that last point. TVM, I guess, was down almost 7% organically this first quarter. And again, the kind of -- just to meet the bottom of your sales guidance, it seems like you have to move TVM from down mid- to high-single digits really to kind of up single digits the balance of the year, and you talked about Europe being kind of hard to predict. So can you give us some more color as to why you would feel why that's achievable?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, it's a combination of 2 things. One is that we are seeing some response from the U.S. market in terms of better growth. The other issue is that we've got a lift from the acquisitions that we've done in the TVM segment.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Okay, okay, okay. And then, Earl, on you leaving...","Anthony L. Trunzo","Let me just -- sorry, let me just add. Q1 revenue, if you really break it down, if you look at what happened, we had a significant reset between the U.S. government revenue and international revenue. Even in a weak international environment, the proportion of our revenue that shifted outside the U.S. was fairly dramatic. And that reset in U.S. government revenue appears like it has settled down. So we're not going to face 1 significant headwind that we faced in the last several quarters in a row. I think that's an important -- if you look at the puts and takes, that's an important component of what the next 9 months are going to look like.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So, yes. So -- Tony, so U.S. DoD was down by 23%, you said in Q1. Is that -- should we annualize that? Are there -- are the comps difficult the rest of the year in U.S. DoD? Or are they easy?","Anthony L. Trunzo","No. They're not nearly as difficult as what you saw in Q1.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay, okay. Got it. And then, on your leaving, Earl, was this something that you've been planning for a while, or was it more recent? I thought maybe we'd get some inkling of it at the Analyst Day, if it was planned. So I was just wondering how long you were thinking about this for.","Earl R. Lewis","13 years.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","That's -- yes, I've been thinking about it for the last 20, I think...","Earl R. Lewis","You get to a point in time where you just decide it's time, and I felt that it looked like the balance this year should be pretty good. I felt that the costs were in good shape. I felt that the balance sheet was in good shape. I felt that we had a great team of people that run the business. And I'd like to learn how to play golf again.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","I hear you. Excellent, excellent. Last one for Tony -- or I guess for anyone, but the $150 million term loan, should we think that the M&A pipeline is pretty full, given you taking out this loan?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I'd say that it's maybe not as full as we'd like it to be. We're in a position now where -- Lorex and Traficon, the integrations have gone, I think, very well. Probably better than integrations -- about some of the best integrations we've done.","Earl R. Lewis","No question.","Anthony L. Trunzo","And we've digested them pretty quickly. So I think we're -- we feel like we're in a position to be able to make a meaningful acquisition. I can't tell you that -- we always have a wish list, if you will. How actionable that wish list is, it varies right now. There's not something that's meaningfully actionable. But I wouldn't at all be surprised if that changed during the course of this year. And that's clearly part of the reason we did it. It's hard to -- I mean, we've fixed the rate on that term loan at 2.49%. And as our business grows and our leverage comes down just a little bit, we'll pick up another 25 basis points. So we'll have 6-year money at 2.24%. That's capital that -- given our history of capital deployment, that's capital we just couldn't pass up to put in the barn now for the future.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Earl, a big congratulations on your career and the retirement, and I'll be tracking that handicap index you just referred to online. That's publicly available data.","Earl R. Lewis","You're still going to buy me dinner?","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Absolutely. Happy to. And, Andy, congratulations to you as well.","Andrew C. Teich","Thank you.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to try to drill down into the split of the segment margins in the quarter and what to look for going forward so maybe this is for Tony. If I got the numbers right, Surveillance, $31.8 million. And I don't think I have enough data from when you changed the segment to know if that's seasonally weak, and the discussion there has been mid-30s. I just want to see if there's any change in how you're thinking about that margin. And then, TVM, a little lower than I thought, down year-over-year, has sort of been trending lower on an annual basis. I know there are some drivers of that, that you guys have outlined. Maybe just talk about the -- if that's the new level or not for the ongoing TVM margin.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes. So, Noah, on the Surveillance side, margins were -- let me just -- let me orient myself here. They were up sequentially from Q1 of last year. The margins in that business are meaningfully affected by mix shift. There are some products in factories where we have lower margins than we enjoy in others. And we have seen a little bit of that. We may see a little bit more of that shift over the next couple of quarters. But when you look at the standard margins of our products in that business -- or the normalized margins maybe is the better way to put it, we're not seeing any pricing pressure. We did see some mix shift. I don't think that's a structural situation. Will it be softer and then better over the course of the next couple of quarters? Yes, I think it could be. But overall, that business remains highly profitable. Yes, Q2, I mean -- I was getting notes from the other side of the table. Q2 will be a little softer because of mix, but it doesn't really reflect any structural change in the core profitability of the products themselves. And that mix shift, I don't think we see as permanent. Regarding TVM, the Lorex and Traficon together were 21.8% of -- I'm sorry, $21.8 million of revenue at -- I'm going to look at days here, what was it? 7% operating margin, something like that? We carry the -- we carry all the amortization intangibles at those locations, and we don't see them as sort of the cash flow effect. Did you say it was less than 7%?","Unknown Executive","[indiscernible]","Anthony L. Trunzo","Okay. So it was -- combined, it was less than 4% for those 2 businesses. So that should improve over the next little bit as those businesses come up to scale. And a few quarters out, we'll see some of the amortization of the intangibles roll out. But the core TVM business, margins were actually quite strong in the quarter. And I think the trend is actually quite good. And the same is true of the COTS [ph] businesses at Raymarine. We've done a huge amount of product work there that has improved the standard margins fairly dramatically. And I've said this before, but a little bit of growth in that business goes a long way. There's a lot of operating leverage now.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. So just to follow up on Surveillance, it sounds like it goes closer to $30 million in the second quarter. Does it then go back into the mid-30s? Is the mid-30 still how you think about the ongoing longer-term run rate in that business?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I think what we've said is low- to mid-30s. And I probably wouldn't change that over the long term. It really is -- it's going to -- we're looking at what the bookings sort of -- what the bookings plan is for the rest of the year would suggest we'd see some nice recovery in the second half. In this kind of environment, there are going to be puts and takes for sure.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And I just wanted to ask one other thing, and this is for anybody who wants to take it and is intentionally open-ended, and that is when and how do you think Europe gets better?","Unknown Executive","Everybody is looking around...","Earl R. Lewis","Well, maybe the how, that's really a tough one. I believe, Noah, there's really structural problems in Europe, and they're -- they've been brought on over years and years and years. So forecasting when or even how Europe's going to get particularly better, I don't see it frankly. I think this -- the malaise of unemployment in Spain, which is at almost 30%, Italy. These numbers are going to be very hard to change overnight. So I think we're in for a long, long haul. And as Andy pointed out, we're moving resources out of Europe and putting them into the Far East, and we will continue that trend as a strategy.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Andy, congratulations. Earl, congratulations and good luck in retirement.","Earl R. Lewis","Thank you.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe, Bill, just to look at the Government Systems segment, one of the programs of the mobile surveillance capability you guys talked about that pretty optimistically at the Analyst Day. And to my understanding, I guess, some of those initial deliveries are going to be encumbered with some additional excess cost, pre production. So is there a bit of a margin drag stemming as those initial products roll out and maybe just a general update on that program?","William A. Sundermeier","Sure thing. MCS program, I mentioned in the script, we delivered our first 2 [indiscernible] test units plus 4 production systems, and they were accepted within the last couple of weeks here and have been doing exceptionally well. We've been delivering more systems and anticipate delivering the entire 31 systems to them here in Q2, which is on our original delivery order. So that program was going well. We have a fantastic depot in Tucson to provide immediate repair for the border. But you're absolutely correct, there's going to be a significant drag on margin with the delivery of those 31 systems that we anticipate that -- the drag and the elimination of -- basically the engineering capability that was put into those systems will be eliminated in Q2 along with that. So -- and we're hoping that, maybe later this year, we might receive more delivery orders. But we don't have anything on the forecast in the horizon. What we're excited about is that we've been able to start marketing that around the world, and our funnel is continuing to build around the world and we even had 1 customer say that they paid for the shipment to send that to whoever they're interested in and fly it all the way over there and do the demonstration. So very, very encouraging signs for our COTS business for that capability. And there, we'll be able to enjoy good margins and normal surveillance-type margins for those kinds of products. I'm very, very excited about that business for our future.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Mike, to clarify a point on the margin question, you'll see a substantial uptick in revenue from Integrated Systems in Q2. That will be the bolus of these MSC deliveries, if you will, and they\u2019re not going to have any margin. So you'll see a chunk of revenue, and you'll see fairly poor profitability from that operation for that quarter. And then, the comments that Bill made obviously stand for the -- for going forward.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And then, just the last one, Tony, Lorex, Traficon, sort of the run rate for the rest of the year, I mean, can we expect maybe an uptick later in the year? Or I guess, is that going to depend on timing, when you guys maybe put -- or implement some of the infrared product or capability into Lorex? How should we just think about those 2 acquired businesses in the revenue trajectory?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Lorex has some seasonality. So you'll see more strength in the second half from Lorex from a revenue standpoint and from a profitability standpoint. Traficon started the year quite well from a booking standpoint. So I think you'll probably see an improvement in revenue from them as well. I think we've said on the last call that we expected somewhere in the $80 million to $100 million revenue range from those 2 acquisitions this year, probably looking at the upper end of that as we...","Earl R. Lewis","Plus also, on the Traficon business, there will be the thermal element. Thermal cameras get rolled into that. I don't think you'll see, on the Lorex business, a tremendous thermal content in this calendar year.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with CRT Capital.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I just want to understand the weighting of the year. Can you give us some kind of weighting on revenue that second half is going to be heavier weighted or the second quarter is going to be seasonally normal, or any kind of guidance on a quarterly basis?","Anthony L. Trunzo","No, we don't give quarterly guidance. I will -- I guess, what I would say is Q2 of last year was the poorest quarter we had in a long time. And I think there\u2019s reasons [ph] to appropriately recognize that in the outlook we've put forth. And Q4 is always our strongest quarter, and I think it'll be our strongest quarter again this year. Other than that, I think we'll probably leave the comments that we made earlier stand.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. The other question separately is on SG&A expense. Can you talk about any kind of seasonality, the normal seasonality whether we should have a drop in second quarter versus first quarter? Is that the trend that we should continue to follow?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I think maybe you're over analyzing the SG&A line. I'd have to look at it, but I -- there shouldn't be much in the way of seasonality from quarter-to-quarter. I mean, I'm looking around here at the operating guidance. I don't think there should be a lot of seasonality.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Yes. Last year, in March period, you did roughly $78 million, then it dropped down to $72 million then roughly around the $70 million, $72 million. And this quarter, you did $78 million. I didn\u2019t know if we're going to be carrying that forward or have a drop.","Anthony L. Trunzo","I can't give you that level of detail without taking a look at it, Brian.","Operator","Our next question comes from Paul Coster with JP Morgan Chase.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Earl, I believe, for the better part of 10 years, you delivered more better returns than any other CEO in the public market. So pretty amazing and really tough...","Earl R. Lewis","I didn't do it, though. The people here did it.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Sure. But a tough act for Andy to follow. Tony, the backlog was $505 million. What proportion of that came from the Traficon and Lorex acquisitions? And the separate question is that, either narrowly defined or broadly defined, what proportion of revenues now do you believe is recurring in nature? What are the contractually -- or just simply, you got such excellent kind of a sales replacement cycles that you can see pretty well what's coming?","Anthony L. Trunzo","So I'll answer the first part of that question. The -- recall that we closed the Lorex and Traficon transactions late in December. And as a result, their backlog was included in our Q4 backlog number. The -- when I looked at the impact they had in the quarter, it was minimal, $1 million movement on the backlog of those 2 businesses from the end of the year to now, and the total backlog is a small proportion of our total. It's mid-single digit million.","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, in terms of recurring revenue now?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I don't have a number. You're talking about service and those sorts of things?","Paul Coster - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes. And your sort of replacement parts from the government side -- [indiscernible] where are equipments being replaced [indiscernible] following sort of the reduction in troop deployments in the Middle East that there\u2019s quite a hike in high margin for that life cycle type business. Is that true of Andy's -- of Bill's business?","Earl R. Lewis","I know what you're talking about. There's a lot of government businesses, if you will, that are calling that out as a special opportunity right now. But we don't see that, Paul.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Peter Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.","Peter J. Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups for Bill. Bill, sequestration hasn't really kicked in yet. I'm just wondering if you think there's downside risk to your internal forecast for Surveillance because of sequestration. And I'm just wondering what you're hearing about potential for a DoD reprogram or request, and if maybe that could positively impact you guys?","William A. Sundermeier","Sure. Certainly, sequestration is already affecting us, and that procurement offices are still deliberating about what they're supposed to do with their procurements and that's causing a certain drag on it. I think we've -- again, at the Investor Day, we've been very conservative about the year, and it's the timing, for example, these large orders that have been delayed is a side effect of sequestration, literally, and it's going to be -- it's going to drag and still going to get it, but it's been shifting around. So we've been very conservative about the year. And as far as reprogramming is concerned, we certainly hope that the agencies are going to be able to have the ability to do that. I think that will really affect us in a positive way. And so far, we're hearing that that's out there in front of the President and Congress and -- but no definitive response yet on the reprogramming ability that they're going to have.","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Tim Quillin with Stephens Inc.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","Number one, could you give us the size of the pushout in the government business? And then, DoD -- and I think Tony had made a point about the government business is starting to face easier comparisons, but the government market is getting worse. And I think you had talked about DoD bookings being down 20% as an assumption for this year. But as you stand right now, is that -- with the sequester now in place, is that an expectation that you have or need to ratchet down?","Earl R. Lewis","Well, I'm going to give it a try. DoD, Tim, is now what's -- the bookings were, I think, 10% or less of our total bookings last quarter -- 10% to 15%, I guess. It depends on how we classify one order we got. I think, by definition, we're pretty well convinced that's not going to get much lower at this point and may go up a little bit in the future. So I think we've seen the trough on that, and our thinking going forward in that...","Andrew C. Teich","Yes. Certainly, we're starting to see the trough. There are some really good bookings out there from a bookings perspective and the pushout of $80 million ID\/IQ, and the order size was nearly $20 million on delivery order size. So that's significant to our bookings potential, and that should roll in this quarter and it's just a procurement delay that we had in the [indiscernible] it was going to stay.","Earl R. Lewis","Okay. Thank you, all. I appreciate it. And it has certainly been my pleasure to work with the people sitting around our table here, and with all of you on the phone, and I think, sometimes, a number of our employees listen in as well. I will miss the excitement of this dynamic and robust company. I'm leaving its management to people that I believe are capable and knowledgeable. The new CEO and his team, I think, will do better than I did. They will surely succeed in their future, and I look forward to my new role as Chairman of the Board and as a senior advisor to them. With that, we thank you for calling in.","Operator","This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.

Andy?","Andrew C. Teich","Thank you, Wit, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning for FLIR's Third Quarter 2013 Earnings Call. Along with me on the call today is our CFO, Tony Trunzo; Bill Sundermeier, the President of Government Systems; and Tom Surran, the President of our Commercial Systems division.","As we stated in our press release last Tuesday, third quarter results did not meet our expectations. Order flow from government customers that derived their funding from the U.S. government slowed dramatically during the latter part of the third quarter. The budget flush that we normally see from our U.S. government-funded customers in the third quarter did not happen this year. Instead, we experienced a significant reduction in procurements, delays in administrative processing and program shifts.","The result was lower-than-expected bookings and a reduction in our expectations for fourth quarter shipments.","For the third quarter, we recorded revenue of $358 million and an earnings per share of $0.32. While revenue grew 8% versus the third quarter of 2012, our margins were impacted by mix change and the revenue shortfall in relation to our plan.","Total company backlog at the end of Q3 was $523 million, and the quarterly book-to-bill ratio was 1. We grew operating cash flow 13% versus the prior year, and year-to-date operating cash flow was up by 45%.","The Commercial Systems division increased revenue 17% versus the third quarter of 2012, with all 3 geographic regions posting positive growth for the first time in 2 years.","Government Systems division revenue declined 4% year-over-year, and U.S. bookings were soft compared to usual third quarter activity.","Government Systems international bookings continued to grow, and Government Systems booked $236 million in IDIQ awards during the quarter.","We announced a proposed realignment plan last week that will result in the closure of up to 6 manufacturing and R&D sites, the movement of those operations into other larger FLIR locations, the consolidation of optics production capabilities and the consolidation of laser manufacturing operations. We have also taken action to reduce cost beyond the business realignment, due to the operating environment we anticipate for the foreseeable future.","I'm confident that these initiatives will significantly benefit us going forward. We will improve in efficiency, particularly in manufacturing and R&D, by better positioning our teams to collaborate and share best practices, ideas and assets, and we will reduce overhead through rationalization of production and support organizations.","We've adjusted our outlook for 2013 based on operating environment and now expect between $1.45 billion and $1.5 billion of revenue and earnings of between $1.38 and $1.43 per diluted share for the full year 2013. This range excludes restructuring charges that we will record in the fourth quarter related to the 2 initiatives discussed, as well as approximately $3.5 million associated with the accounting for the payout of executive retirement benefits that we will incur in the fourth quarter.","I'll now ask Tony to review the financial results for the third quarter. Tony?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Thank you, Andy. Third quarter consolidated revenue was $358.1 million, an increase of 8% compared to last year. Organically, revenue declined by 2%, due primarily to the impact of delivery delays and lower-than-expected book-and-ship business in our government businesses.","International revenue was 46.6% in the consolidated total in Q3, up from 44.2% in the third quarter of 2012, due to substantially improved international performance in the TVM segment.","International sales made up 51.3% of Commercial Systems consolidated revenue in Q3, compared to 47.2% in Q3 last year, while 39.7% of Government Systems revenue came from outside the United States.","Sales to the U.S. government were 25.1% in the consolidated total in Q3, down from 27.6% of revenue in the third quarter of last year. Consolidated gross margin was 48.3%, down 3.9 percentage points from 52.2% for the third quarter of last year. TVM gross margins were down 3.5 percentage points, entirely attributable to inclusion of Lorex revenue at lower margin. The remainder of the TVM business had better gross margins than in Q3 last year.","Surveillance segment gross margins were down 2.9 percentage points compared to Q3 2012, due to weaker mix and lower absorption of overhead.","Consolidated operating income in Q3 was $63.5 million, a 14% decline from the third quarter of last year. Third quarter operating margin of 17.7% compared to 22.3% last Q3, with the decline due largely to lower gross margins, as previously described.","Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock compensation in the quarter were $85.2 million. And EBITDA margin was 23.8%, compared to $95.2 million and an EBITDA margin of 28.6% last Q3, also the result of the drop in gross margin.","Our tax provision for the quarter was $13.6 million, equal to 22.6% pretax income, versus 19.2% last Q3. Q3 2012 tax expense was positively impacted by discrete items totaling $5.2 million. Q3 2013 had only nominal impact from discrete items, but the quarterly tax expense does reflect a catch-up for a slight rate adjustment for the year.","Cash flow from operations for the quarter was $52.5 million, representing 113% of net income.","Through 9 months, cash flow from operations of $249.8 million represents 168% of net income, an increase of $77.1 million or 45% from the first 9 months of last year, and we continue to focus on this important metric.","During the third quarter, we repurchased 500,000 shares of our common stock at an average price of $32.44 per share and paid dividends totaling $12.8 million.","Through 9 months, we have returned $171.7 million of capital to shareholders via the repurchase of 5 million shares for a total of $133 million and the payment of $38.7 million in dividends.","We expect continued share repurchase during Q4, with the actual amount depending on the share price, as well as our expectation surrounding M&A and other high return cash deployment opportunities.","The business realignment we announced last week is well underway. Three of the facilities we are proposing to close are in Europe, and require us to consult with local works councils prior to moving ahead. We expect these consultations to conclude late in Q4 or early in Q1 next year, at which time we anticipate proceeding with the relocation.","The 3 U.S. closures are well underway, with 2 of them to be completed by year end.","We expect to recognize the majority of the costs associated with the realignment in Q4, although certain expenses will occur in the first half of 2014.","For Q4, we expect charges associated with the realignment and additional cost reductions related to the current business environment to total between $27 million and $30 million, with the majority of the costs associated with severance and facilities exit costs in Europe.","Savings from these actions are expected to exceed $20 million per year when fully implemented in the second half of 2014.","In addition to the cost for the realignment and restructuring, we will have an expense of approximately $3.3 million associated with the payout of retirement benefits from our supplemental executive retirement plan in Q4.","None of these costs are included in the revised outlook we have provided.","While Q3 results accounted for part of our reduced 2013 outlook, roughly 2\/3 of the reduction is related to our expectation of continued weakness in our government businesses in Q4. Third quarter bookings were below normal levels, which we expect will impact Q4 shipments. In addition, we have seen longer lead times for licensing and order acceptance processes, both domestically and internationally. Our outlook for the commercially-oriented business units remain in line with our original expectations.","That concludes my comments, and I'll turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover Commercial division results.","Thomas A. Surran","Thank you, Tony. The Commercial Systems division finished the third quarter with a 17% increase in revenue compared to the prior year, and a 2% decline on an organic basis.","Growth in the Raymarine, FLIR-branded maritime and PVS businesses was offset by declines in the OEM and security lines of business, due to reduced shipments to government-funded customers. The thermography line of business grew revenue for the first time since Q1 2012 with all 3 geographic regions posting positive growth.","Raymarine revenue increased 13%, its best growth quarter since we acquired the business in 2010. And operating income quadrupled compared to Q3 2012.","Lorex and Traficon businesses we acquired at the end of 2012 continue to perform well on the top line and both had improved operating margins in the quarter.","On a regional basis, Commercial Systems grew revenue in the Americas by 17%; in EMEA by 27%; and APAC by 1% in comparison to the third quarter 2012. The EMEA region returned to organic growth for the first time since 2011 with all lines of businesses growing over the prior year.","Commercial Systems Q3 bookings increased 7% over the prior year but declined 13% organically, primarily due to weak order flow from government-funded customers in the OEM line of the business. Excluding orders received from government-funded OEM customers, Commercial Systems bookings increased 8% organically year-over-year.","Bookings in the security business -- moving to segment bookings, we saw a 5% increase over the prior year in TVM bookings, with strength in our non-Thermography businesses -- systems businesses and the addition of Lorex and Traficon bookings being partially offset by weak OEM bookings.","TVM's OEM businesses booking dollars declined year-over-year as a result of a weak order flow from military OEMs. However, unit volumes continue to increase, driven by demand in automotive and other uncooled core markets.","TVM's Thermography line of business saw bookings dollars decline 1% from a year ago. Growth in automation, firefighting and gas imaging markets was offset by weakness in the high-end R&D, predictive maintenance and building markets.","On October 1, we introduced the new Ex product line, significant improvements to our Exx line, as well as a new FLIR-branded test and measurement line. The new Ex product line offers an unprecedented level of performance in an entry-level product, including our patented MSX technology, which combines the best of visible and thermal imaging. It would be difficult to ascertain the impact the anticipation for these products had on Q3 bookings","Bookings in the security business increased organically by nearly 20% versus last year and tripled with the inclusion of Lorex. Year-to-date, security bookings have increased nearly 50% organically compared to the first 9 months of 2012. This success was driven by demand for border and perimeter surveillance systems, along with solid unit increases in uncooled systems, particularly in Asia.","TVM's Intelligent Traffic Systems line of business had another strong quarter, with results that well exceeded our expectations. In the fourth quarter, ITS will begin shipping its thermacam system. This is the first product to integrate the ITS traffic analytics and the thermal imager into a single package. The Personal Vision System line of business grew bookings by over 30%, helped by strength in the EMEA and Americas region. TVM's maritime business grew over 15% compared to Q3 of 2012 and showed growth across all regions.","Raymarine's bookings dollars grew nearly 15% versus third quarter of 2012, with all 3 regions growing and the Americas up nearly 15% and EMEA region up 10% year-over-year, the first quarter of bookings growth in the region since our acquisition of the business.","During the third quarter, Raymarine introduced several new products, including a 7-inch version of its lower-priced A-Series, as well as the integration of its successful DownVision technology, first introduced in the Dragonfly into the A-Series and a black box version of the DownVision technology, which can be networked into existing Raymarine MFDs.","As Andy mentioned, we completed a strategic review of our Commercial Systems operating footprint with a focus on efficiency and cost improvements. As a result of this work, we expect to close up to 3 facilities and have staff reductions, which will improve our total overhead cost structure, as well as streamline product development.","That concludes my comments on Commercial Systems, third quarter. I'll now pass the call over to Bill Sundermeier, who will discuss the result of our Government Systems. Bill?","William A. Sundermeier","Thank you, Tom. Government Systems division revenue declined 4% versus the third quarter of 2012, ending the quarter with a backlog of $334 million, $5 million lower than Q2.","Bookings for the quarter were below our expectations, due primarily to more than 50% year-over-year decline in orders from the U.S. DoD.","Divisional book-to-bill was 1.1, helped by 12% year-over-year growth in orders from international market.","Lower-than-planned volume and a less favorable product mix resulted in a quarterly operating margin decline of nearly 6 percentage points versus the prior year. The margin remained consistent with the second quarter of this year.","While the Surveillance segment grew backlog 3% over Q2 of this year, finishing at $276 million, orders from U.S. customers were weak compared to normal third quarter activity. International orders reached 50% of surveillance bookings in the third quarter, which helped offset the domestic weakness.","Despite slow-funded order activity, we had one of the best quarters ever in IDIQ awards, winning $236 million in 5-year contracts for maritime, airborne and tower-mounted imaging application.","The largest funded order in the quarter for the Surveillance segment was $13 million to outfit a Middle Eastern nation's helicopter platform with our 260-HLD compact imaging and laser designation system.","We also received 2 orders totaling $11 million from the U.S. Navy for several of our BRITE Star II gimbal systems and related spares.","Notable international bookings included 2 orders totaling $12 million from integrators working with the Korean and U.K. militaries, who will be adding our Star SAFIRE HD systems to their respective airborne platforms.","On the new product front, we continue to improve upon our latest high-definition imaging system designed for airborne and maritime applications. Qualification and LRIP, limited rate initial production, of our Star SAFIRE 380-HD gimbal is proceeding with excellent results.","Additionally, we developed the SeaFLIR 280-HD system for the Patrol Boat Electro-Optical (sic) [Optics] System or PB-EOS program, one of the IDIQ awards we won in the third quarter, and we continue to finalize the production plans for this groundbreaking maritime solution.","In order to win this highly competitive $50 million award, all bidders were asked to submit a working bid sample in a very tight time frame. Given our commercially developed military qualified operating model that leverages internally funded R&D for very rapid development, with a focus on low overall production costs, we were well positioned for such an RFP. We are hopeful that government procurement practices tend toward this bid model going forward.","As a result of the strategic operational review we completed in the third quarter, the Surveillance segment will undergo structural changes to some of its operations. These changes will include the consolidation of our 2 main laser businesses in our Bozeman, Montana site, combining 2 domestic optics manufacturing operations into our Pittsburgh facility, consolidating the several engineering and production teams in Sweden into our T\u00e4by, Sweden location.","We're also taking additional costs out of the Surveillance segment and modifying the sales organization to better position the business to generate top and bottom line growth in the face of weakened government procurement environment. All of these changes will enable improved R&D processes, reduced operating and administrative overhead and align product development with production ultimately resulting in improved innovation and profitability.","Next, moving to Detection. The segment finished the quarter with $24 million in backlog, up slightly from Q2 of this year. Operating margin reached double digits for the first time since acquisition of ICX in 2010.","Orders for Detection products and service were 95% of total Detection order flow during the quarter, a trend that follows our strategy to focus the business on product sales and reduce the amount of funded cost plus R&D.","Notably during the quarter, our Explosives line of business had bookings growth of over 50%, driven by the success of our new Fido X3 handheld detector, which significantly shortens screening time and extends capabilities.","Our plan to improve Detection segment margins takes another step in Q4 as we take out additional cost and begin to execute on our proposal -- proposed plan to consolidate the Germany radiation operations into the Oak Ridge, Tennessee location.","Integrated Systems segment backlog declined by $12 million during the quarter, due primarily to shipments of 13 MSC systems to the U.S. Customs and Border Patrol.","During Q3, Integrated Systems delivered the first production units of the DR-SKO multi-threat identification system and booked $9 million in additional LRIP funds under the program.","Integrated Systems during the third quarter completed production of the first 3 MVSS systems, which is the international variant of the MSC mobile border surveillance system, a solution that is proving quite valuable to many of our customers in the Middle East.","We are adopting the facility realignment plan in Integrated Systems as well, which will include the closure of our Alpharetta, Georgia facility and the move of those operations to Elkridge, Maryland facility, a site that has been instrumental in winning several large awards.","That concludes my summary of Government Systems third quarter. I'll pass the call back to Andy.","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Bill. That concludes our prepared remarks, and we will now open the call up for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Guys, given what happened with the pre-announcement, I kind of wanted to just ask about forecasting. It's just surprising to see a company of this quality have this happen, I guess, a few times in a relatively short window. And I guess, in the past, sometimes you've been asked if a guidance range includes a continuing resolution or how you factored in sequestration or whatever other top-down budget activity, and I think the answer has always sort of been, \"We don't think about it that way. We're doing it bottoms-up.\" And I don't know what's right top-down, bottoms-up, they're probably both very difficult in the current environment. But I'm sort of wondering how you're thinking about how you need to change your forecasting methodology or if you're finding that there's something broken in the communication between the managers doing these bottom-up plans and the executive team or something else like that, that you're digging into and discovering, given that this keeps happening.","Andrew C. Teich","Noah, this is Andy. The biggest issue here is that we had, in Q3, a situation occur that was unprecedented. In the 29 years that I've been in this business, I've never seen a September where we haven't had a significant budget flush related to U.S. government end of fiscal year spending. And this year, it was almost 0 that came in. And that's something that, given the fact that we haven't seen it happen once in the last 29 years, has led us not to think that it was going to happen this year. Going forward, there are a couple of things. I mean, we still don't really understand what the environment is going to be like relative to continuing resolution and sequestration. And frankly, our customers don't either. We're in Washington, D.C. today here making this call and we're with many of our army customers at the AUSA show this week, and certainly there are a lot of questions that are being asked on both sides of the customer\/supplier relationship here in terms of understanding what the budget situation is going to look like going forward. So in terms of dealing that, I think that we've just got to be conservative. We've got to continue with the bottom-up approach, and those items that are in the bottom-up approach that have U.S. government funding behind them, we've got to put a higher level of factoring on in terms of the probability of those things coming through. When I say higher level, I mean lower probability of factoring and that's part of what you're seeing here in our Q4 outlook.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Noah, it's Tony. I just want to -- your direct question about bottoms-up versus top-down. We spent a fair bit of time over the last -- not just the last couple of days, but the last couple of weeks, looking very carefully at what was in our plan that didn't happen. And specifically, for each one of those significant orders, why it didn't happen. I don't think it's appropriate to get into that specific discussion item by item on this call, but I think that we have come to understand in this kind of environment just how much risk there is in things that are just simple timing. How long does it take to get a -- the entire licensing process completed? How long does it take to walk a customer through the entire procurement process, all the way through to delivery? Those kinds of things are different than they were in the past, and I can tell you that we've been spending a significant amount of time as a management team making sure that we understand how they're different and how that's going to affect our outlook going forward. And frankly, I think you see that reflected in what we're saying about Q4.","Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Just one follow-up on the surveillance margin. It's trended lower through the year. Obviously, there are some unique things happening in the year. But -- and there's some restructuring going on that presumably helps going forward, and obviously, volume would help. But in the past, the discussion was that could stick into the mid-30s, maybe low- to mid-30s. Just sort of wondering what the latest medium to long-term thought process is on the right level for the surveillance margin.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Noah, I think -- it's Tony again. I think at the current levels of volume and the current mix we have, it's going to be tough to get back to 30%. The business has to be either a little bit larger or we have to see a stronger mix because there are certain products -- some of our Portland products are the most profitable in this segment. That mix has gone more toward Boston products, which tend to carry a little bit lower margin. Until one of those 2 things happen, getting the margins back over 30% is going to be a challenge. We're not going to give 2014 guidance until our February call when we announce our Q4, but at that point we'll be able to address, I think, more clearly exactly what the impact of the cost reductions are going to be and what the longer-term outlook for margins in Surveillance is going to be. It's still a remarkably solid business in terms of profitability. We've seen, to go back and look from peak to trough, that the business is probably down more than 1\/3 from peak to trough in terms of revenue. And the margins have come down but still being able to carry operating margins at that level, while offering our customers the value proposition that we offer, we think, is still pretty good. And we want to be careful about paring back too much on the infrastructure in that business to save cost today and keep those margins up when we do expect over time that our model is going to be one that's going to get a better market share in the total market for our products.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Peter Arment of Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Tom, I guess this question is for you. It's nice to see the Commercial businesses are showing some improvement, really, across the board, it sounds like in a different geographical regions, albeit off a low base probably, but maybe if you could just give us a little more color or elaborate a little bit of what you're seeing in terms of some of the products or markets or whether you want to take it by region. Just give us a little more color if you can.","Thomas A. Surran","Well, that's a fairly broad question. So what we're seeing, I guess, just in terms of the regions, Americas, we're seeing fairly good strength in most of the TVM business, excluding our OEM, our systems business doing very well. On the Thermography, we're seeing a bit of a recovery or at least some level of stabilization in EMEA, reasonably good numbers on Americas. APAC is a bit of a mixed bag. We've got some countries in that region that are doing quite well for us, such as China, and then we have some others that are struggling, offsetting some of those gains.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And how does the product refreshes that, historically, you've done -- I mean, you just did a big refresh with -- on the -- with the E-Series. And how typically is that done on the rollouts in terms of the different regions?","Thomas A. Surran","In terms of the rollout, the timing of it -- there is a sequence to it, but for the most part the Ex and Exx were all introduced on October 1, and then worldwide through the month of October. So there's a little bit of a kind of a pattern that we have to kind of go through in rolling those out. The test and measurement was introduced in America on that date, October 1. It'll be introduced worldwide on January 1.","Andrew C. Teich","Peter, this is Andy. I wanted to pick up on 2 other things there, relative to strengths in the Commercial business and they really come down to 2 specific issues. First, you touched upon, which is the new products. Yes I think we've demonstrated as a company, that we have the ability to define and execute new product designs that are successful in the market. I think Raymarine is a great story here. We had 13% increase in revenue, 15% increase in bookings this quarter, and that's entirely driven by the product refresh that's been done there because the market is still a pretty tough market in that space. On the Thermography side, we launched 13 new products on October 1 to the public. One of the things that I think was fairly remarkable about that is that on the day that we launched those products through our distribution channel, which was midway through September, we had approximately 2,000 units of the Ex series ready to ship. So we were -- that was, I think, unprecedented for us as a company that we're ready to hit the shelves immediately and get those dealers ready to sell those units when it was publicly released on October 1. And then, the last thing I'll say is that the integration of the acquisitions, if you look at the last few acquisitions we've done on the Commercial side, Raymarine, Traficon and Lorex, these businesses are all improving. They're all growing and they've all been well integrated. And I think that, that presents a model for the future for FLIR's execution on the Commercial business.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim Quillin with Stephens.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","So in terms of the margins, and I guess this is both for thinking about the overall company's gross margins especially, and then on TVM's margins that have been impacted by Lorex and Traficon. I don't think as part of your restructuring, you're specifically looking at improvement on those acquired companies. But I'm trying to figure out what the pace of improvement might be in TVM overall as you integrate those companies and maybe how you get those up to overall TVM margin levels and how that also might impact corporate gross margins and directionally where you're going and maybe if you have targets for corporate gross margin and corporate -- or excuse me, and segments operating margin on TVM, that would be great.","Anthony L. Trunzo","So Tim, we -- the Lorex business is a unique business model within FLIR. We've got a little bit of it in test and measurement, but Lorex gross margins are less than half what the rest of -- what the rest of TVM experiences from a gross margin perspective. That's not poor execution; that's just a different business model. And when we acquired Lorex, we realized that -- when we acquired Lorex, we wanted them to continue to operate the way they operate because it's different. And the long-term plan for that business is to inject more of our technology into it, drive more value through that channel and thereby improve the gross margin. Tom and Andy may want to comment, but I think it's difficult when you have an ODM business like that where you're sourcing product that you're designing and packaging and distributing but you're sourcing it from somebody else. You're just not going to see the same level of gross margin. As that proportion of -- as Lorex, as a proportion of the total, grows this year, just because it's the first year we've owned them, it's having a dilutive effect on our margins. That's not a surprise to us. The rest -- we have a strong focus on making sure that we don't see deterioration in the rest of TVM, and we're not. So again, I think when we look to next year and talk to you guys about what the outlook is going to be for next year, we'll think about how we can do this, but maybe we can help you understand what that ODM\/Lorex type business looks like in terms of margin and what proportion of the businesses it will be and then be able to highlight the remaining piece of TVM and what the margins will look like in that business. I do think there's an opportunity to improve margins in the Lorex business but that's going to come, as I said, from the evolution of our technology and bringing low-cost thermal technology to that marketplace, which is clearly part of the strategy.","Andrew C. Teich","Tim, a couple other things here. Overall margins TVM margins, if you take out the acquisitions of Lorex and Traficon, were actually up 100 basis points year-over-year. So there is some improvement there. On the Lorex side, Lorex's business consists of 2 components. You've got the consumer piece under the Lorex brand and then formally, there was the Digimerge brand, which we've converted to the FLIR brand that attacks the professional piece, and the margins are significantly better there. They're not up to the same standard as the rest of FLIR's business, but they're improving and that business is growing very nicely. So there's an opportunity there. Traficon itself has excellent margin, so its margins are very much in line with the rest of FLIR, not dilutive to them at all.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division",".","Okay. And then just a couple detailed questions. I guess, one, the $20 million in annual savings from your restructuring, how might that be spread across cost of goods sold, SG&A and R&D? And then what percent of the TVM business is government Cores & Components?","Anthony L. Trunzo","So the breakout of the 3 -- the majority of it is going to come from SG&A. You will see some in COGS associated with lower facilities costs and you'll see some in R&D because we're -- the facility that we have in Germany that we're proposing to close is primarily an engineering facility. And when we basically move that capability to Oak Ridge, it should be at somewhat of a lower cost. I don't have a precise breakout for you at this point but you brought up something that I meant to mention, which is in terms of the charge itself, approximately 80% of it is going to be cash expenditure, either in Q4 or in a future period, because the majority of it is related to severance costs and to facilities closure cost. But I think you'll see, if the model holds and we'll still be working through it, I think you'll see about 70% of the total benefit come through the SG&A line. And there was a second question?","Andrew C. Teich","So how much is the Cores -- I mean, so the other piece of your question was how much of the Cores business relates to U.S. government-funded customers. And that answer is about 50% to 60%. It's a much smaller percentage than [ph] our other lines of business.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Jim Ricchiuti of Needham & Company.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I may have missed it. Did you give the dollar number in terms of revenue that Lorex and Traficon contributed in the quarter?","Anthony L. Trunzo","We didn't, actually. We gave the organic and inorganic, and the delta is already -- while we're here, I can calculate it for you.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","It looks like it's around -- that's right, maybe around $35 million?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Tom has it.","Thomas A. Surran","He wants the revenue for Lorex?","Anthony L. Trunzo","And Traficon.","Thomas A. Surran","Okay. $25 million approximately -- do you want me to be exact, Tony? $25 million on Lorex. Traficon was $8 million.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. How is the -- we don't have a lot of experience with that business but maybe you could talk a little bit about the seasonality of that business in Q4.","Thomas A. Surran","For Lorex?","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","For both.","Thomas A. Surran","Well, Traficon doesn't have a seasonality that we have seen. It's pretty -- there are large orders. So I don't want to say it's smooth. And in terms of what we see in seasonality so far of Lorex is that Qs 2 through 4 are fairly stable, a little bit of a spike. Q1 is the quiet quarter, okay. So you kind of start getting the stock up in Q3, 4 [ph] split for the seasonality if there is a little bit, for the holiday season there is some retail component to our security business. And then you see a little bit of a quietness in Q1.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And one final question, if I may. Just looking at the Thermography business, historically that's been a good -- Q4 has been a good quarter for that business. You have what looks like a pretty good slate of new products that are hitting the market, some improvement on the macro side in Europe. How should we think about Thermography in Q4?","Thomas A. Surran","This year, Thermography business, it does have a strong fourth quarter. We will have a strong fourth quarter relative to the quarters so far this year. The question is, I guess, you could ask relative to prior year, that's going to be a tougher challenge for us. We're hopefully going to be able to get close to those kind of prior year numbers. That's kind of where the target would be. But we still will see a significant sequential improvement over Q3.","Andrew C. Teich","Jim, this is Andy again. The Thermography business has been in a tough operating environment. We've had some of the high-growth regions have slowed down. China did well in Q3. We expect it'll do well again in Q4 but some of the other regions, Japan, Australia, Brazil have had both currency effect and the markets have been a bit soft. I think the wildcard for us is how the new products do in Q4. The launch of the products went extremely well. We were very aggressive in the marketing plans behind the launch of the new products and initial lead activity looks very good, but we're just not sure how that's going to affect overall volumes and mix between these new entry-level products and the higher-end products.","Operator","Our next question will be coming from the line of Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe, Andy and Tony, if I can just follow up on Noah's line of questioning. It seems like we're going to have the sequestration kind of environment in place, perhaps through the presidential election. We're going to see more forced structure cuts next year. We're already hearing about potential cuts to tactical aircraft and readiness in terms of helicopters. So I mean, what do you really have to do differently, or how can you get comfortable forecasting in this environment, I mean? And I'm just trying to understand if you guys have been losing share to some of the larger players out there who have bigger lobbyist presence? I mean, is that putting you -- the amount of money you spend in Washington, is that putting you a little bit behind the eight ball? I'm just trying to get a better context of what can be done to kind of change the methodology given that the environment may actually worsen before it gets better.","Andrew C. Teich","In the -- I don't think that -- to address your first question about are we losing share, I don't see that at all. We track the business that we're in pursuit very closely and understand what happens with it, and I haven't seen any significant competitive losses. And to the contrary, we've had some decent wins in direct head-to-head competition situations. Forecasting the business going forward, I agree with you. We're in a difficult environment because you don't know exactly where the cuts are going to come from. With that said, our CDMQ model, I think, is a very fiscally responsible model. It offers customers the ability to get a product for 100% of the procurement dollars, rather than have their procurement dollars split between development and procurement. And our solutions tend to be priced more competitively relative to the large defense contractors that are out there, and our filling [ph] experience is very good. We filled [ph] a lot of product in Iraq and Afghanistan, in the last few years, and the feedback from the performance and reliability of those products is excellent. The last thing I'd like to mention is if you look at what's happening with the current procurement style, and Bill had a little bit of this in his prepared remarks, is that we're seeing more and more procurements, where a specific performance requirement is written. And the procurement process requires that a bid sample be delivered together with the bid and that has to go through field testing, and that ultimately determines the winner. The PB-EOS program that Bill mentioned in his comments is a prime example of that for the Patrol Boat Electro-Optical System for the U.S. Coast Guard. And there was strong competition because there's lots of people out there interested in getting this kind of business right now and we prevailed because we delivered a solution that was developed in a very short time line and performed extremely well in the field. And that's something that product, which is our Star SAFIRE 280-HDc, (sic) [380-HDc] is going to be a product that will have much broader applicability than just that single U.S. Coast Guard program under our CDMQ model.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. What about the lobbyist spending in kind of Washington presence? I mean, is that something you guys lack in relation to peers? Do you need to boost and bolster your efforts there? I mean, how do you view kind of that dynamic of the business?","Andrew C. Teich","Well, there's no question that we don't have the same clout there as the major defense contractors because we're a smaller business than they are. But that said, I think we do pretty well for our fighting weight. We have a military advisory board that is very well staffed and we get excellent support from the members of that group. And we fight differently than the large defense contractors, and that's part of what makes us attractive to our customers. So I think we'll see over the long term which of these models is ultimately successful but I believe that the CDMQ model that we are, have been and continuing to pursue is one that ultimately is going to be the victor in the style of procurement that the U.S. government's going to have to go to in this environment of constrained spending.","Operator","And moving on, our next question will be from the line of Jonathan Ho with William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I just wanted to get a little bit of a better understanding around sort of the export-import of licenses and how you're thinking about timing in terms of those orders. Were any canceled or is this merely a shift to the right? And does it come back in the fourth quarter potentially, now that things have maybe gotten a little bit better? I just want to get a sense from how you're thinking about that?","William A. Sundermeier","Sure, Jonathan, it's Bill. We had a few orders that were in Q3 that with export delays are going to move to Q4. So we do anticipate those happening in Q4. But Q4 is also a difficult quarter for us with all the holidays to get the licenses through. So if we don't have those licenses in by the end of this month, it makes it much more difficult. So we've looked at that in forecasting the fourth quarter already in anticipation. That's in our numbers in our forecast for this year.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And would it be safe to assume that if it doesn't come in, in the fourth quarter it then just slides to the first quarter and then maybe things normalize? Or is there sort of a permanent flight out? I just want to make sure I understand that.","William A. Sundermeier","If it doesn't happen, we tend to never lose things that we have orders and just timing for export licenses, so it would just move into the first quarter. But I'd say in general, we've done extremely well internally in getting licenses done through the process. We have an excellent, excellent team that works on that, but just fourth quarter is a tough quarter when it comes to just the number of working days and getting things processed.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","So just in terms of price elasticity, I just wanted to understand how you guys are thinking about that at this point. I know that the new E-Series is coming in at pretty revolutionary sort of sub $1,000 price range for the features that you're offering. But I mean I just want to get a sense of are you anticipating sort of a material pickup in volumes with the rollout of this? Or with your market testing and field testing, your sense of elasticity going forward? I mean, is it still there? Is there an inflection point? Just your current thoughts on that.","Thomas A. Surran","One, yes. The amount of value that's being offered by the Ex line is incredible. And then two, at that price point to be able to get the kind of products such as bringing MSX into an entry-level product, the level of resolution, the capabilities of that camera, like you said, it really is a special product. In terms of are we going to continue to bring thermal imaging to new price points? Absolutely. Will we see a specific inflection point? That's hard to ascertain. I think that we expect to continue to see elasticity in the market that we -- that is one of the things that we're going to be pulling -- pushing harder and harder on. And the timing of it, it's just going to be a sequence of products that continue to push on bringing thermal imaging at new price points with new value propositions to new customers.","Andrew C. Teich","Jonathan, I'll add one other thing. This is Andy again. We've stated several times in the past that we think that there are 2 issues that are sort of barriers to much broader scale acceptance of this technology at the lower price point and that's price and awareness. And as we've stated, we have a major effort underway to create a new camera core at a much lower price point and -- that would be built at much larger volumes. And that development is -- continues to progress well and is running on schedule at this point, both technically and from a cost standpoint. But also, we will be stepping up our activities in terms of awareness building. We've already started that activity midway through Q3 with the buildup to the launch of Ex-Series, and we will continue that. And I think we've got to pull on both of those levers simultaneously. Some of the cost savings that we discussed in these realignment activities is going to be directed towards marketing to increase the level of marketing that we're doing there to drive that awareness that's going to be needed in order to get the volumes that we're looking for.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Ruttenbur with CRT Capital.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Yes. The questions I have on the manufacturing side, first of all, what is your current capacity, number of facilities? What do you think you can produce out of that in terms of total volume? And let's just say, since everybody has been so negative, what if markets come back and come back strong, what -- and you're closing all these facilities, what can you produce? Can you go back to your 15% growth target off of those factories? Are you going to have to expand or add capacity?","Anthony L. Trunzo","So Brian, it's Tony. Something really important to try and differentiate here and it's unfortunate that the way events rolled out that these 2 things got conflated. But the realignment, the closure or proposed closure of those 6 facilities, the moving of optics and the consolidation of some of our operations in Sweden, they were all developed well before we had a full understanding of what the current environment was going to present. And they were developed well before we realized that the year was not going to be what we had originally expected. They were strategic in the sense that it was appropriate for us to do some pruning of small under-scaled facilities into larger facilities. And there's a few aspects to that, in addition to the obvious cost savings that are important. There's a strong effort underway within FLIR to be more efficient not just in terms of things like overhead, which this will do, but also be more efficient with our core resources like R&D, and consolidating them into some of our larger facilities, which gives us the opportunity to flex resources, to encourage the kind of collaboration that's necessary and relocating operations into places where all of FLIR can benefit from the lift that vertical integration provides, such as in optics. These things were all developed strategically to position the business for more growth. They were not done in reaction to what we saw as a smaller business. It was quite the opposite. When you look at the facilities that we're either closing or proposing to close, I think the largest one had 75 people, something in that range. And in every case, they're moving to a larger FLIR facility with more infrastructure and more resources. And in none of those cases is there going to be any meaningful reduction in capacity at all. We will have, for the foreseeable future, internally, where we manufacture internally, plenty of capacity to continue to meet what we do expect to be increasing volumes.","Andrew C. Teich","Brian, I'll add one other thing to that, which is, I've been through a number of these cycles in the past and they always have a somewhat different complexion but they also have typical -- a similar outcome, which is at some point, they resolve themselves and the volumes come back strong. And frankly, in the past situations that have been in these things, we probably haven't been ideally positioned to really capitalize on that surge in volume, and this time, we absolutely are. And I think we are better positioned than anybody in the industry to capitalize on it at this point.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Very good. Last question, have you seen any pickup of order activity since the end of the quarter, since the government has restarted? And has there been any surge or orders actually coming through beyond the IDIQs?","Andrew C. Teich","I'll let Bill and Tom talk about each of their businesses there.","Thomas A. Surran","We've seen some small -- helpful finds. In particular, we have a business that sells what we call science cameras into the government and that had really been shut down in the third quarter. And as soon as -- they're basically the fourth quarter and people got back to work in Washington, we did see some orders start coming through that we had expected in Q3. Suddenly, people were trying to get those in. Those were more indicators rather than large volume, but it was a nice indicator.","William A. Sundermeier","This is Bill. So far, we still continue to wait on some orders that we were promised in Q3. So -- I still believe that they're going to happen in Q4, but the shutdown has certainly impacted their ability to deliver them to us.","Andrew C. Teich","Okay, we'll take one more question. We're coming up on the hour here, operator.","Operator","And then final question is coming from the line of Tim Quillin of Stephens.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you could talk about the remaining steps in the development of the next generation infrared core. And then give us -- possibly give us a preview of the potential new markets, especially that FLIR might be able to enter with the products that are enabled with that new core.","Thomas A. Surran","We're very encouraged by where we stand in the development of the product. We're still ironing out a few things. We are working on a variety of products for the integration of that into a variety of markets. And you're right, the price point that we'll be able to address with this new technology opens up a number of markets. I'm not sure we want to communicate all those markets at this time, but it's exciting for us to be able to see those opportunities coming available. The technology -- the level of imaging we're getting, where we stand and being able to ramp production, all on positive signals.","Andrew C. Teich","Tom, this is Andy. Every one of the businesses that we have today is a potential socket for this technology, and we will inject this technology into all of our existing businesses first. We'll probably pick 1 or 2 other new market opportunities to go after in the early days with this that I think will take time to develop, as did the other markets we built over time in Maritime, PVS and Security. And then, of course, we'll offer it as a core. So we'll be a merchant supplier of this technology and it will be available as a core once the product is released.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And no teasers on what markets those might be, though?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Nice try, Tim.","Andrew C. Teich","Not yet but we'll have -- we'll be talking about that in '14.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Andrew C. Teich","Thank you. And thank you, everyone, for joining us today on the call. As we mentioned, certainly, we're not pleased with the results that have happened, thus far, particularly driven by the activities in the government business but we do see a bright long-term future for the business. We're focused on making sure that the business is rightsized at this point for the environment that we're dealing in and such that we can capitalize on the technologies and the vertical integration benefits that we have within the company.","I do want to take a moment to thank all of the FLIR employees in supporting us through this last quarter and in supporting the vision that we have for the business going forward. The employee base has been very responsive in terms of supporting the changes that we've recently introduced, and frankly, in supporting me as the new CEO of this business. And I want to thank them all for their dedication and thoughtful work on that. With that, operator, we'll close the call. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Thank you.

The forward-looking statements we make today speak as of today, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any such statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after today.","Let me now turn the call over to Earl Lewis, Chairman and CEO of FLIR Systems. Earl?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. And thank you, Wit, and thank you everyone, for joining FLIR's fourth quarter earnings call. I'm encouraged by our fourth quarter results, especially our margin performance and pleased with our execution during the challenging 2011. Fourth quarter revenue was $405 million and earnings per diluted share was $0.48, an increase of 12% from 2010. We finished 2011 with $1.5 billion in revenue, representing 11% growth over 2010. And earnings per diluted share were $1.38, or $1.57 excluding litigation settlement and severance charges that occurred during the second and third quarter of '11.","During the fourth quarter, the Commercial Systems division and its TVM segment posted their highest operating margin ever. Raymarine made progress in its product development, introducing a first in a series of groundbreaking and award-winning products. We expect the investments we have made in that area will pay off in 2012 and beyond.","Government Systems' operating margins reached their highest level in over a year, demonstrating our ability to manage cost and deliver strong performance in a challenging environment. We are awarded some significant government business against incumbent competitors, demonstrating our continued competitive strength.","All of this is particularly encouraging. In addition, our unit volumes increased significantly, leveraging our commercial model that we will continue to drive down cost and expand our distribution and service networks. These efforts, combined with continued R&D investment in 2000 (sic) \t will continue through 2012. Focusing on these areas allows us to continuously prove our strong reputation for quality, innovation and trust.","Today we announced our outlook for 2012. We are expecting revenue between $1.55 billion and $1.65 billion for the full year and earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70. This outlook is based on the bottom-up view of the markets in which we compete. The diversification of our business in terms of geographies, products and markets is truly unique and helps us keep an informed eye on the broad competitive landscapes and helps us weather economic disruptions. While external forces will always be part of doing business, we see our core strategies of providing the lowest price, highest quality and easiest to acquire imaging and threat-detection technologies growing significantly over the longer term.","Our goal is to provide returns to shareholders by building on our past success, continuing to innovate and spearheading the industry we compete in. ","Let me now turn the call over to Andy Teich to go over some of the Commercial System division performance. Andy?","Andrew C. Teich","Thanks, Earl. The Commercial Systems division continued to execute during the fourth quarter of 2011. Overall division revenue was at $224.8 million with an operating margin of 28.1%. Our TVM segment recorded revenue of $189.5 million, growth of 7% over the then record fourth quarter of 2010.","TVM showed solid growth in unit volumes but had a difficult comparison to the fourth quarter of 2010 where we had significant high-end security product revenue. TVM operating margin was 33.4% in Q4, our highest quarterly operating margin in the history of TVM, including our predecessor, Thermography and CVS division.","Raymarine recorded a 12% drop in revenue but made significant progress in reducing future costs and developing exciting new products. Increased selling expense and higher R&D expenses related to our investment in new products, including our revolutionary new E-Series line of multifunction displays, affected operating income on the seasonally slow fourth quarter.","TVM bookings in the fourth quarter were strong on a unit volume basis but were down in dollars compared to a strong fourth quarter of 2010, due to variations in quarterly order rates for significant cores orders.","For the full year 2011, TVM bookings dollars grew at an 11% rate compared to 2010.","We saw particularly strong increases in units booked in our high-volume Thermography, Security & Surveillance, Maritime and Personal Vision Systems line. We are particularly excited about our Security & Surveillance business, which has grown units nearly 70% on a compound annual basis since the business' inception in 2006. And yet, we have just started to make headway with the key markets in the space.","Our Personal Vision Systems business saw continued success in the quarter, with the growing demand for our PS and TS handheld cameras. Fourth quarter dollar bookings grew nearly 200% year-over-year, as our retail and online distribution network expands and we're able to reach more consumers with these useful and increasingly more affordable products.","In the Thermography market, we continue to see strong bookings of our new E-series camera platform, which we introduced in the spring of 2011 and have recently launched the next generation of our popular entry-level IX series cameras to the market.","Overall, TVM unit volume bookings increased nearly 70% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010. These unit increases are key part of our strategy to continually reduce cost and thus be able to reduce end-user prices. ","Also, having increasing unit volume allows us to spread our fixed overhead costs across more sales, increasing our operating margin which reached an all-time high of 33.4% in the fourth quarter of 2011.","TVM's strongest geographic region in the quarter was our EMEA region, which grew fourth quarter bookings dollars 18% over the prior year and 16% for the full year of 2011. Over the last couple of quarters, I've mentioned the desire to reduce the order backlog in our TVM business, arising from the ramp up of new products and sourcing arrangements. We finished the year with $136.4 million of TVM backlog, almost identical to our beginning balance of $135.3 million.","Raymarine's performance was mixed during the quarter. The European economic and macro environment uncertainties negatively impacted Raymarine's EMEA region and, to a lesser extent, the Americas region, while the APAC region performed well and grew in bookings dollars. We're very encouraged by the positive response the market has had to our new e7 Multifunction Display, which features Wi-Fi integration with Apple iOS and android products, Hybrid Touch user interface and Bluetooth connectivity to allow for control of the display remotely. ","In the coming week, we will be introducing new midsize 9- and 12-inch variants of this exciting E-Series platform. Additionally, we will be introducing an all-new broadband CHIRP depth finder and a new high-definition color radar product line. We believe each of these new products will be industry-leading in their respective categories and are ready to ship in the quarter.","Commercial Systems' strategy of expanding the size of our various market opportunities is working. While softness arose in some of our businesses during the latter part of 2011, we've grown volumes, continued to innovate new products and enhance our competitive position. Not only have our innovations revolutionized the markets that we serve, they are also designed to increase our profitability. While growing volumes and gaining market share is our mission, we will always do so with a focused eye on profitability. ","Let me now pass the line over to the Bill Sundermeier to discuss the Government Systems division. Bill?","William A. Sundermeier","Thanks, Andy. Government Systems division had a mixed fourth quarter in what was a challenging 2011. Revenue for the quarter was down compared to last year but operating margins improved, reflecting good execution, favorable mix and a focus on reducing cost.","Bookings activity was slow during the quarter due to various macro events that caused further funding and procurement uncertainty for many of our customers. The U.S. Congressional budget super committee process, continuing budget and general economic uncertainty across Europe, the Arab spring and continued troop drawdowns all appeared to affect our customers ","While we saw no major program losses, the results of these global trends was a return to delayed procurement and funding cloudiness after a fairly promising third quarter. Despite these procurement delays, divisional profitability was strong, spurred in large part by a 40.2% operating margin in Surveillance. That segment's best margin level in nearly 2 years.","Product mix and lower expenses were the driving factors in the increase when compared to the fourth quarter of 2010.","Overall, Government Systems backlog ended 2011 at $313.9 million, down $59.8 million from the third quarter. Order activity was subdued across each of our segments, driven by continuing budget trepidation. Surveillance backlog finished at $247.2 million.","Airborne solutions were particularly in demand internationally during the fourth quarter with a large order for gimbals in the UAE, a $6 million order for the Colombian Air Force and a $4 million order for our 9-inch gimbals from the Japanese defense force.","With a rich history now fitting the Japanese Coast Guard, we are very proud now to be a key vendor to their defense initiatives as well. We are pursuing some very large opportunities in new international markets, while we're successful in making progress in a fairly new market, Africa.","We made significant inroads with new customers here in the U.S. during the fourth quarter as well. We were awarded a large IDIQ opportunity for outfitting U.S. Military MRAP with onboard thermal sensor systems. The award for the VOSS program, or vehicle optic sensor system  had little impact to the fourth quarter backlog, but our portion of the program has a ceiling of $334 million over a 5-year period. This win is notable in that it was competitively bid and we will now be placed side-by-side the long standing supplier on this program. Additionally, we are part of the winning team on the U.S. Air Force's A29 aircraft program, initially a 20 aircraft IDIQ, which represents an opportunity to demonstrate our capabilities with the U.S. Air Force, a customer that has not been a large part of our business in the past.","Testing by the VOSS team is ongoing and should continue through May with the first delivery order on the IDIQ expected to come in the second half of the year.","Our infrared products are also continuing their success with long-time U.S. customers for air, ground and troop applications as well. to receive the nearly $7 million order to outfit MEDEVAC helicopters for the Army and order for 10 of our Star 380 HD gimbals systems from the Navy for PGFS tower-based force protection initiative [ph] , and a nearly $4 million order for our handheld recon units for use by the U.S. Marine Saber [ph Light program.","Our Detection segment ended the fourth quarter with $25.1 million in backlog, a reduction of $10.2 million from the end of what was a very strong third quarter of 2011. We won significant multiyear business during the fourth quarter but did not show up in backlog. For example, Detections Chem-Bio  business won a heavily competed $49 million program to supply the U.S. Army with enzyme-based chemical detection kits over a 5-year period. Several orders for our Fido detection handheld explosives detectors came in during the fourth quarter as is an order from a U.S. agency for 50 of our handheld identiFINDER 2 radiation detectors. And internationally, we shipped our first Mass Spectrometer to an Asian agency for use in environmental protection.","We continue to build out our international distribution channel in the Detection business and look to grow the percentage of international sales measurably in the coming year. Additionally, we intend 2012 to significantly reduce the amount of contract R&D in Detection and replace that business with much higher product revenue.","Our Integrated Systems segment finished 2011 with a backlog of $41.6 million, which was down slightly from the $44.8 million at the end of third quarter. We continue our work at the new Doha International Airport and won a networked wide-area surveillance project for the Palm Springs Airport. ","A force protection solution Integrated Systems delivered 2 more, COSSPS [ph] systems for the Army during the fourth quarter and we completed our first factory acceptance test for a project for the Qatari Armed forces.","We expect 2012 to be a trough year for the government procurement as we remain cautious around the global budgetary environment given the funding delays that seems to be continuing in many of our markets. In 2011, we saw several significant programs that we're working toward not materialize. Witnessed several international deliveries held up due to payment and funding issues and we found money shifting between programs.","However, we are hearing from our customers that ISR and [indiscernible] are a priority. Our products value to price ratio remains the best in the industry, a particularly important factor as world budgets tighten. We saw some very encouraging trends in the recent months in getting aboard some large historically sole source program. We have successfully integrated ICx into our operations and they are now focused on increasing product revenue as strengthening our global sales infrastructure. ","Our Integrated Systems business is beginning to gain traction as customers see the benefit of interconnected full-spectrum multi-threat solutions that are offered with the best technologies, the best services at the lowest prices. All of this adds up to a very well-positioned government business ready to gain market share and again see growth. That concludes my comments. And now, I'll let our CFO, Tony Trunzo, to talk about FLIR's financial performance during the quarter. Tony?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Thanks, Bill. Fourth quarter consolidated revenue was $405.2 million, 7% lower than the fourth quarter of 2010. International revenue was 49.3% of the Q4 total compared with 46.8% in the fourth quarter of 2010. Sales to the U.S. government represented 23.7% of the total revenue in Q4, down from 30.6% of revenue in the fourth quarter of last year.","Consolidated fourth quarter gross margin was 55.5%, an increase of 2.3 percentage points compared with the fourth quarter of last year and consolidated operating margin of 27.1% was 4.2 percentage points better than Q4 of 2010.","Surveillance segment operating income was $58.8 million, resulting in segment operating margin of 40.2%, 4.2 percentage points better than Q4 of last year. Favorable product mix and lower operating expenses, as a result of Q3 cost reduction efforts, contributed to the strong margin performance.","TVM segment's operating income of $63.2 million was up 17% from last year and resulted in an operating margin of 33.4%, 3 points higher than Q4 of last year and matching the highest ever for this business. TVM accounted for 51.4% of consolidated segment operating income in Q4, compared with 44.7% last year.","Raymarine was breakeven for the quarter, as expenses associated with the expansion of our sales platform and new product introduction affected cost in the quarter. Integrated Systems' segment operating income was $1.5 million, while the Detection segment reported an operating loss of $700,000.","Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the quarter were $126 million, up 2% from the prior year.","For the full year 2011, consolidated revenue increased by 11% to $1.54 billion. TVM segment revenue increased by 15% to $616.3 million and represented 42.8% of total revenue for the year, while Raymarine contributed $171.5 million in revenue. Surveillance revenue was $577.6 million compared to $671.2 million in 2010. For the full year, Detection contributed $79.9 million in revenue while Integrated Systems reported revenue of $54.8 million.","International revenue represented 48% of the 2011 total, the highest proportion in at least 10 years while sales to the U.S. government represented 28.8% of the annual total versus 34.1% in 2010 and the lowest percentage since 2003.","Full year gross margin was 53.7% compared to 55% last year. Excluding Raymarine and ICx, 2011 gross margin was 57.4%, up 57 basis points from 2010.","TVM reported 2011 operating income of $194.7 million, up 19% for the year. And Raymarine segment operating income increased by 43% to $11.9 million. Surveillance segment operating income was $208.5 million in 2011 compared with $256.2 million in 2010, representing a full year operating margin of 36.1%.","Detection reported an operating loss of $5.6 million in 2011 while Integrated Systems posted operating income of $1.7 million. Excluding a litigation settlement and restructuring charges that totaled $44.3 million, 2011 EBITDA was $432.7 million.","Discontinued operations proved a loss, net of tax benefit of $700,000 in Q4 and a $1.2 million loss for the year. During Q4, we divested 2 of the 4 discontinued operations and adjusted the carrying value of the remaining 2 businesses. We expected to divest these remaining businesses earlier this year.","Cash provided by operations for the quarter was $116.2 million, easily the highest in our history. Quarterly cash flow was aided by reversal of prepaid VAT and other tax items from Q3. For the full year, cash provided by operations was 110% of net income. In 2011, we funded $42 million in capital expenditures, $38 million in dividend, $161 million of share repurchases and $27 million of acquisitions with internally generated cash flow and ended the year with a cash balance of $440.8 million. The year-over-year increase in cash of $247.7 million is equal to the net proceeds of our bond issuance in August and leaves us with ample flexibility to continue to invest in our business, return meaningful amounts of capital to shareholders both through share repurchase and dividend and make strategic acquisitions, all while maintaining our investment-grade credit profile.","During Q4, we repurchased 1.4 million shares of our stock at an average price of $25.51 per share. And for all of 2011, we repurchased 6.1 million shares of stock at an average price of $26.19 per share. We currently have more than 13 million shares remaining in our repurchase authorization which expires in February of 2013. During 2012, we expect to continue to actively repurchase shares with the actual amount of any repurchases dependent on the prevalent share price.","As Earl stated earlier, we announced our revenue and earnings per share outlook for 2012 today. We currently expect revenue for the year to be in the range of $1.55 billion to $1.65 billion and earnings per fully diluted share to be in the range of $1.60 to $1.70. This outlook assumes a modest decline in Government Systems revenue but continued growth in our commercial businesses, as well as improved operating margins at both Raymarine and at the acquired ICx businesses.","We currently expect first quarter 2012 earnings per share to be near the level of the first quarter of last year and for earnings performance to improve as we move through the year.","In addition, we announced the 17% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.07 per share, reflecting our continued confidence in future growth. This increase still represents a modest payout ratio of approximately 17%. As we demonstrated last year, a dividend at this level enhances our capital return strategy while still providing ample funds for strategic growth. The first quarter dividend will be paid on March 9 to holders of record as of February 21.","That concludes the summary of our fourth quarter and annual financial results. Let me now turn the call back to Earl.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. And operator, we're ready for our questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Jeremy Devaney with BB&T Capital Markets.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","First I wanted to take a look at the Raymarine segment. Last quarter, you noted that sales of Raymarine were worse than your expectations and performance this quarter and continues on that weak pattern. Can you comment on what specifically you need to do to get that business growing or provide color on your outlook for the segment?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, actually, we can. The manager of that group is here, Tom Surran, and I'm happy to have him report on what he's doing and why.","Tom Surran","Probably the most important thing is to fix the product line. That's where we've done a lot of investment over the past 1.5 years. And those products are just starting to come out, and there'll be couple of announcements at the Miami boat show and we think, with those products, as Andy mentioned, are industry-leading in their respective categories. That's probably the most important thing. Obviously, the boating market hasn't fully recovered yet, but we think with those products, we'll still be able to do well even in the current market conditions.","Earl R. Lewis","The other point of question, of course, is it's a very cyclical business and we expect Q1 and Q2 to be very good. The initial acceptance of Tom's new products has been terrific. A number of awards and a lot of people are very excited about it. I think we'll see Raymarine do very well next year, even without a big increase in the boating industry --","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","All right, terrific. Moving back over to the Government System segment. You mentioned what the U.S. government sales were. Approximately how much of that was DoD? And also specifically, I was wondering if you could provide us some detail on the trends you're seeing in the DoJ, DHS, DBP [ph] end markets?","Earl R. Lewis","Sure, Bill will comment but just in general, most of -- well, the 24% in Q4, is that specifically -- or the 28% for the year. Or is your question more about the year or just Q4?","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just for the year, if we could see what the DoD portion of the U.S. government was, and what the trends that you're seeing in the non-DoD U.S., call it, sieve businesses?","Earl R. Lewis","Okay. Bill, you have an estimate on DoD breakout?","William A. Sundermeier","We talked for the whole company and less than 25% for our segment for the whole year, do we have that? We'll get that up, Earl, [indiscernible] and outlook -- 45? Yes. Of the U.S. government piece, the majority of that, Jeremy, is going to be DoD. What remains after that is going to be largely DHS. But the significant majority of it is DoD. We don't track those numbers. We could get them by pulling out customer by customer, but we don't really specifically track which piece ends up in DoD and which piece ends up at DHS. But those are the 2 main buckets.","Earl R. Lewis","However, looking going forward, DHS is clearly going to be a higher percentage of our business in 2012, given the borders and given some of our programs we're working on with DHS.","William A. Sundermeier","That they have been passed.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. So we'll see that mix changing more towards DHS for sure.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","All right, that's really helpful. And last question for you at I'll let you go here. Looking at the R&D, the R&D in the quarter was surprisingly low to me. Looking like it's down sort of 100 bps  quarter-over-quarter and 150 bps versus Q1 and Q2 this year. Should we look for R&D next year to trend back up to 9.5% to 10% or are we expecting to stay below 9% here? Just your thoughts on that?","Earl R. Lewis","My recollection of our budget, it's a little over 9% for this year, but I can't -- somebody can confirm that while we're here.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes, let me get that number and I'll pop back in between questions.","Earl R. Lewis","There's no conscious effort to significantly reduce R&D, no. If that's the question.","Anthony L. Trunzo","[indiscernible] It's going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter at 100 basis points either way a quarter is not all that uncommon. There was a little bit more paid R&D in Q4 than we have seen in previous quarters, so that may have accounted for part of what you saw, Jeremy.","Earl R. Lewis","It reduces a little bit. We don't have a lot of paid R&D. In fact, we're trying to get less, but it will bounce around as Tony says.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment from Sterne Agee.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I just want to follow-up on that R&D question. It's a pretty significant amount in general, the whole dollars that you're spending. Can you maybe just give a little more color how it's allocated in terms of -- are you seeing more opportunities to make investments in one area or another? Maybe just give us a little color.","Earl R. Lewis","We clearly significantly increased the ratio in Raymarine in this third and fourth quarters of last year in order to get into some new products into the market. So I think there our spending was significantly higher than the typical ratio between sales dollars and R&D. The balance of our business, I think, in Government is slightly less than Commercial, in general, not a lot, but a little bit. And overall, I guess, the question really relates to how do we go about allocating R&D, and that's done very much through a rack-and stack process where we through individual projects and draw a line at some point, normally around 8%, 9%, 10% depending on the division and stop investing in R&D at that point. It's a relatively simple process but everybody has a pet project, so to speak.","Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Yes No, I'm sure. And just, Bill, can you maybe comment a little bit on this -- seems like MRAP opportunity here is pretty significant, and I can remember back when you were precluded or at least not allowed to get involved. And I think the previous competition or you've always had a very good system here. Maybe you can give us a little color on that program?","William A. Sundermeier","Yes. We're very excited about the VOSS program. You might know, we provided similar systems to the Special Operating (sic) [Operations] Forces and they've really enjoyed our systems and that really helped us breakthrough on this program and we certainly have a pedigree there with special operators and we hope to pass that on directly to MRAP programs. And the ceiling on that is $334 million and we [indiscernible] competing very well in that space, so looking forward and starting to deliver on that program second half of this year.","Earl R. Lewis","Just out of curiosity, in Q4 of '08, R&D as a percent of revenue was 7.2%. In Q4 of '09, it was 7.8%. In Q4 of '10, it was 8.0%. In Q4 of '11, it was 8.6%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim Quillin from Stephens Incorporated.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","I know you don't like to give guidance by segment, but could you just talk about maybe relative expectations in the Government and Commercial side? In other words, are you looking for growth on both sides of the business, or is Government expected to be down a little bit and tagging one more question into that, what does Europe look like on the Commercial side?","Earl R. Lewis","Okay, I'll let Andy answer the Europe. Commercial up and Government down in our plan for this year.","Andrew C. Teich","So Tim, the -- Europe has been dicey for us starting about midway through Q4, we saw kind of a market slowdown there. But that said, on a year-over-year comparison, the EMEA region for TVM was the strongest growth area for us for the quarter. The area that -- of EMEA that's been the most strongly affected is the most commercial of our businesses. So Raymarine was hit pretty hard in the EMEA region in Q4. So we're hoping that the Greek situation gets resolved and consumer confidence starts to build and can get on with decent growth rates there again.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","And Tony, just a question on cash flows which was pretty strong in the fourth quarter, working capital has dinged you, I guess in both in 2010 and 2011. I'm wondering if that turns positive or is less negative in 2012? And if you had any estimates for us on CapEx and D&A as well?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I don't have a good -- we don't have a CapEx budget that we're in a position to share quite yet for the year, Tim.","Timothy J. Quillin - Stephens Inc., Research Division","It'll be up?","Anthony L. Trunzo","It will be up.  Yes, we're going to more in the commercial side of the business. We've got some capital projects there that we're going to go after this year and we'll talk a little more about those as we roll through the year. In terms of operating cash flow, 110% of net income was the second best we've ever done in the year. We've been as high as I think 118% a couple years back. I think we'd like to see ourselves get back into that 120% of  net income kind of area. I would anticipate overall that this year, working capital growth would not be very significant, given that we don't have a significant plan for increased revenue. And frankly, inventories are a little higher than we'd like to see them. There's a couple of areas we're going to be burning off inventory because turns have come down a little bit as we exited 2011. But overall, I would expect 2012 to be a pretty strong cash flow year. I think that we should be in good position to beat that 110% of net income we did this year. And ideally, get up closer to 120% of net income range.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Ho from William Blair.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just taking a look at the growth in the Commercial segment, there is a bit of a drop off just in the core TVM segment. Can you maybe breakout by subregion or -- not subregion, subcomponent where some of the impacts to the TVM growth on a year-over-year basis?","Earl R. Lewis","Hey, Jonathan. So the biggest area that we were challenged in Q4 was in cores and components. But that business is a bit of a lumpy business because we have some large more military-oriented buyers there. They're buying cooled  and uncooled cores from us, related to major program pursuit. The business overall was up in single-digit percentages, which is not atypical, fairly consistent with our budget actually, in terms of bookings, but it was down in Q4. And that had a fairly material impact. The one other area that was down and continues to be down is cooled long-range systems in the border program, the national border program. So that's been slower for us. It has been onset by very strong growth in uncooled security camera sales, and we talked about that in the prepared script. So the good news here is that the growth rate there is very strong, and I think that we can continue to sustain the slower volume behavior in those international border programs with the increase in uncooled security and more commercial and infrastructure-related projects.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just a question for Bill. With regard to your comments around 2012, looking like there could potentially be a trough level, just given what we're seeing with the 2013 defense budget and some of the outlooks that are there. What gives you confidence that the 2012 numbers are where they -- are potentially the bottom and what's going to give you confidence that, that's going to be a growth business in 2013 and beyond?","William A. Sundermeier","As we look forward, there's -- we've been very strong in the airborne segment and even in our own traditional surveillance business, we have room to grow and land capabilities that we want to expand into. We've been talking about soldier solutions which actually did grow last year and it's just continuing very, very well within our segment. Also the Integrated Systems growth is doing very well. We're getting a lot of traction there and growing into an integrated solutions environment, that business anticipated to grow quite rapidly this year, and I see that going into 2013 as well. And Detection, their business is traditionally been almost 90% U.S. market, since we're just establishing our international sales force to be able to sell these around the world. And I see big growth potential there as well. So we're really hoping that our investments pay dividends into 2013.","Earl R. Lewis","One -- just a comment. While the revenue for the Surveillance group, which is of course the biggest drag on the growth side of this business, will be down this year compared to last year. We believe that orders actually will be up this year compared to last year, and that's from a very detailed review of every potential program that we know of. So that's kind of the thinking that this may be the trough.","Jonathan Ho - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Got it. And just one final question around the overall environment. You guys talked a little bit about the fourth quarter being impacted by the late timing of the budget and some of the challenges there. Since the budget's been signed, are you seeing that activity level pick back up or do you feel like there's just sort of a push out from '11 into '12 and optically the backlog could start to improve from here?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Q1 was up to a little bit of a slow start so I think we're anticipating that money start pulling more towards Q2.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Maybe one for Tony and Bill. Tony, just on the outlook for next year, the EPS, I'm assuming at these levels the buyback continues. I don't know if there's any change, material change in the tax rate, but I would think the operating margins would not trend down that much from the fourth quarter. Maybe -- can you give us some help on sort of bottom-line from margin perspective? I mean, you already saw major declines in Surveillance. It doesn't sound like it's going to be that much of a headwind next year. Is there reason to think the margins can't stay close to within 100 or 200 basis points of where you were in fourth quarter here?","William A. Sundermeier","In the Surveillance segment, the answer is probably no, Michael. The overall margins that we saw in Q4 and margins we saw in 2011 do appear to be sustainable for 2012. If you look at, I think Surveillance margins in 2011 overall, we're about 36%. If they come down from that, it will be a pretty small amount, and we talked about that business being a mid-30% operating margin business and I think that's still a pretty good assumption. This team has done a remarkable job of mitigating the decline in revenue in that business with terrific cost management and a really good job maintaining gross margins. And I think that's going to serve us well as that business kind of moves to stabilize. In terms of the -- below the operating margin, Pete, we expect that we'll continue to buy back shares this year, as I said. The exact amount we haven't decided internally, so not a lot to share there. It's going to continue to be opportunistic. We've got a big buyback authorization. At the current levels, I would doubt that you'll see us consume anywhere close to the entirety of that buyback, but I think will be continue to be active in buying back shares. And the tax rate will continue to come down a little bit. It came down last year and we're making some good progress on some planning activities. We'll whittle them down a little bit over the course of 2011 -- I'm sorry, 2012 as well.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then Bill, just quickly, I guess it sounded like, Earl, you just said, orders will be strong this year. I mean, is the plan...","Earl R. Lewis","That -- I didn't use the word strong. I know I didn't.","Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Can the book-to-bill be greater than one and can you grow backlog and exit '12 with a higher backlog?","William A. Sundermeier","That's [indiscernible].","Anthony L. Trunzo","That's what the numbers look like right now.","Earl R. Lewis","And it's simple because these factories just aren't efficient without a backlog. So we have to get the backlog back up a little bit.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lewis of Lazard Capital Markets.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","On the book-to-bill, Mike just asked the question I was asked about the expectations being above onetime since '12. But now that we have VOSS moving in, which was a great win, what should we be looking for with regard to concentration of VOSS in the 2012 period? I guess that's a question for Bill.","William A. Sundermeier","Sure. We mentioned in the script that [indiscernible] continued through May, and we wouldn't expect our first delivery of order until -- no earlier than June, but most likely we're anticipating it in the first part of Q3. So hopefully, we'll have some bookings and shipments at the end of this year, but the concentration is going to be towards the latter half of 2012.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, so it's back-end weighted. And then, with the material increase in '13, off that contract, is this a 3-year contract, Bill?","William A. Sundermeier","5-year contract. $334 million ceiling.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then actually on Detection, should we expect to see profitability in '12? And...","Earl R. Lewis","Yes.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","We hope so. But what do you think the probable -- if you can give us some kind of probable margin range that you guys would expect to help us in the model, because the ceiling has been all over the place.","William A. Sundermeier","I think we wouldn't want to go there.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Yes. Mike, we're going to be careful about guiding to margin by segment. But if you look at the opportunities -- if you look at 2012, Bill's going to be challenged to grow operating income in the Surveillance segment, given that we expect the revenue now in that business to be down. Segment margins probably going to be down as well, or segment income is probably going to be down. The Detection and Integrated Systems key [indiscernible] are poised for substantially better performance in 2012 than they had in 2011. Not only will they be profitable, but I think we're looking for the totality of the ICx businesses to begin to generate a meaningful return on the investment that we made in 2012. And the same is true for Raymarine. On the Commercial Systems side, the TVM business has achieved some remarkable margin expansion given the growth and the cost reduction and price reduction strategies they pursued. So I think when you look at margin performance, you're going to see an expansion at Raymarine. And if probably not, in respect to the TVM business.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then, one more question. When we look at the Commercial business, it would have appear that we're going to see a back-end loaded year. How should we think about that with regard to would it be a 40-60 mix there, or am I off point with that assumption?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I don't think we want to get into more of the sort of quarterly outlook that what we just gave. I mean, we have some visibility in Q1 being reasonably comparable to Q1 of last year in terms of earnings per share. But I think going beyond that, in terms of what the rest of the year lines up as, we do expect op earnings performance to improve during the year, but I wouldn't really want to go beyond that.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Tony, just on tax rate, you it's going to be down a little bit. I was at 30%, should I go to 29% or is it even lower than that?","Anthony L. Trunzo","It will be lower than what it was this year.","Michael S. Lewis - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then do you actually have repos embedded in your EPS guidance?","Anthony L. Trunzo","A little bit.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, not a lot.","Anthony L. Trunzo","We average it through the year, Jeremy, it's a tiny amount.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Ruttenbur with Morgan Keegan.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","Good questions have already been asked. So the question I had was on SG&A in the fourth quarter. Did you guys pay cash bonuses? Why was there be such a dramatic drop? Because normally there's a big bubble at the year.","Earl R. Lewis","There's a little bit of cash bonuses that we over-accrued for in the first 3 quarters, so we didn't have as much of a cash bonus accrual in Q4.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","And normally it's much, much higher in the fourth quarter? Is that...","Earl R. Lewis","Not much, much... that was one of the reasons, there was about 8 reasons that brought the SG&A down.","Brian W. Ruttenbur - Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc., Research Division","What were the other top 1 or 2?","Earl R. Lewis","Okay, let's see. The bonus accrual was one. The savings that Bill implemented basically in Q2 rolled through -- yes, that was in Q3, right after Q2, were -- and they have a little stick on [ph] next year.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Well we didn't have --last year, we had about $7 million in M&A expenses.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, it was the other way around. Yes, it was the other way around. Yes. It was the M&A expense -- the year before, but we didn't have this year. And legal was down, I think.","Operator","And your next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Andy, question for you. I wasn't sure if you gave any kind of color on the TVM bookings in the Americas, in North America. You indicated that there's some choppiness in the EMEA, but what about North America? How that's holding up?","Earl R. Lewis","It was doing quite well through the first 3 quarters of the year, but in -- similar to the slowdown that we found in the EMEA region, things slowed down midway through Q4. So the bookings were softer, and particularly in premium segment of our product line. The volume products continued to do well. So I think it was just the economic overhang that just slowed things down towards the end of the quarter, as it were. We're hoping the fab resolves this year.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Have you seen any change thus far in Q1? I know there's some seasonal issues but...","Earl R. Lewis","It's really too early to tell.","James Ricchiuti - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. And what about on the core components area? It sounds like the weakness was mostly military related. Any color just in general in the commercial portion of that?","Earl R. Lewis","The commercial portion of the cores business continues to execute to plan during Q4. So it really was timing of some military orders in Q4. The other area that we have softness in the cores business in Q4 was in APAC region, and we're taking steps organizationally to resolve that this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.","Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is for Omear Khalid for Noah here. Just a couple of quick housekeeping questions. You guys answered most of them but going back to Michael's question earlier, is it true that you guys did not have any onetime items in the 4Q margin performance. Is that correct?","Earl R. Lewis","Yes. I mean there's always onetime items, but there's nothing that we call out as special.","Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And maybe with regard to the backlog before '12, is there any color on timing, back end, front-end loaded or anything like that?","Anthony L. Trunzo","Well, bookings, I mean, we don't guide to bookings. As Bill stated, we had a little bit of a slow start, but I think overall, the bookings outlook is going to parallel with the revenue outlook for the year.","Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just finally, just again, the question was asked earlier and you responded, you said it was around $0.01 of buyback embedded, is that accurate for the full year?","Anthony L. Trunzo","No. I said a tiny amount.","Omear Khalid - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A tiny amount. And so is that going to be -- I mean can you quantify that a little bit for us or no?","Earl R. Lewis","You keep in mind though, we do plan to make fairly significant buybacks of shares. The effect on EPS is a small amount because of the way it's calculated, et cetera. But we're still going to be buying back a significant amount of shares,  in my opinion anyway.","Anthony L. Trunzo","And no, I mean, I think beyond that, we're not really in a position to quantify because it's going to depend on the share price and what the opportunity is to buys shares when we consider it to be an attractive level.","Operator","And your final question comes from Jeremy Devaney from BB&T Capital Markets.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Dock an extra one in there. The revenue from acquisitions in the quarter, what did you see there?","Anthony L. Trunzo","I'm sorry, what is the question?","Earl R. Lewis","Say it again.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Revenue from acquisition.","Anthony L. Trunzo","In Q4?","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Oh, small.","Earl R. Lewis","Yes, very small.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Low single digit, millions.","Earl R. Lewis","Maybe at $2 million.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Because all we bought during the year was Tacktick, which is a little add-on to the Raymarine business and Arias [ph] , which was an add-on to Andy's business and the revenue of those businesses is pretty small.","Earl R. Lewis","Arias, I believe, was less than $2 million.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Looking at acquisition strictly...","Earl R. Lewis","It's $3 million.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","$3 million? Right. Looking at acquisitions, as you move ahead, buybacks are an opportunity, obviously, to raise the dividend. We're still seeing cash [indiscernible] indicated can be approaching 120 million -- 120% of net. What are you thinking on cash uses? What are you seeing as M&A opportunities in commercial versus government? Any color on that?","Earl R. Lewis","No. No color on it right now. I'd say as of right today, as we sit here, we don't have a lot in the pipeline. But I'm not so certain that the second half won't see a pick up for us.","Jeremy W. Devaney - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","All right. Well I appreciate the detail.","Earl R. Lewis","That's not so much detail.","Anthony L. Trunzo","Can't give you much detail on that really, as you know. Operator, I guess we're done.","Operator","There are no further questions now, sir.","Earl R.

Andy?","Andy Teich","Thank you, Todd. I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to FLIR\u2019s First Quarter 2015 Earnings Call. With Todd and me today is our COO, Tom Surran; Interim CFO, Dave Muessle, Chief Marketing Officer, Travis Merrill; and SVP of Corporate development, Shane Harrison. ","I will start on slide 4 of the presentation. This morning we recorded first quarter revenue of 345 million and earnings per share of $0.34. While revenue was down approximately 2% compared to the prior year as the recent movement of the U.S. dollar added approximately 17 million of headwind to our revenue. ","Earnings per share were up 35% excluding charges related to our restructuring activities. Adjusted operating margin of 19% was nearly 5 percentage points higher than the first quarter of 2014. Our international operating footprint as well as the savings realized from our restructuring drove the growth and profitability despite the revenue pressure. ","Cash flow was strong as well with operating cash flow representing a 156% of the net income. Overall backlog finished the quarter at 557 million improving both sequentially and year-over-year. ","During the quarter, we introduced several new products across the spectrum of performance and price. At the premium performance end we introduced New Science and maritime cameras and at the entry level we continue to introduce Lepton based products that we expect to attract new customer in our existing markets. These included the pocket sized C2 for industrial trades people and TCX thermal security camera for small and medium sized businesses. ","On the consumer side, we recently launched FLIR FX home monitoring camera that is a highly differentiated product that provides people a very versatile, reliable, efficient and fun imaging and security solution. Additionally our OEM segment automotive product line takes another step for its broader adoption of our technology by being included as an option on the 2016 Cadillac CT6, the first American made make to offer our thermal technology. ","Moving to slide 5, in our earning release today we reaffirmed our outlook for 2015. We continue to expect revenues between 1.55 billion and 1.6 billion for the full year and earnings per diluted share in the range of the $1.60 to $1.70. This range incorporates our current views of currency rates for the year. We also announced today our regular quarterly dividend of $0.11 per share which will be payable on June 5, to shareholder of record as of May 22. ","I\u2019ll now pass the line over to Dave to review the first quarter financial results. Dave. ","Dave Muessle","Thanks, Andy. The following discussion on pre-operating results for the first quarter excludes restructuring expenses totaling $314,000 in 2015 and $8.4 million in 2014. ","On slide 7, you\u2019ll see a summarized income statement. First quarter consolidated revenue was $344.5 million a decrease of 2% compared to the first quarter of 2014. The increased strength of the U.S. dollar during the past year impacted the revenue comparison year-over-year as a revenue on a constant currency basis increased by approximately 3%. Our security and detection segments reported a 32% and 25% increase in sales year-over-year respectively. All of our other segments reported year-over-year declines most notably an 8% drop in surveillance. ","However, our instruments and maritime segments which are most impacted by currency due to their sales volumes in Europe and in local currencies, would've shown increases of 7% and 9% respectively on a constant currency basis. Sales to the U.S. Government represented 15% of total revenue in Q1 compared to 20% of revenue in the first quarter of last year. International revenue was 54% of total revenue in both 2015 and 2014.","Consolidated Q1 gross margin was 51%, a 3 percentage point increase compared to last year. Consolidated operating margin before restructuring was 19% compared with 14% in the first quarter last year. Segment level operating expenses declined year-over-year by 2% due to currency and restructuring benefits.","Corporate administrative costs were lower due to reduced legal spending associated with several matters that existed in 2014. Our tax rate in the quarter is 24% which is very comparable to the 2014 rate when excluding discreet items from last year. Net earnings excluding restructuring costs were $48.1 million, an increase of 33% over last year and earnings per fully diluted share were $0.34, an increase of 35% over Q1 of 2014.","Turning to Slide 8, you will see that we closed the first quarter with cash of $547.8 million, an increase of $16.4 million during the quarter. Stronger U.S. dollar reduced value of cash held by our operations outside United States by $31.4 million. Our cash flow from operations in the first quarter was $74.9 million, a 156% of quarterly earnings. As we indicated in our last call, we saw reasonably good collections during the quarter as accounts receivable declined by $42.9 million during the first quarter, but inventories did increase by $19.7 million in the quarter. ","We had capital expenditures of 13.1 million in the first quarter and returned $15.4 million to shareholders through the payment of dividends. We did not repurchase any shares of our stock during the first quarter under the 15 million share repurchase program that we announced in February. However, for the remainder of 2015, we expect to continue our long standing approach to buybacks whereby purchase activity is governed by our view of relative value, expected capital needs and M&A opportunities. As Andy stated, we are reaffirming our full year 2015 outlook for revenue and fully diluted earnings per share. While the strengthening dollar was a significant headwind in our revenue in the first quarter, the impact was largely in line with our expectations. This concludes the summary of our first quarter results. ","Let me now turn the call over to Tom Surran to cover our operational highlights for Q1. Tom?","Tom Surran","Thank you, Dave. Slide 10 is a summary of our segment operating results. Despite top-line softness, first quarter consolidated segment operating income grew 13% over the first quarter 2014 and segment operating margin improved by more than 300 basis points, 23% excluding restructuring charges. Total order backlog finished the quarter $557 million which is 8% higher than first quarter of 2014.","Moving to Slide 11. During the first quarter the Surveillance segment revenue declined 8% year-over-year to 112.9 million and strength in our integrated systems products was more than offset by softness in our airborne gimbals in manned portable product lines. In the prior year we had significant deliveries of our BRITE Star Airborne Systems to U.S. Department of Defense Program. Delivery to international customers made up nearly 60% of Surveillance segment revenue in the quarter. It should be noted that at the beginning of this year we reclassified our Personal Vision Systems product line from the OEM and emerging segment to the Surveillance segment in order to better align the product development, sales functions with the needs of our customers for these products. Prior year results have been adjusted for this reclassification.","Surveillance segment operating income of $30.3 million excluding restructuring charge increased 11% versus the prior year which represents 460 basis point increases in operating margin driven by improved product margins, of favorable margin shift in product mix and lower operating expenses. Surveillance segment order flow was down versus last year but faced a challenging comparison as Q1 2014 included a single customer order with over $30 million with surveillance product. Declines in U.S. government orders and delays in number of international orders were also contributing factors. Surveillance 12 months backlog finished the quarter $270 million representing a book-to-bill ratio of 0.8 times. Surveillance continues to fill its order book with a higher number of smaller size orders which fits well with our commercially developed military qualified value proposition to our customers.","Turning to slide 12, instrument segment first quarter revenue was larger than flat compared to the prior year finishing at $83.8 million. On a constant currency basis the segment would have grown 7% as recent product introductions gained traction in the various markets. Stronger gross margin as well as lower operating expense helped drive 18% growth in instruments operating income versus last year. And operating margin improved 520 basis points to 34% excluding the impact of restructuring charges.","Near the end of the quarter we\u2019ve gained shipping the C2 pocket size fully integrated thermal imager. It is based on our Lepton camera core which you\u2019ll see on slide 13. We also introduced new versions of our K-series fire fighting cameras that feature our new flexible scene enhancement or FSX technology which produces ultra-crisp thermal imagery. Additionally we introduce four new high end cool systems for the science and R&D market. You can expect continued product expansion throughout the year with new innovations in both the high end and low end of our insurance products suite.","Slide 14 summarizes the OEM in emerging segment with Q1 revenue of 39.8 million was down 17% versus the prior year. This decline was the result of divestment of our OCG business which contributed over 3 million of revenue last year as well as reduced deliveries to our defense related OEM\u2019s and negative FX impact were approximately $1.5 million and weakness in European markets. OEM and emerging operating income was up $8.8 million with in line with the prior year excluding the impact of restructuring charges, as a result of favorable margin shift and product mix and lower operating expenses which resulted in 330 basis point improvement in operating margin versus 2014.","Turning to page 15 of the presentation you\u2019ll see an overview of our next generation FLIR ONE for both the iOS and Android operating systems. This new version has a different form factor from the first generation product and features 4 times the resolution. It also has a built in shutter which provides automated temperature measurement calibration. The FLIR ONE is on track for a mid-year launch and will be available through a number of retailers and online vendors.","Moving to the Maritime segment on slide 16, first quarter revenue was down 3% to $51 million. However on a constant currency basis the segment would have grown 9%. Over a half of Maritime revenues was transacted in foreign currencies and given the significantly stronger U.S. dollar in Q1 compared to the prior year; segment revenue was negatively impacted by approximately $6 million. This currency impact flow through to profitability with operating income falling 45% to 4.8 million excluding restructuring charges and operating margins decreasing to 9%. Slightly offsetting the profitability weakness was 13% growth in FLIR branded thermal camera revenue year-over-year.","During the first quarter the Maritime segment launched the new M400 thermal camera that features VGA thermal imaging 3X continuous optical zoom and HD color camera as well as the high intensity LED light all in the Gyro stabilized gimbal that can be controlled via multifunction display. Also introduced with the FLIR Ocean Scout anti-thermal imager that has the power to detect human sized target up to 600 yards away. The Raymarine business significantly expanded its line of fresh water efficient electronics with the introduction to several new models in its Dragonfly product line as well as the Wi-Fish platform that offers Wi-Fi streaming capability to Andriod and iOS mobile devices being an app. Raymarine also introduced the high performance eS Series of multifunction displays and three new sonar models bringing cutting edge professional level sonar performance to Raymarine multifunction displays.","As shown on slide 18, the security segment had year-over-year revenue growth of 32% to $38.8 million. Growth was in across all product lines and regions with particular strength in thermal products which grew 58% over the last year and had 82% growth in unit volumes. The FLIR branded visible line of product grew well, as new product introductions including a suite of IP network camera in the MPX HD Over Coax technology gained significant traction in the market. Security operating profit was $3.8 million and a margin improvement of 400 basis points to 10% due to a higher percentage of higher margin thermal sales as well as controlled operating expenses. ","Last week, we began shipping the FLIR FX the most versatile and technologically enabled Wi-Fi home monitoring camera available. The FX features motion detection analytics, built in battery for mobile use and on board image and video storage and several optional housings which enable outdoor, dashcams productivity applications. The camera also features the ability to uniquely summarize a day\u2019s worth of motion events into a summary clip via rapid recap cloud based service. The product offers FLIR\u2019s first subscription service where consumer can upgrade the camera to extended cloud based storage, increase the number of rapid recaps they can create. ","Also introduced last week was the FLIR TCX, the lowest price thermal security camera on the market that is enabled by our Lepton camera core. In addition security segment has released a full line-up of 2 megapixel and 3 megapixel FLIR professional grade security cameras that further expand the segment\u2019s visible camera offers.","On Slide 20, you will see detection segment first quarter revenue of 18.2 million, increased 25% versus the prior year largely due to strong growth in the explosives and radiation product lines. Detection backlog increased significantly to $97 million as another full rate production order for the DR SKO Program was received. This one for $51 million which follows the $27 million order we received at the end of 2014. Improved gross margins and explosives and on the DR SKO program coupled with an 18% reduction in operating cost drove detection operating profit ability to $2.7 million, which was significantly improved over the prior year where there is an operating loss of $1.2 million excluding restructuring charges.","That concludes my summary of the segment\u2019s first quarter. I\u2019ll now pass the call back to Andy.","Andy Teich","Thanks Tom. Our first quarter of 2015 executed largely within our expectations albeit with some headwinds on the FX front. We continue to execute against our key strategic initiatives to include continuing to develop innovative new products across our various segments and price performance points. Our Lepton technology again allowed us to introduce ground breaking new products at the entry level which will both build overall awareness and expand existing markets. We\u2019re confident that our CDMQ approach continues to deliver unique value proposition for our traditional government and military oriented customers in an environment where overall funding continues to be constrained.","Operationally, we saw meaningful improvement in our emergence coming from the realignment and restructuring actions that were taken last year. We plan to continue to invest in our marketing organization to further strengthen our brand and increase overall awareness of the benefits of our technology in a wide range of applications. We expect to see these actions to create a strong platform for growth as we move forward. As many of you know our former CFO Tony Trunzo\u00a0resigned during the quarter to pursue another career opportunity. We are actively engaged in the search for a new CFO and look forward to filling that role later this year.","I would also like to remind our shareholders and the analysts that we\u2019ll be hosting an Analyst Day and Investor Day on May 21st in New York. At this event, we will be providing you with an update on our vision and strategies for growth and we\u2019ll provide an opportunity for a closer look at our various products and technologies.","That concludes our comments on the first quarter. We\u2019ll now open up the call for questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now conduct our telephone question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please state your question.","Pete Skibitski","Excluding FX organic revenue growth of 3% and it is probably your best first quarter since around 2011, I believe. You reiterated guidance, so it looks like revenue is going to accelerate for you the rest of the year. So I just want to ask you, how do you feel new product acceptance is going? How your end markets kind of acting the way you expected coming into the year?","Andy Teich","Yes I would say that they are executing well and in line with our expectations and particularly on the new product front. We did launch several new products during Q1 and specifically those that were introduced in the instrument space and in the maritime space. Both got good traction and in some cases beyond our expectations. We saw particularly good reaction to the C2 product line and also to both the new sonar products and the new lower end entry level point fishing and GPS products that were launched in the Raymarine line during the quarter.","Pete Skibitski","And then just I want to ask about U.S. Government revenue it was down pretty substantially again around 25%. Is that your expectation for the full year or is that timing? And can you maybe comment about Europe, maybe differentiated between government and commercial in Europe?","Andy Teich","So the U.S. government revenue for the quarter, I think it was 15 % actually and that a little water more for us relative to prior periods. It\u2019s a bit hard to predict at this point how U.S. government spending is going to go. I would expect that it probably wouldn\u2019t go much lower than that at this point but we really have to see how the first half plays out to understand what the full year is going to look like on that front. European business for us was about flat I think for the quarter, in the surveillance segment. And at this point I think that we\u2019re going to see the majority of our growth probably coming from other international regions, to include the Middle East region as we execute the rest of the year. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please take your question. ","Peter Arment","Andy, the question I guess -- can you quantify the defense business in terms of the OEM emerging. I think it was mentioned that there was lower course, that there is a -- can you, Andy help, I mean how bigger percentage that is within OEM?","Andy Teich","I don\u2019t have a specific percentages, I think we can get back to you on it, but particularly on the un-cooled side of that business we saw weaker demand during the quarter. From the revenue standpoint, deliveries of our higher end systems were still on track with plan during the quarter. ","Peter Arment","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And just if I could sneak one more in just, on the inventory, I didn\u2019t catch for the specific reason why it was up, but if we just look back over the last year, your inventory return showed some improvement but this time it goes back to around two turns. Is there -- its conceptually or we\u2019re going to -- is there anything that is going on and we just need volume to get the inventory returns back up? ","Andy Teich","Well, actually we mentioned in surveillance there is some slip of some customer orders that we expected to capture in the quarter; that due to various reasons slid into this quarter. So, there was some inventory ready to ship for those orders that now we will be shipping in this quarter. We also have a facility move that\u2019s occurring later in the year and we had some build up of inventory to make sure we had adequate protection during that move. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Quillin with Stephens. Please take your question.","Tim Quillin","Maybe just qualitatively, if not quantitatively on the OEM and emerging segment, can you talk about how much of that business you consider growth oriented and how much maybe is not as growth in your mind, and how overall you think about the growth of that segment both this year and in the future? ","Andy Teich","Tim, we certainly look at that segment as having both the stable element and growth element. So, combined in the OEM segment is our emerging business segment, which includes the mobile business and also our traffic segment. And we view both of those businesses as growth businesses and then we also look at our Lepton core business as a growth business within that segment. When you look at the other piece of the business relative to un-cooled cores and cooled cores that are oriented towards government and military customers. That business tends to be a bit more lumpy, a little bit harder to forecast. So, that\u2019s one that we\u2019ll have to watch how its demand fluctuates based on what our end customers demand look like. The third components of the business of course are traditionally un-cooled camera cores that are sold into more industrial type applications. These are people that are actives in adjacent market spaces with us in security and maritime, and we still view those as growth oriented businesses. ","Tim Quillin","Okay. Thank you. And can you just remind us or bring us up to date on the number of new Lepton based products, you have introduced so far and I will paraphrase this by saying that I know this is a unfair, but Lepton was introduced 16 months ago, and it's a pretty exciting differentiated core and the pace has seen relatively measured in terms of the Lepton based products. And I am just wondering if there is a gating factor in terms of how many products you can introduce or how you will evaluate opportunities to bring Lepton based products to market? ","Andy Teich","Well, I\u2019ll start with the first question in terms of how many products that we have introduced and not including the cores themselves as we do have multiple variance of core technology using the Lepton sensor. But in terms of the end product development that we\u2019ve done at this point, there\u2019ve been six products that had been launched since January of 2014, when we initially launched the first product which was the FLIR ONE. I think what\u2019s important to note, there are two things. Number one is that there are a number of different new markets and platform configurations that we can address using Lepton technology. And then the second thing is that step number one in terms of developing new products around Lepton is developing a platform to support. ","So in the case of our instrument segment for example we\u2019ve developed a platform that today there are two products out in the market that utilize that same core architecture. So once you have that platform core architecture developed, it\u2019s the time to market developed variant products based on that is reduced. We\u2019re very excited about the technology. I would say, particularly if you look at the products were launched just recently during the most recent quarter, the C2 and TCX security camera, we\u2019re very excited about not only the unique form factor that those products have, but also the imaging performance and the overall value proposition that those offer into the target applications is quite unique. So I think it offers a very nice opportunity for incremental growth in those segments. Tom you want to add anything else to that.","Tom Surran","Well there\u2019s a constraint, of course in terms of the number of products we can introduce. We actually have a fairly long list of product definitions and products we\u2019d like to introduce with the Lepton, but we also have to balance this with making sure we maintain our position at the high end of the market and with the constraint of research dollars we have some exciting new high end products that obviously those are programs we want to make sure get completed. But we do have a number of things we\u2019ll be bringing to the market in the future that will include Lepton.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Ricchiuti with Needham & Company. Please state your question.","Jim Ricchiuti","I was wondering -- I know you\u2019ve touched on gross margins; you touched on in the presentation. But can you talk a little bit more about how we might think about gross margins over the balance of the year, just given what you see as the mix of business?","Shane Harrison","Hey Jim its Shane. Margins in Q1 were a little high, little helped by the FX -- the FX situation. I think going forward for the rest of the year looking at \u201914 is probably very good metric to use. We don\u2019t think that FX help let\u2019s call it, it's going to continue at that pace given that the rates kind of come down in the mid-year as far as year-over-year comparisons. The help that we had this quarter too is -- we had a big help on absorption in the inner [indiscernible]. The detection products and the DR SKO products that\u2019s in detection both had a very good quarter; that should continue, but still kind of an under scaled part of the business. And thermal in the security business had a very good quarter as a percentage of that business and that helped that margin quite a bit. It\u2019s not expected to have such a high percentage of thermal throughout the rest of the year.","Jim Ricchiuti","And just as it relates to the DR SKO order and the way that plays out in the second half and into early 2016, can you give us just some sense as to how much of that we might see you might be shipping against in Q4?","Andy Teich","So the first order that we received in 2014 we will be completing here in the second quarter. The new order that was received this quarter we will be shipping from this point over the next 12 months. Relatively linearly we have currently a little bit of Q3, a little bit of a connection or drop between the two programs. We are working with our customer to try to increase that linearity over that 12 month period. But it\u2019s a preliminary schedule. But that\u2019s basically what it looks like. So from this point, next 12 months, that second order will be executed and in this quarter we will be completing the order from 2014.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jonathan Ho with William Blair. Please state your question.","Jonathan Ho","Just wanted to start out with the Cadillac opportunity, and maybe understand sort of the timing that you guys will start to see the benefit, and just to clarify is the 2016 model year or you're talking about 2016 as a calendar year opportunity?","Andy Teich","It\u2019s a model year opportunity. We\u2019ll start shipping product into that platform in the later part of 2015.","Jonathan Ho","Got it, and then can you talk about maybe what the magnitude of opportunity would look like?","Andy Teich","We don\u2019t typically talk about effects of single products on the overall top line of business. It\u2019s not going to be huge. I think the bigger opportunity there is to look at what the adoption is at the brand level and look for further expansion across multiple model lines within the brand there. This first product with their offering, it\u2019s quite an exciting product, but it\u2019s not going to be earth shattering from a volume stand point.","Jonathan Ho","Got it, and then if we look at sort of the 3% growth target that you\u2019ve given and some of the currency headwinds added there, can you talk about what are the levers that give you sort of the big confidence that growth is going to accelerate from here and maybe your expectations around currency just given that it seems to still be fairly unpredictable at this point? Maybe what are your assumptions on that side?","Andy Teich","Okay. So I\u2019ll start with the later. At this point we\u2019re not factoring in further movement in currency rates. We're assuming that they\u2019ll remain relatively stable to where they are today. In terms of levers for growth within the business, it really comes down to two different things. One is the continued introduction of new products both in existing markets and the new markets, and we have seen the majority of the growth of coming in the business coming from either the introduction of new products or the introduction of new products that address new market segments. The second area is, and Travis -- I\u2019m sure will talk about it later in the call here; our continued efforts that we are doing both in the marketing area and brand building area. The overall exposure of the company from a product and brand stand point has gone up exponentially versus a year ago. And ultimately we expected that share gain in terms of awareness will manifest itself in product sales over the course of the rest of the year.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jeffrey Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please say your question.","Jeffrey Kessler","It appears that a good part of the margin gain that you had comes from two sources. Number one, obviously corporate control, cost control and efficiencies of the corporate level, but also the product mix. Not just new products but the way you were able to get better margin out of the mix of the new products. Could you talk a little bit about how that kind of broke down in getting the higher margins you did between corporate and getting better efficiencies and margins out of the new products you\u2019ve been generating?","Andy Teich","I\u2019ll actually just cover the corporate piece first and then Tom can talk a little bit about the specific product mix piece. The biggest driver in corporate expense year-over-year for us is legal expense. And as we've mentioned in the prepared comments we have significantly less legal spending in the current year versus last year. So that\u2019s the primary driver in terms of corporate expense reduction. The second issue relative to product mix, obviously one of the biggest drivers there is the thermal content within the various product lines as a significant contributor. But even within the thermal product lines particularly in the surveillance business, the type of product that we\u2019re shipping there drives what the overall margin looks like. Tom you want to add some commentary?","Tom Surran","Absolutely, that on the mix is that be also the type of thermal imager and particularly our OEM market. We had larger cooled sales which are typically higher margin. But that business as Andy mentioned earlier is a bit lumpy. I don\u2019t want to underplay though that we had improved product margins during the quarter and so yes there were certainly restructuring activity. Yes, we have some favorable swings as the thermal and even the cool thermal helped. But we also had improved product margins during the quarter.","Jeffrey Kessler","Okay. The second question actually relates to something that I mentioned before. The recent IFC show, a big change in FLIR\u2019s position in the business was that people began to actually notice that FLIR was not just a niche thermal company and it was basically more full line product company and security with both obviously cores and with product and also with thermal sensors that began to enable visible light product. I\u2019m just wondering what you have done to kind of build up the brand and increase brand visibility in your marketing in those areas where they were small niches before, but now they are obviously the growing parts of your business. ","Travis Merrill","Hi, Jeff. This is Travis. I\u2019ll take that one. As it relates to the security business specifically we\u2019ve obviously got sort of a multiple brand portfolio there with those the FLIR brands on high end, industrial critical infrastructure, obviously strongly associated with thermal technology; and then on the consumer side we\u2019ve got the lower FX brand. And I\u2019ll tackle the second one first which is we\u2019ve continue to expand our distribution and channel reach and with that obviously has come a lot of exposure and to really connect those two brands we\u2019ve taken some stuff and you may have seen some of this at the IFC show but to connect those brands a little bit more and just have greater association between the two. I think the FLIR FX which Tom referenced in his prepared comments is also a good example of that about picking up FLIR brand which is traditionally associated with thermal technology, associated more with commercial and industrial type years and bringing it also into the consumer space with a very clear value proposition and very clear and strong differentiation. ","Jeffrey Kessler","Okay. And as -- and what was clear from the show was that the FX was part of this search of new -- you want to call it search of new connected products for both consumers and for the home. And that is the revenues from that product begin to show up in which quarter -- are we seeing that, did you already begin to see a little bit of that in the past quarter or is it just coming in the third and fourth quarter. ","Andy Teich","We began shipping that product in the current quarter for the FX specifically. ","Travis Merrill","So, we\u2019re at the minimal sales of the FX in the prior quarter but nothing into the channel. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Nova Oponick with Goldman Sachs. Please give your question.","Gavin Parsons","Hi, this is Gavin Parsons on for Nova, good morning everyone. Going back to Lepton FLIR one specifically, the price points come down a lot since it was introduced and discount and which is actually this morning kind of order in the $200 range. Are you seeing higher demands or better response for lower price points and if that has any implication on margins. ","Travis Merrill","Hi Gavin, this is Travis again. The first generation FLIR one which we obviously introduced past year and began shipping in the third quarter of last year has continued to see some growth particularly in the [indiscernible] regions and we\u2019ve got a little more aggressive as you pointed out in the promotion of that as we prepare for the introduction of the second generation FLIR one which as Tom mentioned in his comment, will be introduced around midyear, this year. So, overall [indiscernible] continues to be showered, we don\u2019t plan to discontinue the first generation model as it really brings with a unique form factor and a slightly different value proposition from the next generation FLIR one and we\u2019re still pleased with the sell through that we\u2019re seeing on that. ","Gavin Parsons","Great, thanks. And on the M&A, you mentioned the impact of the strong dollar on the large cash balance you have overseas. Are you looking at doing a deal internationally or do you think about the borrowing to do it in the U.S. or does that change the timing that you are looking that at all. ","Andy Teich","I would say it\u2019s really dependent on the opportunities that we see in the pipeline. We have the capacity to do an international deal or a U.S. deal based either on existing cash reserves or borrowing capability, so I think it\u2019s much more driven by the opportunity itself and in terms of how it fits with the strategic growth that in other business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Michael Ciarmoli","Andy low buyback activity in the quarter I mean I know you guys like to look at the relative value of the stock I mean it actually dip below 30 in the quarter. Was there any reason specifically for not being active?","Andy Teich","No again we look at the total opportunity set for the use of capital and making those decisions it\u2019s like it will be more active on that front going forward, but during the quarter we were just considering our cash balances relative to M&A opportunities that we saw on the horizon and the relative valuation of the stock at the time and made the decision not to do buybacks. But again I think we\u2019ll be more active on that front going forward.","Michael Ciarmoli","And then FX, what was the positive contribution to operating income in the quarter? I mean it sounded like certainly a headwind on the top-line but was there much of an impact on operating income?","Dave Muessle","Michael this is Dave. Overall for the company actually even though we had the headwind on the top-line, we actually on a consolidated basis saw a little bit of positive impact on operating income basis. Depending on which are the segments you look at there\u2019s a little bit of variation as to what each of the segments are obviously on the top-line instruments and maritime was most negatively impacted, but actually in the case of maritime that fell all the way down to the bottom line in some regards because a lot of their inventory cost from contract manufacturing is in USD so we don\u2019t get the benefit there. But in instruments with a lot of our production in Estonia and Sweden we actually see the benefit on a cost sales and operating expenses on that business, so we actually saw a positive impact to the bottom line in the instruments group. As far as the other segments it\u2019s pretty neutral. Just don\u2019t have the impact that we see on the instruments in maritime business.","Michael Ciarmoli","So it was a slight positive than overall across all segment and just thought the corporate level are slight positive to operating income?","Dave Muessle","That\u2019s correct.","Michael Ciarmoli","And then just the last one. Andy I guess you had 11% organic growth last quarter certainly the backlog I guess up 8% assuming constant currency that would seem like 13%. A lower single-digit organic growth number this year I guess we had certainly you gave some examples of the BRITE Star order and some of the OEM but it would seem like mid-single-digit organic growth I mean is that the right way to think about this sort of in constant currency for the remainder of the year?","Andy Teich","It is that\u2019s really what our expectation is. I think the Q1 can from a seasonality standpoint typically is a lower growth quarter for us. Also we saw particularly slow activity in the Middle-East region largely driven by low oil prices during the quarter, but we expect those conditions to improve as the year goes on.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Please state your question.","Pete Skibitski","Couple of follow ups. Andy on the M&A, how full is the pipeline?","Andy Teich","We have a number of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at. I can\u2019t really give you a direction quantification. The bigger issue here is looking at overall fit and valuation and as you know at this point the valuations that are out there are running pretty high at this point, so really drives us back to that first point that we really want to make sure that we\u2019ve got a very good fit strategically and a very solid integration plan that we can get the value that we want to see ahead of acquisitions.","Pete Skibitski","Understood. And then I just want to follow up on cash flow. I know the free cash conversion was good this quarter, but I think expectations were really high because of that large receivable or receivable growth you guys had in the second half of last year. I think it involved maybe an international customer. So I\u2019m wondering, did you guys collect on all the big receivable from last year or is there still something outstanding? I\u2019m trying to get to whether or not working capital is going to be a source of cash for you guys this year.","Andy Teich","No we did not collect on all the receivables that are out there, so we still expect to have meaningful cash accretion during the second quarter.","Pete Skibitski","Okay. Most of them come into second quarter in particular. Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne, Agee. Please state your question.","Peter Arment","Just a follow up on Pete\u2019s question on M&A. I\u2019m just trying to get an idea of kind of directionally. I mean if you look at the last couple deals you did, DigitalOptics certainly it was a great deal for you regarding Lepton and traffic kind of marks kind of got you into those expanding your channels. How are you thinking about just M&A from a category because you are carrying a lot of cash on your balance sheet, so are these large transactions that you are looking at, can you give us a little color further?","Andy Teich","The pipeline has a broad spectrum of deals in it both from valuation and in terms of the contribution to the business from a strategic stand point. We\u2019ve done a fair amount of M&A activity historically to build out a vertical integration capability to business. So you\u2019ll probably see less activity in that area. But we still have significant opportunity in terms of expanding distribution of the markets that we\u2019re pursuing, we\u2019re also taking look some adjacent technologies as well that could fit well together with the core technologies of thermal imaging and some of the other sensing technologies that we have within the business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Quillin with Stephens Incorporated. Please state your question.","Tim Quillin","Thank you for taking my follow up. I just had a couple details and then I fill a question I guess. But on stock comp and depreciation they are both down barely significantly year-over-year. So if you could just update us on expectation for stock comp depreciation and amortization in CapEx if you would and then the philosophical question I guess is in terms of the automotive markets where the night vision systems are still going into these very high end automobiles safety vision is actually proliferating across a lot of models right now and I\u2019m wondering why infrared can\u2019t play a broader role and safety vision like collision of avoidance et cetera. Thank you.","Andy Teich","I\u2019ll answer the - our finance folks are getting you answer the first question. I\u2019ll answer the second question. There are two issues here Tim, relative to the adoption of thermal in the automotive space and those two issues are present in many of the other market that we operate in as well and that\u2019s price and awareness. I\u2019m sure simple concepts. We still haven\u2019t in the end user price of thermal imaging option come down meaningfully and I think the thing it\u2019s going to bring that down is really going to be having the feature deployed across more models and starting to see that be more of competitive points between different models. We\u2019ve reduced our cost fairly significantly in that area and as a result our price source suppliers. But the end manufactures have held the prices relatively constant for the feature.","The second thing is relative to awareness I think your first point about the fact that the presence of cameras and a variety of different roles in vehicles increasing is a positive thing relative to use of thermal imaging or long-term. Just the fact that people see more cameras and cars performing roles of collision avoidance or navigation or line departure warning things like that, what will happen as the conversions of consumers wanting cameras in their cars comes together with the value proposition to thermal brands to differentiated value proposition that it brings on many different fronts on those applications will ultimately drive adoption into that market. The other thing is at this point we haven\u2019t seen adoption of Lepton class product into the automotive space. But we\u2019ve seen an opportunity there as well that many of these applications can be satisfied with a lower resolution sensor that the vehicle driver actually never sees the data. But the data is being used in conjunction with the visible sensor to provide meaningful decision making capability.","Dave Muessle","Tim, this is Dave. A little bit on the question related to kind of the run rate on some of the items stock comp we did see a little bit of normally in the current quarter related is stepping changes and so forth. I would not expect to see that level that same pattern I think were maybe really back to historical levels on stock comps so I would not take that as a run-rate indicator. For depreciation there\u2019s probably a few things going on there. Number one would be FX because we do have facilities and operations internationally and then we got some benefit there. We also have some intangibles that are running their expiry date as far as some of our acquisitions in the past, so you\u2019ll see some of that start dropping off so that\u2019s impacting that. And then from a CapEx standpoint we do have a little bit of ramp right now for probably this quarter as well related to the building that were going down and our OEM business. So that\u2019s what I would expect there as far as run-rate and so forth.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question today comes from Jeff Kessler with Imperial Capital. Please state your question.","Jeff Kessler","Following three question to follow up to what you said about adjacencies what you\u2019re looking at in the pipeline [indiscernible] involve technologies such as analytics and the other types of things that can empower video and particularly whether it has not in the past but increasingly in the future empowering infrared and thermal base video?","Andy Teich","Well Jeff this is certainly an area of interest for us and we have in the past made acquisitions in that space. We made the Traficon acquisition a couple of years ago which gave us a platform for video analytics. And it\u2019s a key point for us is that since it\u2019s a really enabled the differentiating capabilities that thermal imaging has in the security space you really need video analytics so we have been leveraging those development capabilities and they will manifest themselves in product launches that will occur later this year, but it\u2019s also an area where we can continue to expand and we\u2019ll likely have some focus on the M&A world.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019re actually going to take one last question and that comes from Michael Ciarmoli with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Michael Ciarmoli","Just Andy can you talk about some of the trends maybe that you saw in the APAC region in the quarter maybe in some of your building markets and security markets over there?","Andy Teich","Don\u2019t have any specific trends to note in the APAC market. Yes fundamentally it was fairly flat market over there. We have traditionally seen pretty good growth in the China market and that was subdued a little bit. We tend to launch the new products in our product pipeline slightly later in the APAC region and we just recently had a meeting over there where we were launching several new products that were launched in the other markets earlier in the quarter, so I would expect to see some response from that as we execute the second quarter.","Pete Skibitski","Good. Well I\u2019d like to thank you all for joining us on the call today. I also want to specifically recognize the continued hard work and dedication of the nearly 3,000 FLIR employees around the world. We look forward to providing further updates on the business on our upcoming Investor Day Meeting that I mentioned at the beginning of the call and then also at our conference call that will be scheduled after our Q2 earnings release. Thank you everyone.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference. All parties may disconnect. Thank for your participation."]}}
