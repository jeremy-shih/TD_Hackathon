[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Edmund Kroll, Senior Vice President, Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Edmund E. Kroll","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining Centene's Third Quarter Earnings Call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman and CEO; and Bill Scheffel, Executive Vice President and CFO of Centene Corporation, will host this morning's call.","The call is expected to last approximately 45 minutes, and may also be accessed at our website, centene.com. A replay will be available shortly after the call's completion, also at centene.com or by dialing (877) 344-7529 in the U.S. and Canada, or in other countries by dialing (412) 317-0088. The playback number for both of those calls is 10033731.","Any remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for the purposes of the Safe Harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recently filed Form 10-Q dated today, October 22, 2013, and also other public SEC filings. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. As a reminder, our next Investor Day is Friday, December 13 in New York City. Please mark your calendars.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael F. Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's third quarter earnings call. During the course of today's call, we will discuss our solid third quarter results, including continued progress towards our margin expansion objectives, future growth opportunities and state updates including recent RFP wins. I will begin by discussing highlights of our third quarter results.","We are pleased with our third quarter results. We continue to produce strong revenue growth and, once again, showed sequential improvement in our pretax margin. This increased by 50 basis points in the third quarter to 2.95%. The improvement was due to a better HBR. Solid expense control at the G&A line was partially offset by higher performance-based compensation and start-up costs in new markets. Margin improvement is a strategic priority for Centene, and our long-term goal continues to be 3% to 5% on a sustainable basis.","Membership increased 4% year-over-year to 2.6 million covered lives. Premium and Service revenues grew 24% year-over-year to $2.7 billion. The faster Premium growth relative to membership growth was driven by the continued shift in mix towards higher acuity beneficiaries. For example, long-term care membership increased almost 300% to 31,600 lives. Additionally, our average revenue PMPM has increased 16% year-over-year. The increase in high acuity membership is consistent with Centene's strategic priority to diversify its product lines to maximize cost savings for our state customers. The long-term care growth should continue over the next several quarters as our new Florida contract ramps up.","The HBR improved 560 basis points year-over-year, and 110 basis points sequentially to 87.7%. The HBR for our existing business improved 210 basis points sequentially to 86.3%. As a reminder, changes in the mix of new and existing businesses can cause variability in the consolidated HBR. Bill will provide additional detail on this topic. During the third quarter, we continued to experience a modest reduction in medical trend across our existing business.","I would now like to discuss Q2 growth opportunities. Our targeted pipeline remains extremely robust at $130 billion through 2016. We expect to continue our recognized success in winning new business. We will diversify by geography and product line with the goal of driving profitable growth. We already have visibility on 2014 revenue growth in excess of 20%, excluding exchanges. This compares to our previous estimate of 15%. We will provide full details at our December Investor Day.","I will now cover state contracts and rate updates. Florida. Our new and expanded Florida long-term care contracts started on schedule on August 1. This program is proceeding as planned with enrollment to be phased in by region through March of 2014. We added an additional 7,000 lives during the third quarter due to the expansion. In September, our Sunshine Health subsidiary was awarded a new and expanded contract for 9 of the 11 regions under Managed Medical Assistance program. Enrollment is expected to begin in the second quarter of 2014 to October 2014. The contract is subject to challenges and contract readiness reviews. Therefore, it is premature to comment on membership and revenues. Sunshine Health was the only plan awarded a Foster Care contract statewide for the Child Welfare Specialty Plan. The current Foster Care population in this state is approximately 30,000 children.","Ohio. Our Ohio subsidiary began operating under a new and expanded statewide contract in July. Our enrollment increased 9% sequentially in the third quarter. We previously noted that the ramp-up of additional lives had been slower than expected. We continue to work closely with the state on this matter. The enrollment ramp should continue into 2014.","Massachusetts. Last month, CelticCare Health Plan was awarded a contract to participate in the MassHealth CarePlus program in all 5 regions. This is a significant win for Centene as it provides an entry point into the Commonwealth Medicaid program. This contract is expected to begin in -- on January 1, 2014.","California. Earlier this year, our California Health & Wellness subsidiary won 2 Medi-Cal contracts in California. Under the first contract, we will serve members in the state's Medi-Cal Managed Rural Expansion program in 18 counties. Under the second contract, Centene will begin serving Medi-Cal beneficiaries in Imperial County. With the benefit of being the only county-selected plan, enrollment is expected to commence on November 1 of this year for both contracts.","New Hampshire. We expect to begin serving TANF and ABD beneficiaries on December 1.","Texas. In September, we were awarded a contract to serve an additional STAR+PLUS recipient -- recipients in 2 rural service areas. Enrollment is expected to begin during the second half of 2014.","Dual eligibles. The demonstration projects in Ohio and Illinois are expected to commence in 2014. We continue to work constructively with both states and CMS on rates and other contract terms.","Centurion. In July 2013, our joint venture subsidiary, Centurion, began operations under a new correctional contract in Massachusetts. This contract provides comprehensive health care services to 11,000 individuals incarcerated in the state's correctional facilities. In September of 2013, Centurion began its second state correctional contract in Tennessee covering 20,000 prisoners. And last week, Centurion executed an agreement for a third state correctional contract in Minnesota, covering 9,000 offenders. This latest award is expected to begin in the first quarter of 2014.","Next, a quick comment on the rate outlook. We continue to expect a composite rate increase of approximately 2% for 2013. In Texas, we received a net rate increase of 4.2% which includes risk adjustment. This rate increase was effective September 1. Georgia and Florida are in the process of finalizing rate updates that will be retroactive to July 1 and September 1, respectively. All these rates are exclusive of the ACA industry tax, which is being negotiated separately.","Switching gears, let me make a brief comment on the ACA opportunity. The ACA is an important opportunity for Centene, but only one part of our overall growth pipeline. We have taken a selective approach to our participation in health insurance marketplace. We have launched our Ambetter brand on a limited basis in 9 of our current states. The legacy book of individual policies at Celtic is in runoff mode. We have repositioned Celtic to support our exchange growth strategy. We have scalable infrastructure and the overall bandwidth to effectively manage the Medicaid expansion in our participating states.","Now a brief comment on Kentucky. As you know, we exited Kentucky July 5. We are winding down operations, which will be substantially completed by the end of this year. We cannot comment regarding the ongoing litigation with the Commonwealth on this call.","In closing, our view of 2013 and 2014 remains positive and upbeat. As Bill will discuss in more detail, we are raising our 2013 guidance to a range of $2.77 to $2.87. Thank you for your support and interest in Centene. We look forward to seeing you at our next Investor Day on December 13 in New York City. I will now turn the call over to Bill.","William N. Scheffel","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. To begin my comments this morning, I would like to reference you to the table on Page 3 in our press release, detailing the components of our third quarter earnings numbers, particularly for the third quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of Kentucky operations and certain gains recorded last year, our diluted earnings per share was $0.88 in Q3 this year, compared to $0.81 in last year's third quarter. I think this provides a good comparison of our ongoing operation between years, although the improvement is much greater when considering that this year includes a normal level of performance-based compensation compared to no-performance-based compensation in last year's third quarter. We expect to classify the Kentucky operations as discontinued for reporting purposes at some point in the future. This could occur at December 31 or for the first quarter in 2014, depending on the level of remaining claims reserves at those dates.","For the third quarter, Kentucky is still included in all of our numbers as a normal operation. And as Michael indicated in his comments, we ceased operations in Kentucky as of July 5, and our ongoing wind-down efforts primarily consist of paying any remaining claims going forward.","For the third quarter of 2013, our Premium and Service revenues were over $2.7 billion compared to $2.2 billion last year, an increase of 24% year-over-year. The $500 million increase results primarily from the start-up of the Kansas contract on January 1; the impact from the membership expansion in Mississippi last December 1; the increases in membership and rates in Texas between years; and the Acaria acquisition on April 1, offset by the elimination of the Kentucky revenue after July 5. Premium taxes were at a more normal level this year at $70 million for the third quarter. Last year's amount of $236 million was impacted by a separate payment to us from one state of $180 million, which we immediately passed through to providers.","Our Consolidated Health Benefits ratio declined to 87.7% this quarter compared to 93.3% last year and 88.8% in the second quarter of 2013. As we indicated last year, our consolidated HBR without Kentucky in the third quarter of 2012 was 88.7%. The improvement in our HBR without Kentucky year-over-year and sequentially is primarily a result of rate increases in Texas, as well as a continued level of moderate utilization resulting from a combination of our medical management efforts and overall low trend levels.","For the third quarter, the portion of our Premium and Service revenue derived from new business has declined to 14% this year compared to 32% last year. The HBR for our new business has decreased to 96.5% compared to 106.5% last year. The HBR for existing business has improved year-over-year by 70 basis points from 87% to 86.3%, favorably reflecting the absorption of the significant increases in new revenue generated in 2012.","Our General and Administrative expense ratio was 9.3% in Q3 of this year, compared to 8.2% in the same period last year, and 8.7% in Q2 this year. The increases in the G&A ratio reflect the additional performance-based compensation recorded this year and an increased level of business expansion costs. Our business expansion costs were $0.12 in Q3 this year. This compares to $0.07 in Q3 last year and $0.17 in the second quarter of this year, although Q2 included $0.07 per share for the Acaria transaction costs. Our third quarter business expansion costs included Centurion's start-up in Massachusetts and Tennessee during the third quarter, costs in Florida related to the long-term care expansion, preparation for the start-ups in California and New Hampshire later this year and the exchanges beginning January 1, plus our normal RFP and business development costs.","Investment income was $4.9 million in Q3 this year compared to $23.2 million last year. The third quarter of 2012 included $19.4 million of gains from the sale of certain investments which we discussed last year. Excluding these gains, our investment income increased due to a higher level of invested assets. Interest expense was $6.6 million in the third quarter this year, compared to $4.9 million last year. The increase between years reflect the cost of the additional $175 million in senior notes issued in the fourth quarter last year.","Our income tax rate for the third quarter this year was 39.1%, excluding the effects of noncontrolling interest. During the third quarter of last year, we recorded an overall income tax benefit of $9.5 million comprised of the benefit from a pretax loss for that quarter and a benefit of $4.6 million from certain state tax items.","Our GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.87 compared to $0.07 for last year. As I previously indicated, the third quarter EPS numbers adjusted for Kentucky and the 2012 gains are $0.88 for 2013 versus $0.81 for 2012. September 30, we had cash, investments and restricted deposits of $1.7 billion, including $38 million held by unregulated entities. We continue to maintain our risk-based capital in our regulated subsidiaries in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Our debt at September 30 totaled $521 million and there were no borrowings drawn under our revolving credit agreement. Our debt-to-capital ratio, excluding the $73 million nonrecourse mortgage note, was 27.4%, a decline from 29.8% at June 30. Our medical claims liability totaled $1.1 billion at September 30 and represents 42.9 days in claims payable. Cash flow from operations was $131 million for the third quarter, which is 2.7x net earnings for the quarter.","Our 2013 updated guidance is Premium and Service revenues, $10.6 billion to $10.8 billion; diluted earnings per share, $2.77 to $2.87; Consolidated Health Benefits ratio, 88.5% to 89%; General and Administrative expense ratio, 8.8% to 9.2%; and diluted shares outstanding of 56 million to 56.5 million shares. Our guidance assumptions include the start-up of operations for California on November 1 and New Hampshire on December 1. Business expansion costs are expected to be $0.60 to $0.65 for all of 2013.","Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Josh Raskin of Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So a question about 2014. You guys said you had visibility into 20% revenue growth or Premium and Service growth for 2014 and then excluded -- it sounded like that excluded exchanges. Does that also exclude the Medicaid expansion?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And you -- is it fair to assume -- I mean, I don't know what your assumptions are on Ohio, but is it fair to assume, we have with Ohio, it's still only about $250 million in revenues; without Ohio, maybe $100 million. Would you expect the impact from the ACA, the Medicaid expansion to be pretty modest?","Michael F. Neidorff","Bill, you want to...","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think, at this point in time, we don't know enrollment numbers for exchanges. And for Medicaid expansion, we're looking at a couple of states, particularly I think, Washington, Massachusetts and Ohio has just recently talked about that yesterday. So I think the 20% -- in excess of 20% revenue growth we talked about will further be updated on December 13 on our Investor Day. We may know more about exchanges at that point in time and can talk about that. Right now, our number excludes that.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Bill, is it fair to assume that the exchanges are a bigger impact in '14 than the expansions?","William N. Scheffel","I think that's -- we'll have to wait -- and that will be seen as we get a little farther along. I think both of them have potential for larger numbers, and we don't really have much visibility into the enrollment process yet for exchanges. So we'll have to see.","Michael F. Neidorff","There is no good proxy out there yet.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes. Yes, that's fair. The 3% pretax margin that you guys talked about, so I'm curious. Do you think that's an achievable number for '14? And maybe even if you just look at sort of existing business, business that will -- so if you take your 2013 book and roll it forward, would you assume that you can at least get to the 3% on your existing book? Or do you think you can even get there on the overall next year?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I mean, right now, we're at 2.95% for Q3. And I think it's possible we'd get there. It's going to be a function of new and existing mix.","William N. Scheffel","I think the expansion costs that we will incur in 2014, for example, Florida Medicaid, that expansion will need to be considered. So I don't know at this point in time, we have a pretax margin number for 2014 that we're ready to lock on to. We obviously will have that for this December 13 meeting. But certainly, that's our goal over time. Whether we will achieve that in 2014, we'll have to wait to discuss that later.","Michael F. Neidorff","I think what's important is we try to do a -- we want to try to show you that it's sustainable. As the HBR gets controlled, G&A, yes, we think it's very achievable. That the timing, we'll have better insight as we unfold the '14 budget.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got you. So just one quick question, follow-up on that and then I'll jump off though. Are you insinuating that the start-up costs, including Florida and all the others next year, will be greater than the $0.60 to $0.65? Were you insinuating that's sort of a headwind for next year?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, we haven't totaled everything up, but I would certainly think that our expansion, our growth continues, and with growth comes the expansion costs. So I would expect that each year that those numbers would continue to grow. I don't have a specific number yet for 2014, we'll give that in December. But certainly, one of the big numbers will be the Florida Medicaid expansion, which we'll primarily hit in 2014 versus 2013.","Operator","The next question will come from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you talk about the Premium tax? You talked about it being separate still from your rates and negotiating still with states. Are there any states that have agreed to compensate you for that? Or where do we stand on that at this point?","Michael F. Neidorff","There are a lot of discussions taking place. Florida has indicated they have a budget line to cover us. Texas is talking about various mechanisms that they're going to use. Sounds like maybe a retro look, and then an adjustment, and we're talking to the accounting firms about it. They do that, blends revenue recognized. So there's still a lot of moving parts. And that's one of those -- we're at that tenuous, not tenuous, but at that point in time when we are close to the annual budget numbers and be able to give you some guidance for '14. But I'd like to wait and be just a little more specific. With the passage of time to December 13, I think we should have more visibility.","William N. Scheffel","I think we are encouraged by the discussions that we are having with our state partners. And I think the actuaries that are involved in this process seem to all recognize the need to include in our rates an adjustment for this. And so, that is moving forward and with discussions with the variety of states, and we're encouraged by those discussions at this point.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Are you still talking about the adjustment being on a grossed up basis? Or is it just the premium tax itself?","Michael F. Neidorff","No, we're talking -- I mean, the actuaries, everybody recognizes a need for the gross up.","William N. Scheffel","The fee is nondeductible for tax purposes, so we have to achieve a similar amount at the revenue line to cover the after-tax costs.","Michael F. Neidorff","The states understand that.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you talk about your 20% growth in revenues that you talked about for next year? Are you including anything in that for growth in members in your state, your Medicaid contracts that you have existing today in terms of new people who may sign up that, perhaps, qualified before but have not actually signed up for Medicaid?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I mean, outreach is an ongoing effort, day in and day out in the various markets. So we, of course, always look to take advantage of that. And you lose some as well so there's a combination in that mix. But once again, we'll give you much more clarity. We probably spoke of the increase in long-term care, we talked about the new contract in Florida. Those things we have some visibility on, that we're comfortable talking about the 20% versus '15.","William N. Scheffel","And that number is primarily consisting of new awarded contracts or expansions that we're aware of. It doesn't include anything for the woodwork effect, for example, that people have talked about or anything like that.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you just tell us how much performance-based comp there was in the quarter?","William N. Scheffel","I think, they were probably around $0.20 of performance-based comp in this year's quarter.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sarah James of Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","You talked a little bit about the legacy Celtic contracts being in runoff as you switched to Ambetter. Could you talk to what retention might look like on the existing book? And if margins would look similar under the new formula compared to how you ran it at Celtic?","Michael F. Neidorff","Rone, would you like to comment on that?","K. Rone Baldwin","Yes, with respect to the legacy block, it's really not something that we view as strategic to the future. That's a block of business that was underwritten largely acquired through brokers, typically upper-income individuals. And as we've talked about in the past, our individual insurance and exchange strategy is to focus on lower-income-subsidized members that's an extension of where we traditionally operated on the Medicaid plans. So as a result to that, there's not a block that we've taken a lot of steps to enhance the product line in compliance with the changes contemplated by the Affordable Care Act for 2014, although we'll continue to offer a product in a number of states. So we don't expect -- we expect this block to continue to decline throughout 2014. And the nature of a runoff block like that is it typically doesn't throw off great margins. So it's going to be something that's not going to be a big contributor, one way or the other, with respect to the bottom line.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And now that pricing data has been released for the exchanges, how do you think about your competitive positioning for the Ambetter product?","K. Rone Baldwin","Look, I think a lot of people expected that, and you're seeing that a great deal of variability in the rates in 2014 on the exchanges. And the expectation isn't that the rates are going to compress more in future years. With respect to our position for 2014, it really varies quite a bit. In some states and counties we're very competitive; in other states and counties we're less competitive. I can tell you that we had a very consistent and disciplined approach to how we priced that we applied across all the different states and service areas that we're serving for 2014. So where we see ourselves from a position standpoint really reflects the specifics of the competitive environment in the states, as opposed to any difference in terms of how philosophy, how we apply it to our pricing.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And last question here is on the Centurion business. The win in Minnesota was very impressive as you dislodged an incumbent with a lower price point bid due to the advantages that you provide in vertical integration and medical management. So seeing that there clearly is an appetite for the type of product offering you have, can you talk about the scope of contracts that are coming up in the next 12 to 24 months? How many other opportunities are there in the near-term?","Michael F. Neidorff","Jason?","Jason M. Harrold","So Sarah, we continue to evaluate a number of different states that have potential RFPs that will be forthcoming in the subsequent months and years ahead and have a fairly robust pipeline. So we'll continue to evaluate those on a case-by-case basis, depending upon the market and the nature of the opportunity. But we do see a robust pipeline for partnership with MHM and this joint venture, Centurion, as we move forward.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","But no specific numbers of contracts that are coming up in the industry for a rebid over the next year?","Jason M. Harrold","No.","Michael F. Neidorff","No, I think that would be...","Jason M. Harrold","No.","Michael F. Neidorff","No.","Operator","Our next question will come from Justin Lake of JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, I just want to follow-up on the industry tax. Can you walk us through the mechanics of how you expect the state rate -- the states to get you this rate increase that would allow for the tax? Do you just expect it for -- to be one more or do you expect it to happen after that and there'll be some kind of retroactive adjustment process.","Michael F. Neidorff","It's going to vary state to state. Bill, you want to make a comment on what we've seen so far and...","William N. Scheffel","Sure. There are couple of different ways that it could be done and not all states will be the same. In some cases, it could be built into our rates starting January 1, and it will be included there. For the expense side of that, we expect it will be -- we will estimate it beginning January 1 and we will have an expense each month for this. The revenue that we'd have to offset that could be coming through a rate amendment that we get currently. It could come through a rate amendment that just says we'll get a onetime payment, maybe that would be in September. But it could -- as long as we have the rate amendment, we would be able to recognize the associated revenue with that, at the same time we're recording the expense. And some of this will be depending on these getting rate amendments with each of the states. So it will just vary as when the cash flow. We won't pay the money until the third quarter or a little later even, September to October range of next year. But we do expect the revenues from the states to come in either pro rata as part of a monthly premium or as a onetime payment.","Michael F. Neidorff","We also continue to work in Washington for a legislative alternative there. So there's a lot of various approaches being taken at this time.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And with those amendments or the rate increases, would they be publicly available in terms of state making an announcement so we'd know which states have decided to make these amendments and which haven't and when? Or do you get the...","William N. Scheffel","I don't know the answer to that question yet as to whether those will be public, or how those will be publicized. But we're having discussions with each of our states, at this point in time, in terms of the mechanics of how to achieve this. And each state has a different approach on how they are looking at responding to this. And we'll work this out over the next couple of quarters, I think.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And I think one of your peers had mentioned that they saw about -- they had indicated that about 25% of their states had, thus far, agreed to kind of pass through the rate. Is that -- do you have any number there in terms of what percentage of your premiums, for instance, or what percentage of states have given you that level of confidence?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think it will be a little premature to talk about it at this point. Let's see where we are in December 13.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and just last question on this. The -- can you tell us what you would estimate the grossed up number you need to get to be made whole on this industry tax? What number should we be looking for for you guys?","William N. Scheffel","Generally speaking, I think some of the rates that we've seen is that our tax would be roughly 1.4% of the premiums. So if you gross that up for federal and state taxes, and that's different state by state, you're probably in the 2.2% range as you need to get paid to get a 1.4% after tax number. And so those are kind of the numbers we're working with right now in our discussions with the states.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one other question on duals. Can you give us an update on what you're thinking there for 2014 and what's -- where you are in kind of your major states in terms of negotiations for rates on the dual side?","Michael F. Neidorff","Jesse, you want to comment on it?","Jesse N. Hunter","Sure. Justin, the -- Jesse Hunter. So very much a work in progress in both of our markets where we've been awarded the dual demo contracts in Ohio and Illinois. So there's a dual track, at least a dual track with respect to both the rates and the contract terms. So we're continuing to work down on -- down both paths, and there are some challenges that we continue to work through in the rate setting process. So we're working with the states and CMS, respectively, to work through those issues. And we'll talk more about the implications of that as it gets into our 2014 guidance in December.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Anything that you could share with us in terms of what the major 2 or 3 kind of hurdles are to getting these rates done, given they seem to be dragging out in terms of negotiations?","Jesse N. Hunter","Sure. I think at a high level, I can't give too many particulars here. But at a high level, on the Medicaid side, it's the same process that we would work through, if we have -- particularly, if you have a population that's moving from an unmanaged setting into a managed setting. So what are the variables with respect to things like managed care savings? What were the assumptions and where that's coming from? And making sure that we understand, both the actuarial and then our kind of relevant experience, how those translate into what we believe to be rate adequacy. And on the Medicare side, a lot of this comes down to the relative acuity of the dual population versus the traditional Medicare advantaged population. And so that's what we're working through as a consistent theme.","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna International Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I want to come back to the new MLR guidance for this year. Was there something obvious coming online in the second half now that you didn't expect back in July when you put out the old guidance? Or is there something on the medical cost side, more directly in Florida or some other state, that's pushing up the low end of the target for this year?","Michael F. Neidorff","I don't know that we see any changes. And Bill, do you want to....","William N. Scheffel","I think the basic issue that you have there is we have sort of looking at the whole year at this point in time, we've tightened the ranges for where we are on an overall basis. And so what we're providing now is what we think is where we're going to come in for the whole year. And it's -- instead of taking 100 basis points, I think we're down to 50 basis points in terms of range. And so that's something that, when you look at our year-to-date numbers, is something closer. We're at 88.9% year-to-date for 9 months. And so where we are really reflects the fact that you got 3 quarters of the year already behind you.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just with regard to Florida and Georgia, specifically. Can you give us some sense for what you're expecting in the fourth quarter, at least from an earnings contribution from those 2 catch-up for retroactive premium adjustments?","William N. Scheffel","Those discussions are in process right now. I mean, I think we're looking at an overall modest amount. And I think that I think they will be overly significant for us in terms of the consolidated numbers.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, we've commented that we see a 2% on the year. So...","William N. Scheffel","For overall. Composite.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, overall. So therefore with -- you can see where it's going to have a big dramatic impact. But -- and it's not -- we're in discussion whether -- and that's not something we talk about publicly towards results.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just clarifying question on the compensation spending. Is that $0.20 pretty stable quarter-to-quarter? Or does it vary from period-to-period?","William N. Scheffel","It's pretty stable as a proportion of revenues.","Operator","The next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just wanted to see if you have -- I know it's early, but do you have any comments at all about how the enrollment process is going on the public exchanges?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think we've seen nothing that different what you're hearing about. Rone, you're closest to it.","K. Rone Baldwin","Well, I think as Bill mentioned, it's premature to draw any conclusions about the enrollment volumes that we're seeing. We're in 9 states for 2014. 7 of those are on the federal facilitated marketplaces, and we're certainly being affected by the same issues that are pretty well publicized about challenges with consumers being able to get access and get through the shopping experience with respect to the federal exchanges. We're also on 2 state-based exchanges, Washington and Massachusetts. And they're -- it's pretty well publicized that Massachusetts is having better experience, and we're certainly seeing that reflected as well. So not clear when things are going to -- the fact that the Washington exchange is working well, I think, is -- gives some room that -- to think that the problems are not intractable, that we're seeing in some of the other areas. But again, it's premature to really draw any conclusions at this point.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I guess you mentioned that there's not a lot of precedence for something like this. So it's hard to tell. My assumption would be that enrollment would be back-end loaded towards the deadline in December. But is there a point in time where you look at it and say that if things are still not working at some point in the future, you start to get worried or more worried about that first selection? Or I mean, how do we think about the delays and what a good time for you would be for things to be up and running again?","K. Rone Baldwin","Well, I think that we -- as the lead up to October 1 and some of the expectations about a bumpy October became more widespread, we certainly adjusted our expectations that October was going to be more of a slow ramp as opposed to a big bang in terms of enrollment. The -- I think at this point in the context of the 6-month open enrollment period, there's still lots of time to be able to get back to whatever level of expected national enrollment or state-wide enrollment that people were expecting. As we get into November, it becomes a little bit more concerning because we're bumping up against the December 15 deadline to get coverage effective January 1. But even then, there's still -- it's unclear how much of the enrollment that might have originally been expected in the fourth quarter can still get shifted into the first quarter of next year. But November becomes a somewhat critical month in terms of looking to see that things are working better than they are right now.","Michael F. Neidorff","There is no reason to believe that it's going to effect the selection side of it, the ADA acuity one way or the other. It's -- someone that's high acuity will have the same difficulty as someone with lower acuity getting through the system.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes, I guess I just figured that someone with high acuity is going to keep trying, whereas someone with low acuity might get dissatisfied and move on.","Michael F. Neidorff","Right. It's hard to speculate on that.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Yes. Okay, so Just shifting topics. It was helpful to get the business updates. And I just wanted to go drill down into the targeted pipeline that you mentioned of $130 billion. That's all new business, that doesn't include the contracts that you kind of listed off as kind of coming online over the next year, is that correct?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, yes, it is. Jesse? You want to comment, Jesse?","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is there any way to break it out, more color between like just Medicaid, core Medicaid business, duals, Centurion, and any other buckets that you think about as to kind of what make up that $130 billion?","Jesse N. Hunter","Yes, and so the little bit of color we can provide right now, Kevin, is that's the same orientation that we've talked about recently in terms of the -- there's the macro pipeline across Medicaid, kind of broadly defined Medicare, duals, exchange, et cetera. And then this is the subset of that, that we're viewing as an kind of a targeted Centene pipeline, which would cut across all the things that you shared. And I think what would be in a position, as we have in the past, to give a little more color on that in December as we talk about how we look at 2014 and forward.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just last question. I think you mentioned a couple of times that you saw a trend moderating slightly. But did you -- I didn't hear if you did. But any color on what exactly was kind of driving the moderation? Is it any particular bucket of cost trend, inpatient, outpatient, drugs?","Michael F. Neidorff","Mary, would you like to comment on that?","Mary V. Mason","Sure. If you look at ER for example, we're seeing slight downward trends in the TANF ER utilization, both for our same store and also for our new plans year-over-year, but also Q3 to Q2. And inpatient is another good example. With TANF, for example, we're seeing some slight increased seasonality, mainly due to some increased deliveries, but very moderate. And for inpatient days if you look Q3 to Q2, but we see decreasing trends year-over-year for all the plans.","Operator","The next question will come from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just first question, just to follow up on the exchanges. Just curious on whether you've seen any enrollment data come in yet from the federal exchanges?","Michael F. Neidorff","Rone?","K. Rone Baldwin","Yes, we've seen enrollment data come in for pretty much all the federal states that we're participating in.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Are you seeing any of the issues in terms of data integrity with those -- with the 804 files or are those looking pretty clean so far?","K. Rone Baldwin","Yes, I think like a lot of other issuers, we've done a level of outreach to people that we've gotten enrollment files for. And pretty much confirmed that the 834 files we're getting reflect the members they intended to roll, the plan they expected to select, the -- whether or not they're APTCs. So the rates are accurate. We're not seeing kind of random problems with respect to the quality of the data that we're getting. There's 2 or 3 specific issues that we're kind of seeing on a systematic basis that we've raised with the exchange authorities and are working through those with them. So we're not seeing -- and with those, we can accommodate those at this point through fairly easy workarounds. So those are being worked on, we know to fix. So we're not seeing enormous problems right now with the actual quality of the data that we're getting through the federal exchanges.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. I had a follow-up question just on the visibility into the 20% revenue growth that you have now. Is that still excluding Florida? It sounds like you said you weren't ready to opine on that just yet. So just wanted to make sure that, that excludes the expansion of the contracts?","Michael F. Neidorff","Florida.","William N. Scheffel","I think that the 20% number includes Florida Medicaid expansion. We've got a wide range right now included in there on the Medicaid side of that.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just a question on the specialty earnings. Looked like those are down pretty meaningfully year-over-year. You had nice margin improvement in the Medicaid side, but just interested on what was driving down the specialty earnings year-over-year?","Michael F. Neidorff","Bill?","William N. Scheffel","There's really 2 components. The primary component there is that we have performance-based compensation included in those numbers this year, and there was none last year. And we've got some additional shifts in margin, particularly in the pharmacy area between our health plans and the Specialty Companies.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, what does that mean, though, in terms of shift in margin from the specialty plans into the health plans on performance there?","William N. Scheffel","Generally, we have lower margins this year than last year than we have on pharmacy side. Those costs are pushed through to benefit the health plans. Maybe I'll eliminate the consolidation, but when you look at it on a segment basis, it's a slight shift in the margin dollars.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question. Just on the new business, MLR, that was up 580 bps sequentially. Is that just the start of the Florida LTC business in the quarter? Or was there something else going on?","William N. Scheffel","With respect to the new business?","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, primarily MLR, that was up around 580 bps.","William N. Scheffel","Yes, the primary thing in new business right now is Kansas. And then we've got a bit of the Mississippi expansion which occurred on December 1. The Florida long-term-care new rollout is very small so far through September 30. They just -- it doesn't weigh in there very much.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So the Kansas MLR that you did, you have seen that rise throughout the course of the year then?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I think Kansas is operating in the upper 90s, and that's where we're 96.5% for -- through the overall new business HBR.","Operator","The next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Obviously, a lot of new business sort of coming on next year. And you did talk about sort of the business expansion costs potentially being even more than what it was this year. I guess, given sort of the commentary around the change of -- in the mix of the business as well, can you maybe remind us or walk us through how you think about the margin ramp of that new business?","William N. Scheffel","I think that the information that we provided since, I think, December of last year where we split out the new and the existing, you can see, as we've sort of absorbed that large revenue growth in 2012, and you've seen the impact on that as we've been able to -- as it's rolled over from new into existing, we've been able to get that to more normal margins. So we're looking at a 12-month period, we're able to take that business on and get into to the normal range. And as you can tell by the existing HBR numbers that we provide, those numbers have continued to be in the -- at the 88% range, I think 87%, 88% range in a lot of cases, which reflect that our ability to keep with what we would consider to be normal margins overall. And so I think our absorption period tends to be from 6 to 12 months to be able to take new business on, dealing with things like the continuity of care provisions, a little initial margin buildup and the new -- the start up of operations and things like that.","Michael F. Neidorff","We've always, historically, we've always said new business, we'd look at a higher MR in the 90s. And the type of business it is and how virgin the territory is impacts how fast it comes down. So excluding out kind of the new store, same store, new business, same business, is just to give you more color and ability to look at it versus saying that it has a blended new margin and new business margin in it of 90%, 95%. So it's -- the overall approach hasn\u2019t changed, just a little more transparency on what we're doing.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess just back to the Centurion business. Can you give us a sense at all of how we should think about the margins there? Any different than the sort of the base business? And if at all, we should think of sort of a -- just in terms of a total sort of revenue like the PMPM, is it the same as we should think as you expand into more states or are there nuances by state within these programs?","Michael F. Neidorff","Jason?","Jason M. Harrold","Sure. So when we talk about the kind of revenue per inmate or per offender, it can vary fairly significantly depending upon the market that we're going into, what the underlying cost could be for a care provider outside the walls, what services are included, whether pharmacy is carved into that particular opportunity or not. So there could be fairly significant differences. But we've given some revenue and some inmate population numbers for the markets that we're moving into or are already in. So you can kind of back into a per inmate per day type of a rate. And it can, again, vary significantly depending upon the market.","William N. Scheffel","But generally speaking, I think the margins in the correctional business, we think are as good or better than what we see in the Medicaid business.","Jason M. Harrold","That's right.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","All right. That's helpful. And then last one, if I could. Just on Ohio, you had noted in the past that it's slightly behind expectations. Any update there on sort of the ramp of additional lives under that contract? When you'd expect sort of some of that to pick up?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think I said in the prepared comments that we continue to work with the states and we see it continue to ramp up through '14. So to get more specific at this point before the December meeting with investors would probably be -- we will probably better just wait and have that kind of insight -- additional insight.","Operator","The next question will come from Dave Windley of Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I wanted to come back to Chris' question on MLR. If I understand correctly, you said that trend was a lower than you expected. It looks like MLR in the quarter, in the third quarter was a little better, certainly, than we expected. I guess I'm trying to understand, again, why the guidance is being squeezed to the high end of the range? Is that a function of some revenue that is now in guidance that wasn\u2019t in the guidance prior? Can you elaborate, please?","William N. Scheffel","Sure. I would say that the primary issue is just math. When you look at -- you've got 3 quarters of the year already in at 88.9%. And if you just factor in a fourth quarter similar to what we're running in the third quarter, you're going to be between 88.5% and 89% for the whole year. There's really nothing unusual in there that we're expecting. We expect the trends to continue as we have in the third quarter. It's really just the waiting that you have, that, given we're already at 88.9% through 3 quarters, the whole year is going to come in the 88.5% to 89% range.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And clarifying, for your retroactive rate updates for Florida and Georgia, do you include those in your revenue and MLR calculations for guidance? Or are you waiting to see what -- how those turn out?","Michael F. Neidorff","We have estimates that have been built in.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then final question. On the SG&A range, could you talk about what items in the fourth quarter could swing you from the low end to the high end of your SG&A ratio targets?","William N. Scheffel","I think the primary item is business expansion costs. And if -- how much we spend there has a bigger impact. The rest of it just tends to be more as expected and less a variability in it. As business expansions goes, RFPs, things like that that we [indiscernible].","Michael F. Neidorff","[indiscernible] there's not absolute certainty when the state will drop an RFP, to be [indiscernible] So it's that type of thing.","William N. Scheffel","And right now, we're not anticipating a large amount of, for example, business expansion costs in Florida for the Medicaid product because that's going to be primarily 2014. But that could get ramped up a little earlier in terms of adding some facilities and people and things, so it could impact the fourth quarter. But as I say, right now we think that's primarily going to be 2014.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if I could slide in one more. On Kentucky, can you quantify what the drag, the kind of the total year-to-date drag for Kentucky has therefore, kind of the tailwind that we could see from that for 2014?","William N. Scheffel","I don't know if we've got the year-to-date numbers for Kentucky. It's not been significant because we accrued for the premium deficiency reserve in 2012. And so the amounts that we've expensed in 2013 tend to be just some of the litigation or legal costs and some of the operating facility costs that we have. Some of those costs were not accruable in advance and you can't accrue shutdown costs for facilities and things like that until you're actually out of there. So I think we said early on, we would expect to have, I think, it was $3 million or $4 million of costs that we would incur after the -- we left there. And I think those numbers, $0.03 or so a quarter, would continue into 2014 for litigation and other things like that for awhile.","Operator","The next question will come from Brian Wright of Monness, Crespi and Hardt.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Could you give us an update on the Texas rate situation as far as -- I thought there was just the normal year update for September, October? Did you discuss that?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, I think we said that there was a 4.2% increase, including some risk adjustment that was put in there.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then that was September 1?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes.","William N. Scheffel","Yes.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then what -- how should we think about the Florida long-term care MLR, at least initially? Is that kind of the normal 90s or more mid-90s?","William N. Scheffel","I think that the initial rates for the Florida long-term care, we think, are going to be in the upper 90s.","Michael F. Neidorff","It's higher, too.","William N. Scheffel","And it's going to take some time to get that into a, let's say, a lower 90s, ultimately.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And that's in the guidance for the year? And that may have an impact as well, right?","William N. Scheffel","That's in our guidance for 2013, yes. And we don't expect that to have a significant variability at this point given our insight and where that is.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just -- if you could just remind me, what was the utilization reduction assumptions in -- that went into the Florida LTC bid pricing?","William N. Scheffel","We usually don't get into that level of detail in terms of what our bid amounts are on terms of things like managed care savings.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, since you did have -- you do have exchange, kind of filed data that talk about, for the public exchanges, can you give us what percentage of the enrollment that you've seen so far is subsidized?","Michael F. Neidorff","Rone?","K. Rone Baldwin","Yes, actually, I don't have the answer to that question. We're starting to look at our actual enrollment information now and trying to analyze it, looking at things like that. So I don't have an answer for you.","Operator","The next question will come from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","With the new business that you're adding next year, it looks like the new business revenue as a percent of total will be somewhere in the 20% to 25% range for next year. Is that a reasonable estimate based on what you know today?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think we said that we could see a 20% increase in our revenue at this point in time. We'll have more specifics, Carl, when we get into the December 13 call.","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I think, Carl, that the percentage of new and existing, we'll have that estimate in December. I do think it will be higher than the 14% you're seeing right now for the third quarter, yes.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And as you look at those contracts that are coming on, anything that stands out in terms of why the initial loss ratio would be different on that new business relative to what we've seen in the past? So -- and you just gave the example of Florida long-term care being high 90s but that's probably not long-term care, probably not a huge piece of that 20% growth. So just anything that stands out that would be vastly different than what we've seen in the past?","Michael F. Neidorff","I don't know of anything, Bill, that we would call out on that. It's...","William N. Scheffel","Not at this point. We might be able to provide some more color on that in December at the Investor Day.","Michael F. Neidorff","There are some RFPs still coming in '14 as well. So I mean, it's a -- there are some variables that are not yet known.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then last question is just the fourth quarter assumption around the flu.","William N. Scheffel","Our assumption built into the guidance is we would have what we would consider to be a normal flu season. Last year was abnormal. And so...","Michael F. Neidorff","Mary, you want to add to that? Mary?","Mary V. Mason","Right. We are experiencing what we consider a very normal flu season; low levels of flu testing and prescriptions. But we all know flu can be unpredictable. So we continue to closely monitor that data.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference call back over to Michael Neidorff for his closing remarks.","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, we thank you for tuning in, so to speak.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining Centene\u2019s third quarter earnings call. This morning I will provide an update on the issues discussed at our June Investor Day and on our second quarter earnings call. I will then briefly discuss our quarterly results and certain macro issues, before turning the call over to Bill for detailed financial results.","Let me begin with Kentucky. Our focus has been and will continue to be one that our members receive the highest quality of care by the most cost-effective means. Two, that our provider networks receive fair compensation. Three, the plans meet statutory financial requirements. And finally, our shareholders receive a fair return on the capital employed.","We are proud of the positive improvements in health care outcomes we achieved in Kentucky. These include a 94% decrease in doctor shopping for narcotics; a 53% increase in hemoglobin A1C testing for diabetes; a 30% reduction in pharmacy costs; a 30% decrease in one-day hospital admissions; a 30% increase in well-child visits; a 23% reduction in hospital re-admissions and a 17% decrease in medical surgery costs.","In our two decades working with states, this is the first time we have failed to achieve a partnership with a state. We have experienced significantly higher than expected medical cost in Kentucky. This is due to an unprecedented amount of retroactively assigned members. Secondly, fraud risk adjustment methodologies, thirdly, policies that are inconsistent with a successful managed Medicaid program, and finally, significant data book issues.","We have tried to work with the state on these issues and while Kentucky has offered some changes, they were not enough to cover the higher than expected costs. I might add that this is not only Centene\u2019s issue. It is our understanding based on statutory filings that the three plans combined lost just under $300 million in the first half of 2012. We believe this raises serious concerns about the sustainability of the program. Our Kentucky experience has taught us to be cautious with states that are, using managed care for the first time.","Yesterday, we filed a lawsuit in Franklin Circuit Court against the Commonwealth of Kentucky seeking declaratory relief as a result of the Commonwealth\u2019s failure to completely and accurately disclose material information. As expressed in our press release, we will use and exhaust all available administrative and legal remedies to ensure the review of our grievances with the state. We believe we have a strong case, but will not comment further while these legal matters are pending.","Next, let\u2019s discuss Texas. Our Margin Improvement plan for the Hidalgo expansion area is proceeding as expected, including the increased STAR+PLUS business we took on in the last two months of the quarter. Our HBR in Hidalgo is tracking in the mid 90% range. Our medical management efforts have gained traction, and we continue to move towards normalizing margins in Hidalgo in 2013. We previously indicated that we expected a 3.7% state-wide rate increase. Due to member mix, we received 4% effective September 1.","Now for an update on Celtic, in June we reported a high level of medical costs in our Celtic individual business. Our corrective actions to improve performance included a new national network contract, which took effect July 1. We are also putting in place targeted rate increases in the second half of 2012. Our HBR has improved from over 100% in Q2 to the high 80s in Q3. I would remind you that our Hybrid Celtic business in Massachusetts is performing in line with expectations and is not experiencing the same margin pressures we have reported in the balance of the Celtic book.","Next, third quarter financials, GAAP EPS for the third quarter was $0.07 per diluted share. As you can see on Page 1 of our press release, this is comprised of several components. Earnings from operations excluding Kentucky are $0.78. Third quarter loss in Kentucky operations is $0.31. This resulted in adjusted earnings of $0.47, which is in line with the forecast incorporated into our previously communicated annual guidance.","The other three items, the $0.69 Kentucky premium deficiency reserves, the $0.21 gain on sales of investments and the state tax relief of $0.08. Premium and service revenue growth was strong in the third quarter, increasing 75% year-over-year to $2.2 billion. We ended the quarter with 2.5 million members, representing an increase of 55% year-over-year. This included a Medicaid membership increase of 63% to 1.9 million, ABD membership increase of 126% to 76,900 lives; long-term care membership increased 66% to 7,800 members. Medicare membership increased 29% to 4,000 members. As you can see, we have continued the growth of our high acuity membership which will be beneficial as more states move long-term care, ABD and dual-eligible recipients in the managed care program.","The third quarter HBR came in at 93.3% compared to 85% in the third quarter of 2011. However, excluding the impact of the Kentucky operations, the HBR is 88.7%. The 370 basis point year-over-year HBR increase is mainly due to new markets, including the Texas expansion, as well as the Commonwealth of Missouri, Washington on July 1 and the phase-in of Louisiana between February and June of 2012. The Missouri and Washington launches are tracking in line with our expectations. We expect relative stability in the Missouri membership going forward. Washington should ramp up to over 50,000 lives by the end of 2012.","Now a brief discussion of our rate outlook. Our composite rate increase for the first nine months of 2012 was approximately 2%. While Georgia and Florida are yet to be determined, we believe the full year of 2012 rate increase will come in at 2%.","Now moving to a couple macro issues. Our views of the election outcome and the effect on managed care have not changed. Regardless of the election results and the fate of the ACA, we believe Centene is well positioned to maintain significant growth. States continue to move recipients out of the fee-for-service and into managed care. We remain committed to helping states effectively manage their beneficiaries\u2019 health outcomes while reducing expenses. The growth outlook remains more robust than ever with an approximately $45 billion pipeline through the end of 2013. We expect our new Kansas brand to commence operations January 1, 2013, and New Hampshire to begin late in the first quarter of 2013. We are pleased that Ohio selected Centene to serve Medicaid members in a dual-eligible demonstration project. This is set to commence in the second half of 2013 and is our first major dual-eligible contract.","We continue to believe we are well positioned for future opportunities in this category. Centene is preparing for the 2014 Medicaid expansion and continues to have conversations with states on future hybrid and exchange opportunities. We look forward to our December 14, 2012, meeting in New York City when we will provide guidance for 2013. I will now turn the call over to Bill, who will provide further details on the third quarter of 2012 financial results. Bill.","William Scheffel","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. For the third quarter we have provided the detail of the component of our results in our press release, and Michael has covered these at a high level in his comments. I will address each of the items included in the press release table as I go through our financial results in more detail.","For the third quarter of 2012 premium and service revenues were $2.2 billion compared to $1.3 billion in 2011 an increase of 75% year over year. The $950 million increase reflects the addition of four new states between years along with the Arizona and Texas expansions and the Ohio pharmacy carve-in in the fourth quarter last year. Premium tax was approximately $200 million higher in the third quarter of this year compared to last year, as one of our states paid us approximately $180 million during the quarter to immediately pass through to specified providers.","Our reported health benefits ratio was 93.3% for the third quarter. Our HBR, excluding Kentucky, was 88.7% with Kentucky increasing the consolidated HBR by 460 basis points. This is due to a third quarter HBR of approximately 115% in Kentucky before the premium deficiency reserve, resulting in the operating loss of $0.31 per share and the recording of a $63 million premium deficiency reserve or $0.69 a share.","As discussed in our release and in Michael\u2019s comments, we have taken actions to terminate the Kentucky contract effective in early July 2013.","Our premium deficiency reserve calculations assume that we will operate at approximately the same level between now and July 5, 2013, adjusted for expected changes in the program such as decreases in revenue from risk adjustment. The premium deficiency reserve will be released over the next three quarters including approximately one third in the fourth quarter of 2012.","Looking at Texas, our largest market, we received a 4% overall rate increase effective September 1st. And as we discussed at our Investor Day in June, we have been working to reduce the higher utilization levels seen in the March 1st expansion areas particularly the Hidalgo service area.","For the third quarter our HBR in the Hidalgo service area was in the mid 90s and this includes the cost incurred in mid August and September from the members we added as a result of consumers switching plans due to dissatisfaction with their previous managed care organization. At Celtic, we reported a lower HBR in the third quarter compared to the second quarter as a result of a change to a lower cost provider network and other actions. We also have implemented or applied for a rate increase in a number of states.","In summary we believe the actions we discussed during our Investor Day in June have been substantially implemented, and coupled with the recording of the Kentucky premium deficiency reserve demonstrate that we are addressing the issues which have developed in 2012. Sequentially, our HBR excluding Kentucky decreased from 91.1% in Q2 to 88.7% in Q3, a decrease of 240 basis points. This reflects overall improvements in most of our operations, particularly in Texas and in Celtic between quarters, offset somewhat by an increase in Georgia\u2019s HBR related to an adjustment to account for changes in the third quarter in the state\u2019s handling of premium adjustments related to retroactive membership deletions.","Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.2% for the third quarter compared to 11.3% in the third quarter last year and 8.2% in the second quarter of 2012. The decrease in the GNA between years reflects the additional leverage we have gained through our revenue increase along with lower performance-based compensation expense, which lowers our G&A ratio in the third quarter by approximately 50 basis points.","Our investment and other income was $23.2 million in the third quarter this year compared to $2.7 million in last year\u2019s third quarter. The increase is a result of two items, which generated $0.21 of benefit in the third quarter. First, we recorded a gain of $17.9 million related to a convertible note agreement which we entered into in 2008 with a third party to provide funds for investments in Medicaid and Medicare related businesses. During the third quarter we reached agreement to sell our interest in this investment for a specified amount. The investment is secured by the underlying operating businesses.","The second item relates to a gain of $1.5 million we recorded in the third quarter from the liquidation of approximately $75 million of investments held by our Georgia Health Plan. As discussed during the second quarter, we had receivables of $221 million at June 30 from the state of Georgia, primarily as a result of the deferral of our capitation payments. During third quarter we received additional capitation payments from the state of Georgia, which reduced our receivables to approximately $100 million at September 30, which reflects one month of capitation payment along with receivables from the State for deliveries and other items. Interest expense was $4.9 million in the third quarter compared to $4.6 million in the same quarter last year, reflecting higher average borrowings. Our income tax line item reflects a benefit of $9.5 million for the third quarter this year compared to expense of $18.5 million in Q3 of 2011.","We expect to have an effective tax rate of approximately 40% for 2012. We have a pre-tax loss in Q2 and Q3 but an anticipated profit for the full-year. Additionally, the third quarter benefited by approximately $4.6 million, or $0.08 per share, from a clarification from one of our States which applied to several open tax years related to items included in the State income tax calculation.","Our earnings for diluted share was $0.07 for the third quarter compared to $0.55 in the same period last year. Excluding the Kentucky operations and the investment gains in State tax benefit, our earnings for diluted share from operations was $0.78 for the quarter. At September 30 we had cash, investments and restricted deposits of $1.5 billion, including $36 million held by unregulated entities. We have estimated our risk based capital percentage, excluding Kentucky, to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level at September 30. For Kentucky we expect to maintain the minimum required capital level.","Our total debt was $395 million which included $40 million of borrowings under our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 25% at September 30, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note. The medical claims liability totaled $919 million at quarter end, an increase of $311 million from December 31. Our days in claims payable, calculated without the expense and liability for the premium deficiency reserve, was 42.8 days compared to 41.4 days at June 30. Our cash flow from operations was $317 million for the third quarter. The large increase this quarter reflects the decrease in the Georgia receivables and prepayment of approximately $120 million for fourth quarter capitation payments from other States.","For 2012 annual guidance, we have updated our numbers as follows: premium and service revenues $8.1 billion to $8.3 billion; diluted earnings per share on a GAAP basis $0.56 to $0.66; consolidated health benefits ratio 90% to 91%; general and administrative expense ratio 8.5% to 8.8%; and diluted shares outstanding 53.6 million to 53.8 million shares. Our EPS guidance reflects actual results for the first three quarters, including the impairment charge for Celtic of approximately $0.50 that we took in the second quarter. And the third quarter items discussed this morning, including the $0.69 charge of the premium deficiency reserve and the $0.29 in benefits from the sales and investments from the state tax benefit. Approximately one third of the premium deficiency reserve is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter.","Compared to the guidance we gave during our second quarter call, operations other than Kentucky have performed slightly above expectations. While Kentucky\u2019s results have deteriorated due to additional retroactive assignment of members and an unfavorable risk adjustment change beginning October 1, these items have been considered in calculating our premium deficiency reserve. Our implied fourth quarter guidance for EPS is $0.70 to $0.80 per diluted share. During the fourth quarter we expect to incur $0.12 to $0.15 for business expansion costs, including startup costs for Kansas, which is slated to begin January 1. This compares to $0.07 per share for business expansion costs in Q3. In addition, we anticipate incurring $0.04 of exit costs in Q4 for Kentucky related to severance and retention accruals.","Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Thanks, guys. Thanks for all the detail on the call. Can you go through a little bit what\u2019s in that premium deficiency charge, just in terms of the overall size of it? If in the quarter Kentucky cost you $0.31 and going forward you\u2019ve only got $0.69 in the premium deficiency charge, why isn\u2019t it \u2013 it\u2019s got to carry you for three quarters. Why isn\u2019t there a larger charge there at this point? What\u2019s the improvement that you\u2019re expecting to see?","Michael Neidorff","","Bill?","Bill Scheffel","","Sure. I think the main thing that\u2019s happened is in the third quarter we continued to see a high level of retroactive assignment of members and so we had unfavorable development in the third quarter, which we had to accrue for from almost inception to date. Even in September we continued to see members assigned to us from November of 2011. So what we did in calculating the premium deficiency reserve, we utilized the HBR calculation that we\u2019ve experienced through the life of the program to date, factoring out development from month or quarter to quarter, then that HBR is actually slightly higher in our PDR calculation for now through the end of June 2013. We know there\u2019s certain changes in the program that are occurring, and we included those in there, but overall we believe that the $0.69 that we\u2019ve accrued for in our premium deficiency reserve reflects our best estimate of what the costs will be between now and July 5.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Then just a follow-up to that, if I subtract the one-time items in this quarter away from your full year GAAP guidance, your new GAAP guidance is on the lower side of the range that you gave before, which from your conversation sounds like the thing that under performed here is Kentucky, and that Texas and the Celtic business both improved a little bit. So why aren\u2019t we seeing a better improvement than in the fourth quarter, given that you now have the premium deficiency charge than where we would have otherwise been based on your full-year guidance? Part of it I guess would be explained by the $0.04 of costs from the exit costs from Kentucky. Then can you talk about those exit costs? Will they carry into next year? Just go through that for me a little bit; help me with the math.","Bill Scheffel","","Sure. Let me see if I can cover all of that. First I\u2019ll start with the exit costs, in our 10-Q that was filed this morning there was a discussion of exit costs that will be incurred between October 1 and all of 2013. These, primarily, relate to severance and retention accruals and lease-termination costs. Those costs are not included in the premium deficiency reserve calculation; rather they\u2019re expended in the period for which they occur.","So severance would generally be expensed in the period that you make those promises, which we would say is the fourth quarter of 2012, and retention bonuses would be expensed over the service period, which would be between now and end of June, July, whenever people stay through. So that goes \u2013 and the least costs can\u2019t be expensed until you \u2013 through using the facility that\u2019s available for others. So those costs we\u2019ve estimated I think $5 million to $7 million will be incurred between now and the end of 2013. About half of that would be included in Q4.","With respect to business expansion costs, I think we said $0.12 to $0.15 in Q4, a lot of that for Kansas, and that compares with $0.07 in Q3. So it\u2019s quite a bit higher in Q4. I think you\u2019re right in the basic premise that Kentucky\u2019s performed worse than we included in our prior assumptions in our guidance numbers. And we\u2019ve picked that up in our PDR calculation. I think that the $0.70 to $0.80 range for Q4 adjusted for the business expansion costs and the exit costs, really any differential on that is the Kentucky operations.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Okay. Although the business expansion you had given previous guidance of that being $0.20 to $0.22, I think, in the second half of the year. You\u2019re a little bit below that overall, I guess, because New Hampshire has been pushed out a little bit, but it seems like that would have actually helped you in the fourth quarter.","Bill Scheffel","","Yeah, it is. And I\u2019m really thinking of if we had $0.78 in Q3 from operations excluding the onetime and the Kentucky operations compared to the 70 to 80 in Q4. If you adjust for the differential in business expansion costs and exit costs and you pick up the fact that HBR is generally a little higher in Q4 than it is in Q3. That\u2019s how we come up with our estimate.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Okay. Are you counting anything for legal costs in there in case the state sues you?","Bill Scheffel","","We have estimates for legal costs in our numbers, yes.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","The next question comes from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna","","Hi. Good morning. Thanks a lot. Just on the, I guess, are you guys fairly confident that you can indeed contractually get out of Kentucky. I mean, how can you help us feel a little better that this isn\u2019t going to end up in a long drawn-out legal battle where you can\u2019t get out by mid-2013?","Michael Neidorff","","Chris, I\u2019d like to talk more about it, but as I included in my script, we have now filed suit yesterday in the Circuit Court in Franklin County, and on that basis, it\u2019s policy, practice and wise to make no further comments.","Chris Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna","","Okay. So then, changing gears, when we think about you guys\u2019 incentive compensation, at what margin, prospectively, do you guys start accruing comp for the management team, and how does that equate to a net margin on a GAAP basis for the overall company?","Michael Neidorff","","Well, we have several matrix that we look at, and various compensation is evaluated with different programs, long term, short term. Your short term is very much based on the EPS. The elements of long term are, one of them that we\u2019ll be using more and more in the future is total share holder return compared to a peer group that will be identified in our next proxy statement. So there\u2019s a series of measures we use for different aspects of it. So in the case of the stock, it\u2019s very much EPS. In the case of short-term, there\u2019s an EPS and margin aspect to it and then long-term is total share holder return, the arrow tip.","Chris Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna","","Okay. Well, just to \u2013 in a more simplified way, so there\u2019s no incentive comp for the management team this year, at least at senior corporate level. I guess in a normal year, what type \u2013 given your run rate now, how much of \u2013 how many basis points of margin pressure would the incentive comp have on overall margin?","Bill Scheffel","","I think maybe the simplest way to explain that is you\u2019re correct; in 2012 we reduced our performance-based compensation. We still have stock comp expense in there for RSUs and things like that that have been granted and they\u2019re not performance-based. But for 2013 we would estimate 50 basis points of costs for performance-based compensation and we anticipate including those costs in our guidance that we will provide in December when we\u2019re making that presentation in New York.","Michael Neidorff","","Yeah, just a further guidance issue, you can go back to our discussion of compensation in the last proxy, half of the stock awarded is performance-based and that has been forfeited as a result of the outcome of Q2 in the year for the senior officers. As it should be. I mean, nobody\u2019s \u2013 the previous year was a good year. We did well this year, has been a difficult year for various reasons and we don\u2019t change the rules. They are what they are.","Chris Rigg \u2013 Susquehanna","","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","","The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse. Please, go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Thanks. Good morning. I just \u2013 maybe \u2013 and I understand you\u2019re going to give 2013 guidance shortly, but I think in previous calls you\u2019d talked about a 280 number being a relevant and decent, jumping-off point or starting point. Does that change at all in terms of thought process with Kentucky out? And then maybe just talk about the top-line growth opportunities given new contracts in Kansas, the Ohio duals and the annualized new business in 2012.","Michael Neidorff","","I think relative to the previous comments made, you all can get to the year end run rates. Bill\u2019s made it pretty clear what the guidance is and that\u2019s what everybody based their last call on, so I\u2019m not going to change that any. And relative to the growth, that is a subject for December 14th, and I\u2019m not going to speculate ahead of that. That\u2019s the purpose of that particular meeting.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Okay. Fair enough. And then you started new business in Washington, Missouri during 3Q. Just help us in terms how MLR\u2019s tracking there and how your experience has been there so far.","Michael Neidorff","","Well, we gave the insight into membership, which is consistent. And the MLR we always booked at a higher level in the 90s, as we\u2019ve talked about historically for the first two, three quarters of new business. So we\u2019ve been consistent with that. So nothing\u2019s changed there.","Bill Scheffel","","Yeah. I think it\u2019s performing in line with our expectations for those two markets at this point.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","","The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays","","Hi. Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","","Good morning.","Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays","","Good morning, Michael. Have you had any discussions with your current state partners around the situation in Kentucky? And be curious to see any feedback in how you juxtapose that with your 20-year track record versus your nine-month track record in one specific state?","Michael Neidorff","","Yeah, I will \u2013 I\u2019ll make only one comment. We believe in good, open discussions. The states we operate in already pardons and works with us. I think you take Texas or any of them; they\u2019re good examples of how when there\u2019re issues we sit down at the table and are able to resolve it, not just for us, but for the industry. So that\u2019s why they have sustainable programs. And clearly when this was unfolding we had solid communications with our current states and those that we\u2019ll be entering. And we\u2019ve already won contracts next year. So that has been received. They understand it and they continue to work effectively with us. They see it as purely a Kentucky issue.","Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays","","Okay. And I guess in terms of looking back at recent RFPs that you guys have been successful in, is there a part of that RFP response that you think you would have to address Kentucky had this happened earlier? I mean it doesn\u2019t sound like there\u2019s been any legal proceedings against you or anything like that. So I\u2019m not sure where or why you would have to bring it up. But is there any reason you think this could be included in future bids?","Michael Neidorff","","No. I mean I \u2013 I mean it\u2019s \u2013 we have no trouble discussing it. We \u2013 it\u2019s very clear. Anybody can get a copy of the complaints we\u2019ve filed yesterday and understand what the issues are. So I think I have no trouble with that. It\u2019s very clear what\u2019s occurred there. And we had hoped that the state would\u2019ve sat down with us and resolve it as every other state we\u2019ve ever worked with has done. But beyond that I don\u2019t want to get into it, Josh, because of the litigation.","Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays","","That\u2019s fair. And then maybe last question, I don\u2019t know if Bill has this handy, but Mississippi and Louisiana, especially Louisiana a decent size state, any impact from Hurricane Isaac in terms of volumes or impact there in your utilization this winter?","Bill Scheffel","","Nothing noticeable.","Joshua Raskin \u2013 Barclays","","Okay.","Operator","","Our next question comes from Sarah James of Wedbush. Please go ahead.","Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush","","Thank you. I wanted to think a little bit about startup costs here. As Josh had mentioned, you guys have been very successful. You\u2019ve won about six contracts starting in the second half of this year to 2013 and it\u2019s about $0.40 to $0.47 so far in startup costs that have been mentioned in 2012, though wondering how much of that was in the quarter and what do we know so far from contracts that you\u2019ve already won where the startup costs will continue on into early 2013.","Bill Scheffel","","In my comments I said we incurred about $0.07 in Q3 for startup costs and we\u2019d talked I think at the end of the second quarter about $0.20 to $0.22 for the second half and so we\u2019re seeing $0.12 to $0.15 in Q4, and most of that is for Kansas, which will start up January 1. There\u2019s a smaller level for New Hampshire which starts later in 2013 and then 2013 we would expect to continue to have business expansion costs from the Ohio expansion and duals going on in addition to whatever else comes out. So we will include a good estimate for business expansion costs for 2013 when we prepare our budget.","Michael Neidorff","","We give a lot more transparency than of course, Ohio, the duals were already in that state so that\u2019s important, but I think once again, Sarah, the time to talk about that in more detail is on the 14th.","Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush","Sure. I appreciate that, I was just trying to get a big, clear picture of where the run rate is right now. My other question is that it looks like Ohio may have been pushed back again, I think in the release you mentioned second half of 2013. If you have a specific month and can you speak to the reason that (inaudible).","Michael Neidorff","","No. There is no specific timing. Jesse, anything you want to add?","Jesse Hunter","","No. I think, Sarah, you\u2019re right. It has \u2013 there\u2019s some movement in the date with respect to that. We mentioned second half for 2012 and obviously there\u2019s \u2013 Ohio\u2019s on the front end of these two holds demonstration programs, working with both the State and the CMS level so there\u2019s a lot to be done there and that work\u2019s in process but we can\u2019t be more specific than second half at this point.","Michael Neidorff","","I think it\u2019s positive. We like it when the state is in \u2013 when states recognize in our rate and go to either the given point in time and they work with us on when the effective date should be, that way they\u2019re \u2013 it gets off to a good start.","Sarah James \u2013 Wedbush","","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","","The next question comes from Justin Lake of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","","Thanks. Good morning. First on the Kentucky exit, your contract includes a fee to exit early, I believe. Can you go over that from a potential cost perspective? And whether you would expect to have to pay this fee if you\u2019re successful in court?","Michael Neidorff","","I think as I said, I really don\u2019t want to talk about it, because of the court case. I\u2019m not going to preclude one way or the other something without going through the steps that are laid out in court. I\u2019m not going to give somewhere or presume something\u2019s not there. It\u2019s not an appropriate discussion. I wish I could talk more about it, but that case is filed.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. Can you walk us through your capital needs for Kentucky in terms of exiting there? Do you think that will be net cash positive if you walk away? Then can you just give us an update on where you are from a capital perspective, thinking out let\u2019s say through the end of next year what your needs might be?","Bill Scheffel","","I think with respect to Kentucky, we are committed to maintain the required capital levels in Kentucky through our exit, which would be July of 2013. There\u2019ll be some runoff that has to occur for several months. Typically, we\u2019ve had this experience in a couple of states, we will get our statutory capital back at the end of the period when we\u2019ve paid down most of the claims and worked with a particular department of insurance for purposes of paying back dividends.","I think with respect to our overall capital needs, as we said, right now we are maintaining a 350% RBC level. In the rest of our book of business we forecast out our requirements based on the large growth that we\u2019ve had, and we continue to believe that we have available to us through both earnings and our credit lines sufficient capital to meet our requirements in the near term.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. And the near term would be for the end of next year?","Michael Neidorff","","Yeah. I think you look out over the next few quarters and I think you\u2019ll \u2013 there are other RFPs coming up. So based on what is known today, it\u2019s different near term, that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s a quarter or two. As we add new business, then we look at it, and we look at our debt capacity, because we obviously prefer debt, and we\u2019ll continue to work with that basis in cash flow from our operations, which have thrown off decent cash. So I think to get beyond that, we may have more clarity in December. I would hope we have several RFPs pending, so all that will influence us. So trying to speculate beyond that gets precarious and can mislead.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. Can I just ask one follow-up and I\u2019ll jump off?","Michael Neidorff","","Sure.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","","The \u2013 thinking about the fourth quarter, where you are now versus what you were \u2013 what you were talking about after Q2, the \u2013 in the second quarter I think you had told us the 70% number, and that obviously included the Kentucky losses. So if we just assume they were about $0.20 for the run rate and call that the ex-Kentucky number would\u2019ve been $0.90. Right now you\u2019re guiding to a midpoint of about $0.75, and I know there\u2019s about $0.04 of headwind from the Kentucky exit. But that still leaves us about a dime short. And I\u2019m just wondering if you can identify what that dime was. I think it relates back to Pete\u2019s question. I just want to make sure I\u2019m clear on it. Is there some higher tax rate or is there any other higher tax rate or is there any other one-time item there? Because you\u2019re talking about operations being better and yet it looks like there\u2019s something missing there.","Bill Scheffel","I think most, if not all of the differential is related to Kentucky. I think as we were preparing our calculations for the second half of 2012 when we made our presentation in June there was an assumption that what was going to be happening in Kentucky during the course of the year. There would be certain improvements. We were going to get a rate increase July 1. And so I think the basic issue is you\u2019re probably overestimating how much we had in the fourth quarter for the Kentucky loss. So, when you added $0.20 back to $0.70 I don\u2019t know that that was a good starting point for a run rate.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. So it was probably closer to $0.10 than $0.20 in your mind.","Bill Scheffel","","I think that I \u2013 I think that\u2019s more reasonable.","Justin Lake \u2013 JP Morgan","","Okay. Great. Perfect. Thanks a lot.","Operator","","The next question comes from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Thanks. Just wanted to continue on that topic, and just relevant to the 4Q. So should we basically assume that there\u2019ll be around a $0.23 contribution from the beginning of the reversal of the premium deficiency accrual? So if we take around one third of what you\u2019ve approved in the third quarter?","Bill Scheffel","","Yes. I think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption. And I think from our calculations that would for the most part cover Kentucky. It may not cover the exit costs, which we talked about being $0.04 in Q4. But for the rest of the operations the reversal of the premium deficiency reserve in Q4 should cover the estimated operating loss in Kentucky.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And then how should we think about days and claims payable in the fourth quarter, just given that you\u2019ll start to drawdown some of that accrual? Should we think about DCP coming down? Or are there additional claim reserves that you\u2019ll be establishing that will offset that?","Bill Scheffel","","Well, the DCP number that we provided excluded the impact of the expense and the reserve for the PDR. And so I don\u2019t know that that number would change drastically. It goes up a day or down a day in any quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t expect to be any significant change from Kentucky being in there until next summer, if that causes any impact in the overall DCP numbers. So I would expect it to stay in the same levels we are, which is the low 40s.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay. Got it. So core DCP should be in the low 40s in the fourth quarter?","Bill Scheffel","","Yep.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay. Then just a separate topic, just interested in what if anything you guys have been hearing around the industry tax? And how that will be addressed, either from the states or the federal government on any developments in terms of how they\u2019re thinking about building in the industry tax into Medicaid rates in 2014?","Michael Neidorff","","We\u2019ve had our Washington office has had multiple conversations, both sides of the isles, both houses. They understand the issue. I think there\u2019s a lot of issues. If the ACA stands, the outcome of the election, and you\u2019re not getting a lot of people committing one way or the other, but they clearly understand it. There\u2019s a large group that have signed onto the necessary modifications. But we can talk more about it when we get through the election in Q1 of next year, because I think no matter what happens, both sides will agree that if ACA stands, there\u2019s a lot of changes that need to be made to it to get it sustainable.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay. And then just one last question, on the ABD MLR, it looked like that continued to creep up to 97.3%. Do you have what that is excluding Kentucky? And really just interested here, because obviously mix of business wise ABD will continue to grow, especially as we get into the dual. So just wanted to know what\u2019s putting the upward pressure on the ABD MLR? Is that all Kentucky? Or is that still some of the effect of Hidalgo? Or are there any other markets as well that are pushing the ABD MLR? Thanks.","Bill Scheffel","","I think it\u2019s both. The Kentucky is in the overall number, because there\u2019s quite a bit of SSI in there. I think Hidalgo is also, increase is the overall number compared to what we have in other states. So those two items probably account for most of the differential.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","The next question is from Carl McDonald of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup","","Thank you. The open enrollment period in Kentucky just ended three days ago. I\u2019d be interested if you have any update on what your membership will look like in the fourth quarter? If not, the membership that you\u2019ve assumed in setting the premium deficiency reserve for fourth quarter and first half of next year?","Bill Scheffel","","I don\u2019t think we have insight at this point in time in terms of any real changes in the membership numbers as the result of open enrollment. In our premium deficiency reserve calculations, we did not assume that there would be a significant decrease in membership between now and the end of June. Anything is possible, but our calculations did not take that into account.","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup","","Okay. Second question would be just the thought process a quarter ago in not disclosing the $50 million premium deficiency reserve that you\u2019d established in Kentucky. I recognize it was just for the Health Plan business rather than consolidated Kentucky, but $50 million a decent size number also a pretty high profile topic. I wanted to understand the thinking around that?","Bill Scheffel","","The premium, we have premium deficiency reserves for statutory purposes in several of our plans from time to time. We\u2019ve never really talked about what a statutory PDR calculation or what that implies, because there\u2019s a number of things that go into that that wash out in the consolidation. So we look at it always from a GAAP standpoint, and that\u2019s what we disclose on. So if we have a premium deficiency reserve for GAAP purposes, we would disclose that.","This is really I think the first time we\u2019ve had a GAAP premium deficiency reserve, which was for Kentucky, and we discussed this I do believe at the end of the second quarter. We looked at that for purposes, and at that point we presumed over the life of the contract we would still break even. Obviously the results in the third quarter worsened and it didn\u2019t appear that there was going to be any improvement, and we\u2019ve taken the actions that we have taken, and as a result of that, we did our calculations again in the third quarter and recorded the amounts that we did at this time.","Michael Neidorff","","I think what\u2019s also important, Carl, is right up until the point in time that we announced the PDR, we were in discussions with the state on some changes to the program that had they agreed to would have completely turned around the way things are done, not just for us, but for everybody to get that sustainable program. So as a result, there were some things we thought were particularly ourselves, but typically so \u2013 once we saw that those were going nowhere we very quickly calculated the PDR and got it out.","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup","","The $200 million in capital contributions that you\u2019re expecting to make in the fourth quarter, is that just for new markets? Or does that include capital that we go into Kentucky as well?","Bill Scheffel","","That would be for all markets. Some of that\u2019s for Kentucky. A lot of it would be for Texas, where given the significant growth in Texas as we increase our trailing 12 months revenue that statutory requirement goes up every quarter.","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup","","And then to follow on Justin\u2019s question, any sense at this point of how much of that $200 million will come from ongoing operations or existing cash versus what we should expect for a debt increase in the fourth quarter?","Bill Scheffel","","Well, at this time we don\u2019t project out what our borrowings will be from quarter to quarter. We do believe we\u2019ll have a significant level of earnings in Q4 and that we would be able to have availability on the revolver to fund the differential there.","Michael Neidorff","","With some cushion remaining. It\u2019s not a case of running the debt to the maximum. So, we still are in a \u2013 we\u2019ll be in a strong balance sheet position at the end of the year, is our forecast.","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup","","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","","The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies & Company. Please, go ahead.","David Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Michael, in your prepared remarks you made a brief comment relative to learning from Kentucky and not \u2013 being more wary about states moving populations into Managed Care first time. I wondered if you could expound on how that influences your thoughts about pursuit of RFPs in the future. Is it simply only states that are moving populations in for the first time or what other learnings could you draw from this that might affect what you go after?","Michael Neidorff","","Oh, yeah. I have to be very careful here, because I don\u2019t want to \u2013 I\u2019m not representing my complaint publicly over a conference call. But I think there are a couple of things. You have to \u2013 you want great assurance that the data they\u2019re giving you is complete and full. And so, we typically have done that.","There is a standard of practice the way things have been done that has not been an issue up to this point in time. And as I indicated to you, this went very fast. The RP I think came out in May and they went live in November 1. And typically states will do it on a more extended basis, getting things right through discussions and I think I eluded to it before, the fact that Ohio is \u2013 where they\u2019ve had Managed Care, they\u2019re a new population and they\u2019re extending the period over time to get some things right and have those discussions. I think that\u2019s what you want to see. You want to see people that are working to \u2013 building sustainable programs versus having a program.","And I don\u2019t go beyond that because I \u2013 as I said, we\u2019re going to take the high road on this thing. And there is \u2013 and I \u2013 let\u2019s just leave it at that.","David Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Okay. So apart from Kentucky, do you \u2013 as you look at your business development efforts, do you have thoughts that you need to expand that, bulk that up, to handle the amount of the pipeline. In other words, is there a process in capacity that you need to expand to be able to handle the expanse of opportunities that are out there?","Michael Neidorff","","It was not \u2013 it was at no way, shape or form a capacity issue on our part. If you look at number of states that we have entered and you look at how we\u2019ve done two, three states at one time, and more, we\u2019ve had no issues. So this is not a capacity. This is just a very particular issue for Kentucky. And Louisiana, Mississippi, Illinois, I mean all the states that we\u2019ve entered very successfully, to the state\u2019s satisfaction as well as ours.","David Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Got it. If I could ask one last follow-up on the shift to Texas. You\u2019ve made some nice progress there. It sounds like more than you expected. Do you think that that progress can continue? Or are there any structural impediments that would cause that to plateau in the short-term?","Michael Neidorff","","We still have a very strong team there. We continue to meet with the state on issues, when and if we identify them there. They\u2019re very interested in ensuring that the program continues to work and that they recognize the need for the companies to be successful in doing it, to have programs. So I see no issues there. I think we said in our script that we anticipate it continue to normalize going into 2013.","David Windley \u2013 Jefferies & Company","","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Neidorff","","Thank you.","Operator","","The next question comes from Brian Wright of Monnes, Crespi & Hardt. Please go ahead.","Brian Wright \u2013 Monnes Crespi & Hardt","","Thanks. Good morning. I just wanted to get a \u2013 so if the $0.70 to $0.80 of a fourth quarter guidance includes $0.23 for the release of the premium deficiency from Kentucky, that\u2019s a bit lower than your x-Kentucky run rate in the second quarter. You\u2019d spoken to $0.09 of it, I believe, in Kentucky run off and higher Kansas G&A. But there\u2019s still a delta there. How much of that delta is seasonal MOR higher in the fourth quarter versus a tax rate catch-up issue in the fourth, to get to the 40% for the full year?","Bill Scheffel","","I think, Brian, that the \u2013 you said, second quarter, I don\u2019t know if you meant third quarter.","Brian Wright \u2013 Monnes Crespi & Hardt","","Sorry, yeah, I meant third. Sorry about that.","Bill Scheffel","","Okay. Good. Good. That\u2019s a little easier to \u2013 the issue there is we said we had $0.31 of operating loss in Q3 and that was exacerbated by additional adverse development, let\u2019s say, from prior in the years as we continue to receive more retros coming from that. So I think what we\u2019re seeing is we don\u2019t expect Q4 to be at the $0.34 run rate going forward, more closely aligned to the $0.23 which reverses off of the PDR. And I think the differential, we\u2019d planned for a lesser amount in Q4 when we were trying to reconcile the guidance numbers in total, but we do believe that the numbers that we\u2019re giving right now, Q3 and Q4, the $0.78 that we have for Q3 and then the $0.70 to $0.80 range for Q4 adjusted for business expansion costs and for the exit costs in Kentucky, and a little bit higher HBR in Q4 versus Q3, are the primary moving parts for the reconciliation. Taxes really don\u2019t play much of a part in either quarter. They\u2019re about the same.","Brian Wright \u2013 Monnes Crespi & Hardt","","So your view is that that\u2019s not a material difference run rate?","Bill Scheffel","","For which piece?","Brian Wright \u2013 Monnes Crespi & Hardt","","For the fourth?","Bill Scheffel","","Yeah. I think third and fourth quarter are comparable in many respects when you adjust for just a few items.","Brian Wright \u2013 Monnes Crespi & Hardt","","Okay. Thank you.","Michael Neidorff","","We have time for a couple more, then...","Operator","","The next question comes from Scott Green of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Hi. I appreciate the questions. On Kentucky, I was just curious if you could tell us what the MLRs would have been in second quarter? And then third quarter, if you reallocated the unfavorable development to the appropriate periods?","Bill Scheffel","","I\u2019m not sure I have all those, but I would say we ran 115% in Kentucky in Q3 and it would have probably been closer to 109% and 110% without the adverse development. All those numbers without a PDR, those are the before numbers.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. And I believe the statutory filing in the second quarter was 119, but that assumed a little unfavorable development, so it may be closer to 112. Is it safe to say that you got a little bit of improvement sequentially in Kentucky on a run rate basis?","Bill Scheffel","","I think it\u2019s dangerous to compare statutory numbers and GAAP numbers when you\u2019re picking up PDRs in one and not in the other. So I think I\u2019ll leave it as I just explained.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. I guess I wasn\u2019t clear. So not referring to the stat filing, do you think the trend in Kentucky ex favorable development improved sequentially?","Bill Scheffel","","They\u2019re about the same. There\u2019s not much difference either way.","Michael Neidorff","","As we said, we\u2019re still getting retro adds going back to next November. So tell us how many of those we are going to get next month, we could give you a sense. That\u2019s part of the issue. That\u2019s one of the big issues.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay. Separately, in Texas, you said you had a mid-90s MLR. Just hoping you could offer a bit more detail since September 1 was the big rate increase that\u2019ll help the MLR going forward, could you tell us maybe what the MLR was in the September period with the rate increase? Was it lower than the average of mid-90s?","Michael Neidorff","","We\u2019d much rather do it on a quarterly basis where we look at the prior period evolved maybe on a quarterly basis. So I think, Bill, it would be misleading trying to give one month.","Bill Scheffel","","Yeah, and I think in general we\u2019re just trying to show that, with respect to Hidalgo, it started March 1, we\u2019ve had quite a few months to try to work on the utilization levels, and then we also picked up new membership in August and September, we got a rate increase in September. So, all those things considered, we still operate in the mid-90s and our team is working very hard there to try to continue to bring down the utilization levels in that service area, which is still much higher than they are in the rest of the state and is \u2013 will continue to be a work in progress probably for several quarters.","Michael Neidorff","","Recognize that we took on, what, 9,000 lives in August and September of high intensity and we\u2019re managing it down to that level. That\u2019s important.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay.","Michael Neidorff","","One more question and then (inaudible).","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Sure. Could you elaborate on the Georgia revenue issue you called out? Was that a new thing related to what AmeriGroup talked about in the second quarter of last year with membership reconciliations? And do you expect any true-up from the state from this going forward?","Bill Scheffel","","It is a similar issue that all three MCOs have to deal with in the State of Georgia in terms of how the state processes membership, retroactive membership deletions, primarily from what they consider to be duplications, and there\u2019s \u2013 it takes a while for them to process these. We make accruals for these on a regular basis every month. From time to time there\u2019s a true-up that might occur, which is particularly what happened in 2011, and then there\u2019s some adjustments in terms of how that impacts actuarial soundness and rates. And so, during the quarter there was \u2013 Georgia made some adjustments and we, in those amounts, and we reflected that in the quarter.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay.","Michael Neidorff","","It\u2019s always routinely looked at every month. Okay. We have one more?","Operator","","The final question comes from Michael Baker of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Michael Baker \u2013 Raymond James","","Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could give us some color on the \u2013 when the Ohio duals are coming, what are you doing in advance of that as it relates to medical management outreach, particularly in light of what you\u2019ve learned on other dual processes so far.","Michael Neidorff","","Well, I think keep it somewhat limited. We\u2019ll get what data we can and we\u2019ll do it through our predictive models. We\u2019ll use our system capability to examine what needs to be done and we\u2019ll work with the state and see what information we can get on the history of these people, and just ensure that there\u2019s a solid \u2013 the medical management people work on a solid transition plan and ensure that they gain the benefits they should for Managed Care. The state\u2019s working very closely with us on that.","Michael Baker \u2013 Raymond James","","And are there any differences in how you\u2019re approaching, you\u2019re reserving assumptions in front of it in light of what experience has been to-date on the duals?","Michael Neidorff","","Well, we can\u2019t take reserves until we have the members with the...","Bill Scheffel","","No, I mean it\u2019s \u2013 we try to reserve for the expected costs for each individual population and this population will continue to be looking at to determine what we think the \u2013 once we get rates and expected HBR is and we\u2019ll try to conservatively accrue that and normally we\u2019ll try to build margin up in the first six months of operations of a new area or segment of a population. I\u2019m sure that will be the case in Ohio.","Michael Baker \u2013 Raymond James","","Thanks.","Bill Scheffel","","Thank you.","Michael Neidorff","","We thank everyone and we look forward to the December 14th guidance and the year-end call in February.

During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our second quarter results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will bring you up-to-date on the Health Net integration and the fair value analysis of legacy Health Net's balance sheet.","Let me begin with a few comments on second quarter results. The second quarter marks Centene's first full quarter with Health Net. Overall, we are pleased with our operating performance which is marked by strong top and bottom line growth. We recognize there have been questions regarding the Health Net balance sheet and underlying operations.","Consistent with our previous comments, we continue to make progress on the fair valuation of the Health Net balance sheet. Importantly, there has been no unfavorable development on the medical claims liability established at March 24th. We did increase reserves for medical claims associated with disputed substance abuse treatment center costs. Additionally, we recorded premium deficiency reserves primarily associated with Arizona and California individual PPO business.","We believe we have effectively addressed these concerns with the purchase accounting adjustments. We also believe the opening balance sheet is appropriately estimated at fair value and the PDRs offset losses for certain contracts in 2016.","While there are some moving parts, it is important to note these issues are not unusual in a large acquisition, and we believe they are manageable.

These include price increases, plan design changes, and a significant reduction in our Arizona commercial book. Jeff will provide further details on this topic in his prepared remarks.","Turning to second quarter financials. Total revenues increased 98% year-over-year to $10.9 billion. Membership at quarter end was 11.4 million, representing an increase of 6.8 million beneficiaries over the second quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 250 basis points year-over-year to 86.6%. This was mainly attributable to the product mix shift from Health Net. Importantly, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical costs trend.","Lastly, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29, which includes a $0.19 benefit related to 2015 risk adjustment and reinsurance reconciliation under the ACA. This compares to $0.76 reported in the second quarter of 2015. Jeff will provide further financial details including updated 2016 guidance.","Now on to the Health Net integration. As we discussed at our June Investor Day, the integration is on track or ahead of schedule in many areas. Our integration team continues to closely monitor financial and operational metrics. We have now completed the actions needed to capture over 90% of the $75 million first year synergy target. As a reminder, this target is for the first 12 months following the March 24 close of the deal.","Additionally, we continue to believe we will achieve over $50 million in synergies in 2016 or approximately 70% of the first 12 months' target. We have begun to transition Health Net to Centene reserving methodology, and anticipate this will be completed by the beginning of 2017. We are also on track to begin the conversion of the California Plan into Centene's medical management system in the third quarter of 2016.","Next, market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. In Pennsylvania, in April, Centene was selected to serve Medicaid recipients enrolled in Pennsylvania's HealthChoices Program in three zones in the state. This contract was expected to commence on January 1, 2017. However, on July 21, the state reissued the RFP with a 30-day response period and an anticipated start date of April 1, 2017. We are confident in the value we demonstrated in our response to the first RFP and look forward to this potential opportunity.","Maryland. In May, Centene's specialty solutions division, Envolve, was selected by Maryland Care to provide health plan management services for its managed Medicaid operations effective July 1, 2017. This award highlights Centene's depth and breadth of management services packaged under the Envolve plan.","Indiana. In June we successfully reprocured our contract in Indiana to serve Medicaid beneficiaries in the state. This new contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2017.","Now, Medicaid expansion. At June 30, we served over 1 million Medicaid expansion members in nine states. This represents an increase of more than 630,000 recipients over the second quarter in 2015 and is primarily driven by the acquisition of Health Net's Medicaid expansion members.","In July, Centene began serving Medicaid expansion beneficiaries in Louisiana under the state's newly implemented expansion program. We currently serve over 60,000 expansion members in Louisiana.","Moving into Medicare and duals, at June 30 we served over 300,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We expect to launch additional Medicare Advantage plans in four Centene states in 2017. As a reminder, the new plans will be launched under our four-star banner, which will give us the benefit of incremental premium revenue. I would also like to reiterate that we are focused on designing Medicare Advantage products to meet the needs of low income seniors.","Next, Health Insurance Marketplaces. Centene's Exchange experience continues to be favorable and we are achieving margins at the high end of our targeted range. I would like to remind you that Centene's Exchange approach differs from most of our managed care peers. Our market price strategy has been and continues to be focused on targeted low-income subsidized individuals. We designed our Exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, including provider networks.","In the second quarter, over 90% of our Exchange members were subsidy eligible. This is consistent with 2014, 2015, and the first quarter of 2016. We ended the second quarter with approximately 618,000 Exchange members across 15 states. We continue to anticipate serving approximately 550,000 Exchange members at year end, due to normal attrition.","Now Centurion, our correctional healthcare business, continues to successfully expand. In May, Centurion was selected to provide correctional medical services, as well as pharmacy services, to over 7000 inmates in New Mexico. These two separate contracts both commenced on June 1 and are operating in line with our expectations. New Mexico marks Centurion's seventh state of operation. At June 30, we served over 136,000 correctional members, nearly tripling the membership on a year-over-year basis.","Turning to commercial, we ended the second quarter with over 805,000 commercial members. We remained fully committed to the success of the existing business in California.","Finally, Federal Services. Last week, we were awarded a new contract for the TRICARE West region to manage the health care needs of active and retired military personnel and their families. Centene will serve approximately 2.9 million eligible beneficiaries in 19 states and regions (13:55). We are currently the managed care contractor for the TRICARE North region. The Department of Defense has reduced the number of regions from three to two as part of this procurement process. We expect a new contract to commence in the middle of 2017.","Shifting gears to the rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect a 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0% and 1%, consistent with the past 3 years.","In conclusion, the second quarter was significant, as it was our first full quarter as a combined company, and we demonstrated our ability to execute on multiple fronts. We posted strong results. We increased full year guidance. We won new RFPs, and the Health Net integration remains firmly on track. We continue to be optimistic about our future and our ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored healthcare.","Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our second quarter financial results. Jeff?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will begin with highlighting the results for the second quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our acquisition accounting and 2016 full-year guidance.","We had a strong second quarter of 2016. Membership was 11.4 million members, an increase of 148% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were $10.9 billion, an increase of 98% over Q2 of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2016 was $0.98, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.29 when excluding Health Net acquisition costs and intangible amortization, compared to $0.76 on an adjusted basis last year.","Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share includes $0.19 per share benefit related to the reconciliation of the 2015 reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Marketplace business. In more detail, total revenues grew by $5.4 billion in the second quarter, primarily as a result of a full quarter of revenue from the Health Net acquisition, Expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015, and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2016.","Our health benefits ratio was 86.6% in the second quarter this year, compared to 89.1% in last year's second quarter and 88.7% in the first quarter of 2016. The 250 basis point decrease year-over-year results from including a full quarter of the Health Net acquisition and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, both of which operate at a lower HBR. Sequentially, the 210 basis point decrease from the first quarter reflects the effect of the Health Net acquisition, the reconciliation of the 2015 reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Health Insurance Marketplace business and lower flu costs, which were more prevalent in the first quarter of 2016.","The Health Insurance Marketplace business continues to perform well in 2016, with over 618,000 members at June 30. During the second quarter, CMS released additional information related to the reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the business. The reconciliation of both of these provisions for 2015 improved our pre-tax operating results for the second quarter by approximately $70 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. This is after considering the risk-sharing contracts, primarily in California, the risk corridor, and the minimum MLR. For 2016, we continue to record reinsurance at the 50% coinsurance rate and record the risk adjustment utilizing the information we receive from the data aggregators, consistent with 2015.","Our general and administrative expense ratio was 9.2% in the second quarter this year, or 9% without the costs associated with the Health Net acquisition, compared to 8.4% last year and 8.3% in the first quarter, also excluding Health Net acquisition costs. The increase year-over-year and from the first quarter of 2016 reflects a full quarter effect of the Health Net acquisition.","During the second quarter, we incurred $0.04 per diluted share of business expansion cost compared to $0.05 in the prior year. Investment and other income was $32 million in the second quarter, compared to $10 million last year and $15 million in the first quarter. The increase is the result of larger investment balances associated with the Health Net acquisition.","Interest expense was $52 million for the second quarter of 2016, compared to $11 million for the second quarter last year and $33 million in the first quarter of this year. The increase is due to the full quarter effect of the transaction financing and the issuance of $500 million of additional senior notes in June of 2016. Our tax rate for the quarter was 52.7% compared to 48.8% in the prior year. The higher tax rate is driven by the acquisition of Health Net.","GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the second quarter was $0.98, including $0.19 of additional earnings associated with the reconciliation of the reinsurance and risk adjustment provisions of the Marketplace business. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter was $1.29. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.16 associated with the Health Net acquisition costs, and $0.15 associated with intangible amortization.","Cash and investments totaled $7.5 billion at quarter end, including $196 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Debt on June 30 was $4.5 billion, including $185 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt to capital ratio was 44.4%, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note, compared to 44.3% at the first quarter of 2016. Our medical claim liability totaled $4 billion at June 30, representing 43 days in claims payable.","Cash flow used in operations was $420 million in the second quarter. The cash flow from operations was impacted by the delay in our premium payments from several of our states as a result of their fiscal year ends. Those payment delays decreased our operating cash flows by approximately $600 million. We subsequently have received substantially all of the delayed payments.","Next, I want to provide an update on the Health Net acquisition accounting. During the quarter, we have made progress in updating several fair value estimates as of the acquisition date. Although we have not experienced any unfavorable development on the medical claim liabilities established at March 24, 2016, we have increased reserves by approximately $90 million during the quarter associated with disputed substance abuse treatment center claims. We expect to continue to review the reserves for the substance abuse treatment facility claims. However, we have finalized our fair valuation of the remaining medical claims liability.","Additionally, we recorded premium deficiency reserves of approximately $300 million, representing the fair value of underperforming contracts for the period from March 24, 2016, through December 31, 2016. The premium deficiency reserves are primarily associated with unfavorable expected performance in the following areas.","First, losses in the individual commercial business, largely in California, driven by increased utilization of substance abuse treatment facilities. Second, unfavorable performance in the Arizona commercial business reflecting the unfavorable risk pool caused by the grandmothering of non-ACA compliant policies further compounded by the lack of risk corridor benefit. And third, unfavorable performance in the Medicare business, primarily in Oregon and Arizona.","We expect to continue to review the premium deficiency reserve for the substance abuse treatment facility utilization estimates. However we have finalized there for valuation of the remaining premium deficiency reserve liabilities. It's important to note we have taken steps to improve the performance of these businesses for 2017. Specifically, we have filed for rate adjustments in the individual commercial business in California more in line with our costs. And we believe the outcome of the 2017 Medicare bid process will improve the margins in Oregon.","We have taken steps to mitigate the substance abuse treatment center cost in the individual commercial business in California including modifications to plan design. We have accelerated the integration of the Arizona Medicaid business and taken actions to reduce our exposure to the individual commercial product in that state in 2017. And we are actively working with the California Department of Insurance to ensure we maintain a competitive individual commercial product in 2017.","We believe the actions we have taken will improve the operating margins in 2017. We have now (23:36) completed our fair valuation exercise associated with intangible assets, certain tax matters, and the substance abuse facility claims and the related PDR. I would refer you to the form 10-Q for a more expansive disclosure.","Lastly, an update on our 2016 full year guidance. We expect total revenues of $39.4 billion to $40 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.65 to $3, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.20 to $4.55, a consolidated health benefits ratio of 87% to 87.5%, general and administrative expense ratio of 9.4% to 9.9%, the G&A ratio excluding transaction cost of 9% to 9.5%, an effective income tax rate of 54.5% to 56.5%, diluted shares outstanding of 162.5 million to 163.5 million shares.","We estimate our operating cash flow to be between 1.5 times to 2 times net earnings. This can be influenced by the timing of payments from our states as well as the payment to states associated with minimum HBR and other return of premium programs. We estimate business expansion costs of $0.25 to $0.30 in 2016.","That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question will come from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks, good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, Michael. You guys just ran through a whole bunch of stuff on the PDR and I guess I just really want to understand what exactly is going on with those losses. So I mean the $300 million seems like a pretty big number, that's 50% or so of Health Net's pre-tax. So I guess I'm trying to understand, were their earnings just overstated historically or in these PDRs it sounds like that's really just from March 24 through the end of the year. So it sounds like it's a run rate of more like $400 million, and I'm just curious how does that not impact operations going forward?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yes, Josh, this is Jeff. You're correct. I would bifurcate that. The PDR also does include the substance abuse facility issue that I just mentioned and I will tell you that the largest component of the PDR is in Arizona. So I think that the math that you did is pretty close as far as the annual run rate. And what I'll tell you is that it was based on information as of the 24th of March and using that information and fair valuing those liabilities effectively as of the acquisition date. And that all those things that I enumerated as far as the actions we have taken, we believe will improve those margins heading into 2017.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, Josh, that's kind of the key as you \u2013 if we run through all the various issues, all the actions are being taken with effect January of 2017, which is plan design which we've been working on for the past several months, the premium increases, the removal from business in Arizona. So there's a whole list of issues that have been dealt with very aggressively so that we will not be discussing this kind of issue next year.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So that makes sense. I just want to make sure I understand. So the substance abuse is included in the $300 million, that's the $90 million or is it more pervasive than that?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","No. there's actually two components, Josh. So, there's a piece that's really from March 24 and prior and then there's the March 24 and into the future, right. And so the $90 million is what we added to the medical claims liability as of March 24, that really is for the prior issues. And then we have a component which is also in the $300 million for, I would say, March 24 through the end of this year.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So there are some changes been made to the certificate of benefits and the timing on that is being worked on with the state. And there's some fraud and abuse that's under full investigation by ourselves and the state, which will impact both of those issues. And so the best way to deal with it was this way, knowing that going forward it's been dealt with very effectively.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes sense. But I guess I still question how does Health Net get away with not \u2013 like what exactly was the dispute, they just weren't paying these claims and it turns out they had to? I'm just curious how...","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll give you as much as I can, but it is in litigation. Some of it's in litigation at this point, so I want to be careful. But in the interest of as much transparency as we can. There were some changes to the certificate of coverage, which we believe we're entitled to. And which the state's evaluating as well as through other legal recourse. There's that. That's being contested by the providers. There's also a whole series of claims where we believe there's been significant fraud and abuse that we have contested and are being investigated very thoroughly and we expect to prevail on a lot of those. So what we've effectively done is we've changed some things that created this issue this year but will not be an issue next year.","And so the best way to handle it going forward and it doesn't hit income, it goes on the balance sheet with purchase accounting. We had that and so what Jeff and the finance team has done is that once we closed, we had the benefit of being able to pore through everything, make those adjustments and ensure that its not hitting the income statement. And so that's as much with the legal issues and the fact that it is going to be in the courts, I want to be careful how much more I say, Josh.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","No, that's fair, Michael. I get it, I just want to make sure I got the number right. So $90 million is prior plus another chunk of the PDR going forward. So I don't know, let's just call it half of the PDR for rough math, is substance abuse related. And are you guys assuming that you owe all of the claims now. I mean, I understand it's under litigation.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know, I know I can't comment on that. I've got to be really careful on that one, Josh.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I don't want to tip any hands.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","No, I get that. So and I apologize for all the questions.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, no. I'm glad you're asking this because it's really important to us that everyone understand that the way Centene does these things, is we look at it, we address it. You know, I've had several meetings personally with Commissioner Jones. We've talked about it and his deputy. We've talked about the action we're taking. What some people thought we had to wait till 2018 we're effecting January 1 of 2017. So we're being very aggressive in fixing it. The other side of it, I don't want anybody to lose sight of this, there's a lot of business, Medicaid and other, that's doing very well and you saw some of the benefit of the HBR. So we knew some of this was where. We knew it could be dealt with in purchase accounting and we continue to move through it aggressively.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And are you guys exiting \u2013 so Arizona is the largest component, whatever, I don't know what that means, half or so but are you guys. So is this like, you know, how much of the business that's suffering or how much of that you just flat out getting out of next year?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","There is a considerable amount of it that we are exiting and the exact amount we'll be able to discuss in future calls.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But if it's unprofitable and we do not see a road to normalizing margins in it, we're going to exit it, and it's not a overwhelming amount of the business.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","And Josh, this is Jeff. I mean, just another thing that compounds the issue is the risk corridor, so a substantial piece of the risk corridor \u2013 the theoretical benefit that Health Net had assumed was in Arizona. So that's obviously compounding the issue and increasing the size of the PDR there.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I can't emphasize enough, I'm really glad that this came out so fast because it's things that have been there that we're dealing with very effectively, we believe, correcting, and will be behind us as we move forward. So I'm really glad it came out quickly.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Me too. And then, I guess, just last one, again I apologize for another question here. Just the $0.19 benefit on the 3R accruals, obviously that means that the Exchanges ran a little bit better then you guys had accrued for last year. Is there a similar expectation now for 2016, did you make any adjustments? I'm assuming you're accruing three 3Rs and payables based on the same math you've...","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I'm going to \u2013 I'll start and then Jeff can add anything if he likes what I say or don't say. We, obviously, accrue at what we believe to be the most realistic number that reflects where it's going to end up. But we also apply an abundance of conservatism. I would much rather sit here and say there is a benefit than a loss or something less than that.","So I think \u2013 I would hope next year there's a benefit. I'm not going to project it to be as large, but I will say that we treat it as a one-time thing. We call it out separate from the $1.10 earnings in the quarter. Because we're not looking to say we had a wild and wonderful quarter from operations. We did have a very strong, positive quarter for operations. But that extra amount we call out as separate from that that which came from continuing operations.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that.","Operator","Our next question will come from Christine Arnold of Cowen & Company. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi there. Couple questions. The profitability from the new TRICARE contract, we could assume that that's comparable to the old one?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jesse, you want to talk about that?","Jesse N. Hunter - Executive Vice President - Products","Yeah. Christine, Jesse Hunter here. So we're obviously not in a position to comment directly around the pricing of the new contract. But I think you've noted in some of the other notes that are out there, the contract is similarly sized to the current experience that that we have in the TRICARE North region. So and it's similar set of benefits and the like with the management services, et cetera. So, I think we'll provide more guidance on that as we get clarity on the process and timing. But I think that's certainly a reasonable starting point","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And I also think that the TRICARE beneficiaries and Department of Defense are going to benefit from the fact that while it was good before, our medical management systems and things we're bringing to bear in the new contract will be beneficial to the recipients.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then on the $0.19 on the risk adjusters and reinsurance, can you give me some sense how much of that was Centene versus Health Net and was any of this just purchase price adjustment and not kind of run rate in earnings for Health Net?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah, I can give a little bit on that. So, obviously, Health Net had some larger balances on the reinsurance and you are well aware what they disclosed in their 10-K. So they were more of the number than Centene was. And there was a small, I would say an immaterial, piece on the reinsurance side that was in purchase accounting but for the most part the majority of it came through in the $0.19 you see in the financials.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","So most of the reinsurance and risk adjuster, this $0.19 was accrued by both of you, it wasn't just for accounting stuff?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Well, no, and I mean said another way, I guess, it was not trapped in purchase accounting, right. This is the estimates that we had on the books as of the 24th, the fair valuation. And then \u2013 and that was by the way, that information was developed using the same data aggregators that we use and that Health Net uses and I would say that the ultimate outcome was the $0.19, once we got the final information from CMS.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Right. But is it fair to say that you did a purchase price adjustment on Health Net's balance of reinsurance and risk adjustment, therefore some of this may not have been in run rate earnings last year?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","It was an immaterial amount specifically on the reinsurance and I would say it trimmed some of the upside on the reinsurance by a small amount.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. So this is real?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yes.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","It isn't just accounting...?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah, it's real.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's real.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah, absolutely.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then last question.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, everything we do is real.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Well I know, but purchase accounting kind of stuff we are seeing (37:17)","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I know.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","So I'm just a little bonkers on run rate. How do we think about the reprocurement risk next year? That's my last question.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we have a solid track record of reprocurement. I don't want to jinx it and Cindy may want to comment but we are comfortable. We track it. We've won seven so far this year, and we have a chance to win one the second time and we're confident we will, with the results we had last time. And so I think from a reprocurement standpoint we go at it aggressively as we have every other one, but I think the track record speaks to it. Cindy, anything you want to add? And I don't see it as a huge risk, anyway.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Perfect. Thank you.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Just to go back to some of the stuff Josh was touching on because I think this is the way the market might interpret some of the commentary this morning that if Health Net was doing $600-ish million of EBIT last year and you got $400-ish million of cost charges, et cetera, however you want to describe it. Is the right way to think about it that the earnings power is really closer to $200 million to $300 million of EBIT from Health Net or do you think it is more in that $600-ish million range?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Well, I think, Chris, what we are saying is that there's some specific items that are obviously depressing the profitability in 2016 that we believe are going to resolve for 2017. So and I would just point to this specific issue of the substance abuse treatment facility which is a significant portion of the overall what we're talking about here. So, and we believe we will resolve those issues heading into 2017. So, you know, if we resolve the issues that we talked about today, I would say it's closer to the higher number.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Okay. And so the $90 million is basically for the 27-ish months of really 2014, 2015 and about three months of 2016, so about $4 million (39:36) a year, is that the right way to think about it?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","It's everything prior to March 24.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Okay. Then just separately, Florida MMA, there's been a discussion of true-ups related to prior period underpayments, 2014 and 2015. Have you guys made any assumptions around that in your \u2013 call it in this quarter and\/or going forward, in terms of what you might receive?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah. Chris, I talked about this at the Investor Day because the MMA, I think they'd already released this potential rate correction. So we did see a positive impact from the MMA rate correction disclosed by the state during the quarter. However, I did mention it was muted by reconciliations that we had in the long term care product that went the other way. So I would think, on a going forward basis, heading into 2017, it is a positive. But specifically this quarter, we did have kind of an offset for that in the same state.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And is that in the 0% to 1% composite rate adjustment for the year?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yes. We do have a forecasted rate adjustment for Florida, it's a 9\/1 effective date, so yes, yes that is. It's in there.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","It's in the total composite.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","That's right.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question will come from Scott Fidel of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. Just on the California individual business, just what are your plans for the PPO block for 2017? Are you actually planning to continue to offer that product? And then just in terms of the rate increases, you mentioned that you think that you're comfortable with what you have for 2017, we did see the final covered California data that came out on the rates, and it look like you guys were up around 10%.","Just one question, though, since it did look like both Shield and Anthem had some very robust rate increases in the risk adjustment settlements and reinsurance that they had looked like they had some pretty adverse selection in some of their books in California. So, just interest in terms of how you'll try to position the business not to attract some of that adverse risk from those two companies as they raise rates well above the market?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I think that's something that Centene is well experienced at, and we've been working with the state at the highest levels to redesign the PPO product. There were major flaws in it, and we corrected that. There's a combination of correcting it and ensuring that it's competitive, ensuring that it attracts a balanced book of business. We never design anything to be one-sided or just get healthys, but we want to make sure we get a balanced book.","We definitely want to make sure we're not selected against adversely, relative to the competitors. And I think the design we've come up with, using our experience, modeling systems capability, has put us in a strong position to do that. And the rate adjustments will be important, and the same competitive rates rate-wise and having a product that can be competitive is part of getting a balanced book of business.","So I can say it's something I've personally been involved in, in pushing and discussing, and I'm very comfortable that we're going to move in the right direction very quickly there, starting January 1. And that's why, setting up the PDR for this year, that's really using it the right way, because we know that come 2017, we'll be in the position we want to be with those products, and we'll be able to, we believe, grow them and do well.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Long-winded answer, I hope I answered it for you.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. No, I appreciate that. And then, just on the continuation of the fair valuation of the Health Net reserves and, Jeff, you'd mentioned that a lot of it's completed. Any way to estimate, I guess, the percentage of the action items that relate to that fair valuation process that have now been completed and those other elements that you're still working on, like what percentage of the overall process you'd estimate that that equates to?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah. I mean, I can \u2013 I think what I said today was, if you look at the medical claims liability absent substance abuse, which we're still looking at, we're kind of done with that. Looking at the PDRs, again, ex-substance abuse, that's still something we're trying to zero in on. We're saying we're done with the PDRs from that perspective. But really every \u2013 I mean there's some small, what I'd call small items that have gotten resolved. But we're still open on, for example, our intangible asset valuation. Right? The $1.5 billion that's on the books.","And so in general I would say, if you look at the large items, we've kind of covered two in the medical claims liability and the PDRs, but there's still a lot of other items to go as far as the valuation is concerned. So it's hard to give you a percentage of the total balance sheet. But there is still, obviously, some large items, like the intangible asset valuation, some tax matters, et cetera, et cetera, that we have to go through.","So if you look at our form 10-Q, it will disclose, number one, the changes in the quarter and then, two, kind of what we're open on.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think what's important here is, the operational side of things have been resolved. And now we're dealing with the accounting things that they kind of are what \u2013 it's what it is, and you take advantage of it.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah, and Michael has always mentioned, it's not how fast, it's how well. Right?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","So we're doing a thorough process and obviously, that's what we're focused on.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","But, once again, I emphasize it's not operations. The operations is right where \u2013 we feel we're just about there.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Right. That's what I was trying to get to, because especially with the planned execution of the conversion to the Centene medical management platform in California in 3Q, just wanted make sure that, for all the elements that you're planning that relate to the conversion, that you've now completed the analysis. So...","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, absolutely, and I can't wait to get to that conversion, because it's going to give us the kind of analytical information that allows us to really just continue to improve health states and manage it.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from A. J. Rice of UBS. Please go ahead.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. Just a couple quick questions, here. First on the Pennsylvania delay in the managed Medicaid. Have they given you any indication, is that going to affect the rollout of the LTSS in any way, and when we might hear something definitive there?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I asked that question and they thought it would not affect it. So \u2013 but I never put, as I said \u2013 this can be direct quote \u2013 I never put my hand in fire over any dates that states give us on when something is going to be announced. So we will wait and see.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then \u2013 I know in the prepared remarks, you said you have gone ahead and you're entering the four new markets for MA. Any comments you want to give us on how you're treating the one year moratorium on the health insurance fee in thinking about bidding for that MA business? And I also would ask in the MA area, you've been recently in the press potentially as a candidate, looking at some large-scale M&A activity. Any comment or update in your thinking there, that you want to share with us?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Let me gladly respond to that, and what we said in the statement we released. One, we tend not to comment on rumors, but I did add to it that I think, if there is any one thing that Centene is recognized for, is that it has not participated, and will not participate, in bidding in auctions. So anything that indicates that would have to be considered a rumor.","Secondly, at various conferences which were webcast to protect everybody (48:05) I commented that the MA that we're in, and my comments talked about at the lower socioeconomic level. And that what we see out of the Humanas and others are businesses that are at a higher level that we do not have a network for. And that's not our business. We would not build a network for it. So I guess somebody was spreading some rumors. I can't be more direct than that and I'm glad to do it because this is webcast.","Now what was the first part? I got so excited I could answer that, I forgot the first part of the question.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Just in thinking about the bids in MA for 2017.","Jesse N. Hunter - Executive Vice President - Products","Yeah, A. J., it's Jesse. Yeah. I think as we talked a little bit about at Investor Day in terms of the four new markets this notion of a proof of concept as we roll out and about the new Medicare Advantage platform, if you will, into the legacy Centene states.","So we're obviously still in the midst of that the bid process. That's not finalized. We won't get into a lot of commentary around the components of the rates and the like. But our strategy, as Michael said before, has been very consistent. We want to have a product design that is attractive for low income seniors, so I think that's probably the best indicator of what you should expect to see once these things become public later this year.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","All right, I'll even \u2013 I'll give you a sense of how we like to know where we're going. Once we prove the concept here, we know which states we're going to go after in 2018.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question will come from the Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. So prior period reserve development, as reported in the release of $252 million is pretty strong, up sequentially there. First off, just to be clear, I assume that only Centene business, maybe only a week of Health Net, and maybe talk a little bit about maybe what's driving some of that strength in the development?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Actually I think what's discloses is a roll forward from last year, right. So that would be only the Centene business. And we really look at it on a percentage of medical expense. And so I think our view is it's been relatively consistent. Obviously I think we've done some Investor Days and some presentations were we look at 1.2% to 1.4%, 1.6% in medical expense. And so I don't think there's anything unusual there.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Just following-up on that thought process, in the prepared remarks you said you anticipate stable \u2013 continue to see and anticipate stable medical cost trends. I mean anything similarly worth calling out in the Medicaid business, any states or business lines, i.e., higher acuity populations that are causing any troubles there?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think we can stand by that original statement.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Then, maybe just slip one more real quick here, just on modeling service revenues. $588 million obviously a big step up now including Health Net. Is that a good run rate we should be using going forward.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah I think that's a pretty good run rate, could be a touch higher, but I think that's in the ballpark.","Andy Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Andy.","Operator","The next question will come from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Getting back to the PDR and your fixes to it, to the problems, it sounds like you're mostly exiting the problems in Arizona. So that seems fairly solved and maybe pricing in Oregon Medicare is resolved. But it sounds like the California individual business is still quite unresolved and that you're still discussing pricing and actions there and the payments to the substance abuse providers is still disputed and going through as disclosed in the newspaper articles being investigated by the states as of the last month or two. So can you talk about how much of the PDR is actually really resolved at this point versus how much of the ongoing problem is not yet resolved for 2017?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good, let me take initial shot at this. One, the behavioral side of things, the benefit certificates have been redone, have been approved by the states and that will effectively, we believe, take care of that going forward. There is always the potential for somebody to try some fraud which we will always go after very aggressively and we have a fraud and abuse program that identifies and goes after that very effectively. So, I see that as a 2017 issue, not there.","On the individual plan on the PPO product, I believe we have now the right design. The actuaries are looking at the right pricing and doing it the way Centene has priced things and it still \u2013 we're taking the same approach we have with the market price products. You go at it, you design the product, you work with your actuaries and you get your pricing right.","So on a going forward basis, I expect that issue in 2017 to be gone and that's why it was appropriate to do the PDR for this year, because this was something we inherited, and it was prior to the 24th when those things were set. We see the impact on the year. We dealt with it that way but, most importantly, we're comfortable that the changes being made will minimize or eliminate this in 2017. I can't be more straightforward, transparent and confident than that.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Can you quantify how much of the PDR relates to the California individual business which still seems a little bit uncertain for next year?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As it relates to next year, I'm not uncertain about it. If I was uncertain about it, I'd still be working on it. We have the benefit design submitted and I think we're very close to finalizing every aspect of it. There was one area that we're still discussing that I expect to prevail.","The pricing is a function \u2013 again, it was final designs and so I believe it's fully resolved. If it wasn't, I'd say that as well. When I say I, I think we do. Not just me. Anything you want to add, Jeff?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","No. I think I made my comments or maybe some of the Q&A here that Arizona was the largest single component. I think California is probably up there number two, but you have to remember that also includes this substance abuse issue that we're dealing with.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Well, the substance abuse issue is in the individual business, is it not? So it's all...","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah, it's in the California PPO, so that's part of the problem that's driving that performance.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So in fixing the substance abuse issue if that resolves, I mean, you have to agree to be either paying the providers or changing their contracts, is that correct?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","The contracts \u2013 then let me back up. The issue is the certificates of coverage and they are being changed for 2017. Some of them are being changed for right now and that's being reviewed by the appropriate authorities. So on a going forward basis, the behavioral issue is being dealt with with the benefit designs, so that part is 2017.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And that's approved by the DOI in California at this point?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","They are ruling to, yes. As far as I know \u2013 on the new \u2013 for 2017, yeah, I mean, they've not raised any issues that give us cause to believe it's not going to be approved. We are talking about how much we could change for this year, and we believe we have one position and we're negotiating that.","But as relative to 2017, I believe that the issues have been dealt with DOI, and they want to see a strong play for the company's product line, competitive and so do we. So we want all the -- we like competition. We want our competitors in this product and ourselves to just have strong products. It's a big market and we'll all do very well.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Hi, great. I guess just going back to the PDR, I guess a lot of times the companies can't book all of the losses into the PDR and there's some ongoing impact. Were you able to kind of isolate it all within the PDR or is your guidance include some sort of ongoing impact from the losses in those products?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","No, no. I mean, the way we view it is it's you know the requirement is to fair value loss contracts and it's how you acquire and service the members, that the accounting term. And so we've done those analysis based on the expected performance and we've accrued the appropriate fair value of those losses.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We think it's all in.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","But I guess usually what happens is if you were to sell a new product, if someone was to through a special enrollment period sign up, and you were to lose money on that patient or that member, theoretically that would be an additional loss in the core business? That wouldn't be (58:21)","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Maybe said another way, I mean, since we've finalized the premium deficiency reserve, that's based on an expectation, right, a forecast. So to the extent performance is different than the forecast, then yes, there would be either a positive or a negative that would go through earnings.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. But this $300 million or maybe call it $400 million run rate is the number as far as you think for all of those businesses?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah. That's the number \u2013 yep, that's the number as of March 24th.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, so it sounds to me like you're also saying that as far as 2017 goes, you would expect that number to be basically zero, the changes that you're making that you've caught all the issues, the MA issues, the Exchange issues in time to reprice, change product design and change coverage area to (59:13).","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We will not have a PDR for those products in 2017.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I guess just going back then to the guidance, you raised guidance by $0.20. Is the way to think about it then in your view as far as what this guidance looks like, that's really just for the 3R change and that from your perspective the core business is basically in line with what you were thinking it was going to be coming in?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yes. That's the way, I would view it.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America \u2013 Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right, great. Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. We saw something about $1 billion of payments in California to cover hep C, do those have any impact on these other issues that we are talking about? I think they're probably completely separate, but I wanted to understand how much of that $1 billion does Centene expect to get and perhaps is that built in to your composite rate assumption, et cetera?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Jesse N. Hunter - Executive Vice President - Products","In hep C in the Medicaid program in California, there is reimbursement from the state through a kick payment mechanism. So when we incur hep C expenses, we accrue an offsetting revenue item anticipated from the state for that kick payment. So we do expect to get our fair share of those payments but the net impact is effectively neutral and that's the intent of the program.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And then, so you would treat those aside from your composite rate views. Is that the right way to think about that?","Jesse N. Hunter - Executive Vice President - Products","I think that's a fair way to look at it.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","It's neutral, zero, yeah.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Okay. Separate question on commercial, we're estimating that you were on your commercial membership down 6% quarter-over-quarter and maybe 2% of that excluding Exchange. Could you talk about what your views are for the group commercial business in California?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think we will give guidance for 2017 in December as it relates to the new product design and the price area we do. But our goal obviously is longer-term to grow that business and we have a strong commitment to build that commercial business.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Just in terms of the Exchanges, seemingly a lot of market exits next year. Can you just maybe talk about your expectations there, is it to capture a lot more lives on the Exchange and even broaden your footprint as we think of next year and beyond?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that falls into guidance for 2017, which we'll give later but we're doing well in the Exchanges, we're at the high-end. So we see ourselves continuing to grow it and we'll be looking forward to talking about that in December relative to 2017.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough. And then, you didn't include the, the MLR for new versus existing business this quarter. I'm assuming that's just related to Health Net coming on and, I guess, going forward is that something that you'll include or is the base too big to do that?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jeff and others can add to this but the scale and size now is so large that it \u2013 with 11 million lives and pushing a $40 billion company, it becomes less material, it takes a lot to move the needle now. And we did that in early stages when it had a strong impact. Now, Jeff, it's...","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yes. No, Michael is exactly right. So, just because of the growing denominator and the mix of business, it's not as meaningful as it was in the past.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough. And then just back to the PDR, just trying get a sense with the PPO piece of it, you have the substance abuse as a piece of the PPO, but I mean can you give us a sense at all I mean is that the main issue within that product or can you help us delineate sort of what is that?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","PPO we said was a part of it, but there are product design issues that were part of it as well, where we could get to some reason some of the products to be selected against, etcetera. So we're bringing the product design in line, so that it's competitive and we build a balanced book of business across it. So it's a combination. Seldom does it \u2013 when it gets to $300 million type numbers, it's just one thing, so it's a combination. But this behavioral health thing was big part of it.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. All right. That's helpful. Last thing, just quickly in terms of I guess Arizona and the corridor commentary, I just want to reconcile that because I thought last quarter you wrote off 100% of the corridor. So maybe I'm just not thinking about it right, but in terms of the PDR on the corridor piece or am I misunderstanding that?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","No, I think you're correct. So, effectively what we said is the risk corridor wasn't in, we did not anticipate that in our guidance. And I think what's happened is that obviously hurt the profitability as well, right, so it's been compounded by what we've seen as far as the expectations for the Arizona business on a going forward basis from March 24 to December 31. So, once effectively that flips to an underperforming contract, than the risk corridor just kind of adds on top of that, right.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think I just, if I may, just summarizing it. The PDR we believe got us right for the balance of this year from the operational side of things. The intangibles was not PDR, that's accounting. So the operations things we believe we have that it's right now going forward. We believe that everything we're doing for 2017 we won't be facing these same kind of issues. So it's really a case of using the accounting that's there for that reason to get things right on this size deal. And I will emphasize again, in Medicaid there is a lot of things that are doing well, that are contributing to the top and bottom line of this company. And we continue to win RFPs. We continue to add members across all our plans. So, it's very balanced.","Other questions?","Operator","Yes, we have some other questions, sir, one moment. The next question will come from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yes, thanks, good morning. The first question, I just \u2013 to follow up yet again on the PDR and this individual book. What is the HMO MLR for Health Net? And what are you targeting for a sustainable product? I hear you on the PPO, you've taken benefit design steps and the product probably wasn't appropriately designed. But on the HMO side of it, is it (1:06:47) going okay?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well we don't \u2013 okay, let me answer that for you, and then Jeff can jump in and others. We don't give individual product HBRs. We did talk about how the HBR is down 250 basis points, okay. We also said a lot of that's product mix out of Health Net. So, you can connect the dots and know that the balance of our businesses have strong \u2013 with Health Net and ourselves, have strong MLRs, that the issue that we had in the PPO is isolated to the PPO products in California.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Okay, so, nothing else outside the PPO on individual. The second question was about the Medicare book on Health Net, and now that you've got two quarters of integration insight and experience, they generally ran at a higher MLR, above 90%, despite a very nice four-star rating. And you said you took some pricing actions, I believe. Is this only pricing related? Is there anything else from contracts or utilization management? And going forward, is it possible to expand the margins on that book of business, which is pretty sizeable?","Jesse N. Hunter - Executive Vice President - Products","Yeah. Ana, this is Jesse. I think the part of the \u2013 we've obviously gotten a deeper understanding of the Medicare book, and I think this question came up in the June Investor Day too, what do we see as the margins for the Medicare Advantage product on a go forward basis? And I think we continue to see the opportunity for our standard, if you will, 3% to 5% pre-tax margins for the Medicare Advantage product. So some of the dynamic that existed on a legacy basis is what I would call mix. So the proportion of the Medicare business that's in California, and there are certain, again, contracts and other things that exist within the California market that would be different as we think about the other markets that we've already indicated we'll be expanding into in 2017.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I also think that the \u2013 that's why I commented earlier that I'm glad that we'll be adding the medical management systems to some of those products that \u2013 commercial will be last part of it \u2013 but in the Medicaid, Medicare, because there's clearly going to be some real benefits from them having the analytical capabilities to improve margins through that data.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then what about on the group commercial side, any post mortem from that, now that you're running the book?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sorry we can't hear you. Can you speak up a little bit, Ana?","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","The group employer commercial, as you're looking at it. I mean, that wasn't your book of business to start with, but again, any opportunities to improve the book of business, in terms of profitability and (1:09:53)","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think \u2013 once again, it will take a longer to get the medical management systems in, but as we get those in, we expect to have some minimal opportunities to improve it.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Thanks for taking the questions.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. Can you walk us through some of the moving pieces in MLR?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Can you speak up, Sarah? We can't hear you.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Sure. Can you walk us through some of the moving pieces in MLR specifically? What was the two-R impact, was it solely on the med cost side or was there premium adjustments? And it doesn't sound like you took any of the reserve adjustments into the MLR, but I just want to confirm that. Then if you could quantify how much the non-repetitive leap year contributed to the Q-over-Q improvement? Thanks.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah. So, I think you started out with first, the two Rs. I think if you \u2013 we've disclosed the pre-tax number. It's 70 basis points on a consolidated MLR. The majority of that would've been in the revenue line item versus medical expenses, more of it was associated with the risk adjustment versus the reinsurance.","So \u2013 and on your second question, what was your second question?","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Just confirming that there was no flow-through of the reserve adjustments to MLR and then, how much the non-repetitive leap year contributed to the Q-over-Q improvement?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","I guess I'm confused by your no flow-through reserve adjustments through the MLR? You mean like prior period...","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Just making sure that that \u2013 the $90 million, the $300 million, since it was purchase accounting, that there was no impact on the MLR.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah. That's right. Those were opening balance sheet adjustments, and included in purchase accounting.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","And the Q-over-Q impact from leap year?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","I think we've talked historically about the quarterly impact for leap year. There's additional costs in Q1. So I mean, I think our HBR improved, but you know the biggest reason why our HBR obviously changed is just the acquisition of Health Net and the different mix in the business, right.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Got it. Then lastly, the CDC is pushing for more aggressive use of Zika testing. Can you speak to whether or not those tests are on formulary in Florida or other relevant markets, and if not ,how does that impact claims denials if it's moved on formulary, or possibly I guess unit pricing, if that helps with negotiations of the test's price?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","It's kind of hard to hear, what testing did you say?","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","For Zika testing.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Oh, Zika.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","CDC is pushing for more aggressive Zika testing, so if you could talk to whether or not it's on the Florida formulary, and how that impacts claims denials?","Jesse N. Hunter - Executive Vice President - Products","You know that recommendation is just out, and so we are tracking that. I don't believe it is on the formulary in Florida yet, but we can get back to you on that information. But it's a very recent recommendation from CDC.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Jesse N. Hunter - Executive Vice President - Products","In any case, we don't really feel this will have a very significant financial impact, though. The costs of tests are very low.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Mr. Lake, your line is open at this time, please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Just appreciate taking the question this late. First on the PDR, can you identify \u2013 basically, just want to make sure I understand this. You're saying that, regardless of how this decision turns out on substance abuse, you are not essentially expected to have to even cover it for 2017.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","That's right. We believe that for 2017, the certificate of coverages have been corrected and will be approved \u2013 it's well along the way to being approved.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","So when do you expect that approval?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Any time. I mean they've been talking about it, they understand it. It's ongoing discussions, it's kind of routine.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Rone may want to add something. So this is a routine approval that we'll be getting for the new certificate. Rone?","Kenneth Rone Baldwin - Executive Vice President-Insurance Group Business","Yeah. This is part of the normal filing process for products for 2017. And that process is not finalized at this point. So we're going through it and there's been, as Michael indicated, discussions that we feel confident that, based on the discussions, that we will have this immunized for 2017.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","This is routine, there's nothing controversial we're asking for. We're closing \u2013 I don't want to call it loopholes \u2013 some openings that the state understands, and they're not sure why they were there to begin with, in the conversations I've had. And so it's a non-risk in my mind.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then, Jeff, as you, I know without giving too much detail, if we were at just bucket this California issue, if were to get fixed the way you're talking about just the substance abuse and the markets that you're expecting to exit in Arizona or the products you're expecting to exit in Arizona, we add those two together, how much of the $300 million would that make up?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah. You're right, Justin. I'm not going to get in too much detail here, but I think what we've said is that all the actions we're taking and what Michael said is that we believe that's going to resolve the issues.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","As we sit here today, right. Because if we don't resolve the issues there'd be a PDR at the end of this year and that's not what we're communicating here today.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","If we thought there was, we'd tell you that. We have a track record of saying where things stand and transparent and they tend to turn out -- and not just tend to, they do turn out that way. So a PDR, we booked it for the right reasons in the right way. We've made the adjustments going forward to benefits, pricing, withdrawing products and I want to emphasize one last point here in that we're not talking about a big broad base endemic problem across the company. We're talking about a product, basically one product in one state.","We're talking about another product in Arizona, which we're exiting and taking care of it that way, so we're not talking about something that affects all the places where the systems are broken down and we haven't booked the right IBNR and all those things. We're talking about one product, one state where we have taken the action to do what we can to improve it this year, waiting for approval on that. But definitely have taken the necessary steps to fix it for next year.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","I appreciate that, I guess what I was trying to get at was again without too much detail, A couple of your peers have had somewhat similar problems in terms of specific businesses or products and they have given some detail around exits for 2017 and the market's chosen to look through them, right, which I think is correct. But without giving color it's hard to figure out how much of that goes away directly for 2017? So that's why I was asking for the color.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well give me an understanding of the color you want. We're saying that we've corrected the certificates of authority.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Right, that I get. How much are you exiting in Arizona? How much of this PDR of $300 million are you just not even going to be in the product for next year, such that we can just literally write it off which I think is what the market would like to do. Just say this is cash charge, we move forward and for 2017, we don't worry about that.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah, it's substantially all in the Arizona piece. And I think we've talked about the Medicare piece and what's being done there and then you have the substance abuse issue primarily in California and the changes that Michael's talked about.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So we've dealt with it all. Arizona exit all the product problems there.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","So Jeff, substantially all meaning more than the more than 50% in Arizona, you will not be in that business for next year is what you're saying?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","I would say, yes.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it, guys. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for squeezing me in. I just want to understand \u2013 going back to the PDR \u2013 just want to understand the mechanics a little bit better because I'm getting questions on this, that where did you book it? It went against the balance sheet? I mean was it something that you had to offset in the second quarter earnings? I'm confused about that.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","No it's part of the acquisition accounting, Matt. So what happens is, is you increase the reserves and the offset is really embedded in goodwill on the opening balance sheet.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, I got that. I guess I'm trying to understand though for the PDR as it relates to I mean, anything related to prior to the acquisition date, I get it, that's against the balance sheet. It will have no impact on the P&L post March 24th. But for this $300 million, that's a PDR that you're taking related to the period of March 24th through the end of this year, so that's what I'm trying to understand. That goes against the balance sheet, does that mean that if you hadn't taken the PDR, does that mean that your earnings for that period would be by your estimate $300 million lower than what your guidance states?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","So what I would say is that the original creation of the PDR is embedded in goodwill on March 24th and then effectively that PDR amortizes throughout the year to absorb the losses on those products that we've identified and businesses we've identified.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So the \u2013 sorry, I mean, just the answer basically is yes to that question?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So there's no income hit to us.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yes.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Right. Okay. And just one last one, for the $0.19, that's all related to Centene, right? Is there any that's related to Health Net?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","No, that's both companies, that's both Health Net and Centene combined.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But if that's for 2015?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah, that's for 2015. That's correct and I would say the majority of it is Health Net related.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But, I guess I'm confused about that, because I would've thought isn't that for \u2013 I mean, that's for Health Net prior to the period of the acquisition close. How does that \u2013 look, it's my misunderstanding of accounting. But how does that flow through to benefit the P&L post the acquisition?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President and Treasurer","Yeah, because we're effectively fair valuing that item as of the date of the transaction and you have to remember that a lot of the Encounters data and Edge Service submissions don't happen until May. And ultimately we were relying on and Health Net was relying on information from the data aggregators to effectively fair value that as of the transaction date.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Michael Neidorff for his closing remarks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I thank everybody. I'm glad we were able to have this call today, because I think it's important we understand the PDR does not affect us on a going forward basis, and it's been dealt with and we're looking forward to continuing forward to growing results of the company.

With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining Centene's First Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our first quarter results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. We will also provide commentary around the healthcare legislation and regulatory landscape. Additionally, we will discuss recent acquisitions of investments including updates on Fidelis.","I would like to begin by discussing Centene's position in today's ever-changing healthcare environment. Centene is no longer just a Medicaid-focus company. To a combination of organic and strategic acquisitions of investments, we have evolved into a multinational diversified healthcare enterprise. We bring approximately 300 solutions to 30 states, totaling 12.8 million U.S. citizens and approximately 900,000 individuals in two international markets.","Centene is the largest Medicaid-managed care organization in the country. Upon the close of the Fidelis acquisition, we will be a leader in the four of the largest Medicaid states. Centene is the largest provider of managed long term support services and to our Ambetter product; we are also the largest provider in the marketplace segment.","One of the chief benefits of our evolution is the scale we have gained. This scale enhances our ability to maintain positive operating performance despite transitory issues that can incur in any business. We are positioning Centene for the future by continuing to invest in systems and capabilities. This is to ensure that we can sustain our ability to provide the highest quality healthcare at the lowest cost. I would now like to go through our most recent acquisitions and investments.","Fidelis Care; we are encouraged by the progress being made related to the regulatory approval process. As we reported yesterday, we have received approval from the New York Department of Health and the New York Department of Financial Services. We are actively working with the New York Attorney General to obtain the final approvals; we believe this should be received relatively soon. This helps to ensure a closing date no later than July 1. The integration planning is under way and going extremely well. We will be able to hit the ground running upon the close of the transaction.","Earlier this month, Centene agreed to certain undertakings with the New York Department of Health. This includes a $340 million contribution to the State of New York to be paid over a five-year period. This contribution will be used for initiatives consistent with Centene's mission of providing high quality healthcare to vulnerable populations within the state.","MHM Services; in April, we completed the acquisition of MHM Services, a national provider of healthcare and staffing services to conventional systems and other governmental agencies. Under the terms of the agreement, Centene also acquired the remaining 49% ownership in Centurion. This is the correctional healthcare services joint venture between Centene and MHM.","MHM serves over 300,000 individuals in more than 300 facilities across the U.S. This acquisition adds one new state to Centene's portfolio. It also expands our existing seven-state correctional footprint to 13 states. We plan to leverage this larger platform to pursue additional opportunities in both new and existing states.","Community Medical Group; in March, we completed the acquisition of Community Medical Group, a leading at-risk primary care provider in Miami Day County Florida. This transaction represents Centene's targeted approach towards vertical integration in healthcare. It is a nice strategic stint as the company focuses on serving individuals in molding government-sponsored healthcare programs. CMG covers approximately 70,000 Medicaid\/Medicare Advantage in marketplace recipients.","Importantly, CMG has a unique clinical care model. In addition to primary care services, CMG provides access specialty care, transportation and a suite of social and other support services. This acquisition provides a platform for expansion of the model across Florida and potentially into other states with a particular focus on areas where access may be limited.","RX Advance; in March, Centene made an equity investment in RX Advance, a full-service pharmacy benefits manager. RX Advance is complimentary to Centene's internal TVM [ph]. We expect to use the company's cloud-based technology platform to significantly reduce administrative cost and affordable drug-impacted medical cost. This partnership includes both a customer relationship and a strategic investment in RX Advance. As part of the initial transaction, Centene has certain rights to expand its equity investment in the future.","Interpreta; in March, we acquired an additional 61% ownership in Interpreta. This brings Centene's total ownership to 80%. Interpreta is an innovative health IT company, focused on clinical and genomic data, as well as real-time analytics. In summary, the net effect of these acquisitions and investments is that we continue to execute on our diversification strategy. This enhances our position as a healthcare enterprise and a leader in government-sponsored healthcare. Adding capabilities in the provider [ph] pharmacy and technology categories should provide growth and margin opportunities for Centene well into the future.","Next, I will provide an update on healthcare legislative and regulatory landscape. We continue to believe it is unlikely that Congress will pass healthcare legislation in 2018. We see any healthcare-related changes being done to a regulation. For example, in early April, CMS released its 2019 final payment notice rule for exchanges. We believe we can successfully navigate these changes as we have consistently done so in the past.","Now, onto the first quarter of 2018 financials. We are pleased to begin 2018 with another strong quarter, marked by solid top and bottom line growth and robust operating cash flows. Membership at quarter end was 12.8 million recipients. This represents an increase of 684,000 beneficiaries over the first quarter of 2017. First quarter revenues increased 13% year-over-year to $13.2 billion. The adjusted SG&A expense ratio increased 100 basis points year-over-year to 10.3%. This was primarily a result of growth in our marketplace business. The HBR decreased 330 basis points year-over-year to 84.3%. This is primarily related to growth marketplace business, better Medicaid performance and a return of the health insurance fee.","We reported adjusted first quarter diluted earnings per share of $2.17, compared to $1.12 in the same period last year. This represents growth in earnings of 94%. Lastly, operating cash flows came in at $1.8 billion or 5.5x net earnings. Jeff will provide further financial details including updated 2018 guidance in his prepared remarks.","A quick comment on medical cost including flu. We saw an uptake in flu in the first quarter and it peaked in February. The impact of flu in the first quarter HBR was approximately 40 basis points year-over-year. As I mentioned earlier, we are able to absorb this cost to our diversity and scale. Importantly, flu is just one component of our medical cost. We view flu trends as episodic and not indicative of our ability to manage overall medical expense. Finally, we continue to see as well as anticipate overall stable medical cost trends. This is consistent with expectations in the low single digits.","Moving on to markets and product updates. First, we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity. Arizona, last month, Centene was awarded a contract under the Arizona's Medicaid program. We will be providing physical and behavioral healthcare services to recipients in the Central region and Southern region of the state. Centene currently serves beneficiaries in Maricopa county in Southern Arizona. Under this new contract, we will be expanding the number of counties we serve to the Central region. This new program is expected to commence on October 1, 2018 and cover 1.5 million beneficiaries.","Texas; late last year, Texas is one of five managed care plans where Centene was one of five managed care plans, awarded a contract under the CHIP Rural Service Area Program. This contract was set to commence September 1, 2018. However, in April of 2018, the state announced the cancellation of these awards. This was due to an error in the evaluation process. As one of two incumbents, Centene will continue to provide CHIP coverage in this area until new contracts may be awarded. Also on April, Texas released an RFP with Star and CHIP Program. The stage has now included the CHIP RSA program in this RFP. All contracts are scheduled to commence on January 1, 2020.","Pennsylvania; in January, we began serving beneficiaries enrolled in Pennsylvania's new long term care program in the Southwest zone. At quarter's end, we served 22,400 beneficiaries ahead of our expectations. The Southeast zone is set to begin on January of 2019, the remaining zones are scheduled to commence on January 1, 2020. Separately, the appeal of the Pennsylvania TANF contract was awarded has been upheld. The state is in the process of determining the next steps. Whichever path Pennsylvania chooses, we look forward to having the opportunity to demonstrate our value to the state.","Now onto Medicare; in January, we began operating Medicare Advantage in decent [ph] brands in eight new Centene Medicaid states. These plans will launch under our all-well brand. They are still eligible for a premium bonus and to our four-star brand [ph] rating in 2018. At quarter end, we served over 340,000 Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. This represents a year-over-year increase of more than 15,000 members. Upon the close of the Fidelis care transaction; we will also be serving Medicare Advantage members in New York. We remain focused on building a successful Medicare business over the long term. We expect this business to be a significant driver of our annual growth rate.","Next, health insurance marketplace. The marketplace business continues to perform well in the first quarter. Ambetter is the national leader in the health insurance marketplace. We successfully navigated a difficult enrollment environment, we gain market share exceeded of growth targets. We retained 80% of the 2017 exchange members. Additionally, 90% of our total members are paid enrollees surpassing prior years.","At March 31, we served over 1.6 million exchange members, ahead of our initial estimate of $1.3 million. This compares to approximately 1.2 million beneficiaries in the same period last year, representing growth of 35%. It is also important to note that key demographics of these members remain consistent with the comments we made at our December investment. The closing of the Fidelis Care transaction will put us in a position to offer exchange products in 16 states.","Shifting gears to our radar work, we continue to expect composite Medicaid rate adjustment of an increase of approximately 1% for 2018. Separately, CMS recently issued a 2019 Medicare Advance [ph] notice that rates came in better than our expectations.","In conclusion, our strong first quarter financial results set the stage for us to maintain positive momentum through 2018. Centene has been and continues to be a growth company -- whether it's through organic growth or strategic acquisition. We have proven our ability to acquire and effectively integrate acquisition of all sizes. We expect to growth both the top and bottom line by double digit percentages. We anticipate our margins will continue to expand as we maintain our focus on process efficiencies to automation and increasing our scale.","As I've reminded you, our Investor Day is June 15 in New York City. We look forward to seeing you then. We thank you for your continued interest and support of Centene and I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning, I will cover the strong first quarter results and update on the Fidelis acquisition and provide more color on the changes we made to our annual guidance as announced this morning. As Michael mentioned, we had a good start to the year with strong first quarter results led by the growth and performance in our marketplace business, and year-over-year improvements in the performance of our Medicaid business. This more than compensated for the additional flu cost we experienced in the first quarter. I will provide more details on that in a minute.","For the first quarter 2018, total revenues were $13.2 billion, an increase of 13% over 2017 and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2018 were $2.17, an increase of 94% over the last year. The first quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share were driven by membership growth and the associated profitability in the health insurance marketplace business and the benefit of tax reform. Additionally, the first quarter results were approximately $0.12 per diluted share higher than previous expectations due to the lower share count and lower interest expense associated with the delay in the financing for the Fidel's acquisition which was included in our previous guidance on March 1. Let me provide some more details for the quarter.","Total revenues grew by approximately $1.5 billion year-over-year primarily as a result of growth in the health insurance marketplace business, the expansion in new programs in many of our states in 2017 and 2018 including the expansion of the Missouri contract and the Pennsylvania LTSS program and the return of the health insurer fee in 2018. This growth was partially offset by lower revenues in California, associated with the removal of the in-home support services program from managed care.","Moving on to HBR; our health benefits ratio was 84.3% in the first quarter this year, compared to 87.6% in last year's first quarter and 87.3% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The decrease year-over-year is primarily driven by the growth in the marketplace business and the effect of early enrollment compared to the prior year, lower cost in our Medicaid business and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018. This was partially offset by new business which initially operates at a higher HBR and additional flu cost year-over-year of approximately 40 basis points.","Sequentially, the 300 basis point decrease in HBR from the fourth quarter of 2017 is primarily attributable to growth in the marketplace business which seasonally has a lower HBR in the first quarter, the reinstatement of the health insurer fee and additional expense recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the CSRs. This was partially offset by increased flu cost compared to the fourth quarter of 2017.","Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 10.3% in the first quarter this year compared to 9.3% last year and 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2017. The increase in the ratio year-over-year is due to additional cost incurred during the first quarter to service the additional marketplace membership. A sequential decrease is due to increased cost associated with the open enrollment periods for both the Medicare marketplace businesses in the fourth quarter of 2017. This was partially offset by increased variable compensation expense related to earnings performance in the first quarter.","Additionally, we spend $0.05 per diluted share on business expansion cost during the first quarter, which is consistent with the prior year. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 34.1%, compared to 39.7% in the first quarter of 2017. The lowered tax rate was driven by the effect of the income tax reform in 2018, partially offset by the return of the health insurer fee.","Now on to the balance sheet; cash and investments totaled $11.9 billion at quarter end including $452 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Debt at quarter end was $5.2 billion including $675 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.3% excluding our non-recourse mortgage note compared to 43% at Q1 last year and 40.3% at the end of 2017. We continue to focus on deleveraging and consistent with our past practice, we used equity as a significant component to fund various investments and acquisitions completed in the first quarter. Although we increased our borrowings in our revolving credit facility, we ended the first quarter with a debt-to-capital ratio consistent with the year-end.","Our medical claims liability totaled $4.8 million at quarter end and represents 43 days in claims payable compared to 41 days at the end of 2017. The increase in DCP is the result of growth in the marketplace business in the first quarter and the timing of payments. Cash flow provided by operations is $1.8 billion in the first quarter or 5.5x net earnings. Cash flow for the quarter benefited from growth in the claims reserves and the risk adjustment payable associated with the marketplace business. Before we discuss the changes to our 2018 annual guidance, let me spend a few minutes to update you on the Fidelis acquisition.","As Michael mentioned in his comments, we have revised the expected closing date for the Fidelis acquisition from April 1 to July 1, 2018. The integration and synergy planning continues to go well and we expect to hit the ground running. As a result, we expect to achieve half of the $25 million of year one synergies in 2018. Additionally, we continue to expect the transaction to deliver our previously communicated accretion targets. We expect to fund the transaction with approximately $2.3 billion of equity and $1.6 billion of debt. As we have indicated in our earnings release today, we have updated our annual guidance assumptions to reflect the equity and debt financing as of May 1. These are guidance assumptions in the ultimate timing of the debt and equity financing will be subject to market conditions.","Now on to our annual guidance; let me be direct here, there are a lot of updates, so let me give you our perspective. First, we had a good quarter that exceeded our expectations by $0.05 per diluted share after accounting for the timing of the Fidelis debt and equity financing. We have increased our full year GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share expectations by the $0.05. Second, as we stated earlier, Fidelis continues to perform in-line with our expectations and the changes we are making to guidance are the result of the timing of the transaction, the associated financing and the undertakings. The change in adjusted diluted earnings per share is the result of an additional month of overhang on the financing and removing a full quarter of Fidelis earnings. Just to give you some perspective, the Fidelis and the associated financing transactions had been effective January 1, 2018, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance would be $0.35 to $0.40 higher.","Third, we have closed several investments and acquisitions and have included those in our updated guidance. On an adjusted EPS basis, CMG and NHM are accretive transactions for 2018. That accretion is being offset by strategic investments in RX Advance and Interpreta that we believe will drive long-term growth in margin expansion. In aggregate, these transactions are dilutive on a GAAP basis in 2018 due to transaction cost and intangible amortization.","In summary, our updated full-year 2018 guidance for revenue and earnings per share is as follows. Total revenues between $58.2 billion and $59 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $4.36 to $4.70, an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.75 to $7.15. With the seasonality of the marketplace business, we view the second and third quarters being relatively equal from an earnings perspective, with the fourth quarter being lower due to the open enrollment cost for the marketplace in Medicare. We are pleased with the strong performance in the first quarter and the addition of the acquisition in investments we completed that will continue to drive long-term growth in margin expansion.","That concludes my remarks and Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Steve Tanal from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Stephen Tanal","A random one here, just thinking about Medicare Advantage, star scores of '19. In the final call notice, it seemed like they decoupled the audit measures in related penalties in the BAP score. I know that was an issue for you, guys. Just trying to understand whether there was any implications for your '19 rates, star scores or the appeal processes underway?","Michael Neidorff","Well, we have the appealed process still underway and we continue to evaluate the alternatives. The crosswalk et cetera is appropriate, so we see minimizing any impact on the 2019 rates and income.","Stephen Tanal","Got it. So nothing really direct there? Okay. And just to help us wrap our heads around the seasonality of the marketplace, is there any way you could frame or call out the discreet upside the EPS on seasonality in Q1 and then relatedly, what kind of offset we should be thinking about later in the year like the 4Q?","Michael Neidorff","I'll let Jeff go into that.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. A couple of things. I would say first, it's two things in the first quarter. Number one, it's higher membership; and two, a little bit better performance on a year-over-year basis from an HBR perspective. So really, two things driving the phenomenon in the first quarter. I'm not going to get into specifics, but I think I made commentary in the past that marketplaces close to break even by the fourth quarter, so the majority of the earnings are in the first quarter with the fourth quarter really being the offset and it starts to decline from the first quarter to the fourth quarter.","Stephen Tanal","Got it. Just last one for me real quick. July 1 for Fidel, it sounds like you're framing that as maybe a little bit more of conservatism than actual timing given there's only one regulatory approval out there. Is that a fair statement?","Michael Neidorff","I think it's fair to say that we do everything with certain abundance of conservatism, but I want to be realistic. I don't want to end up saying something that is not certainly [ph]. So I think saying no later than July 1 is probably the best way to represent.","Stephen Tanal","Great. Thank you, guys. Appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah James from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead with your question.","Sarah James","Thank you. As I walk through the guidance updates, one of the areas that looked conservative to me was the SG&A and I was hoping maybe you could bridge the changing guidance for us. I know we got some Fidelis payments and strong kicks [ph] growth, but it still just seem pretty conservative, so maybe you can break out some of the investments you spoke about and any other moving pieces? Thanks.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. A couple of things. A lot of the metrics are changing just because of the reblending of the Fidelis. When you move Fidelis out of quarter, we've talked about before that they've had a lower G&A ratio compared to the Centene business as it stands today. So when you adjust for that timing, effectively, it changes all the metrics because of the reblending of the two companies for half a year. I think that's the largest thing going on. Obviously we've talked a little bit about the investments -- some of the investments that we've made this morning as far as transactions and investments that we've already closed. Obviously, those have effects on the ratio as well, but the largest driver is really the reblending of the company when you move Fidelis out of quarter.","Sarah James","Got it. And I think that Florida is expected to be announced today. I know in the past you guys have talked about your IPNs and I'm just wondering if there's any update that you can share with us on Florida?","Michael Neidorff","Stay tuned. The rest of us -- we'll hear hopefully, they do today. There's nothing more to say about that, Sarah. It's just wait and see.","Sarah James","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. I wanted to dive into the guidance a little bit as far as the $0.05 from the quarter out-performance. You guys mentioned flu being up 40 basis points year-over-year, which I guess is about $0.20 out of EPS. I just want to ensure how you were thinking about that $0.05 of out performance in the quarter? Were you already assuming something like 40 basis points from flu, or was that actually better and a little bit of an offset versus how you thought about your guidance?","Michael Neidorff","Jeff, you want to take that?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. I guess, Kevin, the way I'd look at it is the last guidance update we gave was February 6, so we've had indications that flu is a little bit higher. The way we view it is we were $0.05 ahead of our internal forecast and really what I would do is I'd start with the $2.17 and obviously back off the $0.12. It was just mathematics on the movement of the shares and then you have the $0.05 beat that we mentioned. With the commentary we made on February 6 was really that Q1 would be higher than Q2 and it's really driven by the marketplace business and the early enrollment that I mentioned. So I think if you do that, that's the number you will come up with.","Michael Neidorff","We are also ahead on our over the individual estimate on the marketplace, which was a contributor to it. A combination of things, but what we try to say earlier was when you reach the scale we have, the flu is about one line on the medical expense.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. So I think everything to Michael's point is consistent with the commentary that we provided on February 6.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. So what was the actual $0.05 out-performance in the quarter? I guess if you beat by $0.05 per quarter, the thought might be, well, then you raise guidance by $0.20 for the year. Is there something kind of had an offset as you think about the rest of the year?","Michael Neidorff","I'll start and you can pick it up. If you look at it and we said that some of it had to do -- a lot of it with the over performance and the growth of the exchange and we also said that the earnings on the exchange starts to be reduced each quarter, that's just the nature of deductibles and things of that nature, that should help explain it. Jeff, you want to add?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. Again, I'll go back to -- this is $0.05 better than our expectations, not the discreet consensus number. We were always here. I make commentary on February 6 that said effectively, 2018 is going to lay out similar to '17 which would imply something like 54% of the earnings are on the first half of the year and then Q1 was going to be higher than Q2. If you do that math, I think that gets you to where we are right now, which is a kind of $0.05 ahead of expectations and to Michael's point is really driven by performance in the HBR line and the revenue line with the marketplace, and Medicaid and all those things that we've listed in the press release.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. I guess any color on Fidelis' actual performance so far? Any updates there?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. I made comments in my prepared remarks that they're in-line with expectations. So I think they continue to perform well and really all that we're talking about this morning is really out-performancing Q1 and the rest is really just timing of the transaction closing.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thank you.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Newshel from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Newshel","Thanks. So now that you have some of the claims experiences or any change on how you're viewing exchange margins for the full year? It sounds like in the first quarter, at least that it's starting out a little bit higher than what you thought. And also since now you're developing rates for 2019, do you have any initial commentary there on what you're going to make into rates and whether you're going to have a consistent footprint, or expand or shrink?","Michael Neidorff","I'll start and let Jeff pick up. But I think when we talk about the first quarter marketplace, I'll remind you that we had an increasing moment over our original expectations and we tend not to get too much into '19 until we do guidance in December of the year. It's kind of early that we're talking about expectations in the way we do business on the marketplace. Jeff, anything?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","I think Michael is right. It's really volume-driven. You'll notice in our filings we do have some minimal MLR payables. To some extent, we're projecting a full-year margin and that's what we're recording to.","Michael Newshel","And what's your booking on risk adjustment? Is that consistent with what you did in prior years? Are you still on net payer on risk adjustment?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. We're net payer, but obviously the volume has grown because of the increase in the size of the business.","Michael Newshel","Got it. Anything that recently happened on the policy front that changes any of your thinking on whether you might participate in 2019 if the administration try to put some restrictions on several loading or anything like that. Would that change your approach at all? Or you'll take any changes and you can fully expect to participate?","Michael Neidorff","Kevin?","Kevin Counihan","I think there's a couple of things. We number one, think that regular changes are going to be made via regulation as Michael said; number two is that the state flexibility that exist in the payment notice we think actually could be a positive to us because it's just that we've been a payer, so stay flexibility in that regard may actually help us lower MOR. There's obviously going to be a positive. There are a number of things in the payment notice that we're encouraged by.","Michael Neidorff","I might also add, mind you that were very decentralized, so we're really structured to work on a state-by-state basis and we see that as a plus.","Michael Newshel","Got it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Windley from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Dave Windley","All right. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to understand some of the pennies of movement here in the Fidelis' timing. I think when you last updated us and pushed the timing from February to March, that was a $0.06 change and then the loss or the push from March out of the quarter is a $0.12 change, and then you're funding two months ahead of when you anticipated to close in the second quarter. So first, what's the difference between the $0.06 and the $0.12 and then secondly, just for the full year, how much should we think about 2018? How much drag is 2018 caring that will then not be present in 2019? Thanks.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","A couple of things. The $0.12 you're mentioning is Q1. Right? The $0.12?","Dave Windley","Well, I think you said in your prepared remarks that the $0.12 upside in the quarter was the result of delay from March 1?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. That's $0.12 for Q1. That would not be the case for the full year because the first quarter share count, it would be one-third of the total shares for the quarter versus on the full year, it gets diluted by the full year share count. So the $0.12 is not the number for the full year, it's really the Q1 number. That's a little bit different there. What we've done is we've packaged up all of the movement of Fidelis into one line item. We have assumed the offerings in March, we're moving those to May, the transaction closing April, we're moving that to July. That is all encapsulated in the $0.25 that's in the adjusted diluted EPS range.","Dave Windley","Yes. Is it possible to give me what the advanced funding -- the two months of advanced funding is?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. The overhang? Sure.","Dave Windley","Definitely.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. The overhang is between $0.10 to $0.12 for sure.","Dave Windley","Okay. Thank you for that. The second question. On Medicare Advantage, Michael, what would you describe to us as your learnings from the annual enrollment period this year in your positioning? It looks like your membership pick up was scattered across your various new entry states and I guess I'm curious about how that influences your competitive positioning and your desire for that to be a substantial driver of growth going forward.","Michael Neidorff","I think one of these we've -- pick up with me -- but we will be adjusted our marketing approach as much as anything, how we go at the open enrollment period. So it's more the direct approach to the consumer that we'll fine-tune and we expect to see continued improved results from.","Dave Windley","Okay, thank you.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Borsch from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Matthew Borsch","Yes. Thank you. If I could ask about a different topic. Just give us your assessment of the group commercial market as you come into this year. I realized a lot of that or the vast majority is in California, but just like to hear what your update is on price competition in medical cost trends? Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Sure. I think we've stated we're committed to the commercial business intel frame we acquire and we believe it's going to perform very well for us, continue to grow it. Personally, I was involved when they were doing some renewal work and they have a good product that's very well-received out there. As I think about it and I'm just giving you as candid of statement as I can, over time there may be additional opportunities working with state governments and things that is not just pure commercial assessment work, government-related. We're talking about that kind of thing. We believe it is good learning coming out of the California model and as time and energy permits, we'll consider alternatives to how it might be expanded.","Matthew Borsch","Okay, thank you. If I could ask just on a different area of business on the individual. Can you just talk about retention rate on ACA numbers or have you seen anything that might indicate that there's less retention this year as opposed to last year? Whether it's for any real reason or just did the awareness that the individual mandate is going away?","Michael Neidorff","I think we're not seeing that. I'll let Kevin give you more details.","Kevin Counihan","Good morning. We actually have not experienced that. Our persistency rate is remaining at 80% which is above the national average, by the way. We're actually encouraged by that. What we're also particularly encouraged by is our effectuation rate. It's at 90%, which is about 10% higher than it was a year ago. That's something, which is you know is very critical in terms of predicting future retention. We're encouraged by what we're seeing. Now with respect to the individual mandate, it's kind of an interesting question because when I was at CMS, I never really thought the individual mandate was all that powerful and I'll tell you why. Because number one, the dollar value for the penalty was not that significant particularly compared to premium; and number two is there were so many opportunities for people to appeal. Whether it was for affordability, for college education, for religious purposes and others. So I think in a way, the new mandate is actually higher healthcare cost. I think people want to have insurance coverage, they want to protect themselves and their families. And I think we've seen with the enrollment going to 2018 how attractive these products are.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Kevin.","Matthew Borsch","Thank you for all that.","Operator","Our next question comes from A. J. Rice from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","A. J. Rice","First question. Obviously the industry backdrop around pharmacy benefit is really evolving and you made an investment at RX Advance. I know you have your own PBM and you have legacy health net relationship with CBS. Can you just give us any thoughts that you have on updated thinking around pharmacy benefit and light up what you're doing and what the industry is doing?","Michael Neidorff","I'll just give you an open comment and Jeff's either comment -- he's been doing most of work to this point from the M&A perspective. But we see this as really the modernization and the direction that pharmacy benefits needs to go. I'll let you pick it up.","Kevin Counihan","Yes, AJ. A complicated number of moving parts with respect to the topic, but I think the starting point as -- you know, because I think you've see a lot from an industry perspective is some things need to change from the PBM model if you will and I think there's a couple of dimension to that that are both tied into our investment in RX Advance. One is just the underlying technology opportunity for automation, cloud, et cetera and that brings both administrative cost efficiencies that I think are important, number one, but it also improves the overall quality and experience and the ability to connect the interoperability of systems across in our case the payer landscape. But the other thing which I think is increasingly important is everybody understands that the benefit of having an internalized capability with respect to pharmacy management, how that ties to physical health and behavioral and the like, as you all know, we've been very focused on that from the beginning. I think what we see now is the ability to marry the technology, marry the scale benefits that exists, but also implement some new operating models. In particular the relationship for total cost of care and moving towards a value-based arrangement in pharmacy that has not existed in the past. I think that will address some of the transparency concerns that has been embedded n the industry for a long time.","A. J. Rice","Okay, great. Maybe one other follow up. You guys have done great at expanding your health marketplace enrollment and now you're the largest player in the marketplace, I think nationwide with more than 10% of the market. As you've gotten these additional members that are maybe earlier in the year to figure this out. But if you go ahead to make adjustments to your traditional provider networks because you're now picking up people that are outside of those geographies, a one metric I know you might measure that is out of network claims and so forth. Any update on thinking around those issues?","Michael Neidorff","I'll just leave a comment. I was thinking about traditional network and do we deserve that support and that's the network, our recipient's wish. We've of course had to expand it with the increasing membership. But i.e. that's not a strategic change there.","A. J. Rice","Okay. Any thought about the -- so that network expansion, you're not seeing a lot of other network claims, or is it too early in the year to know whether you will?","Michael Neidorff","I would say that it's pretty consistent with our historic experience. Any time we see that is if we had a deficiency, just including the total increase in some of the markets. We need to expand the network and there's a lot of energy being put to getting that network expanded. We're going to stick to our 'knitting', so to speak, to use the old clich\u00e9 and we stick to 400% of federal property level below and the majority is up 250% of the federal property level below and that's our market, we're not trying to be all things to all people.","A. J. Rice","Okay, all right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Peter Costa","Good morning. Looking back to the annual guidance again and sort of where the different numbers are, I'm just trying to understand a couple of different aspects of it. First, you said if you had filled that else for the whole year your earnings would be $0.35 to $0.40 higher. Yet, you adjusted for the delay of potentially a quarter your earnings by $0.25. You took out more for the quarter. Then your share price is about 20% higher than when you announced the deal. So in theory, the Fidelis Care is actually more accretive than it was before. And then you mentioned the out-performance that you had in the quarter being $0.05, but you didn't raised the guidance for the full year by anything more than what it was in the Q1 performance despite some of the cost in flu being overcome. I'm just trying to understand why your numbers are so conservative? Is there something with Fidelis that is not performing or some changes from the conversion that you had not considered before that makes that deal less attractive?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","There is a lot in that question but I'll start at the beginning here. So the $0.25, you have to remember that includes another month of overhang, right, on -- compared to last guidance that includes another month of both shares and the debt overhang. So that number is probably larger than what you're expecting just because of the additional month of overhang. My second point would be; I'd go to my prepared remarks, I think Fidelis is performing exactly what we expected, so -- and I reiterated the accretion targets there. As far as the share price, we have updated -- I would say both two things, compared to when we announced this transaction in September of last year, both a share price and interest expense. So bond rates have moved against this, the share price has moved in our favor. I would tell you we have what we believe are relatively conservative expectations but we haven't raised the capital sitting here today.","Michael Neidorff","I think that chapter -- it is a very important point. Until it's done, it's not done so you want to be conservative to see what's in, how those numbers come out.","Peter Costa","And in terms of the synergies from Fidelis Care, you talked about $100 million, is that still the number that you're thinking about or is that improved having multiple [ph] business?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","We said $25 million in the first year. I made a comment today that we're on target to get half of that in 2018. We did say $100 million in year two, we've always targeted a higher level of synergies but we felt comfortable with the $100 million and that's where we are today.","Michael Neidorff","I think what's really important is that every aspect of the deal has been very consistent and we're not seeing any changes in the original assumptions we made, the management is as strong as we believe today, so has engaged us. We believe they were -- they have managed through the delay incredibly well, so it's a very strong team. The regulatory is in New York, we find just very -- we are very good at work with MOL [ph], they are very professional in all the things they do, their approach to it and we'll just see every aspect of the Fidelis deal being a positive one.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Joshua Raskin","Good morning, I'm just going to beat the Fidelis horse one more time. No impact in the first quarter, obviously second quarter sounds like it's $0.12 dilutive at this point just from the financing overhang with no operations. What's the Fidelis impact on the second half? I'm just trying to figure it's just an accretive deal for 2018.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes, we've had this conversation before. I think if you go back to the numbers that we said today where if we had Fidelis for a full year, right, you would be increasing $0.35 to $0.40. So if you just do that math, I think -- and then assume mid to up or single digit accretion as we've said, it is an accretive deal for the year. So, and we're picking up half of that accretion in 2018.","Joshua Raskin","Okay, got it. And then the second question, just -- you guys mentioned obviously a much better MLR in the quarter and a lot of that was the marketplace but you did say there were some Medicaid MLR improvement; I'm just curious were there any specific states or geographies, any segments, any specific drivers of that Medicaid MLR that was better?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes, I think we saw improvement really driven by network and unit cost initiatives in addition to medical management. We did have some states that had favorable pay for performance metrics, certain part percentages of our contracts are at risk based on meeting usually quality and performance metrics and some of those came in favorable which we're pleased about. So overall it was -- it crossed the board, I would say generally a good performance in the Medicaid business.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. So those are 2017 performance metrics that get paid in the first quarter, so that's the idea that maybe part of the reason you're not expecting some of this to recur the rest of the year?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes, there is actually two things. Number one, it's -- some of those are 2017 metrics but it also changes your opinions on 2018 as well, right. Meaning, if you meet the metric in a previous year then you have more confidence that you'll meet the metric in the future year as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Justin Lake","Couple of things; first, on the pricing side. Going into 2019 on the exchanges, obviously you're doing well and even better than expected. There has been some chatter and you can just look at the results, I mean the not-for-profits have been doing pretty well. They all got tax benefits just like you did and they are probably going to price some of it back and specifically even some of the public comments they have made indicates that maybe a larger percentage of that pricing is going to come in the individual, the exchange market. I'm just curious in terms of your view of how competitive they are today and if they do get more competitive from RO [ph], is that something you need to consider from a market share or pricing perspective for 2018 or do you feel like you're just so positively differentiated that even if they were to come price a little bit lower that you still keep your share in your margins?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","I mean, I think as we mentioned before we're not going to get into the details of 2019 pricing but I think all of those factors are factors that we would take into account when we're looking at the competitive dynamics of the marketplace business and what our goals and objectives are for 2019.","Michael Neidorff","I think also, when you -- some of the systems and the [indiscernible] we have, it's -- it helps as we said, it's going to help drive cost in the right direction in '19 and forward. So I think we'll continue to be very competitive in all our products going forward.","Justin Lake","I mean could you give us an update I think at your Investor Day last you had said, you're above that 5% margin; I think people came away thinking 6% or 7%. And on exchanges for 2018, is there -- now it sounds like it's better. Can you help us with that?","Michael Neidorff","I think we just want to be consistent and say it's at the high end of our range.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Justin, remember what we said was that the full year expectations aren't really any different here than what I would have communicated on February 6. We saw a little bit better performance in the first quarter but ultimately for the full year we think we're going to be consistent with what we previously communicated.","Justin Lake","Got it. And then just a follow-up on Fidelis, Michael, during your prepared comments, you're pretty definitive that the deal will close by July 1 and your new guidance assumes the equity and the debt are basically done by this time next week. So just given your apparent increase certainty on the deal close, what should we assume on the equity issuance here on terms of timing?","Michael Neidorff","I think -- Jeff can add to it. We said it's going to be a lot dependant on the market conditions and if market conditions continue to be strong we will move forward with the equity deal. So let's not pre-suppose the whole lot and pre-save something because once again, we know we have a very vulnerable market, not only with us, it's just the total environment we're in. So if you advise us, if you probably say take a little bit more time [ph] and make your decision based on that. If it's a strong market, we can go out; if it's uncertainty because of some global condition or something, then we'll -- well, we have time and we'll be patient and do it when it's the right time to do it. We're not -- we always talked about how -- it's not how fast but how well you do, so you know that, we've talked about that Justin. So I'm not going to pre-state -- I like to do it as soon as reasonable.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Obviously we had to pick a date for guidance in order to revise the guidance, right; so that's what that date reflects. As Michael indicated, I think it's going to be based on market conditions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes from Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Lance Wilkes","I've just got a question on the vertical integration strategy and a deal obviously that you did. I was interested in understanding kind of what your value proposition is in owning clinics or care centers and certain markets is more about access or the alignment of interest kind of value based approach there? And then also -- what percent of your Medicaid business today uses an urgent care clinic or retail clinic as it's primary care provider?","Michael Neidorff","I think one of the -- what we try to say is this gives us an opportunity where we see access more limited, I'm not going to go into specific markets and tip that hammer door or some where access is more limited. We see this as having a scalability and capability to expand in some of those markets and they have a capability to do it with reasonable dispatch was necessary; so that's very important. The use of urgent care is somewhat limited in our approach. We like individuals that have a primary care, we encourage adding and push that; so we think that's very important. We have a quality committee that we work with former deans in medical schools and deans of public health and they are consistent with urgent care and urgent clinics are intended to be just that, an episodic type. And we have one here at our own facility for employees and it's -- if you go in there without a primary care for that physician, when you come out you will have one. So that's pretty much the approach that we follow in that.","Lance Wilkes","Got you. And as you're thinking about the strategy beyond that one transaction going forward and you're thinking of potential partnerships with pharmacies or retailers are getting into retail clinics or things like that, do you see that as being more episodic as well or do you see that as potentially transforming into something that could replace primary care?","Michael Neidorff","I don't see it replacing primary care. I think -- so as we work, we do have very close relationship, we have a lot of confidence in this very qualified health centers. We work with them, with one clinic we've setup in St. Louis, it's staff and some of the nurses, so if they see something that needs a physician, they have the access to it to immediately refer it to that physician group. So we have a very strong belief and support in the primary care physicians and helping them to be more successful with assistance in capabilities and we're putting more and more emphasis on that than trying to support these more transitory operations; there is a place for it [indiscernible] if there is -- if someone has a cold or something minor, that's great, use it once but you should have your own doctor you can call. We want our recipients [ph] treated the way our children have been treated; you know, you call your pediatrician and take his advice.","Lance Wilkes","And just one follow-up question would be, as you're looking at the Medicaid enrollment kind of market-by-market and contract-by-contract; how are you seeing the improving economy impacting kind of in-market growth or shrink? Just interested in that and if it varies, not just by geography but by -- kind of product type there?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, I think that what we have found is that with economic environment we continue to have a fairly stable situation. States will consider increase in coverage if their budgets become strong or they just need healthcare, and when we're working with the Congress and other we're encouraging that either marketplace be expanded to allow for individuals that are working so that individuals start to learn how to use an insurance system. So I mean there is some public policy issues that play there that allow us to be fairly consistent.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen [ph] from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","So just from the four recent smaller acquisitions that closed in March\/April; I think you mentioned that two are accretive, two are dilutive. Just curious, if that was always your expectation around those deals or perhaps anything -- did any trends change within any of those, after closing there was any different than your prior expectation?","Michael Neidorff","I would say, we recognized that in some of the system opportunities that they -- they have a clear benefits and payout in the very near future. But when you close the mid-year, we're saying that in the impact on '18 but now everything we do is very precise navigated [ph]. We don't receive surprises, we see a surprise we dodge in things upto the point that the wire is sent and the money is in the other persons bank.","Unidentified Analyst","One or two other quick ones, I'm not sure if you'd quantify this or not; are you -- any chance you're able to quantify how much of the return of the health insurer fee improved the medical benefits ratio in 1Q '18?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","I think it's only the component that's in premium revenue; so I think it's roughly between 20 to 30 basis points, something like that.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. Maybe just a final quick one; you mentioned you still expect medical cost inflation to remain in lower single digits, is there any high level color you can provide just on 1Q trends and some of the bigger cost categories within that, whether it's in-patient, out-patient or pharmacy or physician, just any high level trends?","Michael Neidorff","As we've said, it's been very stable.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, fair enough. Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Zack Sopcak from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Zack Sopcak","I'm wondering if first quarter you saw anything unusual in your pharmacy utilization? Eli Lily this morning lowered their -- sorry, increased their guidance based on expected lower Medicaid utilization for this quarter normally end of the year. Have you seen anything along those lines?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","No, I mean the only thing we did see obviously was the flu. So flu costs were higher than let's say average, so we did see higher drug spent on the flu side.","Michael Neidorff","And then, I'll remind you that some of these new systems that we're putting in place now would mitigate in the upward trend.","Zack Sopcak","Got it, understood. One of the question and back on your success in the marketplace, given the shorter enrollment period and more of the investment into marketing came from you instead of -- from the government. Any major learnings that you think will help as you go into the next enrollment period for next year?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, I think what the total is, we were wise to anticipate that we would have to pick up that frac and we did; it was the right benefit, we were able to enroll people directly and due to the things that -- in fact, we had a bigger response and it includes overwhelmed in the enrollment system. So if anything we've learned from these, be prepared for more upside than what we expected going forward. I mean, is this a high satisfaction as far as Kevin talked about, our retention rate at 80% year-over-year; that's pretty good for any kind of commercial product that's out there. So it says that some things were being done right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Gary Taylor","Just a couple of quick ones. On the tax rate change, you didn't talk about that and why there was an impact to EPS; is that just sort of churning [ph] up or reconciling that that hits non-deductibility, is that why the tax rate guidance went up a little bit?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","No. Again, the tax rate guidance went up because of the reblending of Fidelis. So in New York, they pay a premium tax versus the state income tax; so if you take the post-tax reform, they would need a much lower rate than the Centene average. So when you reblend the year after moving Fidelis a quarter, the rate goes up.","Gary Taylor","Got it. On the exchange business, what's a good estimate of full year G&A load in that business? Is that as high as 15%?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes, that's a pretty good number, that's close.","Gary Taylor","Okay. And then last question on Fidelis G&A which is materially lower than your corporate average, can you just remind us why that's the case? And I don't think given the synergy\u2026","Michael Neidorff","I will start a little bit there. Some of the benefit plans are different -- benefit, competition, structures, things of that nature can be impacted by.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","I think the other thing is that as we've planned the acquisition, we've looked at actually investing more G&A dollars there to really get medical management savings and I think we've mentioned that at the beginning of the transaction that things like payment integrity, fraud ways and abuse; all the analytic capabilities that we have here that we can support them with case management system, etcetera, etcetera. We think more of the opportunity is in medical expense versus G&A.","Operator","And our final question today comes from Ana Gupte from Leerink Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Ana Gupte","The first question was on involve, I wanted to get a sense for how much you're actively marketing that Fide services outside obviously are growing quite remarkably as you're rolling up the acquisitions helpnet and then in the future Fidelis? But is that also targeted more beyond inside?","Kevin Counihan","So our -- we're actually going through a strategic planning process uninvolved at present. One of the things that we want to do is make sure that those products are refreshed in a way that reflect the opportunities of the marketplace. Let me just give you an example; so one of the things that we're looking at is whether our EAP Program can be reconfigured in a way to support social determinants in a way to get software they could actually have one of our members call in and be able to be directed to a housing shelter if they need shelter for that night or a food bank if they need access to food or other kinds of things. So our real focus right now is making sure that the involved suite is meeting the needs of the current market.","Ana Gupte","Off your current internal market, in other words?","Kevin Counihan","Correct.","Ana Gupte","Okay, all right. Secondly, as you know, the growth is coming on both on involve as well as the base business that's all the roll ups; to what degrees there are more wide space on for profit conversions like you saw in Fidelis in New York, are there others elsewhere?","Michael Neidorff","I think whether they are out there and I'm not going to talk too much about where we're going and how we're going and for obvious competitive reasons.","Ana Gupte","Okay, all right. And then finally, on the worker requirements, it looks like Virginia is on the brink of Medicaid expansion. What are your thoughts about you hearing around Florida or any of the other\u2026","Michael Neidorff","We're very supportive of the work requirements back when [indiscernible] was governor of -- Indiana was installed and we were very supportive there helping to how to do it. And I remind you it's childless adults who don't have physical disabilities and we think that's good public policy, we will work very diligently with the seats [ph] who want to do it to implement it in a very responsible way.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, at this time we'll conclude today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference call back over to Mr. Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael Neidorff","I just want to thank everybody. As we said, it's -- this quarter had a lot of moving parts because of Fidelis and different issues but it was a solid quarter, it was a stronger quarter, we eventually had anticipated, we planned forward, we're pleased with that. We're pleased with what how the safety use is going to unfold and looking forward to another very strong year. So, we thank you and look forward to talk to you in subsequent calls. Have a good day. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, today's conference has now concluded. We do thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines."],"4345":["Centene Corp.

Finally, a reminder that our next Investor Day will be Friday, June 16, 2017, in New York City.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining Centene's first quarter 2017 earnings call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our first quarter financial results and provide update on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will provide commentary around the changing healthcare regulatory landscape. Please note that we will have a hard stop at 9:45 as we have our annual meeting at 10:00. Ideally, we'll be done by 9:30, but there is a hard stop at 9:45.","I would like to begin with the healthcare regulatory landscape. The repeal and replace discussion currently underway in Washington, D.C. has created headline volatility. I think it is important to keep in mind this particular legislative process is very complicated. It will likely take some time to play out if a final bill is signed into law and I emphasize it. I would like to go through how this process may unfold, in the hope that understanding all the variables will minimize one statement creating volatility.","First, the bill must be approved by the House. This is proven to be difficult due to the various constituencies within the House, all of whom have their reasons for what they would like to have in the bill. These include: the Freedom Caucus, a group of conservative Republicans in the House, who want a complete repeal of the ACA; secondly, the Tuesday Group, a group of moderate Republicans who are opposed to a simple repeal of the ACA. They would prefer to see more modest changes and maintain aspects of the ACA, such as subsidies for low income in vulnerable populations and maintaining the current language for pre-existing conditions. And then, the Democrats, who are opposed to the ACA being repealed and replaced, and instead support certain fixes to the current law.","For the process to move forward, any bill will need a simple majority to pass the House. The bill would then move to the Senate, where the Republican majority is thinner. Additionally, any bill that passes the House will undergo a full Byrd Rule scrub in the Senate. The Senate parliamentarian will have to determine if any of the House provisionings need to be taken out of the House proposal because they do not affect the budget.","If the Senate parliamentarian deems too many of the provisions in the House are in violation of the Byrd Rule, the entire bill could lose its reconciliation status. In either instances, 60 votes would then be needed to pass the bill. As the House tries to navigate a bill that could reach agreement with a more conservative leaning caucus, the Senate would encounter a different challenge.","20 Republican senators come from states that expanded Medicaid, and 16 Medicaid expansion states have Republican governors. We are confident any bill that could ultimately pass would increase state's flexibility, would include Medicaid reforms that would moderate from the current House proposal. And any changes in the Senate in regards to marketplace would only enhance what we believe have been positive development in the House bill; for example, giving states additional funds to make healthcare more affordable for those between 100% and 300% of the federal poverty level.","Whether the ACA remains the law of the land or a repeal and replace bill comes to fruition, Centene is well-positioned. Regarding Medicaid, any changes that give additional flexibility to the states aligns nicely with Centene's local decentralized approach. As to exchanges, we see nothing at this point to prevent us from proceeding with our 2018 marketplace participation.","We believe there is bipartisan support for cost-sharing reductions, CSRs. We were pleased that the administration asked the court to keep the CSR payment litigation on hold this past February. We are aware that both parties are currently discussing CSRs and their inclusion in the continuing resolution, which needs to be passed by the end of the month.","Lastly, Centene has demonstrated our agility and capacity to successfully navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.","I understand it is easy to get caught up in the constant noise. However, I believe that it's time to move past the unfounded headline volatility. In the meantime, it's business as usual for Centene. We will continue to focus on fundamentals as evidenced by our strong first quarter results.","Now, on the first quarter financials. We're pleased to begin 2017 with a very strong first quarter, marked by solid top and bottom line growth and robust operating cash flows. Membership at quarter end was 12.1 million members, representing an increase of over 600,000 beneficiaries compared to the first quarter of 2016.","First quarter revenues increased almost 70% year-over-year to $11.7 billion. This was primarily attributable to the closing of the Health Net acquisition.","The first quarter HBR improved 110 basis points year-over-year to 87.6%. This was mainly related to the addition of Health Net as well as growth in Centene's marketplace business. We reported adjusted first quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.12 compared to $0.74 in the same period last year, representing growth of approximately 51%.","A quick comment on medical costs including flu. We saw an uptick in flu during the first quarter. The flu appears to have peaked in early March. Overall flu costs were higher than last year and at the high end of a normal flu range. Importantly, we continue to see as well as anticipate overall stable medical cost trends consistent with our expectations in the low single-digits.","Next, the Health Net integration. March 24 marks Centene's first full year operating as a combined company with Health Net. Health Net has been successfully integrated from a cultural leadership, human resource and financial assistance standpoint. We are achieving our synergy targets in realizing the benefits of greater scale and product diversity.","The claims systems is in the process of being converted to Centene's. We expect the remaining core platform conversions to be completed over the next 12 to 18 months. I'll remind everyone, it's not how fast but how well. We were pleased with the results of the integration and will focus on the combined business on our earnings call going forward.","Moving on to market and product updates. First, we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity. Nebraska, Q1 marks Centene's first quarter operating under Nebraska's new Medicaid program. The contract is performing in line with our expectations. And at quarter end, we served over 79,000 beneficiaries in the state.","A quick note on Centene's pending Medicaid contract start date. The Missouri Medicaid statewide expansion contract is expected to begin May 1, 2017. The Nevada Medicaid contract is expected to commence on July 1 of 2017. The Pennsylvania Medicaid contract is now anticipated to go live January 1, 2018. And the Pennsylvania long-term contract is expected to begin January 1, 2018.","Next, Medicare. At quarter end, we served over 328,000 Medicare and Dual beneficiaries. Q1 was our first quarter operating Medicare Advantage Plans in Centene's Medicaid states. On January 1, we launched MA Plans in Texas, Georgia, Mississippi and Florida under our four-star parent rate.","As I previously stated, we are applying a test-and-learn approach to our first year of MA operations, similar to Centene's initial launch of our exchange product in 2014. Also similar to our exchange approach, we will be focusing on providing high quality affordable MA products to low income beneficiaries.","We will be applying the insights we gain this year with respect to network, plan design and benefits to Centene's 2018 MA Plans. Overall, we expect our Medicare Advantage business to be profitable in 2017.","Now on to Health Insurance Marketplaces. At March 31, we served approximately 1.2 million exchange members. This represents year-over-year growth of over 500,000 beneficiaries, slightly ahead of our expectations. Please note, approximately 80% of our 2016 exchange members renewed their plans for 2017.","It is also important to note the key demographics of these members, including age, gender, financial assistance and metal tier are consistent with our experience over the past three years.","Over 90% of our exchange members are subsidy eligible and over 90% are enrolled in silver tier plans. This includes Maricopa County, Arizona, where Centene is the sole exchange provider. This highlights Centene's continued success in attracting and maintaining our targeted customer segment through effective sales, marketing and member engagement activities.","We continue to closely monitor claims utilization patterns. Thus far, in 2017, we have seen no evidence of unanticipated utilization levels. This, along with the higher than expected membership, allowed us to recognize $0.04 of the $0.20 of conservatism that we included in our initial annual guidance. As it is still early in the year, we continue to feel it is prudent to include the extra level of conservatism in our guidance related to the business. Jeff will provide further details on this in his prepared remarks.","Shifting gears to the rate outlook. We continue to expect 2017 composite Medicaid rate adjustments of zero to 1%, consistent with the past few years. Separately, CMS recently issued the final 2018 Medicare Advantage rates. They are slightly better than the preliminary rates released earlier this year.","In summary, our strong first quarter financial results set the stage for us to maintain our positive momentum throughout the remainder of 2017. We continue to realize the full benefits of the Health Net acquisition, including those products new to Centene which will drive future growth and greater scale in 2017 and beyond. We are optimistic about our future and ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government sponsored healthcare.","As a reminder, our Investor Day is on June 16 in New York City. We look forward to seeing you then. We thank you for your continued interest in Centene.","Jeff will now provide further details on our first quarter financial results.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Earlier this morning, we reported strong first quarter 2017 results. Total revenues were $11.7 billion, an increase of 69% over the first quarter 2016 and GAAP diluted earnings per share were $0.79. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.12 compared to $0.74 last year.","As highlighted in our press release issued this morning, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter excludes the following items. Amortization of acquired intangible assets, the acquisition costs associated with the Health Net transaction, and the Penn Treaty guaranty association assessment expense of $0.17 per diluted share.","In March 2017, a state court issued final liquidation orders with respect to the long-term care insurer Penn Treaty Network America Insurance Company and its subsidiary.","Under state guaranty association laws, certain insurance companies can be assessed for obligations to policyholders of insolvent insurance companies that write the same or similar lines of business. A small portion of our healthcare insurance, primarily associated with the legacy Health Net business, is written under life and health insurance licenses versus HMO licenses.","As a result and in accordance with the liquidation order, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $47 million during the first quarter, representing our estimated share of the guaranty association assessments as selling, general and administrative costs. I would like to note that this represents an undiscounted amount as the timing and payment is uncertain.","Now to provide more details in the quarter. Total revenues grew by $4.8 billion year-over-year, primarily as a result of the Health Net acquisition which closed on March 24, 2016, growth in the health insurance marketplace business, the start up of our Nebraska health plan on January 1, 2017; and the start up of the Texas STAR Kids Program in November 2016.","Sequentially, while premium and service revenues increased, total revenues for the first quarter were lower than the fourth quarter of 2016. The decrease in total revenues was driven by the health insurer fee moratorium which suspended the health insurers' provider fee for the 2017 calendar year. Additionally, the fourth quarter of last year benefited from $500 million of additional revenue associated with pass-through payments from the state of California and $195 million of additional revenue associated with the minimum MLR amendments in California. These sequential total revenue decreases were partially offset by the growth previously mentioned.","Moving on to HBR. Our health benefits ratio was 87.6% in the first quarter this year compared to 88.7% in last year's first quarter and 84.8% in the fourth quarter. The decrease year-over-year is driven by the acquisition of Health Net which operates at a lower HBR due to a higher mix of commercial business and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2017.","Sequentially, the 280-basis point increase from the fourth quarter is primarily the effect of the additional revenue due to the retroactive change in the minimum MLR calculation under California's Medicaid expansion program recorded in the fourth quarter of 2016. HBR also increased sequentially due to an increase in flu-related costs over the fourth quarter.","The Health Insurance Marketplace business continues to perform well. We ended the first quarter with approximately 1.2 million members which is above our initial expectations. As we have stated previously, the metal tiers enrolled, demographics and profiles of our members are consistent with prior years and our expectations. We continue to be prudent and conservative with respect to our expectations of our marketplace margins. However, the performance of the 2017 Marketplace business in the first quarter contributed approximately $0.04 per diluted share of the $0.20 per diluted share conservatism we originally included in our annual guidance.","This was driven by higher than expected membership and utilization that was consistent with our historical experience. We continue to monitor claims experience and membership behavior. And as it is early in the year, we believe it is appropriate to maintain the remaining conservatism.","Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 9.3% in Q1 this year, excluding the Health Net merger cost and the Penn Treaty assessment, compared to 8.3% last year and 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2016, also excluding the Health Net merger cost. The increase in the ratio as compared to the prior year is primarily due to the acquisition of Health Net which operates at a higher SG&A ratio due to the higher mix of commercial and Medicare business.","The decrease in the ratio from the fourth quarter of 2016 is due to a higher level of seasonal costs related to the open enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace business and a charitable contribution to our foundation recorded in the fourth quarter of last year. Excluding Health Net merger costs, business expansion cost of $0.05 were incurred in the first quarter of 2017.","Interest expense was $62 million in the first quarter compared to $33 million in the first quarter of 2016 and $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase year-over-year is due to the financing associated with the Health Net transaction. Sequentially, the decrease is due to the costs incurred for the early redemption of the Centene and legacy Health Net senior notes in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Our effective income tax rate was 39.7% in the first quarter of 2017. The lower tax rate compared to the prior year and quarter is due to the one year moratorium on the health insurer fee.","Now on to the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled almost $10.3 billion at quarter end, including $306 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Debt on March 31 was $4.6 billion, including $100 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 43%, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note compared to 43.7% at last year end. We continue to focus on leverage reduction and have reduced our debt-to-capital ratio, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note, by approximately 130 basis points since the Health Net acquisition.","Our medical claims liabilities totaled $4.3 billion at March 31 and represents 41 days in claims payable compared to 42 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $1.2 billion in the first quarter. Operating cash flows for the first quarter benefited from increased medical claims liabilities due to market expansions in Nebraska and growth in the Marketplace business and payments received from Medicare in March 31 that related to April services.","Turning to guidance. Our updated full year 2017 guidance numbers are as follows. Total revenues between $46 billion and $46.8 billion, HBR ratio of 87% to 87.5%, and SG&A expense ratio of 9.1% to 9.6%, adjusted SG&A expense ratio of 9% to 9.5%, GAAP EPS of $3.74 to $4.15, adjusted diluted EPS of $4.50 to $4.90, effective tax rate between 39% and 41%, and diluted shares outstanding between 176.9 million and 177.9 million.","We have updated our SG&A expense ratio and our GAAP diluted EPS to reflect the effect of the Penn Treaty assessment expense. For GAAP diluted earnings per share, the assessment expense was partially offset by an increase for the first quarter performance and a narrowing of the guidance range. We have increased our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range for the year by $0.07 at the midpoint and narrowed the range to $0.40, reflecting the results from the first quarter.","As previously discussed, we estimate that the 2017 Marketplace business contributed $0.04 to the $0.20 of conservatism we included in our 2017 annual guidance. As a result, we continue to maintain $0.16 of conservatism in our annual GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance for the 2017 Marketplace margins.","Additionally, our earnings are expected to be more heavily weighted to the first three quarters of the year due to the following changes. First, the delay of the start date of the Pennsylvania contract from the second quarter of 2017 to January 1, 2018. The shifting of the start date pushes the start up costs into the fourth quarter compared to our previous guidance.","Second, the shortening of the open enrollment period for the Marketplace business which compresses all the open enrollment costs into fourth quarter. And third, our subsidiary, Alabama Healthcare Advantage, ended its agreement as a capital contributor that would've allowed for the company to move forward with this relationship with the five regional care RCOs in Alabama which was previously scheduled to contribute margin and go live in October 2017. Business expansion costs are still expected to be between $0.25 to $0.30 per diluted share.","In summary, we were pleased with the first quarter results and the operating momentum heading into the remainder of the year. We continue to maintain a conservative expectation associated with the margins in the Marketplace business, pending further experience in the second quarter.","That concludes my remarks. And, operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Today's first question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, Michael. First, just quick one on health insurance exchanges. It sounds like that's clearly running in line. A little bit of a good guy on the guidance, et cetera, so all positive. What's holding you back on the remaining $0.16? Have you just not seen enough claims information? Or what's the information you guys are waiting for now sort of end of April that's going to change going forward?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think you hit it. We have one, two months of claims data. It's performing as we expected. It seemed prudent and reasonable to let out the $0.04 but also to hold the $0.16 until we get another quarter's experience. And then we can let more out as appropriate. But there's no reason to expect any negativities, just once again, an abundance of conservatism. Jeff?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, Josh, a couple of things. We haven't seen anything in the performance of the membership, the demographics that would indicate that it's performing or will perform any different than it has over the last several years. But one thing to mention is that on the risk adjustment side, we don't have any data from the data aggregators. So, really, I would say the $0.04, I would characterize a lot of that as a result of membership and underlining claims data. And I would take a pause, I guess, on the risk adjustment because we're waiting for more \u2013 or actually any data from the data aggregators that will come in the second quarter.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, okay. Got you. So, by second quarter, you should have a pretty good sense. You won't have the government data but you'll have the consulting data. So I guess we'll know at that point.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, we'll have two things. Number one, we'll have the final results for 2016. And as you heard Michael indicate that over 80% of our membership reenrolled with us this year. So that will be a confirming piece of information. And then the second piece is that we'll have the actual data for 2017 using 2017 claims experience from the data aggregators in the second quarter as well.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just second question, RFP pipeline, just curious if there's anything material that we should be keeping our eye on through the rest of the year. And then it sounds like North Carolina is probably a 2018 event but maybe any specific commentary on the timing there.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think they're still working through the legislative aspects of that and the regulatory things, so it's too early to speculate. I think 2018 is a fair assumption. And we'll continue to work through these other opportunities we see coming. But we'll comment on them as the states release them.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Okay. Thanks","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. Just a quick clarification here on the guidance. For the exchanges, if you're able to recognize the full $0.20 cushion, does that put you in line with last year's margin profile? Or would that leave you doing a little bit better than last year?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","I think what we said when we originally came out with the $0.20 of conservatism was that our 2016 book of business was running towards the top end of our margin expectation range which is between 3% to 5% and that the $0.20 really pulled down that expectation by 1.5% at the pre-tax line. So I would say it's close to the top end of our margin guidance range. But still a little early to tell how it shakes out for the year as far as is it above last year or not.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And there's been a lot of discussion here (30:20)...","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Sarah, if I may, I just want to add, I think everything we're seeing says it's still a very good business.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Right. Yes, Centene seems to be outperforming everyone else in the industry on that front. And there's been a lot of discussion in the industry around the challenges capturing encounter data for risk scores, for new health insurance exchange members because you can't use the script field yet to prove out risk scores until 2018. Can you give us an idea of how Centene is doing on capturing risk scores for new members? And how do you think about the impact in 2018 on either margins or how accurate your risk scores will be once you're able to use that script data?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","You got that, Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Sure. Yeah, Sarah, without getting too far into the details on some of those, I think the best indicator so far is how do we use the information that we have to make our estimates around risk adjustment and related estimates over the course of time. And I think we've demonstrated that we've done a good job with respect to that and it's been a slight positive since we've gone through our actual versus estimates on encounter. So I think any additional information will just be more beneficial in the future.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Chris Rigg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning. Apologize for any background noise. Just was hoping for clarification on the comments you guys made about the 1.2 million insurance exchange members. You said 80%, I believe, renewed plans. Is that \u2013 do you guys know, was it 80% of everyone or just 80% of part of that pool? I'm just trying to get a better sense for who's actually (32:09) guys.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","We said we increased 500,000 this year. So, go back to the membership of last year, 80% of the people we covered last year in 2016 re-upped with us this year.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then on the SG&A ratio, for the quarter, you're kind of near the midpoint of your adjusted guidance for the year and then you sort of talked about the fourth quarter related issues. So can you just give us a better sense for how we should expect that to trend during the second and third quarter? Or do you think you're actually, at this point, given what you've seen in Q1, trending towards the midpoint or towards the high end for 2017?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","I would say that there's nothing unusual about the second and third quarter that would cause that ratio to be substantially different than the first quarter. What I'm mentioning is that in the fourth quarter, because of now the size of our commercial business, we will have a higher SG&A ratio. So I think if you think about Q2 and 3 relatively consistent with Q1. And then Q4, quite a bit higher because of the open enrollment costs, et cetera, on the commercial business. And I would say similar to what we experienced in last Q4, right, because we had those same costs in the fourth quarter last year.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. And then just one quick one on Medicare Advantage. I guess given \u2013 you only have three or four months under your belt in the de novo states. I guess how should we think about that business growth wise heading into next year? Should we think of that as sort of, okay, you got your toe in the water, you're doing okay, and we should expect a more rapid acceleration of membership in (33:52) any color as to how we should think about organic state (33:56) next year?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think I'm most comfortable saying we can talk about it when we give our annual guidance. We'll continue to work through, evaluate it. We're looking at entering new states. And I've commented at some Investor Days and other meetings where while if we've filed for 11 states, it doesn't mean we'll necessarily enter all 11 because we're going to balance the cost of entry so as to maintain the margins while entering new states, so there's a lot of work being done right now. So it's probably too early to get too directional.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Tom Carroll, Stifel. Please go ahead.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey there, good morning. Yes, so two questions.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","First, Jeff, I just want to follow up on your comment about the quarterly earnings projection as it goes out this year. So I guess my initial thought was 4Q was going to be a little more difficult this year. But then it seems like maybe walk back a little bit and suggested that the quarterly progression this year is going to be similar to last year. So could you put a finer point on that? I mean, is last year a good source to look at in terms of when EPS is going to come in across the quarters?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","No, no, I think what I'm saying is compared to what we previously kind of indicated first half, second half on the guidance range is that we would now expect the fourth quarter to actually be a little bit lower than what we previously anticipated because of those three items that I mentioned. And effectively, that shifts back into Q2 and Q3, if you will.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you for that clarification and then another bigger picture question on the Dual eligibles. A larger peer company of yours suggested what I would call a newfound interest in the Duals. I wonder if you could tell us a bit about your Dual business. Things such as like the average per member per month you have and maybe where the MLR is running relative to your consolidated business. And as it relates to the pipeline which has a good bit of higher acuity business out there, is Centene looking to really increase its focus on Dual opportunities?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think I'll start off and Jeff and others can jump in here. But I've never depended on the Duals for our growth and I've said that from the beginning. It's something we're in and something we do well. But until the fundamentals of how people dis-enroll and the nursing home issues when things get resolved, I don't see it being a stable and as predictable as other businesses we have.","So we go ahead in that context. But we're still very interested there. And we're going to continue to pursue it. And we're also going to try and pursue some appropriate regulatory changes to help make it more effective. Jeff, anything that you want to add?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, yeah, I mean, obviously, it hasn't been a material book of business for us. But it's running relatively well, I would say, in the low 90%s HBR. And I think the premiums, and I'm just doing this off the top of my head. I think the premiums are roughly a couple thousand dollars PMPM, per member per month, that is.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","So you have a higher MLR and as a percent of lower G&A, so...","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","That's right.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Scott Fidel of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Dana Nentin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning. This is Dana Nentin in for Scott. Thanks for taking the call. Just given the earlier receipt of some of the April capitation payments in March, can you talk about your expectations for 2Q cash flow? And whether there's any change in your overall outlook for cash flow in 2017?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, I \u2013 what I'll say is that wasn't the largest single driver. I mean it was a little over $100 million, something like that, of additional cash it received for April service dates. What's really driving the cash flow in the first quarter is the growth in the Marketplace business and the growth in our \u2013 are just base business, specifically Nebraska.","If you think about \u2013 we get our premium payments or collect our premium payments in the first month, and on average based on our days and claims payable, we pay those payments out in 42 days. So there's really a cash flow benefit in periods of growth. And so long-term, when you normalize for that, we would expect to be in 1.5, 2 times net earnings. But obviously, for this year, just because of the growth specifically in the marketplace, Nebraska will probably be above that range.","Dana Nentin - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from AJ Rice with UBS. Please go ahead.","AJ Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hello, everybody. One technical question and then maybe a broader one. The \u2013 I guess when you're reporting enrollment for Medicare, you're including that with the Dual eligibles. When I look at the movement last year, you were pretty steady in the enrollment and then first quarter you actually stepped down a little bit. I'm just trying to understand can you give us some color on actually what your enrollment looks like on Medicare's MA stand-alone?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, the stand-alones about 250,000 members, something like that, sorry, 280, 000 members.","AJ Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, okay.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Stand-alone.","AJ Rice - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. And then more broadly, on \u2013 going back to the exchanges, I appreciate all the questions about \u2013 the comments about Washington. It seems like there's a lot of focus on the idea of the cost sharing subsidies and whether they'll maintain those or not. Do you guys want to weigh in with your thoughts about that? Is that a deal breaker for you? And moving forward on the exchanges, what kind of premium increases will you need if they were to go away. And I will ask you about Maricopa County where you're the only HICS provider versus your other \u2013 the rest of your book. Do you see any difference in the profile of members in Maricopa versus the profile that you get in the other places where you have multiple competitors.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I'm sorry that I was interrupting. I'll start with Maricopa. I see the same profile basically. There's no difference in that profile from our other members. We knew that going into it, looking at the \u2013 what was there. Two, as it relates to the CSRs and what's happening in Washington if anything, my \u2013 somebody has a speaker on \u2013 with a lot of background, okay. I think what the big issue is, it has a long way to play out and we're convinced there's bipartisan support for the CSRs. So nobody wants to take this population and put them on the street. Effectively, doing away with the CSRs would eliminate the affordability of the product we make. I don't think it's going to happen.","AJ Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Michael Newshel of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. Good morning. I've got a quick follow-up on exchanges. How much risk adjustment are you guys booking as a percentage of premiums? And is that similar to what you did last year or is it more conservative?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, I'll just give you the dollars. In the first quarter, for the 2017 Marketplace business, we recorded over $300 million of risk adjustment as a payable. And we expect for the year that will be over $1 billion. And if you recall last year, we had about $425 million recorded at the end of the year.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Got it. So like \u2013 so roughly speaking, in terms of percentage of premiums pretty similar compared to the growth of exchange membership?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, that's correct.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yes.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Got it. And then just another quick follow-up on the Health Net plans subject to the PDR last year, specifically on the California PPO product. Is that tracking towards breakeven? And are you seeing the lower out of network charges and behavior changes that you expected it (42:46)?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I'll take that. As we said earlier, we don't see any PDRs this year on that business. And we have a \u2013 we see it performing as expected. And from a medical loss, from the membership, every aspect of it. The changes we put in place are achieving what we expected.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Okay. Thanks very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, thanks. I just want to go back to the comment that you made, Michael, about exchange participation for 2018 I think you said that there's nothing at this point that makes you want to rethink that because of patients. Are saying that you kind of expect to be in a similar number of counties and states next year or is there a plan to move that up over time?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think we wait \u2013 as it moves along, we always look at adding. And I think what's important is that \u2013 what I was trying to convey, Kevin, is that, like last year, I said it's business as usual. And I believe that's going to really prove out to be the right thing. And I'm saying the same thing that we have the agility, the ability to adjust. And so as things unfold, I see nothing out there that's going to change it to where we would not participate. If something changes, we'll adapt to do or what we have to do as we historically have. So but if we are evaluating other markets to expanding, yes.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then as far as MA goes, obviously, it's an area of growth for you guys over the next several years. I guess, year-over-year, the MA membership was down I believe, can you talk was going on there?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, I think Jesse will talk about.","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah, I think, Kevin, this is Jesse Hunter. So a couple of things. The biggest kind of single item on the MA front we've talked about this a bit before was the group retiree business associated with some companies that are based in the West Coast so kind of legacy Health Net customers if you will that were kind of expanding their footprint more broadly. So that was kind of the most impactful on kind of in the category of membership attrition. And I think as we've talked before, as we expand our footprint and have more geography and more focus around organic growth opportunities, you'll see that trend changed starting in 2018.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Christine Arnold of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, there. One question on the Medicaid and one of the public exchanges. First on the public exchanges, can you give us a sense for how your per member per month profitability progressed in 2016? So I'd imagine first quarter was a profitable. But how much deterioration do you usually see. And I'm trying to put that $0.04 in the context of the $0.20. And then with respect to Medicaid expansion dollars, if we don't get a health care bill, are we safe? Or could they try to make you to pay for in a tax bill. Michael, how are you thinking about that?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","In terms of Medicare expansion?","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think until they revoke the \u2013 adjust it, repair it to whatever action they take. I'm trying to think of the right words, repeal and replace is what I was trying to think of. Until they repeal and replace, I think it's going to be business as usual on the Medicaid expansion. There's one state, I think, that's been talking about pulling back on it. And that could happen here from time-to-time.","I know there were several states with Republican governors that would like nothing better than expand it. And we regret that their legislation is never had. So I'm not thinking about making a whole lot of changes as 20 Republican senators that come from states that have expanded Medicaid, as I said in my script. And so I think that is a long way to play out.","I see it, it may make \u2013 it could move into the exchange product and just what the subsidies are. There's various alternatives being talked about, but nothing that would leave these people without effective insurance.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then what about the progression of losses on individual in 2016 per member per month? Can you give us a sense of that, so I can put the $0.04 in context with the $0.20?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, I think it's \u2013 well, I mean the first point is, I think, it's hard to put the $0.04 in context with the $0.20 using the quarter progression because for what we said earlier, was that we're really still waiting on information on the risk adjustment, right. And we just said that the risk adjustment payment is going to be \u2013 could be in excess of $1 billion for the year. So I'm not sure that those 2 would relate. But as a traditional commercial business, the majority or more of the earnings will be in the first half of the year.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Today's next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Morning.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. I have a conceptual question and then I want to shift gears and ask a question about Illinois. My conceptual question is, Michael, when you think about the number of states that are requesting Medicaid waivers to either view work requirements or implement premiums or Wisconsin recently also proposing drug testing, do you have enough experience in states like Indiana that have done waivers to have a viewpoint on how those sorts of requirements would impact enrollment as well as mix and margins?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, it really has \u2013 if I take Indiana where we played an important role in the implementation, and Chris, you can jump in here and add to it. We saw no ill effects from it. We did well and we were supportive and if anything, the business build and became very constructive. Chris?","Christopher R. Isaak - Centene Corp.","I would agree with you, Michael. One of the things that we saw, Gary, was the fact that, actually, when you started to look at some of the data and such that the health outcomes actually improved, actually more than we had anticipated that they might, and that we looked at it as a real good program for the beneficiaries. We didn't really see anything negative as far as bringing on the requirements that the state brought in (49:47) program.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And I'd add we're very decentralized in our approach to these things. So we can adapt to what any particular state wants relatively easy from a systems standpoint and what have you.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then my second is just on Illinois with the potential re-bid there for 2018, but also the consolidation of contract in MCOs that the state is proposing by as much as half. I guess maybe just two part question. First is, how do you feel you're positioned in Illinois? How confident that Centene emerges as one of the remaining health plans? And part two, do you expect an outright rate reduction for 2018?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","So I think there's a two-part answer to that. One, I think we're well positioned. Secondly, do we want to continue to go forward in Illinois? And that's going to be a function of what the rates are and the profitability of it. So, as we see what the rate bands are and we go through the actual assessment, we're going to make a business decision as to whether or not to pursue Illinois. We have a strong network. We have statewide a lot of places where others have pulled out recently. They're asking us to contract with them. So I think this thing has to play out over the next two, three weeks. And I'll focus on and Jeff will and Steve and the whole financial team, Chris, on the actuarial studies that say is it going to be profitable.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah, hi, thanks for taking the questions. Just wondering if you know broadly the loss ratio that you have, if you can give us some color by segment, Medicare, legacy Health Net, and more broadly in the new markets. And then, where you ended up in exchanges. Is it still in the mid-80s, and then where are you on Medicaid as far as the expansion population and then the more complex populations? And any directional sense there?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yes. I want to clarify one thing. We're not going to talk about legacy Health Net anymore. Health Net is now a California plan and going forward, it's just one of our states. And they understood it's fully integrated and all the systems are integrated. So, to look at what legacy is versus now is something that, culturally, we're not doing and thinking about as a company. But the others (52:50), Jeff, you can jump in.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, I'll talk about the biggest books of business that we have, so I'll break it down into Medicaid and commercial. I think what you'll see for the first quarter is \u2013 and I think you would traditionally see this every year, which is a little bit higher Medicaid HBR really driven by flu. And then, you'll see a lower commercial HBR, really, just because that's the way the commercial product performs with deductibles, copays, et cetera, et cetera. So I think for the first quarter, we definitely experienced that. I think that was in line with our expectations.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And then going forward, just directionally, when you think about how this will all play out going into 2018, just up or down, I know you're not guiding or anything here. And how should we think about normalized loss ratios? Do you see improvement here? Will it be flat on a net basis?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, I'm not going to comment about 2018 HBRs. I mean, I think we're comfortable where our guidance range on the HBR is today. And really what's going to drive the HBR on a going-forward basis is the mix of products that we have.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Exactly, we're going to \u2013 it's actually an evolving mix.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. This is Steve Baxter on for Justin. Thanks for the questions. Can you talk about what you're seeing as far as rates go in the Medicaid expansion population? Our general understanding across the industry is that rates have normalized here some, putting pressure on results a bit in 2017. I guess, first, can you talk about what you're seeing in 2017 and what your guidance includes in terms of potential rate adjustments that have not yet been announced? And do you expect any incremental pressure here as you move into the second half of the year that we would need to think about annualizing for 2018?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think \u2013 well, take the first one at the top. I think in our rate range guidance of 0% to 1%, that's all encompassing, right, for the total business, so that would include Medicaid expansion. And so, in general, if you take it at the aggregate level, we're still anticipating between 0%, to between 0% and 1% rate increase for the year. We have, over time \u2013 the Medicaid expansion has been around quite a long time. So, a lot of states have already normalized margins. So, what I would say is any adjustment on Medicaid expansion is already included in our aggregate 0% to 1% composite rate expectation.","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, your margins you'd characterize as being pretty comparable from 2016 to 2017 for that business?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Now, what I will tell you, I mean, just one thing to note is if you recall last year, we did talk about the California Medicaid expansion was like an 11% decrease, but it had no effect because there was a minimum MLR rebate. So, to some extent, you have to take those programs in combination, but yes, I would say consistent is \u2013 on a net basis, consistent is true.","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That's fair. Yeah, I guess, it just begs the question when you're talking about an 11% rate decrease on having an impact on your actual results. It seems to imply you're still further at the top and what the caveat on the range there. So, that was, I guess, the basis for that question. Do you think California is in a good place now and is it going to continue reasonably going forward?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Well, I mean, I will just state what I said before, I think in aggregate, it's in our 0% to 1% and that's consistent with the last three years. I mean, we've had between 0% and 1% for the last three years.","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. So, following up on the question about the Health Net PDR issues from last year, appreciate the comment that it's running in line with your expectation for this year. I guess how does that fit relative to what you'd hope for longer term for these businesses, because I'd assume that you still might be looking for some improvement there over a longer period of time?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, I think what we've done is we looked at it, and I think the next issue is growing that business. And we're putting the time and energy in working with the state to take the actions that we'll grow. That's the single biggest issue. We scaled it. The mix of the recipients is appropriate. There's a good balanced mix of recipients. The in-patient cost is down. So, every aspect of it is delivering as we expected and the issue now is growth.","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And one just last question, numbers wise. Membership for ABD and Long Term Care was up about 40,000 sequentially. My impression was that Nebraska was mostly a low-acuity population, but maybe I'm mistaken there. I was just wondering if you could help us understand what was driving that sequential increase.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Oh, you're talking sequential, right?","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, sequential. Yeah.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Nebraska does have ABD and SSIN and LTC or \u2013 yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's in...","Stephen Baxter - Wolfe Research LLC","(57:47)","Jeffrey A.

Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just a quick couple of revenue follow-ups. Your first quarter run rate, first quarter annualized looks to be higher than your guidance, which you reaffirmed. Is the, say, attrition, for lack of a better word, is that exchange attrition anticipation or perhaps share of wallet issues in Georgia? Or are you just kind of running conservatively on the guidance? Thanks.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","I would say, well, there is exchange \u2013 sorry, there's a lot of feedback here. There is exchange attrition in the number. Additionally, there were a small amount of pass-through payments in the first quarter. I mean, as you're aware, those are very lumpy. But in general, I would say exchange attrition is \u2013 the first quarter will be higher because of the \u2013 that's the maximum amount of members we have in exchange business.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. And then, a small number but the service revenue number was down a little bit. Anything going on there?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Nothing unusual. I think they're from comparing Q4 to Q1, there was a lower amount of volume in the VA business with respect to the appointments that we take there for the health care coverage, but nothing outside of our expectations.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay.

All participants will be in listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions). After today\u2019s presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. (Operator Instructions). Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ed Kroll. Mr. Kroll, the floor is yours, sir.","Edmund E. Kroll","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m Ed Kroll, Head of Investor Relations for Centene Corporation. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter earnings call.

Please mark your calendars for that.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael F. Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's second quarter 2014 earnings call. During the course of today's call, we will discuss our strong second quarter results and provide updates on Centene\u2019s markets and products, the ACA and the impact of new hepatitis C therapies.","I will begin with highlights of our second quarter financial results. We reported second quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.79 or $0.95 when excluding the $0.16 impact of the ACA health insurance fee. We continue to expect to recoup the entire impact of the fee during the course of this year.","Second quarter membership increased 23% year-over-year to 3.2 million covered lives. Premium and Service revenue grew 49% year-over-year to $3.7 billion. The HBR improved 40 basis points sequentially to 88.9. This reflects normal seasonality in our ongoing medical cost management efforts. Bill will provide further HBR detail including the new and existing business mix. We continue to see stable medical cost strength consistent with our expectations. ","Now on to market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. Florida; in May, we began phasing in regions in Florida\u2019s MMA program. As of June 30, five of our nine regions had gone live. In addition, we commenced operations as the sole provider to the Child Welfare Specialty Plan, Florida\u2019s new foster care program. As of June 30, six of the 11 regions had gone live.","We expect to have 20,000 foster care beneficiaries when all regions are fully operational. The implementation of these two contracts is proceeding according to plan. They\u2019re the primary drivers of our 36% sequential membership growth in the state. Both programs will continue to be phased in by region through August of 2014.","Illinois; in July, IlliniCare subsidiary began a five-year contract with the Cook County Health and Hospital Systems to serve approximately 100,000 new members under the CountyCare program. Under the contract we will provide administrative services and specialty services including care coordination, behavioral health, pharmacy and vision. The size of the program is expected to grow as CountyCare enters additional state Medicaid programs.","Mississippi; also in July we began operating under a new statewide managed care contract to continue serving members in the Mississippi CAN program. Mississippi is moving to expand the program by an additional 300,000 beneficiaries. The rollout of the expansion is expected to commence at the end of 2014 and continue through the second quarter of 2015.","Moving into dual eligibles. We have successfully completed the launch of our dual eligible demonstration project in Illinois and Ohio. At June 30, we had nearly 10,000 dual eligible members in these states. Membership will continue to increase throughout the remainder of 2014 in both Illinois and Ohio. We continue to expect Michigan, South Carolina and Texas to go live with their dual demonstration projects during the first half of 2015.","Shifting gears to the M&A front. On July 1, we completed a transaction that has significantly expanded our membership to Louisiana. Under this agreement, Community Health Solutions, CHS, assigned its shared savings contract covering approximately 200,000 beneficiaries to Centene\u2019s Louisiana subsidiary. The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals, DHH, recently announced planned changes to the Bayou Health Program. This includes a consolidation of its two models into one risk-bearing [MCO] (ph).","Consistent with the state\u2019s proposed changes, we are working with DHH to transition these members from the non-risk program to our full risk health plan in early 2015. The total purchase price is estimated to be between $110 million and $140 million contingent upon retained membership. Separately, Centene and CHS have entered into a business development partnership to pursue other Medicaid Management Care opportunities in new markets.","Next, I will discuss our investment in Ribera Salud. Last week we completed the purchase of a noncontrolling interest in Ribera Salud, a Spanish health management group highly regarded for its ACO-like, public-private partnership health care model. Our recent or initial investment for a 50% interest was approximately $16 million. Diversification has always been a key element of Centene\u2019s growth strategy. The transaction represents our initial entry into the government-sponsored health care market in Europe and a modest investment.","Now, a brief update on the ACA. First, the health insurer fee. As of today, Centene has received signed agreements from 15 of our 17 applicable states, which provide for the reimbursement of the ACA health insurance fee on a grossed-up basis. This represents approximately 60% of the total amount. We fully expect to receive 100% of the grossed-up reimbursement from our two remaining states in 2014. This is reflected in our guidance.","Next, health insurance marketplaces. In January, we began operating in a subset of counties in nine states. At June 30, we had 75,700 enrolled and paid exchange lives. This is slightly ahead of our previous projection of 70,000 lives. We continue to expect the health insurance marketplaces to have a minimal impact on our 2014 financial performance. The demographics of our enrollees continue to be in line with our pricing. Members are predominantly lower income and over 90% are eligible for premium subsidies.","Now Medicaid expansion. We ended the quarter with approximately 155,000 expansion lives in four states. Longer term, we continue to view this as a growth opportunity as more states adopt expansions. As to the woodwork effect, we saw only a modest impact in the second quarter. There are multiple factors that impact Centene\u2019s membership [growth] (ph) including program changes, eligibility determinations, service area expansions and Medicaid expansion among others. Given the number of variables, it is difficult to attribute membership growth directly to the woodwork effect. Our updated 2014 guidance reflects Centene\u2019s continued expectation for a limited impact from the so-called woodwork effect.","Now hepatitis C therapies. We continue to manage the utilization of our new hepatitis C drugs in a responsible way on behalf of our state customers. Our experience to-date has been consistent with our estimates. The net cost impact of Centene in the second quarter of 2014 is $13.7 million. This compares to 4.2 million in the second quarter of 2013 and 7.3 million in the first quarter of 2014. Please note the incremental spend is on a higher membership base.","The higher cost to new therapies is clearly recognized by all of our state partners. We continue to have productive discussions to ensure that the new therapies are properly managed and fully reflected in our reimbursement. A quick comment on rates. We expect the 2014 composite rate adjustment to be relatively flat. This is reflected in our updated guidance.","In conclusion, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance in the first half of the year. We reported second quarter revenue growth of 49% and membership growth of 23%. The insurer fee is being dealt with in a proper manner by our states. Our states have also acknowledged the need to provide for adequate reimbursements with the new hepatitis C therapies. And our pipeline of future growth opportunities remains robust. We expect to maintain this positive momentum in the second half of 2014 and our raising our financial guidance for the quarter.","Thank you for your interest in Centene. I will now turn the call over to Bill.","William N. Scheffel","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. For the second quarter, our Premium and Service revenues increased 49% between years to over 3.7 billion. Our diluted earnings per share increased to $0.79 or $0.95 excluding the impact associated with the health insurer fee in the quarter. This compares to $0.71 in 2013.","The 49% increase in Premium and Service revenues is the result of the additions of new operations in California, New Hampshire, Centurion, the health insurance marketplace and U.S. Medical Management, expansions between years in Florida, Ohio and Washington and growth in the carrier health business.","Our service revenues component increased by over $300 million between years to 410 million primarily reflecting the growth in the carrier health business along with the addition of U.S. Medical Management. Our consolidated health benefits ratio was 88.9% in the second quarter compared to 88.4% in the second quarter last year and 89.3% in the first quarter this year. The increase of 50 basis points between years is due to increased levels of higher acuity membership. Sequentially, our HBR is down by 40 basis points reflecting normal seasonality.","For the second quarter, 26% of our revenues came from new business and 74% came from existing business. The portion of our revenues from new business is higher both year-over-year and sequentially. Our HBR for new business was 91.8% in the second quarter compared to 90.4% last year and 93.1% for the first quarter of 2014.","As Michael indicated, our cost in the second quarter related to hepatitis C drugs increased by approximately $6 million from the first quarter, which was consistent with our expectations. We continue to discuss programs with all of our states on ways to ensure we are appropriately reimbursed for these costs going forward. At this point we are confident that the programs being established by the states will provide for adequate reimbursement.","Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.6% this quarter, an improvement of 30 basis points from last year and 20 basis points from Q1 of 2014. Last year\u2019s second quarter included $0.07 of a carrier health transaction cost and the first quarter of 2014 included $0.06 of U.S. Medical Management transaction cost. Excluding transaction cost, our G&A ratio has been relatively consistent between 8.6% and 8.7% for these periods.","For the second quarter, we recorded $30 million of revenue related to reimbursement for the ACA health insurer fee. At quarter end, we had signed agreements from 14 of the 17 applicable states covering the reimbursement on a grossed-up basis for income taxes. Subsequent to June 30, we added an additional state leaving California and Texas as the two remaining states for which we have not yet received signed agreements.","We continue to work with our two remaining states and fully expect to receive agreements on this issue in the second half of this year. Investment income was 7.3 million in the second quarter compared to 4.1 million last year. The increase reflects higher investment balances and earnings on our equity method investments.","Interest expense increased from 7 million last year to 8.6 million this year, as a result of higher average borrowings on our revolver and the issuance of $300 million or 4.75% senior notes in April of this year.","Our effective income tax rate was 48.7% in the second quarter excluding the effect of noncontrolling interest. This compares to 39.2% last year and reflects the impact of the nondeductible ACA health insurer fee in 2014.","Our diluted earnings per share was $0.79 for the second quarter which includes a $0.16 impact from the ACA health insurer fee. This compares to $0.71 of diluted earnings per share in the second quarter of 2013. Our second quarter of 2013 included $0.07 in transaction costs related to the carrier health acquisition. Diluted shares outstanding were 59.7 million shares for the second quarter compared to 59.4 million shares in the first quarter.","At June 30, we had $2.4 billion of cash investments and restricted deposits including $15 million held by unregulated entities. Our risk-based capital continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level, excluding any statutory impact related to the treatment of the ACA health insurer fee during the year.","Our total debt was 891 million at June 30 including $70 million of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Our debt to capital ratio excluding our $71 million nonrecourse mortgage note was 35.5%. Medical claims liabilities totaled 1.4 billion at June 30 and represented 42.9 days in claims payable.","Cash flow from operations was 159 million in the second quarter and 412 million year-to-date. This was 3.3 times net earnings for the second quarter and over 5 times net earnings for the first six months of 2014.","Our full year 2014 guidance numbers have been updated to reflect our second quarter results. The start-up of our Illinois contract on July 1 in Cook County, the assignment of the CHS contract in Louisiana and the acquisition of a noncontrolling interest in Ribera Salud in Spain.","We expect Premium and service revenues 15 billion to 15.5 billion, diluted earnings per share $3.70 to $3.90, consolidated health benefits ratio 88.7% to 89.2%, general and administrative expense ratio 8.5% to 9%, effective income tax rate 49.5% to 50.5% and diluted shares outstanding 60 million to 60.4 million shares.","We\u2019ve increased our revenue guidance by $700 million to $800 million for 2014 as a result of increased membership in Medicaid, Medicaid expansion and health insurer marketplace product lines, the addition of the Cook County operations and growth in the carrier health revenues.","Our EPS guidance numbers, our GAAP numbers and included absorbing approximately $0.12 of transaction costs related to Louisiana and Spain in the third quarter. Our business expansion costs for the year are estimated to be $0.60 to $0.65 and include approximately $0.18 in transaction costs related to completed transactions; $0.06 in Q1 for U.S. Medical Management and $0.12 in Q3 for Louisiana and Spain.","This concludes my remarks and operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). The first question we have comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff","Good morning.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital","Good morning, Michael. Two top line related questions. I guess the first one is, it\u2019s your Investor Day a month ago or so, you guys talked about visibility into an $18 billion top line next year without any additional wins, et cetera. It sounds like there\u2019s actually been a couple of wins or new entries since then. Did that 18 billion include what we\u2019ve already seen or is that number already higher today?","Michael F. Neidorff","Bill?","William N. Scheffel","We knew in Investor Day that these transactions were coming online, so they pretty much included the two transactions which we\u2019ve completed already in July.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay. But the Cook County start for the duals and Ohio as well, that was all in there?","William N. Scheffel","Right, we started Cook County July 1, so obviously in the middle of June we were well prepared for that start-up.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay. And then just a second question on the dual. I think Michael said that you got 10,000 duals in Illinois and Ohio. I guess according to the CMS report which I understand are not perfect representations of your market, you only had about 2,000 or so at the end of the second quarter. So what\u2019s the differential? Some of that you\u2019re just serving the Medicaid side of things or they\u2019re not full duals and maybe how many full duals would you expect in Illinois and Ohio this year?","William N. Scheffel","Yes. Actually in Ohio in the dual program, they are enrolling Medicaid members first, so a substantial amount of the membership is Medicaid only in Ohio. In 2015 they will start to pass some enrollment of the Medicare portion, so there will be a little bit of a delayed impact. But the estimate for the full duals you put out is not too far away from where we are at this point.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay. And that was actually a combination of Illinois and Ohio, I think Ohio was 1,000; Illinois was a bit below that.","William N. Scheffel","That\u2019s about right, yes.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay, got you. And then just a last question, just the increase in the premium taxes on a sequential basis. Was there something in there specifically?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I think we have sometimes additional payments received in a couple of states and I think we had two states that paid us additional amounts in the quarter for us to payout to providers or back to the state, either one.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay. And that was all cash. I mean it looked like the expense line went up\u2026","Michael F. Neidorff","Right.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital","Okay. All right, perfect.","Operator","Next, we have Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Hi. Can you help us understand what\u2019s going on with the service line revenues, in particular Acaria and sort of how do we forecast that going forward? It seems to keep running faster and faster. Hopefully, you can tell us how is that working going forward.","Operator","We do as that you please standby. We just temporary lost connection. One moment. Thank you standing by, everyone. Sir, you may proceed.","Michael F. Neidorff","Peter, are you back on?","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","I didn\u2019t think that question was that hard. Yes, I\u2019m here.","William N. Scheffel","Apparently it was.","Michael F. Neidorff","You were on a strike and you faded out at the end.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Yes, let me try again. The service line revenues, can you talk about the trajectory on that line and in particular AcariaHealth and what we should expect going forward from that?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think the service line revenue increases I indicated is primarily AcariaHealth plus the addition of U.S. Medical Management in 2014. The carrier health includes a significant amount of hepatitis C therapies that they provide as part of their programs. And we see that sort of plateauing at this point in time for the rest of the year as their product sort of slows down in second half of the year. So, primarily I would say 60% to 70% of the increase is coming out of Acaria.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Okay. Thanks. And then can you speak about the reasons for the change in guidance on the tax rate?","William N. Scheffel","Sure. I think that\u2019s something that everybody should understand. Our normal tax rate is roughly 40% and then the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee causes it to increase by over 900 basis points, I think. And so what happens is that number \u2013 the amount of the non-deductibility that stays the same during the course of the year. And if our earnings grow, absent the health insurer fee, you won\u2019t see a corresponding increase in the health insurer fee impact, so the effective tax rate will actually go down as a result of that. So you\u2019ll see more of the 40% and less of the increase of the health insurer fee. So it\u2019s really nothing more complicated than that in the blend of the two as you add in more earnings from our regular operations.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","So to be clear, the lower guidance for tax rate is due to the fact that the rest of your business improved operationally better?","William N. Scheffel","Right. The health insurer fee is static and the earnings are increasing on our normal business.","Peter Costa - Wells Fargo Securities","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Michael F. Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question we have comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thanks. I guess, first, you guys did close a couple of deals during the quarter. Just wanted to understand if you could give us a sense of what the accretion from those transactions was, if any, like how much of the guidance raise was organic versus deals?","Michael F. Neidorff","Bill?","William N. Scheffel","Sure, Kevin. I think the deals that we closed were in the third quarter in July. And so we want to make sure that both the Louisiana transaction and the Spain transaction were done this month. We provided, for example, the transaction costs associated with those deals so everyone would understand that, pick that up in their understanding of the third quarter and then also for purposes of understanding our change in guidance that we\u2019ve got $0.18 of transaction costs baked in for the full year so far for transaction costs. With respect to the accretion question, we have included in our updated guidance our estimate of the earnings and the impact of Cook County and Louisiana and for Spain. Most of those operations don\u2019t have a significant impact in the second half of the year as we do a certain amount of transition and start-up costs with those and we do have the amortization of intangibles associated with some of those transactions that we have to start dealing with. So, for the most part, nothing significant in the second half from accretion.","Michael F. Neidorff","It\u2019s not material.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Because I look at the guidance and if you add back the transaction costs, it seems like at the midpoint you're kind of raising the guidance by like $0.17 and it should beat consensus by $0.07 at the quarter. So it seems like the second half of the year you're raising guidance by about $0.10. But you're saying that not much of that is due to deals, just most of the core business continuing to show better results.","William N. Scheffel","Yes. I think that's a fair analysis.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And so I guess trying to understand a little bit about \u2013 I know you don't have a huge amount of new expansion business, but just trying to understand how you feel like that business is coming online, how you feel like the rates were set and whether the new experience is showing any unusual pent-up demand there?","William N. Scheffel","I think our newest operations include California, New Hampshire and marketplace and a few other things with duals which some of those are a little early to really know. I think the two states we've added are performing probably above our expectations at this point in time. In marketplace also we've been pleased with the medical cost trends up to this point. We added a lot of the membership for marketplace in the second quarter, so it still has time to have to develop but at this point all three of those sectors seem to be performing well.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, we don't want to get overly aggressive on it. As Bill said, it is very early.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Do you have any comment on the three Rs?","William N. Scheffel","I think with respect to the three Rs, it's almost a moot point because we're not at the point where we're in a position to record any significant amount for risk corridor or for reinsurance at this point. We would, if we were into those levels to record a corridor or large cases for reinsurance, but at this point it's been rather insignificant. But philosophically, we would record the risk corridor and the reinsurance amounts based on our actual experience in 2014 and year-to-date. With respect to risk adjustment, we don't have enough information to know how our population compares to others and whether we \u2013 how much payment would be going either way on that, so we've not recorded anything and would not intend to record anything on risk adjustment unless we got a lot more information on how our book of business compared to everyone else.","Kevin Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right, great. Thanks.","William N. Scheffel","Thanks.","Operator","Next, we have Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Yes, thank you. Just wondering if you could maybe drill down a little bit on what you're seeing in terms of utilization trend and maybe just in the context of sort of what we're seeing on a macro level which is strong prescription volume trends, but relatively weak numbers for physician office visits. To be clear, that's at a very macro level. I'm not referring to Centene. So just looking for a little more granularity beyond stable trend.","William N. Scheffel","I think at this point in time, our medical cost trends have been pretty consistent with both our original expectations and what you've said. There are different component. And so clearly the cost of drugs go up every year in terms of the pricing for both brand and generics. Utilization for inpatient and outpatient has been relatively stable. And so when you look at it all, we've seen relatively minimal increases in overall utilization and the changes in our HBR as I talked about at our Investor Day in June relate a lot more to changes in mix. When we had higher acuity membership that has a higher built-in HBR, you'll see a slight increase in our HBR as that mix changes and that's what we're actually seeing at this point in time. So in terms of cost trends, I don't think we're seeing any different than what you said and nothing really of any surprising nature.","Michael F. Neidorff","We're calling the trends relatively flat, as I said in my comments, and see nothing that changes that, Matt.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","I'm sorry if I missed this, but what's the update on Sovaldi and the costs that you incurred in the second quarter?","William N. Scheffel","It was a $6 million roughly increase over the first quarter.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Okay.","Michael F. Neidorff","But we had also as you know significant additional membership compared to last year.","William N. Scheffel","New states and new products.","Michael F. Neidorff","New states, new products.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","And where are you with not \u2013 are you absorbing that at this point or where are you with additional reimbursement or kick payments for that?","Michael F. Neidorff","We're talking to states and we're at different points with different states relative to pass-throughs and the various methodology for reimbursing. And then that becomes more of an issue at the end of the year or early next year with some of the new products. We feel that the current Sovaldi tends to be plateauing out and has been absorbed within the numbers we gave you and with what the states are doing for us. So we don't see it as a material issue at this point, particularly with the discussions we're having with the states where they recognize the issue and are being very constructive. Is that fair, Mary?","Mary V. Mason","Yes, it is.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","All right, I'm good. Thank you.","Operator","Next, Justin Lake of JPMorgan. ","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff","Good morning.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","A couple of quick questions. First, can you give us an update \u2013 obviously a lot of growth in Florida. Can you give us an update in terms of what you're seeing in the membership there in terms of the ramp and how costs are looking versus expectations. And then can you specifically delineate for us long-term care and the long-term care rollout and what you\u2019re seeing there?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think a lot of it is very early at this point in terms of the timing rollout. Anything you want to add Bill?","William N. Scheffel","The Medicaid rollout is in process right now and will continue on for several more months. And I think the long-term care rollout is complete and we have close to 30,000 members I think in Florida in long-term care and absorbing that product nicely. The Medicaid will continue to \u2013 it\u2019s too early really to give any indications of anything on an HBR. We see nothing at this point in time that would say that we\u2019re seeing \u2013 the membership we\u2019ve added in the new program that\u2019s any different than what we expected it to be.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Okay, great. And then most companies have indicated that rates and performance on members from Medicaid expansion have been running really strongly both in terms of the performance of the membership and also how the rates were set initially on Medicaid expansion. So I\u2019m just curious how to think about rate setting process for 2015 and whether you think there maybe any reset of margins lower here or are those margins kind of running in line with typical targets?","William N. Scheffel","I think that the rates that were set for Medicaid expansion were indicative of the fact that there may be a higher HBR for that population than what typically is seen, whether you say that\u2019s pent-up demand or whatever. And so we\u2019ve seen that in some cases but in relationship to the rates and the actual costs they are in line with the HBR targets. So nothing there of any surprise. With respect to 2015, it\u2019s too early to call in terms of what the rates might be on the Medicaid expansion portion of that and I think the states will review the actual cost data to determine whether they make any substantive changes in that. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019ll have a lot of information, new information to make substantive changes to that, so I\u2019d expect it to the great extent to carry over into 2015 similar to 2014.","Michael F. Neidorff","And the states also will be getting 100% reimbursement from the federal government so that allows them to be very realistic in their mind.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Got it. And when does that get communicated?","William N. Scheffel","You\u2019re talking about rates for 2015 or what?","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Yes, the rates for 2015.","William N. Scheffel","Each date has a different timeline for when they go through rates, so I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s a specific date at this point. It\u2019s state by state.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, we have tended on the earnings call after the rate has been established to discuss it at that point.","Justin Lake - JPMorgan","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Next, we have Chris Carter of Credit Suisse.","Christopher Carter - Credit Suisse","Thanks. Good morning. Just first a follow-up on Peter\u2019s question. Can you maybe just quantify for us how much of a benefit you\u2019re seeing from Sovaldi on the service revenue side?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think I would just say that it\u2019s a subsidiary amount of the revenues on the service line income but it\u2019s a low margin product.","Christopher Carter - Credit Suisse","I mean could you help \u2013 I guess how should we think about the margins I guess directionally when you say low margin?","William N. Scheffel","I don\u2019t think we really want to get into that level of detail for a specific product of a specific subsidiary.","Christopher Carter - Credit Suisse","Okay.","Michael F. Neidorff","Competitively.","Christopher Carter - Credit Suisse","Got it. And then next question, the new business revenue increased to 26% in the quarter from 20% last quarter but the MLR went down. I mean can you just kind of walk through the puts and takes in terms of what\u2019s driving the MLR lower?","William N. Scheffel","Every new business has a different mix and so included in new revenue still would be the new products we added and new states we added; California and New Hampshire. They\u2019re, as I said, performing reasonably well with this point in time. We also have the health insurance marketplace which is included in there and that runs at a lower average HBR than our normal business, the Medicaid business, so you\u2019ll see when you blend that in, you\u2019ll have a lower HBR for new business than you might typically have seen.","Christopher Carter - Credit Suisse","And then I guessing Florida\u2019s in there now.","William N. Scheffel","Florida\u2019s long-term care and Medicaid expansion are in there also.","Christopher Carter - Credit Suisse","Got it. All right, thank you.","Operator","Scott Fidel, Deutsche Bank.","Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG","Thanks. First question just interested if you have any updates just in terms of how we should think about seasonality of EPS in the 3Q versus the 4Q? I know you mentioned the deal costs that you\u2019ll have in the 3Q. And then just around the recruitment of the remaining two states. We\u2019ve been modeling that all flowing through in the third quarter. Is that a reasonable estimate or do you think we should maybe have that a bit more sort of broken out between 3Q and 4Q? So basically if we look at consensus right now, consensus has a split at around 53% EPS in 3Q and 47% in the fourth quarter. Just interested if you\u2019re comfortable with that?","Michael F. Neidorff","Scott, I think if you go back to what we said on the last call, we said that it would be in the second half and that it could easily slide into the fourth quarter some of it recognizing that states like Texas have a fiscal year September 1, and so we work through some of these things. We forecast at that point in time it could go into the fourth quarter.","William N. Scheffel","I would say absent timing for the health insurer fee, I don\u2019t know that there\u2019s anything unusual with our seasonality in Q3 or Q4 compared to our normal trends. So I would say we would expect that to be similar to prior years in that regard.","Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. So on the remaining insurer fee maybe just like probability [wait] (ph) sort of the remaining two states versus three in the 4Q.","William N. Scheffel","Right now I would say just to hedge our bet I would put more of it in Q4.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, I mean it would be appropriate, prudent, conservative to say Q4 because we can \u2013 we\u2019re concerned but what is important is that it get done and gets fully reimbursed, fully grossed-up and the difference between September 1 and October 1 is not as important to us.","Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. I had a follow-up question just on Kentucky and I know you guys can\u2019t talk too much about that since the litigation is still ongoing but it does look like in the 10-Q you did have an update on some communications that the commonwealth had around their projected exposure for the state and for CMS. And just to the extent that maybe you can comment on those estimates that were provided in the 10-Q and basically just give us an update on how the litigation is developing here?","Michael F. Neidorff","Scott, when you\u2019re in the middle of litigation it\u2019s moving through the court effectively, it\u2019s very prudent to do nothing more than rely on what was written and that\u2019s on the base of some very good advice from very good counsel. So I\u2019m going to take a pass on trying to amplify it or describe it anymore than what\u2019s been described.","Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay, that\u2019s fair enough. Just last question just on operating cash flow, again that was well above our forecast. Bill, I didn\u2019t hear you update the operating cash flow guidance for the year. Is that still the same or do you think it could be even better here given the trends in the first half?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think our normal view has been 1.5 to 2 times. We\u2019ve obviously exceeded that for several of our years and so it wouldn\u2019t surprise me we exceed that for this year given how strong we have been through the first half.","Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. Were there any specific timing issues in the 2Q that reverse in the 3Q or was that all sort of a clean number there in the second quarter?","William N. Scheffel","I think it was relatively clean.","Scott Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have A. J. Rice of UBS.","A. J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank","Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe a couple specific detailed questions. I appreciate the commentary around the deal cost as part of the 60, 65 in total start-up costs. Can you comment on the 42 to 47 remaining start-up costs? Have you incurred most of that already or is that \u2013 how much of that is still left to be incurred in the back half of the year?","William N. Scheffel","I think that our deal costs are \u2013 when you peel out the transaction costs tend to be relatively consistent. So I think that we\u2019re probably slightly more in the second half than the first half, excluding transaction costs, but maybe $0.04 or $0.05 worth not a lot, not more than that.","A. J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And now that CHS is basically done, can you give us any feeling for what your thoughts are on the range of potential accretion for next year and the 200,000 or lives we\u2019re talking about, what is your thought in terms of bracketing the percent that might convert to full risk to you?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, we typically will give you guidance with '15 in December. We\u2019ve been pretty consistent and not trying to get ahead of ourselves and we\u2019ll have more data at that point in time. Do you want to add anything, Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter","Yes, I mean the only thing I would say is we\u2019ve consistently provided a range of the potential outcomes on the price which is consistent with our past experience going through these types of member transitions which are subject to member choice and the process, working constructively with the state. As Michael said, we can\u2019t give anything more specific but I think our history has guided the structure, the transaction and the range of potential outcomes which is reflected in the range of value that we\u2019ve consistently disclosed.","A. J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And then just a last technical one on the Spanish deal, where are you going to report the results of that going forward?","Michael F. Neidorff","At this point we\u2019re thinking we\u2019re going to likely record that as part of the specialty segments.","A. J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","Next, we have Sarah James of Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to circle back on 2015 revenue. I understand that Ohio has lags in dual MA enrollment by design, but in other markets like California opt-outs running at 15% to 20%. So if I were to extrapolate that and say market-wide that\u2019s where opt-out is on a fully ramped full year dual allocation for Centene, it could be over 500 million I was estimating. So I\u2019m just wondering how much of that is already baked into the $18 billion number for 2015?","William N. Scheffel","I think that\u2019s hard really to pull apart that number at point in time. We\u2019ve added in the different product lines and the growth from the different states. It\u2019s not overly scientific in terms of the specific op-out percentage that we\u2019ve calculated. At this point we use more round estimates, I would say.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Okay. And then Georgia and Florida added Sovaldi to the NPDL with prior approval in April, so can you talk about the change in coverage for Georgia and Florida? How much of that contributed to the 6 million build in Sovaldi costs q-over-q? And then if you could comment just in your discussions in general with rate setters what the intention is for handling Sovaldi in the rates as they anniversary? I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s going to be big then or more likely a separate payment. Thanks.","William N. Scheffel","I think that as has been reported by many, the state by state hasn\u2019t taken different positions. Florida; its intention is to bake this in starting May 1 on the new Medicaid program with a kick payment and that\u2019s already been assumed in our guidance and other things like that. Texas, it hasn\u2019t yet been added to the PDO. We expect that to occur and we\u2019ll get reimbursed for that. So I don\u2019t think we want to go state by state through 20 states to say where each state is other than in general we\u2019re pleased that the states have all understood the impact of these therapies and what the costs are, particularly going forward and are working on mechanisms to make sure that we\u2019re fairly reimbursed for these costs.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.","I guess I was more talking about how the anniversary, so not this first year but next year if it moves from a kick payment to being baked in, if there is any kind of protection that you have if the amount of scripts changes?","Michael F. Neidorff","Let me try and help in the sense, Sarah, that these drugs tend to be curative and we see it plateauing off and so we\u2019re having discussions with the states on utilization and all the different alternatives that are open to us now. Sovaldi is one and if that\u2019s been in the market by that time for a year, because the new one is coming out and that would take a different approach. And Mary you\u2019re in the middle of all this.","Mary V. Mason","Yes. And it\u2019s good to see with all the productive conversations that we are having with the states, they do recognize and are discussing the new drugs that are on fast track for FDA approval later this year.","Michael F. Neidorff","So I think you have to really bifurcate it. Sovaldi is one issue that\u2019s plateauing out and its utilization is there, then you have the new drugs in the states and all this realize people maybe have been warehousing, it\u2019s considering all those factors. And so they don\u2019t plan to see that rest on our backs. They recognize the issue and they\u2019re working constructively. And if we saw some concerns we\u2019ll raise them for you.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next is Tom Carroll with Stifel.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups. I want to return to the services revenue line. I guess I\u2019m not clear on where you think that might end up on a full year run rate basis. And I think you mentioned this quarter, the revenues were somewhat peaking there. I mean does that imply a $1.5 billion line item for the full year? Are you comfortable with that?","William N. Scheffel","I would say they\u2019re plateauing as much as peaking and I think that 1.5 billion is probably a good round number for where we think we\u2019ll be for the year.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","About 400 million on a quarterly basis for the remainder of the year.","William N. Scheffel","Right, exactly. It may not be equal Q3, Q4 but something like that in total.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","So in thinking about that line item into next year, I think you said Sovaldi in hep C spending was a substantive heart of that growth. If hep C spending is going to either kind of continue to grow into next year or if the payer community comes together and competes it down, will this line item kind of move as hep C and specialty drugs spending will move? I guess that makes sense, right?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think Tom we\u2019ll be in a better position to discuss that in our December call when we\u2019re talking '15. We\u2019ve always been ahead of ourselves for all the years we\u2019ve been doing this. So we\u2019re going to stay pretty much the same. We\u2019ll talk to you about that in December.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Okay. I\u2019m just looking for kind of proxy for that line item to think about it into the next couple of years, but it sounds like\u2026?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, there is certainly a correlation on what you stated, but I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a perfect correlation.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Yes. And then secondly, I wondered if you would provide some further comment on your outlook on just kind of the rates overall and I believe your prior expectation was for kind of flat to up 2% and it sounds like you\u2019re leaning more towards flat now for the next kind of 12\u2026?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, that\u2019s correct. I think we expect that cross all the rate adjustments for this year, we expect it to be flat. I\u2019m not sure what more I can add to it.","William N. Scheffel","And I think that\u2019s consistent with what we said in June at the Investor Day.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Yes, it is. How much do you think of the kind of flat leaning rates into next year is related to like squeezing of the balloon, if you will, on the part of states? They\u2019ve got other stuff they\u2019re looking to fund right now. So as it comes back to establishing routine rates that we\u2019ve done for years and years, do you think that\u2019s driving the flat rates?","William N. Scheffel","I really think that\u2019s a very little portion of that because I think what we\u2019re really seeing as it relates to cost trends, in-patient levels, et cetera, we\u2019ve got minimum HBRs in several states, experienced rebates. When you factor all of those things together there is really no impetus to have a large rate increase. I think that\u2019s why flat seems to be the norm. It\u2019s really not because the states are trying to drive the rates down for unusual reasons.","Michael F. Neidorff","If they see the utilization, we see the utilization. As we\u2019ve talked about, our systems tend to be real-time and we\u2019re seeing flat because we don\u2019t see the arguments for something else.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Next, we have Chris Rigg with Susquehanna International Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wanted to follow-up on a couple of earlier ones, first, related to the Medicaid expansion lives. I guess can you give us a sense just to sort of level set expansion members versus traditional members, anything on in-patient days per 1,000, ER visits per 1,000, doc visits, something to give us a sense for the relative difference between the two populations?","Michael F. Neidorff","Mary?","Mary V. Mason","I mean obviously it\u2019s very limited experience at this time, but it\u2019s all within expectations.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","But I mean is the expansion population running meaningfully different than the traditional population or you just don\u2019t have enough info at this time?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think that from an HBR standpoint it\u2019s probably similar but we\u2019re getting higher rates.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","Sure.","Michael F. Neidorff","So as you result, you say it\u2019s a higher cost than what the typical population has been. Whether that continues we\u2019ll just have to see over time. What would happen is they would sort of come together.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay. And then my follow-up again is on hep C. I just want to be clear, peaking versus plateauing. When we think about the net cost in the second quarter, I think you said 15.7 million. Is that number expected to go down in Q3 and further down in Q4 or how should we expect total net cost to run for the year?","William N. Scheffel","I think the number that was stated was 13.7.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay.","William N. Scheffel","Which was an increase of 6 million \u2013 net cost of 6 million quarter-over-quarter. And at this point in time we think it\u2019s plateauing whether \u2013 if it stays that high we\u2019ll have to wait and see but certainly we\u2019ve seen the number of starts reduce, things like that, so we think until the new drugs come on later in the year and next year, we don\u2019t expect it to see the same level of growth.","Michael F. Neidorff","I think Mary\u2019s comment to us in meetings that the starts are plateauing.","Mary V. Mason","Right. So you\u2019re not only seeing a lower number of starts but you\u2019re also seeing people who are started earlier in Q1 and early Q2 completing their course of treatment. So we are seeing and it is plateauing.","Michael F. Neidorff","So let\u2019s call it plateauing and kind of leave it at that.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","Okay, great. Thanks, guys.","Michael F. Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have Andy Schenker with Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Good morning. Just to talk about the exchanges and marketplaces, I mean earlier you said the demographics were in line with your expectations. Can you maybe just talk about how that\u2019s feeding into your pricing expectations for next year and how you\u2019re positioning yourself? I mean a few news reports of some declines in a few states, obviously probably a few increases as well and could you just follow-up on the position for '15?","William N. Scheffel","The membership demographics are, as you indicated, in line with what we expect. What we continue to target, the lower income Medicaid churn population and that\u2019s why so many of our members are eligible for subsidies as well as our average age is within the range of expectations. For pricing for 2015, it\u2019s really too early to give any across the board indications. It\u2019s very much state-by-state and I think that we\u2019ll see \u2013 we go through a state-by-state analysis and where we come out on pricing will depend on the specifics that we see. But I think it\u2019s too early to know until later when prices are revealed in October.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","And maybe just a follow-up on that then. I mean in general obviously you\u2019re actually slightly ahead on enrollment this quarter than what you\u2019ve kind of suggested towards last [quarter] (ph). Are you generally happy with your enrollment numbers and therefore looking for maybe stable enrollment as the markets expand or any views on trying to increase your penetrations in some of your markets or is it just each market is so different that it\u2019s hard to generalize?","William N. Scheffel","Again, we\u2019re viewing the marketplace as an opportunity in states where it can be complementary to our Medicaid population. So we think we will see some growth as the market grows, but it\u2019s still going to be a relatively modest part of our business going forward.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then maybe just going back to the business expansion cost here, I just want to make sure I\u2019m understanding this right. So you\u2019ve now target $0.60 to $0.65 for the year versus $0.55 to $0.60 which is your guidance last quarter but you added $0.12 of transaction costs, so net-net is it right to think you\u2019re kind of lower by $0.06, $0.07 base expansion cost outlook for the rest of the year or were there other moving parts I\u2019m not properly factoring there?","William N. Scheffel","I think your point is that we didn\u2019t increase the business expansion cost by the level of the transaction cost we talked about for Q3 and I think that\u2019s a fact and that they\u2019re slightly down in terms of our estimate for our business expansion cost excluding transaction cost, not by a lot.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have Ana Gupte of Leerink.","Ana Gupte - Leerink","Thanks. Good morning. Wanted to follow-up quickly on the rate changes by state in your outlook that\u2019s flat. Any thoughts on how states that are expanding Medicaid might think about the rate increases for the expansion lives relative to the base population given the full federal subsidy around it? Are you thinking about it that way at all?","William N. Scheffel","No, I think states will go through their normal process while looking at rates for the Medicaid expansion population and go through the same actuarial analysis eventually based on the experience, so I don\u2019t think there will be anything unique about how they\u2019ll approach those rates compared to how they do on the core Medicaid business.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, I think it\u2019s important our numbers in terms of the rate trends for 2014 are flat. We\u2019re not giving any rate trends for 2015 at this point.","Ana Gupte - Leerink","So it could be a positive rate change. At this point you\u2019re not saying that '15 is flat.","Michael F. Neidorff","We\u2019re not saying anything. Ana, we\u2019re really saying \u2013 we\u2019re working on it now to having discussions and by December 15 we expect we\u2019ll be able to give you a good indication.","Ana Gupte - Leerink","Okay. I want to follow-up again on the CHS transaction. I think a couple of people asked I guess on the accretion for next year. Just trying to ask it a little bit differentially perhaps then. If you take your sort of mid (indiscernible) MLR in Louisiana, maybe you\u2019re SG&A shy of 10%. If you assume the risks and move to risk lives, what is sort of the timeline for a transition to get up to the max accretion you could get on that transaction?","William N. Scheffel","I think that there\u2019s still a lot of things to happen in Louisiana with respect to this transition, et cetera and so we\u2019re not prepared to talk about 2015 numbers for either membership or for the accretion that might come out of there. We have experienced in a number of states where we have added the membership to an existing plan that\u2019s generally gone well for us, but we\u2019re not quantifying that at this point in time. And as Michael indicated in our Investor Day in December, we\u2019ll probably have lot more \u2013 we\u2019re lot farther along in the process and be able to give a little more\u2026","Michael F. Neidorff","I think people who know us well enough that if we try to do something now, we\u2019re going to be conservative beyond what really one would be in December. We have a good view and the mislead in that direction is just as bad as being too optimistic. So it\u2019s just a little early.","Ana Gupte - Leerink","Okay, fine. And then moving on to duals, looking at the experience that you have so far, would you then say that you\u2019re breaking then for '14? And what would be the timeframe to get to sort of that 3%-ish to 5%-ish margin outlook in light of the savings that are being the schedule that\u2019s being stipulated?","William N. Scheffel","I think right now our duals experience is fairly limited in terms of the amount of time we\u2019ve been doing this in the Illinois and Ohio areas, so we\u2019re not giving any projections in terms of when we would get to normal run rates, et cetera; we\u2019ll see.","Ana Gupte - Leerink","But do you still think 3% to 5% is achievable at all or is there any reason to back off from that?","William N. Scheffel","I think the 3% to 5% we talk about are for our overall book of business and individual pieces can vary from that. And so I think we\u2019ll have to wait to see how our experience shakes out on the product over time and see, but we\u2019ll stand by the 3% to 5% for the overall book of business but the individual pieces I don\u2019t think we really want to speak to.","Ana Gupte - Leerink","And then the final question on the exchanges again, just a final follow-up on the '15. Looking at your rate changes for 2015 and several of the states that disclosed it, some of your peers that have at least said that they\u2019ve had some experience adverse experience in the first quarter, maybe even the early part of the second and their rate increases are quite substantial for '15. Yours have not been. Is that a way to \u2013 it can run into a (indiscernible) but that would mean that your '14 experience looked more favorable perhaps or again positive margin experience that you\u2019re looking more to gain share at this point over worrying about the margin for next year?","William N. Scheffel","I think part of that is where you\u2019re coming from and so depending on what you\u2019re initial rates were in 2014 and others were much more aggressive than we were in terms of the rates. Rone can speak to this in more detail, but I think we\u2019re pretty happy with where we started from and we\u2019re making our adjustments from that base.","K. Rone Baldwin","I think Bill said it well that in most states we are fairly considerably priced and that was reflected in our competitive position that clearly what our starting point is as we look at our rates for 2015. And again, as we said previously, there have been no real concerns or surprises based on our experience so far but it\u2019s very early as well.","Michael F. Neidorff","Just look at our target which is the low end of current net worth that type of thing.","Ana Gupte - Leerink","But it\u2019s still targeted the margin. I think you talked about \u2013 I forget now you\u2019re MLR. You said something and I gave it which was quite a nice result and you\u2019re sort of sticking with that since then. No changes there.","William N. Scheffel","I think we\u2019re talking about low 80s for the original HBR for the marketplace and \u2013 our pricing had one thing built into it and then we were putting into our guidance mid-80s.","Ana Gupte - Leerink","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have Steve Halper of FBR.","Steven Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yes, just two quick questions; the non-regulated cash on the balance sheet, was that 50 million or 15 million?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, 5-0.","Steven Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","5-0, thank you. And then going back to the Texas process to get the ACA fee, is that sort of wrapped up in your rate discussions for the coming year or is it a separate category?","William N. Scheffel","Each state has their own process to go through to deal with this particular issue and so the state of Texas is working through their process as we speak. And when it\u2019s all concluded, it will depend on how much they need to do the review and deal with it.","Steven Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Right, but is it \u2013 your discussions with the state, is it wrapped up in sort of a normal rate discussion?","William N. Scheffel","It\u2019s really separate.","Michael F. Neidorff","It\u2019s separate. To my knowledge they have separate discussions, same people, separate discussions.","Steven Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Yes, that\u2019s fair. Thank you.","Michael F. Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have Dave Windley of Jefferies.","David Windley - Jefferies","Hi. Just a follow-up on Steve\u2019s question there. Can you talk about what the gating factor is in the Texas process? Is it around the way that they will make that payment or is it \u2013 they kind of need a fiscal year deadline to push them to a decision? Is there \u2013 I guess why is their process taking longer than others states is essentially the question?","Michael F. Neidorff","It\u2019s just that you have various states, you have different politics, you have different elections taking place. You have a lot of different issues getting people to focus on as much as anything. The people we\u2019re talking to are discussing it, they\u2019re working it through their process. They have a whole process for any budget variations that are involved. And as we saw when we were talking rates in the Hidalgo Valley and others a year ago, they have a way of getting through it. It\u2019s not how fast but how well.","David Windley - Jefferies","Okay. Separately on utilization, were you able to tell\u2026","Michael F. Neidorff","I just want to make a point that up to this point, Texas has always been a responsible good partner that you can talk to these things about, so we\u2019re comfortable with this.","David Windley - Jefferies","Very good. So on utilization, were you able to tell in the second quarter if any of your utilization experience showed any kind of bounce back from the weather depression in the first quarter? In order words if not for that, would MLRs have been even better?","Michael F. Neidorff","Mary?","Mary V. Mason","No, we did not see any of the bounce back from the weather.","David Windley - Jefferies","Okay, great. And then last question, I believe CMS has taken up an initiative to look at, at how states are setting rates kind of looking at the overall rate setting process and the adequacy of that. Are you aware of that and how long do you think that kind of study will take and what the outcome of that might be?","Michael F. Neidorff","Rone will add to it. CMS has always had to sign off on the stage rate, so I mean that part is not new.","K. Rone Baldwin","We\u2019re not particularly seeing anything notable or significant based on the actions they\u2019re taking at this point.","David Windley - Jefferies","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Brian Wright, Sterne Agee.","Brian Wright - Sterne Agee","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Wright - Sterne Agee","Thank you. The number of employees accelerated. You\u2019ve been hiring a lot given your growth, but in the most recent \u2013 this quarter it was up like 10.5% sequentially and that\u2019s versus 8% in the prior quarter. I\u2019m assuming this is an anticipatory kind of employment growth. Is there any chance that that slows down a little bit for the back half of the year?","William N. Scheffel","A lot of those is new programs we added during the quarter, so Florida has had lot of activity, for example, we\u2019ve added a lot of people in Florida for the expansion for the Medicaid program and that\u2019s \u2013 when you see jumps like that is typically because of new products being added. It could be duals, it could be Cook Country where we\u2019re anticipating that starting July 1 in Florida.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, and it\u2019s going to be product specific too. I mean you have a lot more case workers when you\u2019re dealing with tools and long-term care. So it will be quarter-by-quarter based on what we see the growth to be. You always have to try and bring them out a little bit ahead of time.","Brian Wright - Sterne Agee","So it\u2019s a function of predictive a quarter of two ahead of what you\u2019re going to see then? Is that the best way to kind of think about it?","William N. Scheffel","It\u2019s aligned with the start-ups.","Brian Wright - Sterne Agee","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next, we have Kim Purvis of Cross Current Research.","Kimberly Purvis - Cross Current Research","Hi. I\u2019d like to approach the Medicaid expansion from a slightly different angle. Can you give us any additional color on the demographics of that group; male, female age, anything would be appreciated? Thanks.","K. Rone Baldwin","I don\u2019t have anything really to specify the distinction of the Medicaid expansion group from what we\u2019re seeing elsewhere in terms of it other than depending on the state-by-state kind of previous eligibility standards what income levels are coming in compared to the previous ones. But it\u2019s generally tracking based on my understanding what we\u2019re seeing broadly in the Medicaid programs.","Kimberly Purvis - Cross Current Research","But it wouldn't be sort of the typical [tenant] (ph) population. I'm assuming it's going to be more single adults, more individuals, along that line.","K. Rone Baldwin","No, it is more adults than children there\u2019s no question about that, but with respect to more specifics on the demographics than that, I don\u2019t think again other than what you generally see with income, we\u2019re not seeing a dramatic difference.","Kimberly Purvis - Cross Current Research","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Carl McDonald, Citigroup.","Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc.","Great, thanks. Had a bigger picture specialty pharma question. So it seemed like the industry got caught off guard by Sovaldi and specific to the Medicaids as we know weren't able to get it into rates ahead of time. Given the pipeline of specialty pharma drugs that's coming over the next couple of years, are there \u2013 maybe Sovaldi's the unique situation, but are there ways that you can get in front of that and get states to incorporate these things into rates ahead of time so that we don't sort of have to constantly go through this? Can we get it into rates after the fact and potentially lose money in the process?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think we\u2019re taking that point to the states. I think the states are as well. They're learning from the experience and what we established for the next line of hep C drugs we see for other drugs coming in the future. Once again, it\u2019s going to be the size of the population. There\u2019s some smaller population that some specialty pharma that are even more expensive. It\u2019s a smaller group and it may not be curative, it may be ongoing therapy. So what it is, is going to determine how we work at the states. It\u2019s not one size cuts all or \u2013 it\u2019s not a cookie cutter. You have to look at it and just show your flexibility and work with them effectively.","Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc.","And then to follow up on a response Mary had to one of the prior questions, when you said you didn't see a bounce back from the weather, were you saying that utilization levels in 2Q were similar to 1Q or are you saying 2Q utilization returned to normal, you just didn't see any pull-through of the 1Q utilization on top of the normal amount?","Mary V. Mason","Right. What I was referring to with the bounce back is I know there was a concern because of those days, I believe it was the end of January or early February that we would be seeing a lot more utilization in the coming months which we did not see. As we said with utilization, it was very stable utilization trends, flat ER, maybe a decrease in patient trends. So everything really looked very stable.","William N. Scheffel","I think within Q1 that might have been higher \u2013 seen that in March, we saw the weather was early in the quarter so if there was any deferred impact, a lot of that would have showed up in March. Second quarter stood on its own with normal seasonality compared to prior years.","Carl McDonald - Citigroup Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael F. Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, we have no further questions. We\u2019ll go ahead and conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks. Sir?","Michael F. Neidorff","I just want to thank everybody and look forward to reporting Q3 to you. Thank you.","Operator","We thank you sir and to the rest of the management team for your time today. The conference call has now concluded. We thank you all for attending today's presentation.

After today's presentation, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. Please note, today's event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ed Kroll, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Edmund E. Kroll - Centene Corp.","Thank you, Rocco, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our 2017 fourth quarter and full year earnings results conference call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeff Schwaneke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call, which can also be accessed through our website at centene.com.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recently filed Form 10-Q and Form 10-K and other public SEC filings.","Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.","The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our fourth quarter full year 2017 press release, which is available on Centene's website at centene.com under the Investors section.","Finally, a reminder that our next earnings call will be on Tuesday, April 24, 2018. Dates for all remaining investor events in 2018 can also be found in the Investors section of centene.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining Centene's fourth quarter and full year 2017 earnings call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2017 financial results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. As has become our practice, we will provide commentary around the healthcare legislative and regulatory landscape. We will also bring you up-to-date on the Fidelis acquisition.","I'd like to begin with an update on the healthcare legislative and regulatory landscape. A year ago at this time, the healthcare debate was front and center in Washington D.C. It consumed more than three quarters of the legislative year and the repeal and replace effort ultimately was unsuccessful.","Since then, comprehensive reform efforts have receded and more tactical legislation has emerged, most notably, the SCHIP program being reauthorized and funded for six years. In addition, several ACA taxes have been delayed, including the health insurance fee for 2019. As part of the tax reform package that passed earlier this year, the penalties associated with the individual mandate will be eliminated beginning in 2019, which we expect to have minimal impacts on us.","We are now seeing heightened regulatory action as CMS continues to promote efforts that give states additional flexibility. This aligns well with Centene's local approach. We believe these significant developments make repeal and replace for any significant healthcare reform unlikely in 2018.","We do anticipate Congress will look at ways to stabilize the marketplace and there continues to be strong bipartisan support to implement a reinsurance program. In addition, the reinstatement of CSR funding continues to be discussed as well as greater state flexibility via 1115 and 1332 waivers. We believe these improvements have a good chance of being included in an omnibus bill that passes in the first half of 2018.","On a separate note, we're pleased to announce that Jessica L. Blume was elected to serve on Centene's Board of Directors. She was appointed to both the Audit Committee and Technology Committee. She will stand for re-election at our April 2018 Annual Shareholders Meeting.","Ms. Blume brings us strong background in technology and finance as having previously held the position of Vice Chairman at Deloitte, where she was a partner for 20 years. She served as a member of Deloitte's U.S. Executive Committee and was a member of the Deloitte Board of Directors for the maximum two terms. In addition, she served as the Chair of the Executive Compensation and Evaluation Committee as well as a member of the Finance, Governance, Strategic Investment and Risk Committees.","Now, on to the fourth quarter and full year 2017 financials. 2017 was another year of strong growth and accomplishment for Centene, capped off by the robust fourth quarter results we reported this morning.","In 2017, we added almost 800,000 members, surpassing the 12 million member mark. We grew revenues by 19% to $48.4 billion and adjusted EPS by 14% to $5.03. These results compare favorably to our initial 2017 revenue guidance of $46.4 billion and adjusted EPS guidance of $4.63 at the mid-point.","Our cash flow from operations remains strong at $1.5 billion or 1.8 times net income. During the year, we stuck to our business as usual approach. We were not distracted by the headline volatility surrounding the repeal and replace noise in Washington D.C. Our shareholders benefited as Centene's stock price increased 79%, well ahead of our five-year CAGR of 38%. We continued to enhance our diversification plan by product and geography.","Centene successfully launched an expansion effort in Medicare Advantage in four of our Medicaid states under Allwell brand. We started new Medicaid contracts in Nebraska and Nevada and one new business in 2018 in Arkansas, Illinois, Pennsylvania, and the State of Washington. Overall, win rate in Medicaid RFPs is an industry-leading 80%.","We also continue to evaluate our organization structure in an effort to be most efficient with our growth and it is important to focus on G&A and ensure we're leveraging the incremental size of the company. In summary, 2017 was another successful year and our operating momentum remains strong as we head into 2018.","Next, I'll discuss federal tax reform. We know there is a great interest in federal tax reform and what effect it will have in 2018. Specifically, with respect to how companies will deploy the potential benefit of tax reform.","For Centene, we started with our company's purpose, transforming the health of the community one person at a time. We believe we can better serve our members and customers by continuing to invest in capabilities that serve our purpose.","With that said, we intend to use the benefit of tax reform to invest in growth and employee initiatives, including leadership development programs and other training, as well as technology and processes, including digital health and analytics. All of this will help drive our mission of better outcomes at lower cost. Jeff will go into further details regarding the financial impact of tax reform, as well he'll update 2018 financial guidance.","Now, I will discuss the acquisition of Fidelis Care. In October 2017, we were granted early termination of the waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino. We are currently moving through the process for New York regulatory approval. This is actually a dual-track approval process. First, the typical approvals necessary for a health plan acquisition in our industry, which are progressing at a reasonable pace.","And in this case, secondly, the Catholic Church is working with New York State officials on the mission of the foundation it intends to set up with the proceeds. Unfortunately, this portion of the process appears to be taking longer than expected. We continue to work towards an April 1, 2018 closing date. The initial integration planning is underway and going extremely well.","Next on the medical costs, including flu. The latest data indicate that flu season is more intense than last year. In my presentation at the Investor Conference in early January, I indicated we saw flu peak around the holidays. Subsequently, we saw flu trend up again to a second higher peak for our membership. We have not seen this happen in over five years. It clearly is higher than expected and a potential headwind for the first quarter. However, we remind you, we view flu trends as episodic and not indicative of our ability to manage overall medical costs. Importantly, we continue to see as well as anticipate overall stable medical cost trends consistent with our expectations in the low single-digits.","Moving on to market and product updates, first, we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity. New Mexico. Last month it was announced that our New Mexico subsidiary Western Sky Community Care was one of three vendors awarded a statewide contract for the Centennial Care 2.0 Program.","New Mexico's current program provides integrated Medicaid Managed Care coverage, including long-term support services and behavioral health to nearly 700,000 beneficiaries. We are particularly pleased to have been awarded this, as it was a re-procurement of an existing contract and Centene was not an incumbent. While there have been appeals and suits, we believe they're unfounded and will not ultimately be successful. We expect this contract to commence on January 1, 2019.","Centene currently operates in New Mexico through our Centurion subsidiary as the sole provider of correctional health services in 11 facilities throughout the state.","Illinois. In January, our Illinois subsidiary, IlliniCare, began operating under a new statewide contract serving Medicaid beneficiaries and needy children. Centene previously operated in 12 counties in the state. Under the expanded contract, we will operate in all 102 counties and materially increase our membership and revenue. Our new members should all be enrolled by April 1 with the exception of Foster Care, which is expected to commence on July 1. We were pleased to be the sole source provider for the Foster Care program.","Pennsylvania. In January, we began serving beneficiaries enrolled in Pennsylvania's new Long Term Care program in the Southwest zone. The remaining zones' start date vary and will be fully implemented by January of 2020. So far, our membership has come in above our expectations.","Washington. In January, Centene began providing managed care services to beneficiaries enrolled in the state's Apple Health Fully Integrated Care program in the north-central region of the state. This was a re-procurement of our existing contract and now integrates behavioral health into the program.","Arkansas. In February, we began managing a non-risk Medicaid special needs population comprised of individuals with high behavioral health needs and individuals with developmental and intellectual disabilities. In October 2017, our Arkansas joint venture with Mercy Health and LifeShare received a license to become a risk-based provider organization. Approved risk-based provider organizations will manage and take full risk of this population beginning in January of 2019.","Now on to Medicare. At year end, we served over 330,000 Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. We are pleased with the operating performance of the Medicare Advantage book of business in 2017. We applied the insights we gained in 2017 towards Centene's 2018 Medicare Advantage and D-SNP plans.","In January, we began operating MA and D-SNP plans in eight new Centene Medicaid states. These plans will launch under Allwell brand and are all eligible for a premium bonus under our 4 Star parent rating in 2018. The initial metrics for 2018 membership growth are in line with expectations. Upon the close of the Fidelis deal, we will also be serving Medicare Advantage members in New York. Over the long-term, we continue to expect our Medicare Advantage product to drive over 20% of our annual growth rate.","Moving on to Health Insurance Marketplace, at year end, we served just under 1 million exchange members. This represents a sequential decline of approximately 60,000 beneficiaries due to normal attrition. This was in line with our expectations. The Marketplace business performed well in the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. Our 2018 exchange focus remains on providing high-quality affordable health care to low-income individuals. We began offering exchange products in three new states in 2018: Kansas, Nevada and Missouri.","In January, we had over 1.6 million paid exchange members. The key demographics of these members, including age, gender, financial assistance and medal tier remain consistent with the comments made at our December Investor Day. This includes a modest shift from silver to bronze plans, which was anticipated. Upon the closing of Fidelis Care transaction, we will be offering exchange products in 16 states, up from 13 states last year.","Shifting gears to our rate outlook, for 2017 our composite Medicaid rate adjustment was an increase of approximately 1%. We are also expecting a composite Medicaid rate adjustment of an increase of approximately 1% in 2018. Separately, last week, CMS issued the 2019 Advance Notice and preliminary Medicare Advantage rates appear to be in line with our expectations.","In conclusion, 2017 was another successful year for Centene. Our strong fourth quarter result sets the stage to maintain our positive momentum into 2018. Centene has been and continues to be a growth company with expectations of growing both top and bottom line by double-digit percentages. We expect our margins to continue to expand as we maintain focus on process efficiencies through automation and increasing our scale.","Our pending Fidelis acquisition is expected to create significant value for Centene's shareholders and Fidelis' stakeholders, as well as provide high-quality, low-cost health care services to the most vulnerable populations in New York.","We have proven our ability to acquire and effectively integrate large acquisitions. We are confident in our ability to successfully integrate Fidelis. We are optimistic about our future and ability to continue to extend Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored health care.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff to provide further details on our fourth quarter and full year 2017 results, I would like to give you a heads up regarding a change in our reporting format. Due to our increasingly diversified platform and emphasis on product categories, we will be adding a supplemental revenue disclosure by product category beginning in the fourth quarter of 2018. Also, we will no longer be breaking out membership by state.","We thank you for continued interest in Centene, and I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Earlier this morning, we reported strong fourth quarter and full year 2017 results. For the full year, total revenues were $48.4 billion, an increase of 19% over 2016, driven by the full year of Health Net's results, growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and product and market expansions in 2016 and 2017. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the full year 2017 were $5.03, an increase of 14% over last year and 9% higher than our initial 2017 guidance midpoint.","Before I discuss the fourth quarter results, I would like to spend a few minutes and discuss tax reform. As Michael previously mentioned, we have adjusted our full year 2018 guidance to reflect tax reform, which is expected to benefit net earnings and cash flow by approximately $280 million in 2018. This is before additional investments of $60 million after tax to support growth and employee initiatives during the year, investments in technology and analytics and enhancing our capabilities to serve our members and state customers.","I'd also like to highlight that based on our expectations for the year, the benefit of the lower tax rate was not limited by minimum MLRs in our commercial markets. We will discuss the revised 2018 guidance, including the effective tax reform in a few minutes, but first, let me discuss the fourth quarter results.","We reported strong fourth quarter results with total revenues of $12.8 billion, an increase of 8% over the fourth quarter of 2016 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.97 this quarter compared to $1.19 last year. The decrease in adjusted diluted earnings per share compared to the prior year is the result of significant investment in growth initiatives in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the Marketplace and Medicare businesses and the impact of flu.","We spent $0.26 per diluted share on business expansion costs in the fourth quarter and $0.50 per diluted share for the full year 2017. For the fourth quarter 2017, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the following items: lower tax expense of approximately $125 million or $0.71 per diluted share associated with the re-measurement of our net deferred tax liabilities to a 21% tax rate as a result of tax reform that was passed in December 2017.","$40 million or $0.14 per diluted share, associated with a contribution to the company's charitable foundation in connection with the benefit from tax reform, additional expense of $22 million or $0.08 per diluted share associated with the lack of CSR funding by the federal government in the fourth quarter, amortization of acquired intangible assets of $0.14 per diluted share, and acquisition-related expenses of $0.02 per diluted share.","Let me provide some more details for the quarter. Total revenues grew approximately $900 million year-over-year primarily as a result of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, the expansions in new programs in many of our states in 2016 and 2017, including the expansion of the Missouri contract and the startup of our Nebraska and Nevada health plans in 2017.","This growth was partially offset by the fourth quarter of last year benefiting from $195 million of revenue associated with the MLR amendment in California, the one-year moratorium of health insurer fee in 2017 and lower 2017 membership in the commercial business in California as a result of margin improvement actions taken last year.","Moving on to HBR, our health benefits ratio was 87.3% in the fourth quarter this year compared to 84.8% in last year's fourth quarter, and 88% in the third quarter. The increase year-over-year is primarily driven by the benefit recorded last year related to the minimum MLR amendment in California. This decreased last year's HBR by approximately 170 basis points.","Additionally, the fourth quarter 2017's HBR was negatively affected by the additional expenses associated with the lack of CSR funding, higher flu costs, the premium rate reduction in our Medicaid Expansion business in California, effective July 2017, and performance of newer expanded markets, which initially operate at a higher HBR.","Sequentially, the 70 basis point decrease from the third quarter is primarily attributable to favorable performance in Medicaid, including premium rate adjustments as well as favorable performance in our Marketplace business. This was partially offset by increased flu costs of 30 basis points compared to the third quarter and the previously mentioned CSR expense, which accounted for a 20 basis point increase in the HBR for the fourth quarter.","The Marketplace business performed well in the fourth quarter and full year 2017. As previously mentioned, during the fourth quarter, we recorded additional expense of $0.08 per diluted share, recognizing the effect of the federal government not funding the CSRs. This primarily represents states, where we have receivable positions on CSRs at the end of the year. For the majority of our states, we have received CSR payments for 2017 that represent our full year CSRs.","As Michael previously mentioned, for January 2018, we have over 1.6 million paid members, which is higher than our expectations we discussed at our December Investor Day. We have updated our guidance to reflect our revised membership expectations.","Moving on, our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 10.5% in the fourth quarter this year compared to 9.4% last year and 8.9% in the third quarter of 2017. The increase in the ratio year-over-year is due to increased business expansion costs and the revenue recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the minimum MLR amendment in California, which reduced the prior year adjusted SG&A expense ratio. The sequential increase is due to the increased cost associated with the open enrollment periods for both the Medicare and Marketplace businesses.","We recognized an income tax benefit of $55 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 due to Income Tax Reform. Excluding the effective tax reform and the charitable contribution, our fourth quarter tax rate would have been 40.9%.","Now onto the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $10.1 billion at quarter-end, including $310 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.","Debt at year end was $4.7 billion, including $150 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 40.3%, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note compared to 43.7% at last year end and 41.2% at the end of the third quarter 2017. We are pleased with the continued deleveraging of the company by 340 basis points during the year.","Our medical claims liabilities totaled $4.3 billion at year end and represents 41 days in claims payable compared to 42 days last quarter. Cash flow provided by operations was $450 million in the fourth quarter and $1.5 billion for the full year 2017 or 1.8 times net earnings.","Next, I would like to provide an update on the Fidelis transaction. As Michael mentioned, we continue to work toward an April 1 transaction closing and expect to fund the transaction with approximately $2.3 billion of equity and $1.6 billion of debt. As we have indicated in our earnings release today, we have updated our guidance to change the equity issuance timing from February 1 to March 1. Again, these are guidance assumptions and the ultimate timing of the debt and equity financing will be subject to market conditions.","Lastly, turning to 2018 guidance, we have updated our 2018 annual guidance for several items and have included a table in our press release issued this morning to provide more clarity on the changes. We have updated our guidance for the following: an increase in our revenue at the midpoint of approximately $700 million associated with the higher membership expectations on the Health Insurance Marketplace business.","The additional membership also increased our GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share by approximately $0.14. The increase in revenue was partially offset by the effective tax reform, which decreased our revenue by over $100 million associated with the lower tax rate gross-up on the health insurer fee in the Medicaid business. This revenue adjustment has no effect on net earnings.","Additionally, as previously mentioned, we expect lower tax expense of approximately $280 million or $1.38 and $1.58 per diluted share impact on GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share respectively associated with tax reform. This is before the additional $60 million after tax or $0.30 per diluted share for investment in employees' technology and systems we previously discussed.","Lastly, as discussed previously, we have revised our share count to reflect the change in the equity issuance timing for the Fidelis transaction financing. This increased both our GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.06 per diluted share.","In summary, our updated full year 2018 guidance for revenue and earnings per share is as follows: total revenues between $60.6 billion and $61.4 billion, GAAP earnings per share of $5.91 to $6.25, and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.95 to $7.35.","Lastly, a quick comment on the quarterly spread of our earnings. As a result of the shorter open enrollment period for the Marketplace product and increased membership, peak membership is earlier than last year. As a result, we expect the distribution of our earnings between the first half and second half of the year to be similar to 2017. However, we expect slightly more earnings in the first quarter this year versus the second.","In summary, we are pleased with the company's fourth quarter and full year results and the momentum we carry into 2018.","That concludes my remarks. And, operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Today's first question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I was wondering if you would just comment on sort of the tax reform net accretion guidance and what sort of is assumed there for potential offsets. I guess the one that's top of mind for us, a bit of a concern, is just the New York State windfall tax that was proposed. Any thoughts there on what's in the numbers versus not?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah, I think \u2013 Jeff, do you want to start, then I'll pick up?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I think right now that is specific to New York and I think there was something in California. Those haven't passed, those aren't law at this point in time. So we have not projected anything in that other than the lower federal tax rate that's in our guidance today.","So again, it's early. We'll have to wait and see what the impact is on both the commercial and Medicaid business. But as I stated in our Investor Day, longer-term, we see opportunity in the Medicaid business. On the commercial side, it really depends on the competitive dynamics.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And there are (30:56) some federal laws and legislation on the amount of tax that a state can charge on those types of products, specifically Medicaid. And that was set up so they don't find a way to fund the Medicaid to their share of it through taxing. So I think this has a long way to play out and it's not something that we see having any short-term or longer-term effect on us.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Understood. That's very helpful. And just lastly for me, maybe on Marketplace, really strong numbers there, upside to enrollment. Curious to know from your perspective, Michael, where are you guys seeing that? Or how much of that growth is about competitors backing out at this stage? Where is that growth really coming from?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, I think we've retained about 80% of the population we had from last year. And I think we have the right networks, we have the right systems and capability to manage it and develop that reputation. We've entered some new states; Nevada and Missouri, we mentioned among \u2013 this is the third one. And so some of it's coming from those new states. If people are backing out and we're in that state, we obviously will pick up some of that membership. But most of it, I believe, is on our own account and how we're doing things and the reputation we have in the marketplace with the all-better (32:13) franchise.","Stephen Tanal - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Hi. Thanks. So good morning, guys.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Morning, Michael. So the first thing that sort of jumped out, it just sounds like the first quarter numbers you're expecting a little bit better than what the Street was expecting and better than the second quarter. I guess I understand that the Marketplace is off to a better start, but I'm surprised just based on flu, is it just simply you took bigger flu accruals in the fourth quarter to account for that because you knew it was coming when you closed the books? Or what? I'm curious why the 1Q numbers are strong.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, a couple things, Josh. I'd say, first, we have more commercial business mix than we used to have several years ago. So it used to be the first quarter had the least amount of earnings in specifically in the Medicaid business, but we've kind of flipped because of the entrance into the Marketplace and other commercial markets. And so with the open enrollment happening earlier this year, we do see higher membership coming on earlier than we did the previous year. And as we've mentioned, the earnings profile of Marketplace is it makes more money in the first quarter than it does in the fourth quarter.","So I think that's really driving the shift, is really the higher membership and an earlier date and the economic dynamics in the Marketplace product, where you actually make more money in the first quarter than any other quarter throughout the year because of deductibles, right?","So I think that's the phenomenon that we're trying to talk about, and it's just a little bit different than last year because the peak membership happens a couple of months earlier, right?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And I think relative to the flu, I mean, we've anticipated some of it. I talked about the second peak. So it's one element in total medical costs, and we have seen that there tend to be offsets. And I think part of the benefit of our scale and size and the population we serve, Josh, is that we do get offsets.","And I've said there is a little headwind on the flu. We recognize it, we monitor it carefully. We've had flu prevention programs and things. In some states it's higher than others. We see where it is higher it's a function of physician cost and some Tamiflu and some testing for the flu. So it's more the ambulatory-type costs that we're seeing on it, which is much more manageable.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Got you, got you. That makes sense.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. And just, I mean, one other thing. One month does not make a quarter or a year, right? I mean, we provide annual guidance, so...","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Yes. That's fair. That's fair. And then just a question on the sustainability of this tax reform benefit. I was also surprised to hear you say none of it's getting caught up in the minimum MLRs for the California commercial business, which was not surprising, but are you not seeing any state mechanisms? I know certain states, Texas for example, you guys are always paying a big rebate there. Are any of the states looking to \u2013 and I know we talked about California and New York with these windfall taxes but just more specifically, the mechanics around how your contracts exist today, do you not think any of that benefit flows back to the states? And then I'd be curious to get your perspectives on long-term. Do you think the states, if they're not capturing it, do you think they come back and try?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think I commented earlier on there are some legislative constraints. I might also comment, Josh, we encourage states to do what we do in Texas. We really like that program. We'll get the actuarially sound rates. We have the highest quality scores there, and they see that we're very efficient with the \u2013 when you're, say, giving them checks for $100 million and that, which is a very balanced way to do it versus just cutting across the board. And so I think you'll hear states talk about it as they go through budgets and things, but I'm not making any decisions on the basis that that's going to happen.","Joshua Raskin - Nephron Research LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Chris Rigg of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the -","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys, just the SG&A ratio in the fourth quarter. I mean, from afar it looks like there may have been some discretionary spending in there that was maybe not planned, but maybe I'm wrong. Just want to get a sense for how you looked at investment spending in the fourth quarter. Thank you.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","No. I think if you go back to what we said at our Guidance Day, we said we expected the SG&A ratio to be above 10.5%. I'm, obviously, excluding the charitable contribution. I'm looking at the adjusted SG&A ratio.","So really, it was kind of a preview for the costs that we expected to incur on the Marketplace and the Medicare open enrollment period. And if you recall, the government restricted their spending specifically on the Marketplace and so we kind of stepped in and filled the gap. And we added those dollars somewhere around the second and third quarter. So that was really new spending for us. When you look at our original guidance for 2017, that wasn't included, and we effectively took steps to invest in those products. And, obviously, with the results that we have, it's been very successful.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. The return on that investment in G&A was very worthwhile.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Understood. And then I apologize for coming back to the MLR floors and the dynamic there, but I just want to make sure, is there at all a component or a dynamic there where, because in certain states the statutory entity includes both Medicaid and the commercial, that helps keep you under the threshold? Or is that not the case? I'm trying to think about that in the context of the overall profitability of the Marketplace business generally. Thanks.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Well, I mean, I think that's one of the reasons why it's a little more complicated than you would think right off the cuff is because, in general, the basis that most states would have to leverage some form of tax would be the statutory financial statements. And you're right, there could be multiple products in each one, so it's not as cut and dried as everybody may seem to think.","Chris Rigg - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. It looks like the Florida invitation to negotiate was put out a few days ago. Could you just update us on how Centene did on that versus your existing regions? And one of your competitors was talking about possibly a protest, so just would love your thoughts on whether or not there was anything unusual in this RFP the way it was set up. I know some states like Ohio had problems in the past, so just was there anything unusual in this one?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah, I'm not going to comment on what we've been asked to do and not do, that's up to the states to comment on it. I will tell you that I'm not unhappy with what they've asked us to do. And that as it goes forward, I think the world is watching individuals more and more who are not successful for various reasons filing protests, and there's a mechanism and it's their right. And we'll let those things play out. And \u2013 but we're confident that our business in Florida is sound, and we've delivered on their expectations, so we'll continue to do well there. Chris (39:57), anything you want to add?","Unknown Speaker","No, I would just add, Michael, and reiterate that we were real pleased with the way that the process is turning out so far and there's more to come.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Great. And just a follow-up on guidance. I appreciate you walking through a few of the moving pieces on MLR guidance as we think through the bridge from this year to next year. Just wanted to clarify if there was a step-up or step-down in expected flu costs in 2017 to 2018; and then if there's any books that are anticipated to improve. So for example, I know that Pennsylvania ABD is relatively new, so has that matured yet or is it still ramping?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yes. With respect to the flu, I think, Michael kind of covered that. Flu is only one component of medical costs. We're talking about one month out of an entire year right now. That's all we have really information on, a little over a month. And so I think I'll just leave that there.","And your second question, I mean, we're obviously \u2013 I mentioned in the fourth quarter results the commentary about the higher HBR and our new plans. And yeah, we absolutely expect improvements in, I would say, the Nebraska, Missouri, Pennsylvania. Usually, there's continuity in care provisions and new programs, and so if there's nothing different than what we have historically said that they run higher HBRs for the first six to nine months and then we expect those to come down with medical management initiatives, so nothing new there.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I might just add, Sarah, that we book a higher number even in what may be calculated, just in the interest of abundance of conservatism.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I wanted to go back to a comment you made about 2019 and the thought that the individual mandate repeal is not going to have a meaningful impact on the business. Just wanted to get some color from you guys around why that would be the case, I guess first on the exchanges. And then second, obviously, one of the things that kind of surprised people when Medicaid Expansion went on was the Woodwork Effect and all the people who came out to get insurance there. Thoughts about how that mandate impacted the potential Woodwork dynamic and why that wouldn't be a headwind going forward.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, sure, Kevin. I think our population, we have really focused on sticking to our knitting, as the clich\u00e9 goes, we're very focused on a given level of socioeconomic that's consistent with our population. And that population gets full reimbursement or full coverage for those costs. And so therefore, it's not a question of them having to join or what it's going to cost them because they get the coverage. And so we said it will have a minimal effect on us, we won't say it won't have any, but I think our growth in the overall marketplace and how we're executing on it, we see no reason why that's going to change in 2019. And as I said, the individual mandate, it has very little impact because of the level of coverage our population will receive.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I guess on the Woodwork Effect, how do you think about that? If not the mandate helping that then what kind of drove that effect?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, I think just the overall impact of the plans and what we're able to offer and once again, the socioeconomic coverage. I mean, the premium subsidies are in the legislation, so when they did away with the CSRs, our population continued to be able to enroll with subsidies through the premium. Now it's been well publicized; it'll cost the government more money that way. And that's why I think they're going to reconsider CSRs going forward. So as people came out and wanted the coverage, the population we serve still had the premium subsidies to protect them.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And I guess this guidance is actually pretty strong guidance. I'm used to you guys providing guidance in December and then basically just kind of reaffirming it when you report the Q4 results because it hasn't been that different. Obviously, tax reform is a unique item and the Fidelis timing also kind of unique items, so you've done things like that in the past on moving guidance on timing. But I don't remember the last time you actually raised guidance on a core basis so quickly, so just wondering kind of what gave you the confidence this early in the year to do that? And how you think about the momentum?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, I mean, I think if you go back, it's just really membership expectations and actual results that we have so far on the Marketplace business. I mean, back in December, I think, we kind of guided to a number of around 1.3 million paid members. And now we're looking at something greater than 1.6 million. So from that perspective, it's just more time has passed and we have certainty on the number of enrollees, and we're obviously \u2013 it's been a very successful open enrollment for us. And so we felt we needed to change guidance for the additional revenue and earnings that that's going to deliver.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I'll add a little more color to it. At a conference in January, I estimated 1,450,000 people, but what's happened here is you typically would see in the 70s conversion for most people to sign up and actually pay a premium. Well in this particular year, we had a whole lot more people. I'm not going to get super specific, but we had a much higher percentage convert and pay the premium. And so when you see that happening, it says they wanted the insurance and it gives you some confidence that it's going to stick.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Maybe I could just continue along on that thread on the ACA exchange membership. So you say you're looking at about 1.6 million. I guess, what I'm wondering is how are you measuring and what kind of fix do you have on the composition of that membership relative to your typical profile of low income, mostly subsidized members.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yes, I would say that as we said at our Investor Day and I'll restate it that everything we've seen, the profile of the membership is basically where we have historically received in that. There was a few percent shift from the silver to the bronze, but other than that, the gender, age, every aspect of it is consistent with what we historically have attracted.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And as you find yourself in markets where you're the only carrier providing coverage, to what extent are you having to fend off maybe regulatory pressure to change your network to make it fit a broader spectrum of potential insureds?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","No, I would say that we are what we are. We're basically the Medicaid coverage. We have some Medicare now that is also looks to those traditional providers, and we're not going to try and be more than that. Now I want to remind people, while we're the, in some markets, the only exchange product, there are other individual products that may be available through some insureds-type products. But from an exchange standpoint, no, there's been no pressure from the states, and we would be very quick to resist any pressure to change and move away from what is our traditional membership.","Matthew Borsch - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Morning.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Shifting to MA, I'm curious if you could describe kind of your level of satisfaction with the enrollment that you've seen in some of your expansion markets for Medicare Advantage and then also your reaction to CMS's proposed change to the calculation on crosswalking, if you think that'll stick and how you might mitigate your 2019 Stars impact if that is not available to you. Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think there's several factors. We've been satisfied that we're continuing to build the Medicare as we did the early stages of the exchange products, and we're sticking to that methodical growth and being very careful about it. And it's growing at said (49:23) levels. And it's not just that, it's between now and the end of the year because once again there's programs to enroll individuals as they become age eligible to move into Medicare. So that aspect of it is not a problem.","Relative to the crosswalk, that's not been fully defined, and we continue to talk to CMS about the calculations and how they reach the level of our Stars. And there was some double jeopardy. And I remind everybody, this was before Centene owned Health Net that this all occurred. So we're working through it, and I think we're finding that CMS is listening to our arguments. And it still has a little ways to play out.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Would you expect those conversations to conclude before you submit bids for 2019? Or what do you think the timing would be on having clarity on that?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Oh, I think we will have some clarity in the very near future. But 2019, we'll look at our bids, what's appropriate to bid, not just based on that.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Sure. All right. Thank you.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Let me just \u2013 I want to be very careful. This is a one-year issue for 2019, and that's the benefit of having our scale and size. When you're a $62 billion company, you can look at it and say there are offsets to that one year. And so as I look at it, if it was a multiple year and a big issue, then it would be something else. But right now it's well within our scope of copability.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question today comes from A. J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Hello, everybody.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","First, Michael, you mentioned the waiver process and states going through that, and I know we have two states, Kentucky and Indiana, that have so far been approved to add a work requirement and others are looking at it. What is your view on that? And are there particular aspects to those waivers that you're trying to make sure that are included as they roll those out?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, we're working carefully with the states and talking about it. I want to be careful when I'm talking to states that they don't hear about something that they haven't announced. But I will tell you this, on the work, I'm an advocate of it. When we do what we do, we look at what's sound public policy, and looking at where we are and what's affordable and where things are, I think it would be very important to do that. And as they become successful in the workforce, they can move over and join our exchange program.","A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Just a point on the quarter, we saw the Services business grow, I think, 9% after two quarters, where year-to-year it was down. Is there anything to highlight there? And do you expect to see growth in the Services business in 2018?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Jeff, you want to take that?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. A couple things. I would say the Services business is a little bit lumpy on the top line, really driven by contract reconciliations for the Centurion business, the Fed Services business. The other thing is we did have a small acquisition where we added cystic fibrosis to our specialty pharmacy company, so that will add a little bit of revenue. But I think I mentioned at our Investor Day we're looking at maybe a couple hundred million dollar growth year-over-year, 2017 to 2018.","A. J. Rice - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question today comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Wanted to follow up on your comments around the Fidelis deal. The discussion around the foundation is really helpful. The other thing that was in the Governor's budget was looking to collect I think it was $750 million from conversions, M&A, et cetera, kind of like some kind of not-for-profit tax on conversion. So can you talk a little bit about this? From the perspective that they're looking for $750 million, we don't know how they're going to calculate it. I don't know if it's per deal.","And then the Fidelis agreement indicates that they have a maximum number set aside in terms of proceeds, where I think they said anything above $375 million less than proceeds could break the deal. So I'm curious, if it is $750 million, how you would look to bridge that, potentially just increase the purchase price et cetera. So any kind of comments around those two things would be really helpful. Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Sure. First, I'll tell you that those are negotiations between the cardinal and seven other archbishops and so I want to be very careful to not interject myself in the middle of it. That we're going to pay them $3.75 billion for the business and I'm not going to increase that, okay?","Now if they decide they want to pay a little bit more, which might make sense from their perspective, to get the balance of that money, great. So I think at this point, I'm going to let them and the Governor and the AG's office have that negotiation. I know it's ongoing. And the best thing I can do is stay out of it. Because we're working through the other side of it very effectively and we're pleased with how that's going. Chris Koster has been driving that for us. He's a former AG here in Missouri who has joined our staff, and is very effective in dealing with regulatory issues.","So I'm trying to be as diplomatic as I can and tell you that I think the church has every interest to get this done because are they better off getting nothing or some significant portion of the $3.75 billion. I think the difference between the $750 million you quoted and I'm not going to give any credence to that and the $375 million is a mere $375 million.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Right, no, that makes sense. Then just to be clear, if there's a delineation between the foundation, which is always kind of set up with any (56:34) kind of not-for-profit conversion like there was with Empire when it made the conversion to for-profit status and the $750 million, right? This is a tax on the top. Whatever is left would be expected to go into a foundation and that's a separate...","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Justin, this is very different. They went from a not-for-profit to a for-profit status. This is a not-for-profit company. Which one, there is no conversion because you're buying assets, okay?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Right.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","So it's the matter of some negotiations where they say they have a foundation that owns the plan so to speak, in a manner of speaking. And so it's now converting from that asset to a cash, and the state may see this as an opportunity in discussions to say we should get some small portion of that, and that's fine. But it's very different than an Empire conversion, and it's just very distinctly different.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, that's helpful. Thanks, Michael.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi.

Does that imply 4Q development was negative or it was just less positive than 4Q of 2016? Could you help us out?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","The rolling figure is a 12-month number, I believe, right?","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Right.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","So but at the end of the day, again, the way we look at development is consistency as a percentage of medical costs, and I think we've historically been into the 1.1% to 1.2% of medical cost as development.

Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","It's been rising for seven quarters in a row, and it's dropped off about $100 million sequentially. That's just why it jumped out.

As part of our ongoing fair value analysis during the second quarter, we recorded a premium deficiency reserve of approximately $300 million, due to unfavorable performance in some of Health Net's business operations. The PDR covers the period March 24 to December 31 of 2016.","We have taken significant actions over the past few months to improve the business operations for 2017 and beyond.

Please note, this had no effect on third quarter earnings. The largest component of the PDR is $110 million related to the California commercial business. We negotiated with the Californian Department of Insurance the necessary benefit changes.","On October 3, we submitted our filings to the CDI with the 2017 plan designs and rate adjustments. These substantial benefit design changes allowed us to reduce our original 23% rate increase to 9.9%.","Some of the key benefit changes included the first time inclusion of an out-of network deductible for platinum and gold plans of $5000 for an individual and $10,000 for families; a significant increase in the out-of-network maximum out-of-pocket level to $25,000 for an individual and $50,000 for a family; the elimination of non-emerging out-of-state coverage and travel network access; the elimination of the default rate of 75% of billed charges to out-of-network services that do not have a Medicare rate; the reduction of reimbursement for out-of-network physicians and other services in supplies to 100% of the Medicare rate from the 85th percentile of FAIR Health and 190% of the Medicare rate, respectively; and restrictions on third-party premium payments, which were not included in the original 2016 offering.","We believe these substantive changes will significantly strengthen our control of out-of-network utilization, which was the main driver of the PPO cost issues.","In addition, we expect to further improve the operating performance of these products with the implementation of Centene's medical management tools as well as network enhancements. We appreciate the collaboration efforts of the CDI through the process. We expect the rate and benefit design changes to create a more competitive product in 2017 and allow for a balanced book of business.","Let me now go through the remaining components of the PDR and the corrective actions we have taken outside of California. First, $70 million related to Arizona individual commercial. We will exit the Arizona individual PPO business effective January 1 of 2017. This exit represents $32 million of the $70 million loss.","The remaining $38 million of the loss is associated with the individual HMO exchange product in Arizona. We have reconfigured our geographic presence, increased rates and redesigned benefits. We will remain in Pima County and in the Maricopa County as the only carrier. We expect the Arizona exchange to generate $500 million in incremental revenue and operate within our normal marketplace margins in 2017.","Second, $15 million related to Arizona Medicaid. As of July 1, this business has been fully transitioned to Centene's operating platform. We expect Arizona Medicaid to be profitable next year. Third, $20 million related to other smaller items, including the Arizona small group and Oregon individual business. We have apprised the rate increases and benefit design changes to address these issues.","And lastly, $70 million related to Medicare Advantage, we submitted bids in June and are taking actions on unit costs and medical management initiatives to achieve profitability next year.","Next, let's talk about Health Net integration. The integration process continues to go well and we remain on track or ahead of schedule in many areas. We have now completed the actions needed to capture all of the $75 million first-year synergy target.","During the third quarter, we began the conversion of Health Net's California plan on to Centene's medical management system. We expect this conversion to help drive better operating performance through the application of Centene's award-winning case management tools and programs.","Turning to third quarter financials. Membership at quarter end was 11.4 million members, representing an increase of 6.6 million beneficiaries over the third quarter of 2015. Total revenue increased 86% year-over-year to $10.8 billion. On a sequential basis, total revenues declined by $50 million due to exchange membership attrition and the eligibility re-determine process in California Medicaid. This is partially offset by commencement of Medicaid expansion in Louisiana, and all of these were expected.","Note the re-determine results in a sequential loss of approximately 61,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in the states. It has now been completed and roughly 16,000 members were added in October. The HBR improved 200 basis points year-over-year to 87%. This was primarily attributable to the commercial product mix shift from Health Net. Importantly, we continue to see stable medical cost trends, consistent with our expectations in the low-single-digits.","Lastly, on a GAAP basis, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.84. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.11, or $1.16 when excluding a $0.05 expense related to the 2015 risk adjustment and reinsurance reconciliation under the Affordable Care Act. Recall that, in the second quarter, we recorded a $0.19 diluted EPS benefit related to this reconciliation. Thus, the net benefit we have recorded in the past two months is actually $0.14.","Jeff will provide further financial details, including updated 2016 guidance.","Now on to market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. In August, Centene was one of three plans selected to serve long-term care recipients enrolled in Pennsylvania's HealthChoices program statewide. This program covers more than 420,000 individuals who are dually eligible and those with physical disabilities.","This contract will be rolled out in three tranches; the southwest zone will be the first to go live with an expected start date of July 1, 2017. The southeast zone is expected to commence January of 2018, and the remainder of the state expected to begin on January 1, 2019.","Pennsylvania marks Centene's 10th state managing long-term care for long-term care beneficiaries. We are the largest provider of long-term care support services, one of the fastest-growing segments of the managed care market. While the contract has not been finalized, we expect that it will ramp up and be profitable within a normal timeframe.","Alabama. In September, the Alabama Legislature approved the funding needed to create its regional care organization structure. Centene's specialty solutions division, Envolve, has contracted with five non-profit RCOs in the state to provide management services. Operations are expected to commence July 1 of 2017. This award highlights Centene's depth and breadth of management services under our Envolve brand (13:27).","Missouri. Last week, we were pleased to be selected to provide managed care services to Medicaid recipients in all 114 counties in Missouri. This award is a successful re-procurement and expansion of Centene's presence in the state. This expanded program covers over 240,000 additional Medicaid beneficiaries in Missouri, bringing the total number of individuals covered to over 740,000 lives. The program is expected to commence May 1, 2017.","Next, Medicare and duals. At quarter end, we served over 300,000 Medicare and dual beneficiaries. We continue to move forward with our growth plan to expand our Medicare Advantage footprint into Centene's Medicaid states next year.","We are launching new MA plans in Texas, Florida, and Mississippi. These new plans will be launched under our four-star parent rating and are eligible for a 5% premium bonus. In Georgia, we are using our existing Special Needs Plan to launch Medicare Advantage. This plan will also be eligible to a quality bonus.","Consistent with Centene's overall strategy, we will focus on low-income Medicare beneficiaries. We fully expect to have a profitable MA business in 2017.","Let me make a brief comment on the recently announced 2018 Medicare Advantage Star ratings. We are pleased to have maintained our four-star parent rating. Seven of our plans saw an improvement in Star ratings and seven plans' Star ratings stayed the same. Our Oregon plan's Star rating declined from 4 to 3.5 stars, primarily due to a reduction in Part D scores.","This was the result of the addition of a deductible to our prescription drug benefit, which was done to improve profitability. This issue was limited to the Oregon market. Maintaining a high-quality Star rating is a top priority for Centene.","Now, Health Insurance Marketplace. Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable, and we are achieving margins at the high-end of our targeted range. Our marketplace strategy is different from most of our peers. We design our exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform, excluding provider networks, as we are focused on low-income subsidized individuals.","In the third quarter, over 90% of our exchange revenues were subsidy-eligible. This is consistent with our prior experience. We ended the quarter with over 580,000 exchange members in 15 states. We continue to anticipate serving approximately 550,000 exchange members at year-end due to normal attrition. Overall, we continue to expect our marketplace offerings to be profitable next year.","Shifting gears to our rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect a 2016 composite rate adjustment of between 0% and 1%, consistent with the past few years. In summary, we are optimistic about the future of our ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored healthcare. We are on track with the integration of Health Net.","We have taken the necessary actions to substantially improve the underperforming markets and products covered by the 2016 PDR. Our growth pipeline is bigger than ever, and we continue to expand our Medicare Advantage market. We remain committed to long-term margin expansion and continue to make the necessary investments in systems and infrastructure to successfully execute our strategy.","As a reminder, our next Investor Day is on December 16 in New York City. As is our custom, we will provide full first-time 2017 financial guidance.","I would like to make a couple of comments on our expectations for 2017. At this time, we believe total revenues will be approximately $46 billion at a minimum. This represents $1 billion increase over the estimates we provided at the June Investor Day and a 15% increase over 2016.","Importantly, the outlook continues to be favorable, despite the fact that the denominator is significantly larger. Equally, while we are still finalizing our AOP or annual operating plan for 2017, we have no reason to believe that the consensus estimate for 2017 will be outside our target range.","Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our third quarter financial results.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning I will begin with highlighting the results for the third quarter of 2016 and provide an update on our 2016 full-year guidance. For the third quarter 2016, Centene's membership was 11.4 million members, an increase of 137% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition.","Total revenues were $10.8 billion, an increase of 86% over Q3 of 2015. Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $0.84 compared to $0.75 last year and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2016 was $1.11 compared to $0.87 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share includes a charge of $0.05 per diluted share associated with the Arizona risk-adjustment program.","During the third quarter, we received information from CMS that some of the participants in the Arizona risk-adjustment program were unable to pay the amounts owed to the federal government associated with the 2015 risk-adjustment reconciliation. As a result, the uncollected risk-adjustment amount was pro-rated to all insurers in the market.","Accordingly, we recorded a charge of $0.05 per diluted share, recognizing our portion of the risk adjustment that will not be collected, which reduces the $0.19 per diluted share benefit we recorded in the second quarter of 2016.","Now, for some more specifics. Total revenues grew year-over-year by $5 billion in the third quarter, primarily as a result of the Health Net acquisition, expansions or new programs in many of our states in 2015 and 2016, and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2016.","Sequentially, our revenues were slightly lower than the second quarter, due to lower commercial membership, primarily as a result of expected attrition in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and lower membership in the California Medicaid program as a result of annual eligibility re-determinations completed by the state. This was partially offset by growth in other markets, specifically in Louisiana Medicaid expansion.","Our health benefits ratio was 87% in the third order this year, compared to 89% in last year's third quarter and 86.6% in the second quarter of 2016. The 200-basis-point decrease year-over-year results from the addition of Health Net as well as the growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, both of which operate at a lower HBR. Sequentially, the 40-basis-point increase in the second quarter reflects normal seasonality in the business.","We continued to deliver strong membership and margins in the Health Insurance Marketplace business during the third quarter. The product continues to achieve margins at the high-end of our targeted range and we now have over $329 million accrued as a risk-adjustment payable for services provided in 2016.","For 2016, we continue to record reinsurance at the 50% coinsurance rate, record no-risk corridor receivable and record the risk adjustment utilizing the information we received from the data aggregators, consistent with 2015.","Our general and administrative expense ratio was 9.2% in the third quarter of this year, or 9.1% excluding the costs associated with the Health Net acquisition, compared to 8.4% in the third quarter of last year and 9% in the second quarter of this year, also excluding Health Net acquisition costs.","The increase year-over-year reflects the addition of the Health Net business, which operates at a higher G&A ratio due to a greater mix of commercial business. Sequentially, the 10-basis-point increase is due to lower revenue in the third quarter.","During the third quarter, we incurred $0.07 per diluted share of business expansion costs, primarily associated with the Texas STAR Kids award and the 2017 Medicare expansion, compared to $0.05 per diluted share in the prior year.","Investment and other income was $33 million in the third quarter of 2016, compared to $8 million for the third quarter last year and $32 million in the second quarter of this year. The increase year-over-year is a result of the larger investment balances associated with the Health Net acquisition.","Interest expense was $57 million for the third quarter of 2016, compared to $11 million for the third quarter last year and $52 million in the second quarter of this year. The increase year-over-year is primarily due to the financing associated with the Health Net transaction. The sequential increase is due to the full-quarter effect of the $500 million of additional senior notes we issued in June of 2016.","Our tax rate for the quarter was 53.8%, compared to 48.3% in the prior year. The higher tax rate is driven by the acquisition of Health Net. During the third quarter, we received approval of our refund in connection with our tax position with respect to 162(m)(6), or the limitation on the deductibility of certain executive compensation. As a reminder, we expect to be subject to 162(m)(6) limitation in 2017 as a result of the Health Net acquisition.","GAAP diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the third quarter was $0.84 and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the third quarter was $1.11. Both amounts include a $0.05 diluted earnings per share charge associate with the Arizona risk-adjustment program previously discussed. As a reminder, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.12 associated with the Health Net acquisition costs and $0.15 associate with intangible amortization.","Cash and investments totaled $8.1 billion at quarter-end, including $268 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Debt on September 30 was $4.6 billion, including $300 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio is 44.1%, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note, compared to 44.4% at the second quarter of 2016.","Our medical claim liability totaled $3.8 billion at September 30, representing 41 days in claims payable. The days in claims payable decreased during the third quarter due to annual provider risk share settlements of approximately $115 million in our California market as well as the timing of claims payments at the end of the quarter.","We had strong operating cash flow for the third quarter of $480 million or 3.3 times net earnings. This was primarily driven by net earnings, collection of outstanding capitation payments and prepayment of amounts from CMS associated with the Medicare product. This was partially offset by payment of the health insurer fee of $513 million at quarter-end.","A quick update on the substance abuse claims. During the third quarter, we revised our estimate of the level of substance abuse costs we anticipated to incur between the acquisition date and the end of the year. As you recall, we established a reserve of $50 million in our acquisition accounting in the second quarter as an estimate of the liability associated with these claims for the period from March 24 through December 31 of 2016.","Based on the level of incurred and projected claims through the third quarter, we have lowered our estimate from $50 million to $35 million. This adjustment had no effect on earnings. We continue to evaluate the fair valuation associated with the substance abuse claims and expect to complete that analysis in the fourth quarter.","As Michael mentioned in his comments, we have taken actions associated with products that were included in the PDR, including product design, premium rates, product exits, and numerous medical management and network initiatives. Based on the action we have taken, we believe we have resolved the issues associated with the 2016 premium deficiency reserve for 2017. We look forward to providing more details in full 2017 guidance at our normal December Investor Day.","Lastly, an update on our 2016 full-year guidance. As described in our press release this morning, we are adjusting our guidance for the risk-adjustment charge related to the Arizona recognized in third quarter.","As we previously disclosed, during the second quarter of 2016 we recorded a benefit of $0.19 per diluted share and increased our full-year guidance for the 2015 reconciliation of the risk adjustment and reinsurance provisions of the Marketplace business at that time. As a result of the information received from CMS in the third quarter, the benefit recorded in the second quarter was reduced by $0.05 per diluted share to $0.14 when combining both quarters.","We have updated our 2016 guidance accordingly. Our updated annual guidance is as follows. Total revenues of $39.4 billion to $40 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.73 to $2.83, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.28 to $4.38, G&A ratio of 9.4% to 9.9%, the G&A ratio excluding the transaction costs of 9% to 9.5%, an effective income tax rate of 54.5% to 56.5%, and diluted shares outstanding of 162.5 million shares to 163.5 million shares.","The guidance above implies a fourth quarter GAAP diluted earnings per share of $0.83 to $0.93 and an adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.05 to $1.15. This range now includes business expansion costs, which we expect to be at the high end of our guidance range of $0.25 to $0.30 in the fourth quarter, driven by increased costs associated with our expected Health Insurance Marketplace growth in 2017.","We continue to estimate our operating cash flow on a long-term basis to be between 1.5 times and 2 times net earnings. As previously highlighted in the second quarter, we do anticipate that there will be variability in our cash flow from quarter-to-quarter, depending on the timing of payments to certain states associated with minimum MLR programs, primarily in California.","Subsequent to quarter-end, we received amendments to our California contracts with the Department of Health Care Services to amend the Medicaid expansion medical loss ratio definition. All reconciliation periods remain open. However, we expect the amendment to reduce our minimum MLR liability and are currently working with the state to evaluate the impact of the amendment.","That concludes my remarks. And, operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. And your first question this morning will be from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, Michael. I wanted to start on the 2017 commentary. I think that was really helpful. It just gave us some direction before December. And if I think about the consensus and compare that to the updated guidance excluding the $0.14 of good guidance this year, it implies just around 15% growth, which is exactly in line with what the top-line expectation is.","And so I'm curious, your margins are still running below your long-term goals. Is there some sort of conservatism in there? I would have expected, with some of the synergies and it sounds like you're assuming the full $300 million of Health Net comes back, are there some headwinds from a margin perspective or is this just sort of a conservative place to start?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think at this stage, in our AOP, annual operating plan, process it's a safe place to be. So we're going through the final process. We're looking at start-up costs and the various new products we have, et cetera. And so we really are outside our pattern. I'm not saying much of anything about earnings until the December call. But we felt that with all the things out there, we would give some indication. And then we'll give you a lot of granularity and a lot more color in December, Josh.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Okay. That's fair. Maybe just on Arizona, you've got two of the bigger counties where you are going to be the sole remaining exchange carrier. It sounds like you're expecting that to remain profitable. And I'm curious, just based on the market exits from others, what gives you the comfort? Is there that dramatic a difference in your plan design and rates relative to what others in the market were providing?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think this is a pure HMO. We have the right rates, the right positioning. It's one that has been very successful for us in other markets. And really we exited the PPO in those and the HMO Health Net had was not as well-structured. And so we're confident that it will be profitable.","Do you want to add anything, Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Josh, this is Jesse Hunter. So, just a couple of things. One, we will be the sole carrier for Maricopa County on the exchange, but not in Pima County. We'll be one of two in Pima County. So I think it is important to provide a little bit of context for Arizona marketplace just in general.","I think the starting point for the whole market was off, right? So, that's what drove a lot of the carrier exits. You had grandmothering of policies. You had a number of other things. So Health Net had that experience. That experience has been fully reflected in our plan for 2017.","In addition, we have added new products. Particularly in Maricopa County, we've added a new silver and a new bronze Ambetter product, which is consistent with what we have in the other Centene Ambetter markets. So those are the kinds of things that give us a lot more confidence around kind of leveraging the Centene marketplace experience versus the historical Arizona marketplace experience.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Rone, anything you want to add?","Kenneth Rone Baldwin - Centene Corp.","No. Okay.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And I guess just a follow-up real quick. Jesse, do you know what the experience of the exited carriers was? Just sort of thinking about what was the overall loss ratio in that market for those plans that are no longer around, right? What were those members incurring in terms of expense?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","I don't know with kind of specificity on that, Josh, but I think that all of the folks that had kind of the more traditional commercial orientation in the Arizona marketplace had kind of equally bad experience.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Okay.","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","And we have reflected that, right, in terms of how we're thinking about it and changing the plan design, et cetera, to move more to the focus on subsidized populations and the like that we see elsewhere.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I mean, the issue (34:32) is our network, as we've said, it's highly subsidized, 90%-plus. So it's our normal model, Josh.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Perfect.","Operator","And our next question will come from Scott Fidel of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. First question, just interested if you can give us an update on that Pennsylvania contract that you had won earlier in the year for more of the classic Medicaid RFP and then some of the losing bidders had appealed that. So, just interested where we are in that status and whether you've assumed that contract in the 2016 initial views on revs or whether that \u2013 on 2017 or whether that could prove to be upside if you are upheld on that contract win.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. A couple of things. One, I think the state handled it wisely. There was a court case, and rather an (35:25) appeal, an appeal to drag it out. They say let's do a new RFP, it will be faster. So we expect to hear in the next month or two months, I guess, where that stands. There's no reason to believe we won't continue to prevail because we were the number one in all regions, the scores showed by a wide margin last time.","Relative to the second part of your question, the timing \u2013 in the second part I lost the...","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","In the second part, it's not in the number...","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","It's not in the number. No.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","...that we gave you for 2017.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","We will not add something until it's been awarded to us and clearly ours.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Okay. Just second question, just on the risk adjustment accruals and just thinking about that nickel hit that you had on the 2015 reconciliation. Just interested in terms of, as you've now updated your risk adjustment assumptions, whether you've built-in some additional conservatism just for the variety of co-op failures that we've seen over the course of this year and that could create a bad guy in terms of potential imbalances between payables and receivables in the risk adjustment program.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. This is Jeff. I mean, obviously, that's something we are looking at and we have looked at. And ultimately that's \u2013 as part of the risk adjustment process is ultimately determining the collectability. So, as we continue to look at that, we'll have to evaluate that as we get closer to the end of the year, specifically for 2016 and where everybody stands.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think, importantly, last time when we had the $0.19, we just added it right in and then didn't try and take any credit for it. It's part of the normal earnings. And just we added the full $0.19 in. And so this really amounts to an adjustment of $0.19 by $0.05 that we didn't get. So it's once again, I think, a very balanced approach. I almost wish we had a separate line, but accounting rules don't allow that.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna Financial Group. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Just wanted to ask about the Medicare Advantage expansions for next year. Are you guys just estimating you'll have sort of a toe in the water in the three new states, a relatively small amount of membership, or do you think you'll actually gain a foothold within the first year?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Chris, this is Jesse. So I think, as we've said at our June Investor Day when we talked about our launch of \u2013 it's actually four new MA products in our existing markets, but we talked about this as a proof of concept. So we definitely are taking a kind of softer launch approach for 2017 so we can be in a position to then grow from that base within those four markets in 2018 and forward, but then also entering other markets in MA in 2018. So we'll see kind of a continued progression, but we're looking at our growth in MA as a multi-year strategy.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think, and what we commented at the Investor Day is, it's no different than how we entered the marketplace. You go in it carefully, you prove the concept, and then once you get comfortable with it, you turn up the heat on it. And that's worked well for us. We've always said it's not how fast but how well. And so we're applying that same principle to this product.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. And then, just on the synergies, I get a little turned around sometimes in terms of where things exactly stand for this year versus what we should expect for next year. So is the right amount that's actually going to be realized in sort of earnings this year $50 million to $55 million and the next year you get the residual? And have you seen any upside to the original target at this point? Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, I'll start and then Jeff and others can pick up. We always talked about the $75 million would be the first 12 months of operation. So you have \u2013 this year you have roughly 9 months of it. I think, Jeff, it was about $50 million, in that range?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, that's right.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","But why don't you...","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. That's right. I mean, I think if you just kind of take \u2013 we said the first 12 months, $75 million; second 12 months, $150 million. And I think if you just take that and assume a March transaction date and shift that out, I mean there is obviously just based on the fiscal year.","So, that's what we indicated is that we've executed on all the actions to get to $75 million within the first 12 months and only 9 of those months fall into 2016. So, you're correct, is that that benefit would continue obviously into 2017. And then there's additional synergy capture there as well that we're confident that we can achieve.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to, I guess, reaffirm. So, when you guys narrowed the guidance range, you lowered the top-end by more than you raised the bottom-end, and that's just related to the $0.05 Arizona charge and then a higher expectation for business start-up costs. Is that the way to think about that?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","I think the way I'd think about it is if you just take the old midpoint, lower it by $0.05 and then it's plus or minus $0.05 from there, so to again come up with a $0.10 range.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I was just trying to think why the high-end was lowered by $0.17. Was there anything else kind of driving that beside the charge and the higher business expense cost?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","No, it's just the charge.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, you made a comment that you're at the high-end of your margin target for the exchanges this year, but I think the comment for next year was profitable. I mean, is the expectation that next year you'll be just at the midpoint of a target range for exchange profitability? Any comment there?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","No. I think...","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","No. I think \u2013 so we haven't given our just kind of full 2017 guidance. So I think we would leave a little bit of the detail for that as we go through. But I would not read into kind of profitability as being kind of deterioration from 2016.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","So we see normal \u2013 remember, we were talking I think probably as much the Arizona issues where we've turned that around and taken all the corrective steps, as well as California PPO plan.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, I guess, you kind of said a number of dynamics around Health Net for next year, but can you address the PDR? It sounds like the synergy targets are all coming in line. So it sounds like to me your expectation for Health Net for 2017 is pretty much on track to be what you thought it was going to be when you closed the deal. Is that an accurate statement?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, I think, we were making all the progress we expected at this point in time, and I am fully confident we will achieve next year and in the out-years what we've expected when we did the deal, yes.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Michael Newshel of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good morning. Going back to the Health Net PPO and EPO product in California, can you just clarify or frame level of losses that you expect to continue into 2017 here? I know the rate hike and benefit design changes are, obviously, going to significantly reduce it a lot.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Right.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","But even in the rate filing itself, you have a projected pre-tax loss of around $40 million. Can you talk about, one, like what are the upside to that $40 million loss from benefit design changes or medical management? And also, does the rate filing itself reflect the $50 million reduction in the PDR related to substance abuse that you announced today?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Jeff, can you start it off?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think as we look out into 2017, first of all, the rate filing would account for some decreased substance abuse utilization. As far as the $42 million, you're correct, that was in the rate filing, and we are taking and continue to take medical management network initiatives. And at this point in time, we believe we've covered more than half of that, and we're not done, and we think we have continued actions that we can take between now and next year to get us closer to the breakeven point.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","And would you expect to reach profitability on this product in 2018?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yes. Yes, I'm sure we would. I think what's important here is that rate filing was based on the actual assumptions on the historic experience as well which is part of the requirement.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Right.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And so you file that \u2013 and we have all the benefit and other changes, some of which is still good in there. So it went from $50 million some to $40 million. But then, there's all the other things we'll do. So we believe, as Jeff just said, we'll get it to breakeven. And we believe based on the population we attract being able to have lower premiums, we need to do better than that. But that's for discussion later in the year as it unfolds.","Michael Newshel - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. Health Net had an agreement with the State of California or a settlement targeting a 3.25% margin with a 50% buffer around that. In 2017, that goes to no adjustment between 1.25% to 3.25% I believe. Can you tell me where is that contract operating today? Is it above 3.25% margin? And then what's your expectation for next year?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. So, if you look at this, I mean this was disclosed I think in Health Net's 2015 10-K, but I think the settlement account effectively had a surplus of over $300 million or something in that range.","And again, as a reminder, the Medicaid expansion business is a component of that settlement agreement. And so, I guess, what I would say is that that number has continued to build over time. And I don't think this settlement agreement is going to have an impact.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So, no change for next year in terms of how it's going to operate.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Yeah, no change.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then can you tell us \u2013 your insurer fee revenues have been less than the expenses for the insurer fee recently. Can you tell us why that's going on? Why is it higher reflecting the gross up?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Well, so just a quick thing. The accounting rules require that if the insurance fee is billed as one premium, it's in premium revenue. So, for example, in Medicare, the insurer fee is actually embedded in premium revenue line. Whereas for Medicaid, it's a separate component of the rate and it's actually billed separately, so it's shown separately. And so, that's just an accounting technicality there.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I see.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Same thing for Marketplace by the way.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. And then sort of the last question if you don't mind. What's left to do on the California PPO business? You talk about continuing to focus on \u2013 from your commentary, it doesn't seem like that's quite yet to profitability for next year. So what are the things that you can do over the next year to try to improve the profitability of that?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, I think you're going to see us putting emphasis on growing it on a very balanced book of business. The previous design I would almost characterize as an inexpensive indemnity-type product. And it was a loss for Health Net in 2015 as well, we knew that.","But I think what we look at is we have the right rate structure, the right benefit structure to attract a balanced book of business to drive the utilization in network, which is intended. The out-of-network should be the exception, not the primary use of it. So we've done all those things and I think now just starting to grow it in the right way and market it, and we will return it to the place it deserves to be.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","The next question will be from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to go back to the California PDR exposure. So I just wanted to understand kind of the two pieces on the substance abuse side. Am I understanding correctly that your exposure there, obviously declined in the update this quarter, but your exposure into 2017 is mitigated or eliminated by your change in certificate of coverage, i.e., you don't have to pay those types of claims going into next year. And then rate and benefit design are what you are using to attack the other $75 million. Is that the right way to think about it or is there a blurrier line?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","No. I think when you look at all the products associated with it, the out-of-network coverage, the benefit design they had before without the Medicare Maximum and the other issues where there was a percent of billed charges, basically out-of-network providers could do what they wanted and we are liable at a time for 75% of billed charges till they change their certificate of coverage.","So, virtually putting in the changes that I discussed during my formal remarks eliminates the incentives to put people into that product at the same level. And we already see a material drop-off of that taking place. It was a bad design before. The state, everybody recognized it. It's been fully fixed. And there's other steps taking place that I'll let the legal authorities deal with as it relates to it. So, that affects that.","It also affects the normal PPO outside the people (49:51), the same principle applies. We now have a product that will have great appeal to people who want to use our in-network and who on similar occasion want to go out of network. I mean they now have an exposure of $25,000 maximum out-of-pocket, which is significantly greater than what it was, but very competitive.","So it's really \u2013 we now have the right PPO design. And PPOs have always been intended for a in-network use without a network being the exception, before virtually all the utilization was out-of-network. So we believe that that together with the lower rate increase to be more attractive to the balanced book of business.","These are things we've done successfully for many years and will turn this around, and it has, and will put us where we want to be.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Great. And so, Michael, the change in the certificate of coverage, the impact of that is already reflected in your reduction of the exposure from $50 million to $35 million. Is that what you're referencing?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Yes, I think what you're going to see is you're going to see \u2013 I mean, obviously, the new certificate is not into effect until January 1. There were some changes they made effective earlier than that where they could. But so we're starting to see where there's less people being transferred into, they know they can no longer bill 75% of billed charges. And I mean, there were instances where lab tests were thousands of dollars that we pay $8 for.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Right. Okay. Shifting to Medicare, if I could briefly, curious of your reaction to the slightly modest decline in Star scores for the Medicare book of business. What are your plans to boost those back up? And then, maybe more broadly, your plans to begin to build track record in your new markets to have them be able to maintain a bonus level Star score?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I will turn it over to Jesse in a minute. I want to remind you that there were seven Star scores that remained constant. There were seven that improved. There was one that lost half a star because of the benefit change in the Part D drug and it was in Oregon, one of the smaller markets. So there was not a dramatic shift as some notes may have indicated.","And Jesse, do you want to pick it up and talk about the program?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I would highlight a couple of things. One, in terms of the implications, I think some of the math that was referenced in a few of the notes that we saw included the dual members, D-SNP members in terms of the percentage of members that applied in various kind of Star levels. So I think there's a little bit of mixing and matching with respect to that.","But, as Michael referenced, we did improve our Star scores in a number of our plans, including our D-SNP plans, which are widely recognized to be more challenging to increase the Star scores. So we've demonstrated that we can do that. So we have a number of programs, not the least of which is provider engagement and how we're working with our providers in all of these markets.","And remember, when we're launching these new programs, as we referenced, in Georgia, Texas, Florida, Mississippi, those are markets where we have longstanding provider relationships. So that will be a center-point in terms of not only our kind of growth strategy, but also our stars and quality improvement strategies going forward.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And I want to just respond to second part of your question in terms of the new markets that the team that achieved these four and greater stars are the same team at Health Net that's working with us on the new markets. And we have every reason to believe they'll use the same processing approach to it that will achieve the high star levels.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from A. J. Rice of UBS. Please go ahead.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hello, everybody. I appreciate the comments about 2017 and the fact that the disputed contract in Pennsylvania is not in there for revenues. I know at one point you were looking at absorbing some costs associated with that this year, and that was part of the $0.30 I think or so of expansion costs.","Can you comment on whether you've absorbed that this year? Is that going to be in next year's numbers or has that been delayed largely till next year? And I know you have the LTSS contract rolling out. Do you think the overall expansion number for next year will be more or less than the $0.30 you've incurred this year?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Well, I would say, at this point in time Michael mentioned, we're in the process of finalizing our AOP. And specifically, with the timing of some of these awards, and obviously that's one of the moving parts, so I'm not going to comment specifically on what we expect for 2017 on that front.","But I will tell you that what we said today is that the costs for this year are actually higher in the fourth quarter. So, yes, you're right. The change in that award status has reduced the level of costs associated with that, but then on the other side we do expect a significant growth in our Marketplace business in 2017. And we have seen an increase in start-up costs of that in the fourth quarter.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Then maybe a quick point on the PDR. So it now stands at $285 million. Tell us how that evolved \u2013 can you just give me some help on thinking about how that evolves over time? Do you expect, since it relates to 2016, to run that down to $0 by the end of the year? Will some of that carry over in case there's negative development from 2016 next year that you'll be able to offset against? And how should we think about how that plays out over the next period of time?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","That will run down by the end of the year. Now, specifically, just on the substance abuse, I mean ultimately some of those end up in IBNR and, from a cash perspective, they get paid next year. But the $285 million will run down to $0 by the end of this year.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And do you think there is \u2013 well, there be any that gets carried over in case there is negative development on any of these items for next year?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Well, the piece that will get carried over would be in IBNR, right? It would be in our medical...","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah...","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. It'd be in our medical claims payable. Right.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a last quick question on \u2013 you mentioned on the synergies, on track and pleased with that. I know one aspect of the longer-term synergies you were evaluating was your pharmacy benefit status, both Health Net having one way they were approaching and you doing it with your own internal PBM. Is there any update on where that all stands at this point and your thinking on that?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I'll start that there's a blend that where \u2013 we still have our PBM very active and we're using some of the things that Health Net was doing. And Jesse can give a little more color and granularity on it.","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I think the starting point here, A. J., is that one of our kind of core philosophies is serving the whole person. Obviously, pharmacy is part of that. So Centene is committed to the pharmacy business. I think that's an important starting point.","And as we look at our PBM, there's a number of things that we have developed that we think are core competencies, which includes benefit design, formulary management, clinical programs, analytics, mail order, specialty, et cetera. There's all of those things that are very much kind of embedded in kind of the Centene pharmacy management model.","We've also \u2013 and we'll be launching where we're kind of rebranding is our external approach with Envolve Pharmacy Solutions. Some of you may have seen a release that went out recently where we're going to be working with Mercer on some opportunities from an external perspective.","But all of that said, Michael referenced the hybrid approach, so we have entered into an arrangement with CVS\/caremark to really leverage some of the scale, particularly from a network perspective, and certain back-office functions for pharmas.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","And does that increase your thinking on the synergies, or is that sort of in line with what you had originally thought on the synergies?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","In line.","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","It's in line with what we had originally thought on the synergies.","A. J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Morning.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Just want to go back to the exchanges and your position for next year, just given market exits from peers. Any concerns around network adequacy? And then do you have any sort of enrollment caps in place at this point?","And then, just want to clarify, I think in your prepared you talked about Arizona your expectation of $500 million of incremental revenue I think just from the exchange, which I think is about 140,000 lives back-of-the-envelope. So we're talking about a 25% increase in the exchange enrollment just from Arizona. So I guess help sort of corroborate against (59:05) those numbers?","And then, just in terms of how we think about capital in terms of all the new lives coming on next year? Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Jeff, do you want to start on the capital piece?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. So I can handle the last question first, which is on capital. I mean, obviously, Centene's been a very high growth company over the last five years. We've put over billions of dollars into capital at our subsidiaries. And we would expect, obviously, with this growth that we would have to contribute capital to fund the growth as well.","However, I will tell you that, on a percentage basis, we've had years where we had 50% growth. On a percentage basis, that growth is smaller in compared to the organization in total. So the capital requirements, a lot of those can be funded with free cash flow.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I just want to add and others can add to it. But as it relates to the growth, we are expecting a significant growth and we'll give you a lot of granularity on that in December at our Investor Day. But importantly, some people I know are worried about, well, are you going to pick up some of the individuals who are high-cost out of other plans? We think, one, we have our network. If our network is of interest to them, that's fine because it's a well-managed network.","Secondly, we are a net payer of a lot of money, $300 million or so. So there's a safety net there within that amount, which approaches what some others said they have lost. So, as we look at the exchanges going forward, we see ourselves at a very strong position to effectively grow it and still maintain the margins that we've become used to having on it.","Anything want to add anybody else?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Just specifically on your question, Ralph, around the network, just to further Michael's point, we are very focused on kind of network adequacy for the expected growth. But our orientation there is really we think we're fine in terms of facility-based network. So our focus really is on physician services, particularly primary care.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then no enrollment caps, I guess?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","No.","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","No.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, just on the Medicaid expansion states, federal funding goes down a little bit in 2017, I think 95%. So, just wondering your communication with states, how they may or may not be approaching that? You said composite rate increase overall was sort of flat to up slightly as has been consistent over the last few years. But any other pushback there in terms of states wanting to kind of fill that gap and any pressure for you all there? Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","We constantly talk to states about it. Rates have to be actuarially sound (61:56) and they are very much aware of that. And you always have that one or two states that it's a little more discussions required to get there. But we're comfortable that we're saving them levels of medical expense that we remind them you don't want to kill the golden goose. And I think that's still apprised (62:22) in 99% of our states.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Christine Arnold of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi there. I think you referenced about...","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Hi.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi there. I think you referenced about $70 million in Medicare losses that you expected to incur this year. What's your outlook for that going into 2017? Do you expect to eliminate those losses with your recent filings and changes in plan design? How do I think about those Medicare Advantage losses?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. That's exactly right. The $70 million was in reference to the premium deficiency reserve, and so those are losses when the premium deficiency reserve for Medicare is looked at an aggregate across all Medicare products. And so that $70 million was the PDR that we booked and, yes, we do expect it to be profitable based on those items you mentioned.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","And what is exactly \u2013 profitable?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Say that again. You cut out.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","I'm sorry. What exactly you're doing to make that profitable?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, I think that's some of the things I discussed, how we did plan design, rate adjustments, a whole series of things.","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I would just add Christine, this is Jesse, that when we went through the bid process in 2016, we took into account a number of different factors, including network, including plan design benefits and the like, which resulted in a profitable bid for 2017.","In addition to that, we have obviously ongoing medical management and network initiatives to continue to enhance our financial performance going forward.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question will come from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","A couple of questions. The first on the ACA-compliant business, the individual business. Can you give us some color in terms of where you sit right now in terms of where you think your 2016 premium is going to shake out? And it sounds like you're rightly expecting a fairly significant increase in membership from premiums here for next year. Any kind of ballpark directionality you can help us with in terms of how much premium increase you think you're going to get for next year?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think that's a better question for \u2013 you're talking about 2017, what it's going to look like in 2017?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Well, just first the baseline of how much premium you have in this business this year and then, just directionally, do you think it's going to be up 30%, 50%, 10%...?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Are you talking about the market \u2013 are we talking about the marketplace?","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Yes, the marketplace. Exactly.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Okay. Jeff, please.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. So you're just talking about the look forward into 2017. I mean, we're not going to give the specifics on 2017. I mean, obviously, we're beginning the open enrollment process, right, at this current point in time. So we're not going to give any specific colors I guess on 2017.","But what I did say was that we do have additional costs in the fourth quarter because we do expect significant growth obviously from this year. And then obviously we've commented specifically about Arizona and what we expect there, right? And that was the $500 million that Michael mentioned.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Can you tell us what your premium is this year on in the exchanges?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, the total premium on exchange...","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","A little over $1 billion this year.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. And then, just any other color on this California Medicaid expansion MLR floor would be helpful. For instance, is there any expectation \u2013 was there any impact in the third quarter or expected in the full-year guidance? And just some background on this like how significant can it be?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. So, a quick thing. There was nothing in the third quarter associated with this. So this is where the state is effectively changing the MLR definition to be consistent with the federal regulations. And the biggest change is really excluding federal and state taxes.","We are working through the calculations with the state at this time. So we haven't sized the total amount. Obviously, the MLR began back in January 2014 at the inception of the Medicaid expansion program. This has been in process for some time. So a piece of this was included and has been included in our guidance, and it's within our guidance range for this year and that will come in the fourth quarter.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And I think the part associated with 2016 is in the guidance.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yes.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Any prior period, as is our practice, we'll treat it as a one-time.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","That's right. Only the piece associated with 2016 was included in our guidance. So there will be a piece that will be retroactive. And again, I think all those reconciliation periods are open. And we haven't seen the draft calculations from the state at this point in time. So we're kind of waiting for that.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Any way to size the impact for 2016 or in the fourth quarter from this that you've already incurred or that you expect during the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Well, I mean I can give you this, I mean we have included a piece in our guidance. I can tell you that was roughly about $0.09, so that we have in the fourth quarter associated with this. That's our best estimate at this point in time.","But I would hesitate to size the total magnitude. It's a positive obviously for the company, but I'd hesitate to size the magnitude of that. And this will be \u2013 it's cash. It's a cash-positive as well, because if you recall, we have a liability back to the state of over $0.5 billion associated with this minimum MLR program.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","That's been accrued.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","That's been accrued, yes. So what would happen is it would reduce that amount that we owe and, of course, we already have that cash on our balance sheet today.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. So the full-year 2016 benefit is $0.09.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","That's right.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And that's estimated and that's still...","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","That's estimated. Again, like I said, we haven't seen the draft calculation. So we still have to work through that with the state.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question will be from Matt Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Oh, thanks for squeezing me in. Just can you talk about the group commercial business that you have from Health Net? How was the renewal process then and what are your expectations just directionally, I'm not looking for guidance, but directionally in terms of account wins or account losses on the group commercial side going into next year?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Frankly, I will not spent a lot of time on it. Well, that's part of the AOP process, which we're going through now. And Rone, anything you can comment on that?","Kenneth Rone Baldwin - Centene Corp.","Well, we are going through the December 1, January 1 is the large period for renewals in the group business. The large group business has been a good performer, relatively stable and we're continuing to see that this year. The small group business has been a business that we've been looking to improve the margins and we have been increasing the rates for that. We're going to see that reflected to some extent in terms of membership in the fourth quarter here, but that's part of the strategy to get the business back on track to address some of the PDR issues and margin issues for 2017.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","In your view on the small group business, does that suffer from some of the same issues that not necessarily you had, but broadly the ACA businesses had with adverse risk selection?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Are you talking about the small group? Yeah. What we did is...","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think I know, Matt. Good question. The same benefit design changes we did for the individual, we also implemented for the small group. So we will expect to...","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Okay. So they'll be well in line. And, once again, now that we have this right and the benefits right, it puts you in a position to effectively grow that business. And after I think in the past, they were chasing more volume than we would...","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","...we want to make sure it's profitable and then we'll grow it.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question will be from Ana Gupte of Leerink. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Hi. Thanks. Good morning. The first question I have is I'm assuming follow-up on a question that was asked before. So you have the top-line growth, I think when you exclude the issues on the PDR, it's somewhere in the mid-teens.","In terms of the margins, as you're mix-shifting into ABD and long-term care populations and when you look at the overlay of the new set of Medicaid regulation, have you had an opportunity to now study that? And do you get some cross-subsidization as you go forward? So is that in essence better preserving your margin profile going forward, this slight mix-shifting?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, at this early in the process \u2013 as I said, we're in the final stages of the annual operating plan. It would be too early to try and give too much indication. We've tried to give you the sense of that it was moving ahead with that. And what the consensus was, it's fair to say it would be within our range.","But before I get too granular, and I want to finish the process because I don't want to say something today that is not confirmed again in December. So, kind of bear with us for the short period of time. But we're looking forward to 2017. I think it's going to be a good year for us now that we've corrected all the issues in California. We're starting to launch the Medicare. And there's a lot of things that are left, there are some RFPs still pending. So I'm looking forward to it.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. No, I was actually \u2013 less for 2017 guidance and more just some clarity from you on the reg, which I at least tried asking other companies as well. And I'm assuming since it came out in July, you had some more color on it, if you're able to share at all.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think, at this point, let's talk more about it, and I know you won't forget it and you asked the question, you could ask it in December in person.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Sounds good. One more question then. On the risk adjusters, again, I'm not looking for any kind of color on margins for next year. Just there was a pretty big change as it seems like from CMS, after some of the more commercially-oriented plans had issues with their risk profile and adverse selection. And it looked like it was a little bit about prescription drug, but there were some other changes around spreading risk better across all plans.","Did you all have any input? And how does the managed Medicaid industry that's participating in exchanges, are you advocating one way or the other and are you happy with what was out there? I believe the comments were due on the 6th of October, right?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think our government regulatory people, we spoke with them, and they've put in the comments. And it's still an going discussion with CMS. And they are now open to discussing with us because of the successes we're having is one of the most successful, fastest-growing exchange products, they are very interested in talking to us and...","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. One last question \u2013 sorry, one last one. On your strategies for Medicare Advantage as you're expanding into new states, will that be more tied to your desire to win long-term care contracts or opportunities there or is it broader than that? And will you be just looking for MA business regardless of the Medicaid positioning that you have in the state and what is it looking like for 2017?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Well, I think just generally and in terms of the strategy it would be kind of the broader version, if you will, of MA. So we would be looking, as we said, very consistently we'd be looking to support the lower income kind of subset of the Medicare Advantage-eligible population. So, that will have some other kind of implications as we think about some of the other state-based products, but our orientation around that is broader.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks for fitting me in.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Michael Neidorff for his closing remarks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, just I want to thank you.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2013 Earnings Call. During the course of today's call, we will discuss our solid fourth quarter and full year 2013 results, market and product updates, future growth opportunities and a brief update on the ACA, including the insurer fee.","I will begin with highlights of our fourth quarter financial results. Fourth quarter membership increased 12% year-over-year to 2.7 million covered lives. Premium and Service revenues grew 31% year-over-year to $2.9 billion. The faster premium growth, relative to membership growth, was driven by the continued mixed shift toward higher acuity beneficiaries. For example, long-term care membership increased 345% year-over-year.","The HBR improved 260 basis points year-over-year to 88.1%, reflecting rate increases and effective medical cost management. We are experiencing a normal flu season thus far. The most recent CDC data suggests that flu season has peaked, which is consistent with Centene's data. Our Fluvention program continues to stress flu vaccination and early treatment, as required. Last year, we experienced a more intense and prolonged flu season. Aside from flu, we see 2014 medical cost trends as consistent with those of 2013.","Now on to market and product updates. First, we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity. Florida, the long-term care program is proceeding as planned. At the end -- at year-end, 5 of our 10 regions have been phased in. During the fourth quarter, we added 6,200 additional lives due to this expansion. Separately, we were successful in 9 out of 11 regions in the state's new and expanded MMA program. We expect the state to begin phasing in regions during the second quarter of 2014.","California. In November 2013, we commenced operations in California under 2 separate contracts. Both contracts are ramping in line with our expectations. Membership at December 31 was 97,200.","New Hampshire. We launched our health brand in December of 2013. Thus far, the performance is consistent with expectations. Membership at December 31 was 33,600.","Massachusetts. In January of 2014, we began operating under MassHealth CarePlus program in all 5 regions. This is also ramping, as expected.","Mississippi. We were recently informed that we will be retaining our contract in the state. This was assumed in 2014 guidance. This reprocurement includes some expanded service areas.","Next, some comments on Centurion. We are successfully expanding our Centurion business, launching 3 contracts in just 6 months. Our last contract commenced in Minnesota during January of 2014. We continue to view Centurion as an attractive growth driver. Our joint venture with MHM provides a compelling alternative for state governments to address their conventional health care needs.","Now on to dual-eligible. We are participating in demonstration projects in 4 states thus far. Centene has won RFPs in Ohio, Illinois and South Carolina. We recently signed an agreement to purchase a majority stake in Fidelis SecureCare of Michigan. Fidelis was 1 of 6 plans selected by the Michigan Department of Community Health to serve dual-eligibles in Macomb and Wayne counties. These 4 demonstration projects are expected to commence in 2014. We continue to work constructively with the states and CMS on rates and other terms.","As for future growth opportunities, our targeted pipeline remains extremely robust at $138 billion through 2016. We expect to continue our recognized success in winning new business. We will diversify by geography and product line with the goal of driving profitable growth.","Now I will briefly comment on the ACA, including an update on the insurer fee. First, Health Insurance Marketplaces. We continue to expect the Health Insurance Marketplace to have a minimal impact on our 2014 financial performance. In January 2014, we began operating in 9 state marketplace. Enrollment is trending at the low end of our previous guidance, which was 70,000 to 140,000 lives.","We had approximately 21,000 enrollees and paid marketplace members effective January 1. The demographics of our enrollees are generally in line with our pricing expectations. The average age is 44 years old. Members are predominantly low income, over 80% are eligible for premium subsidies. It is still too early to comment on the acuity level of our marketplace members. While we continue to take a measured approach towards our participation in Health Insurance Marketplaces, we believe our early participation will give us valuable experience for longer-term marketplace opportunities.","Next, Medicaid expansion. The majority of our states are not participating in 2014. Therefore, this will have a relatively minimal impact on our 2014 growth. However, longer-term, we view this as a growth opportunity as more states adopt the Medicaid expansion.","Last, the insurance fee. Ongoing discussions with our state partners continue to reflect our expectation of grossed-up adjustments. There is general agreement as to the need for the actuarially sound rate. A majority have committed to fully cover the fees on a grossed-up basis. We are confident that the remaining states will do so. Our understanding is that CMS and the Academy of Actuaries are supporting reimbursement of the ACA insurance fee on a grossed-up basis.","The ACA is currently only one part of our overall growth strategy. Our performance in 2014 is not dependent on a meaningful contribution from ACA components. However, we remain cautiously optimistic in our outlook for 2015 and beyond. Bill will go into further detail on this topic.","Next, a quick comment on rates. Our composite rate increase for 2013 was 2.7%. We continue to expect a composite rate adjustment of 0% to 2% in 2014. This is exclusive of the insurer fee, which is being negotiated separately. In conclusion, we expect to maintain the positive operating momentum Centene established in 2013 into 2014 and beyond.","Thank you for your interest in Centene. I will now turn the call over to Bill, who will provide further details on our fourth quarter and full year financial results. Bill?","William N. Scheffel","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. I would like to begin my comments this morning by noting that we are presenting our fourth quarter and year-end results with the Kentucky operations now classified as a discontinued operation. Accordingly, we are presenting our financial results focusing on continuing operations with separate disclosure of discontinued operations for Kentucky.","At a summary level, both 2013 and the fourth quarter performed well and increased significantly over 2012 results. Fourth quarter Premium and Service revenues were $2.9 billion, a 31% increase year-over-year. Our Premium and Service revenues for the full year were over $10.5 billion, a 37% increase over 2012.","For the fourth quarter, our diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.84. For the full year, earnings per share was $2.87, and this would be $2.95 if we add back the $0.08 of a carrier health transaction cost. Our actual results are at the high end of our original guidance range given in December 2012 of $2.60 to $2.90 a share.","I will now give a more detailed discussion of our performance. Our Premium and Service revenues increased by over $2.8 billion in 2013. The increase is a result of several items: The addition of new or expanded operations in the last 2 years in Texas, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Kansas, Missouri and Washington; the April 1 acquisition of AcariaHealth; the startup of our Centurion joint venture contracts in Tennessee and Massachusetts; and rate increases across our markets between years; and during the fourth quarter, we began health plan operations in California and New Hampshire.","Our health benefits ratio was 88.1% for the fourth quarter, which was an increase of 30 basis points sequentially from the third quarter. This increase is due to normal seasonality and startup of new operations in California and New Hampshire. For the full year, our 2013 HBR was 88.6% compared to 89.6% in 2012. The 100 basis point decrease between years primarily reflects improvements in Texas and in our individual health insurance business.","With respect to new business information. For the fourth quarter, approximately 17% of our revenues came from new business, those in operation for less than 12 months. And the HBR in the fourth quarter was 86.6% for existing business and 95.4% for our new business.","Last winter, we experienced a higher-than-normal level of flu cost, both in the November, December period and the January, February time frame. For this winter, our experience has been in a normal range for a flu season. While there are certain areas that have experienced higher flu levels at times, overall, we have not seen anything out of the ordinary so far this season.","Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 8.4% in the fourth quarter of 2012. The increase between years is primarily due to incurring a normal level of performance-based compensation expense this year. For the full year, our G&A ratio was 8.8% for both 2013 and 2012. This reflects the AcariaHealth transaction cost and an increased level of performance-based compensation this year, offset by the benefits of the additional leverage we have generated through our higher level of revenue and our efforts to control costs.","We incurred business expansion cost of $0.19 in the fourth quarter and $0.57 for all of 2013. This compares to $0.44 in business expansion costs incurred in 2012. Our spending in the fourth quarter was slightly lower than anticipated as we adjusted our spending downward for the Health Insurance Marketplace, due to the enrollment issues experienced in November and a lower level of membership now expected for 2014.","Investment and other income totaled $5.4 million in Q4 compared to $3.2 million in the fourth quarter last year. For the year, investment and other income was $18.5 million in 2013 and $35.3 million in 2012. The primary difference between years relates to the $19 million in gains recorded in the third quarter of 2012.","Interest expense was $6.7 million in the fourth quarter compared to $6.1 million last year. Interest expense for 2013 was $27 million and $20.5 million in 2012. The increases for both the fourth quarter and full year represent the interest costs for the $175 million in additional senior notes that we issued in November 2012.","Our effective tax rate in the fourth quarter, excluding noncontrolling interest, was 41.6% and 40% for the full year. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.84 for the fourth quarter and $2.87 for the year. This compares to $0.35 for Q4 of 2012 and $1.65 for 2012 in total.","Results from discontinued operations were $0.09 in diluted earnings per share in Q4 and $0.07 of earnings for the full year of 2013. During the fourth quarter, we recorded favorable development related to the medical reserves that had been previously established for Kentucky. We have wound down operations in Kentucky since our July 5 exit date, and have classified the Kentucky results as discontinued in our income statement and balance sheet.","At December 31, we had cash and investments of $1.9 billion, of which $45 million was held by unregulated entities. We have estimated our risk-based capital percentage to continue to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Debt at year end was $669 million and included $150 million of borrowings under our revolver at December 31.","During the fourth quarter, we funded approximately $135 million to our insurance subsidiaries for tax benefits utilized on the consolidated return. Our debt-to-capital ratio at December 31, excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note, was 32.4% compared to 32.7% at last year end. Our medical claims liability totaled $1.1 billion at year end and represented 42.4 days in claims payable. Cash flow from operations was $171 million for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $383 million for the full year, which represents 2.3x net earnings for 2013.","Now I want to update our 2014 guidance numbers and cover the assumptions we are using in their preparation. First, the guidance numbers have been adjusted to represent continuing operations, consistent with our year-end 2013 financial results presentation. We have also updated our guidance to include the acquisition of U.S. Medical Management, which closed on January 6, and our estimate of the ACA insurer fee for 2014.","Our 2014 guidance numbers are: Premium and Service revenues, $13.8 billion to $14.3 billion; health benefits ratio, 88.7% to 89.2%; G&A expense ratio, 8.5% to 9%; effective tax rate, 50% to 51%; diluted earnings per share, $3.50 to $3.80; and diluted shares outstanding, 59.7 million to 60.2 million shares.","The updated guidance numbers reflect several changes. First, we have added revenue, expenses and additional shares related to U.S. Medical Management, now that the acquisition has closed. And this includes approximately $0.06 in transaction cost incurred in the first quarter. We have also decreased the expected membership for the Health Insurance Marketplace to 70,000, which is the low end of the membership range discussed in December. And we have now included the ACA insurer fee in our updated guidance numbers.","We continue to believe that we will be reimbursed by our ongoing state customers for substantially all of the ACA insurer fee on a grossed-up basis. As others have commented, the states are moving forward to include the reimbursement as part of a contractual arrangement. Each state has its own process to follow before signing an agreement or contract amendment. Therefore, it may take time to complete this, such that revenue recognition related to the reimbursement of the ACA insurer fee may not occur until later in 2014.","This would have the effect of lowering earnings in the first half of the year and increasing earnings in the second half, but have no impact on our overall 2014 annual guidance. A substantial majority of our states have committed to reimburse us for the ACA insurer fee. We are working with all of our states to obtain the appropriate documentation through signed agreements and\/or contract amendments. As Michael indicated, our understanding is that both CMS and the American Academy of Actuaries are supporting the reimbursement of the ACA insurer fee on a grossed-up basis on the basis of actuarial soundness.","Lastly, our business expansion costs for 2014 are estimated to be $0.50 to $0.55, including the $0.06 in USMM transaction costs.","Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question, I guess, just on the fee, just in terms of -- and I think, Bill, you were starting to address this on the revenue recognition. I'm just curious, what is your policy as to the timing of that revenue recognition? Do you need a signed agreement for the state? And then what is your anticipation around how many of these states will have signed agreements by the end of the first quarter? I guess, I'm just trying to look at, is it possible we see whatever breakeven first quarter or something like that with a real back-end loaded 2014 EPS results?","William N. Scheffel","I think our policy will be generally consistent with what I think you heard others say. We will need some sort of signed agreement with respect to the way the state is going to reimburse us for the fee. And we are working with each of the states right now with respect to that documentation. We're in early February, right now, it's a little hard to predict exactly what we're going to have in hand by the time we get up to March 31. At this point in time, it would be probably overly optimistic to think we would have it all done by March 31, but I think we are working with all of our states. And we don't really have a number right now as to the specific percentage we'll have at the end of the first quarter.","Michael F. Neidorff","It's moving along very well, Josh. I mean, the documentation with states takes time. Because each one is a little bit different, their approach to it, so it's not like you have a boiler plate document you can give them and mark up.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's fair. Would you say you guys are optimistic you'll have at least half of your revenues by state signed up to reimburse for the fee by the end of the first quarter?","William N. Scheffel","I think, at this point, we're not ready to present a specific number or range, as what we'll have at the end of the first quarter. We still have almost 2 months to go to and complete these, and we'll give you an update.","Michael F. Neidorff","And the difficulty is we're working with every state, Josh. And when you get 2 or 3 of the big ones, and you're there. You get 6 of the 8 of the smaller ones, and you're still trying to get to that 50% number. So we see nothing that is a barrier or comments have been made that this will not be resolved to our satisfaction.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's fine. And then the second question, I think you made a comment that the Medicaid expansion was going to have a minimal impact. And I understand a majority of your states that you happen to be in are not expanding, at least not for '14. But...","Michael F. Neidorff","I think it's 3 out of 19 or something is expanding, a small number.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","But we continue to hear about the sort of woodwork effect, and there are states that are talking about potentially even double-digit increases in Medicaid enrollment, even in states that are not expanding. So I'm just curious, have you gotten any January enrollment rolls and have you seen any pickup in some of your states? It's been a while since we've seen real organic Medicaid growth, so I'm just curious what you're seeing in your states.","Michael F. Neidorff","Rone, do you want to make a comment?","K. Rone Baldwin","Yes. We have yet to see any real visible significant signs of the woodwork effect in the states that we're operating in. Certainly, in some of the states where there's been large outreach associated with Medicare, Medicaid expansion, we're seeing some signs based on the state's statistics. But overall, it's not something that is emerging yet in terms of the enrollments we've seen early in 2014.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's fine. And then just a last one, hep C cost, I'm just curious there's some nervousness around, specifically, the Medicaid population and treatments there. Have you guys started to see, I mean, was there any sort of backlog of patients or anything like that that's starting to come through in January? I know you guys have rate...","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes. I'll have -- I'll ask Mary.","Mary V. Mason","Josh, as I would with any new drugs, we're always focused on rigorous review of the request, making sure they meet FDA guidelines. I can tell you since the approval of Savaldi [ph], as well as the [indiscernible] in the beginning of December, we've had 22 approved requests. And we're focusing on those patients, getting them into case management and making sure they have compliance so they have the best outcome.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So you have 22 total out of your 2.7 million lives or so?","Mary V. Mason","That have been approved requests, yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte at Leerink Partners.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","I just want to follow-up on -- and I know WellPoint and the contrast between how you're guiding for '14 relative to how they're guiding. And I get it that they're blue and diversified and very different from you, but still I think the differences are quite stark, if you will. So the first one is that they're guiding in the baseline to not getting any gross-up on the fee, and they generally sounded pessimistic about it, I'd say, on the call, whereas you and others are sounding very optimistic. So I'm just trying to get a sense for that. And then secondly, on the other end of it and on exchanges they're guiding towards a 3% to 5% pretax margin, and you're guiding breakeven. I get it that your positioning may be different, but is that related to your pricing and the member experience that you're guiding to breakeven and do you expect that to expand in terms of margins and growth in '15 and beyond?","Michael F. Neidorff","Bill, you want to talk about...","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think it's hard for us to speak about other companies' earnings calls and guidance, I mean, we do -- have looked of those things. I think, in general, the company's that have come before us have had a similar discussion with regard to confidence on the ACA insurer fee being reimbursed on a grossed-up basis, and that it'll take a little bit of time for that to happen and the right documentation has to occur. So I think, as near as we could tell, everybody's pretty much on the same page on that. And then with respect to exchanges, we've -- as we said in December, I think we have and we've lowered our membership number, and we have expected to have a breakeven to a small loss in that book of business. It doesn't mean we priced it that way. We've just put that into our guidance to reflect the potential for higher acuity levels than maybe originally anticipated.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes. I think, if I may just add to it without -- I can't comment on what they're seeing, I can only comment on certain differences. And we have a very -- we've had a very small level of individual participation outside of Medicaid. They've always had some of the larger carriers -- commercial carriers have had a large individual book, so the law of larger numbers will apply. I think we're going to do very well with our churn approach, cleaning those that we want. And the fact that 80% are getting subsidized, so the strategy is on track. And we prefer to be cautious and say it's breakeven and create a lot of expectations as we work through it. Rone, something you would add to that?","K. Rone Baldwin","Yes. We have priced the product and we do believe that it can generate 3% to 5% pretax margins over time. We have taken a cautious approach for planning and guidance for 2014. We've also assumed that we're not going to be able to accrue for any kind of risk adjustment in 2014, so that also has had an impact on our specific outlook for this year since we think that our risk adjustment accrual is probably going to require waiting for the data to come in and be able to be booked in 2015 for the 2014 experience here.","Michael F. Neidorff","And I can be firm enough to say that my involvement would be with CMS or other levels within the company. And the industry, I see nothing that says, \"We're not going to see these rates grossed up.\" If I did, I would say so. But all conversations to date tend to show that the rates -- the federal law says they have to be actuarially sound. And the federal government, the states, all recognize that. But that's not been an issue in our discussion.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","That's very helpful. Just to follow-up on your risk adjusted comment. Do you think that the risk corridors would be trued up for '14, despite the timing issue on the risk adjusted, at least on an estimated basis?","William N. Scheffel","I think that what we're saying is that our calculations would assume that the risk quarter is in place for 2014, and the reinsurance aspect is in place for 2014. Risk adjustment, while it's in place, is not going to be reasonably estimable in 2014, it will be 2015 before we would have any estimate to whether that would have a significant impact to us.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah James at Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Just one quick follow-up on the industry fee. I know you belabored the point...","Michael F. Neidorff","Sorry, could you speak up. Sarah, we can't hear you.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I know you've belabored the point of the industry fee, but I just wanted to make sure I have the right count of anyone that you have gotten a signed agreement for yet. So can you tell us which states have actually signed the agreement so far?","William N. Scheffel","I think, at this point, we have some, but we really haven't gotten into the list at which where we are in each state, because we still have ongoing discussions with most states. And I think, at this point, we're just working with all of them. We have like 3 or 4 that we have already signed some agreements, but...","Michael F. Neidorff","I guess -- all right, they're at various stages, Sarah. We have 3 or 4 that are signed. We have some where the language, whether it be a contract amendment or a specific letter of understanding, have been discussed, negotiated and agreed to, waiting for signature and counter signatures. So it's moving from day-to-day, but it's all moving in the right direction. There is no one who has said, \"You're wrong.\" They've all engaged with us on this discussion. Three, 4 -- in the tank, so to speak already, and others, moving along.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, you've talked about...","Michael F. Neidorff","And by the way, I might just add -- I might add, when you get 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 states recognizing it, that also is very supportive that the CMS and everybody else that's worked with those improving their rates for that, it's precedent setting.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And you've talked about USMM saving in 2 sample cases in the range of 8% to 14% on existing business, and that there's a current overlap of about 150,000 members on your high-acuity book. So is it feasible to see this level of savings that were pointed out in those examples on your high-acuity overlap? And how long does it typically take to ramp-up to that level of savings?","Michael F. Neidorff","Sarah, let me help you. We had, this past Friday, all our CEOs in the plans met with USMM. I mean, it's not been quite a month that we've closed this. A lot of our preplanning has gone into it. Different states have different products. You're going to see different savings across duals, across long-term care, across SSI, across [indiscernible]. And to try and put a fixed number on it, we have -- we have our internal numbers that we're measuring and working against, that gave us the ability to give you some accretion. But to try and take that and apply it to some percentage of our 2.7 million growing membership, I think that would be -- if I did it, you should worry that I did it.","William N. Scheffel","So just a little bit more on USMM. We obviously are estimating savings in 2014 sufficient to cover the additional shares that we issued with respect to the acquisition and the debt cost. I think that there are -- we gave some accretion numbers early on, I think, when we announced the acquisition. And that was excluding transaction cost. So in our 2014 guidance, what we have absorbed in effect, which is we retained the original $3.50 to $3.80 per share, is that we have $0.06 of transaction costs, plus the accretion that we think we will get during the course of the year, which effectively absorbs all of the shares that we're issuing. So we did not adjust our guidance downward as a result of the net of those 2 things, rather we've absorbed that within our range, the $0.30 range in our EPS guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Rigg at Susquehanna International.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to the HBR guidance for the year. It's not a big increase, but it's about 20 basis points. I was hoping you could walk us through the change there.","William N. Scheffel","I think the biggest change from what we gave in December to today is that we have a lower membership number for the Health Insurance Marketplace. And overall, the Health Insurance Marketplace has a lower HBR than the average for the company. So by having less of that, we have a slight increase in our HBR from that mix change, let's say. So it's really nothing in terms of an acuity difference or anything that we're seeing. It's really the folding in of less membership from the Health Insurance Marketplace that causes it.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up on Josh's question earlier about the woodwork effect. Just to be crystal clear here, if that \"woodwork effect\" were occurring, you would already have a pretty good idea if you were seeing a bump in the rolls for January?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think that the thing that I would say on woodwork is, the states control the enrollment process and so each state has their own way to determine eligibility. And when they get assigned to Medicaid and how it works through an auto assignment process, so -- and that's something we don't necessarily have a lot of visibility in each state all the time in terms of what their backlog might be in that regard. So we may see increases over the course of the next 6 months, but at this point in time, through January and February, we've not seen any appreciable change that we would attribute to being so-called woodwork effect.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Windley at Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","A follow-up on the HBR. Is it -- in thinking about your buckets of existing and new, is it right to think about the existing being about flat year-over-year or consistent with what you've been seeing maybe down a little, and the new moving up into the high-90s? Is that how we should think about those buckets moving?","William N. Scheffel","I think that, that's generally, okay, consistent. I think our existing also is impacted by the acuity level. So for example, we're going to put on a lot of long-term care business in Florida, which has a higher HBR than our average, typically. So you end up, now, having that rolling into the new bucket. So that will continue to be in the mid- or upper-90s. And then on the existing -- Kansas we'll roll into existing starting January 1 of '14, so we'll have that impact in 2014.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And on G&A, you obviously continue to get very nice leverage there. I'm wondering, with all the new business that you have been bringing on and will continue to bring on, are there any step function cost that we should be anticipating, be it in care management-type resources or IT investments, data centers, things like that, that we should be aware of that might affect the progression of your SG&A overhead levels?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes. I think some of you who have been out here and have seen our data center. It's been really -- the new one we built has been structured that it can triple our size by adding servers and it's -- I mean, it's very modularly, has not built on a lot of overhead. It was done in a way -- I think, those who saw it, made a lot of sense. So we anticipate that. There's always a little incremental addition of people when you add a new product, you add a long-term care to Florida or something. Your basic infrastructures, you have your presidents, your CEOs, your medical management people, because you're adding some nurses and case managers, our systems, our case managers and other things that we've added over the years, allow us to incrementally add people, really, are very supportive of taking on additional business and being able to leverage it through the system. So I think it's going to be a mix. Now are we going to an entirely new state, as we've shown you in the past, there's additional costs associated with that. But if there is an additional cost, it tends to be very transitory until we bring the plan up and get it running. Now the -- in the past, historically, costs have seem to go up from the G&A standpoint, new plans, where you are opening up a new state, new staff to be ready for a given date, and the state delays it.","William N. Scheffel","But overall, there's nothing in our pipeline that would say we would have a drastic change in our G&A cost or anything new that we'll be bringing on line would have that impact. It's all incremental and I think we will continue to enjoy the benefits of scale as we continue to grow.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. Bill, you had expected -- the last one for me. You had expected $0.60 to $0.65 in startup costs in '13. Did the number fall out at that level and where will that go in '14?","William N. Scheffel","Dave, I think what I said was $0.57 for 2013 is where we ended up. And one of the reasons we ended up there is because we consciously pulled back on some of our costs for the Health Insurance Marketplace given the membership issues. We thought that marketing and other costs might roll out earlier, and it didn't. So we ended up a little lower than what we originally anticipated. And then, I think one of my last comments was that we estimate to be $0.50 to $0.55 for 2014, which includes $0.06 for the transaction cost for USMM. So I think, right now, we tend to be in the, let's say, $0.45 to $0.55 range the last several years in terms of business expansion cost, I expect that to continue over time. But as we grow, that probably gets to be less of the percentage of the total.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck at Bank of America.","Unknown Analyst","This is Steve, on for Kevin. I wanted to come back to your guidance, particularly for G&A. I would have thought that, including the industry fee now, would have raised G&A by maybe like 90 basis points, instead it's only coming up 20. And I also would have thought that including that would have lowered your MLR, rather than raised it. So I was hoping to understand that a little bit better.","William N. Scheffel","Sure. I mean, that's a good question. Right now, we are expecting to treat the ACA insurer fee similar to the way we're treating premium taxes. In other words, we'll break that out as a separate component, either as part of premium taxes or separate but -- excluding it. We tend to talk about Premium and Service revenues as our revenue number, excluding premium taxes, we would expect to probably continue to do that and excluding the ACA insurer fee reimbursement from our revenues as our discussion of -- when we talk about our growth. Similarly, the actual expense, we would expect to be treated like premium taxes are in our G&A ratio -- in our G&A cost. And our G&A ratio does not include premium taxes. So therefore, when we fold in the ACA insurer fee in our updated guidance numbers, there's really -- we're not changing our premium service revenues because it's considered premium tax. We're not changing our G&A expenses ratio because we're considering that to be outside G&A expenses. We are changing our tax rate, that changed from roughly 40% to 50% because of the fact that the fee is nondeductible, and you have to factor that in. But those are the main impacts on the change in the guidance from adding in the fee.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. That's definitely helpful. And then just to switch back to the exchanges for a second. You said your enrollment assumption now is closer to the bottom end your original range of 70,000. I was wondering whether you've seen anything in January that makes you confident you'll be able to kind of ramp-up from the 21k that you reported. And then, also, you have the same outlook for margins, breakeven, the slight loss, despite your overall lower level of G&A this year. I guess, pull back in spending give you confidence you'll be able to achieve that still?","William N. Scheffel","Yes. We're -- we did see -- as the market saw some pickup in the rate of enrollments towards the end of December, and we've continued to see steady rates of enrollment through January, we think that's going to continue. And potentially, again, have another surge period before the end of -- end of the open enrollment period. So we're -- so everything is fairly steadily proceeding since the end of December, and we'll see where we end in the open enrollment period. We do think that we should be able to get some additional enrollment outside of the open enrollment period, given the small number of people in the exchange and the number of people that are turning off of Medicaid and other insurance plans, looking for exchange eligibility throughout the rest of 2014 also.","Operator","Drew Schenker at Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","It's Andrew Schenker. So just a couple of quick questions. On the duals, just could you update us on how the discussions are going with the states? And CMS, are there any thoughts you have on timing as these conversations are progressing? Do you think we're going to hold to that current expected timelines for the states?","Michael F. Neidorff","Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter","Yes. Drew, so we have, obviously, state-specific discussions and kind of the broader discussions with CMS. And there continues to be some movement on the timelines, but we're working with each of the states on an individual basis to see how those things progress. There has been momentum, I would say, over the last quarter or so on moving those things forward. So as we get closer into some of the states, Illinois, as an example, we have a lot more visibility on how some of those things are progressing. Ohio, I think, would be kind of next in line, if you will. Some of the other states that are kind of further down the pipe, we've talked about South Carolina and Michigan via our investment in Fidelis. Those are just earlier stage right now, so there is little less visibility on where we'll end up from a timing standpoint.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then changing gears here. Just thinking about acquisition investment pipeline, obviously, you guys have been active, Fidelis being the most recent ones. Any changes or thoughts now that we've got the initial rollout of the exchanges and Medicaid ramping up on your acquisition strategy?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes. We still have an aggressive program looking at opportunities and -- within our guidelines on IRR and accretion, et cetera. And so when the right one is there, you'll hear about it. I can't talk about the specifics because it'll just make it very expensive.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Lake at JPMorgan.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Mike Newshel, in for Justin. A question on hep C. You said the guidance includes -- are you able to give us a dollar estimate in terms of what's included in the guidance?","William N. Scheffel","I think that -- as every year, there's going to be new drugs that come out. And so we have -- we knew this hep C drug was coming out, so we have adjusted our estimates accordingly, but we're not going to get into specifics of how much I think that we would have the cost in our health plans of members utilizing the drug, and we have the benefits from AcariaHealth, which is a supplier of the drugs also. So we have a little bit of offset.","Michael F. Neidorff","And I mean, we reported there's 22 cases so far since its come out. And I think trying to get anymore granular than that could be misleading.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Right. And of those 22 approved request, can you say how many total requests you have in term -- both how many may have been rejected because they don't meet guidelines or how many still might be pending?","Michael F. Neidorff","It's just -- there's a reasonable number, but I don't have that in front of me.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Costa at Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","The G&A was probably lower this quarter than you would have expected, given that you delayed some of the spending on the exchanges, probably by at least $0.03 of earnings impact. Can you tell us where did that -- what's the offset to that, that caused your earnings to be about in line? Did your -- according to my model, your MRR is a little bit higher. Was there a higher medical expense in the fourth quarter than you otherwise would have anticipated and what caused that?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think that there's a combination of things in the G&A. We were lower on our spending for the business expansion cost, which includes the rollout for the Health Insurance Marketplace. But we didn't have other activities that we were investing in during the quarter, which wouldn't qualify as \"business expansion costs\". And so some of that's -- so it's nothing in particular, but I would say our medical costs were in line as we talked about 30 basis points increase, I think, quarter-over-quarter. And so I think it's really just other G&A items and -- that we were spending money on.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then can you talk a little bit about -- have you seen anything from any of the states regarding eligibility tightening? Is that creating somewhat of an offset in terms of the membership that you're enrolling in Medicaid?","William N. Scheffel","Well, again, the states control that process, and each state is a little different. And each state uses a different enrollment broker at times, and they can be in different stages of annual recertification, things like that, how long it takes to get reenrolled. And so there really isn't any general comments you can make other than it's a state-by-state case. And it's not unusual for us to see fluctuations in membership in any state as a result of eligibility changes or enrollment, broker activity, et cetera. And what we have seen so far, we would say is normal.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes. I was going to say there's nothing in -- to answer your question, there's nothing that's abnormal about it. It's a normal course of business. And we have 20 states and there'll be variations across them.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And the last question. Can you talk about your $138 billion in pipeline out there? Can you break that down by sort of core Medicaid, dual-eligibles, exchange membership?","Michael F. Neidorff","Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter","Yes. So we've talked in kind of broad strokes over the last year or so at our various investor conferences around the split. And if you think about kind of the core Medicaid piece, it represents the, I would say, the majority of the opportunity of that pipeline so it'd be either existing Medicaid or products on the Medicaid side within our existing markets. So you think about ABD, long-term care expansion, things along those lines. And then, it's like the next biggest category would be on the dual-eligible opportunities, again, focused on our existing markets and then further expansion on the marketplace front.","William N. Scheffel","Just a follow-up to the other question too, just in general. One of the things on the G&A front, we did increase in the fourth quarter some of our performance-based compensation amounts. And because that's based on earnings, as earnings did well in the fourth quarter and for all of 2013, there was an increase there, too.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And regarding the $138 billion, was there any change in terms of the relative pieces of that?","Jesse N. Hunter","No. I think the $138 billion was the number that we used in our December conference, and that's something, obviously, we continue to monitor. And I think we'll have a revised view of that when we talk again in June.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Fidel at Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question. Just any help you can give us on the breakdown of what you expect in terms of the percentage of earnings between the first half and the second half? Looks like, in 2013, you trended around 60% in the back half. And given the impact to the industry, if you have any thoughts on how it might like in 2014?","William N. Scheffel",".","I think it's difficult right now to peel out the impact of the ACA insurer fee on the first or second quarter depending on the level of progress that is made on the documentation side. I think that, excluding that, I would expect that our progression of earnings would be similar to some prior years. And that the little -- seasonally, you're lower in the first quarter, and third and fourth quarter picks up. So I think that's still the case. And then, I think you always have to look at with and without the ACA insurer fee for purposes in making those estimates now.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then I had a second question. Just interested if you're seeing any impact on the expected timing of the rollout of the Florida MMA due to the contract dispute and some of the litigation around the prestige provider service network. It doesn't sound like that from the prepared comments, where you talked about it going live in 2Q, but -- just interested if there's any effect from that?","Michael F. Neidorff","Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter","Yes. So Scott, I think, probably, the best thing to say is that we're working very closely with the state to make sure that we do our best to keep things on track from a timing perspective.","Michael F. Neidorff","Everybody is interested to see that, from their budgetary and ours as well.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just last question. Just interested in your thoughts on how -- what type of impact you're maybe seeing in the first quarter just around some of this extreme weather that we're seeing in a number of areas in the country. I would assume for you guys that might be most relevant just on the Midwest markets, and whether you think that's going to be more of a positive or negative on utilization?","Michael F. Neidorff","Mary?","Mary V. Mason","I would say this is a normal -- what would you would normally expect in January, normal flu season, normal for RSD, really nothing unusual.","William N. Scheffel","I think that utilization numbers are still to be determined from all the weather, and the weather that gets -- some things may be deferred, but then picked up later so...","Michael F. Neidorff","Somebody misses their appointment on January 31, they may pick it up on February 5. But the point is, there'll be some swings but over the quarter, we see nothing really meaningful.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Borsch at Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just maybe back on the industry fee one more time. And I just want to understand, are you talking to the states about onetime recruitment mechanisms or is it something they're going to blend into the rate? And I guess, I was interested in that question, I assumed that they're not making or aren't planning on making a rate change that would apply to everyone in the market because then they would be overcompensating those not-for-profit plans, assuming there are some in the market that are exempt.","Michael F. Neidorff","You hit the issue. Some states, depending on the number of not-for-profits they have said, \"Well, we'll wait to the end of the fiscal year, and we will just reimburse you. Gross up and reimburse you what is owed.\" And then once that's signed, Bill and Jeff and the team can start to accrue it as appropriate. That's the issue. There's no boiler plate. Each state is taking a little different approach in how they look at it and go about it. And some are grossing up the fees, some are building it into the fees. But I see nothing onetime. This is an ongoing issue that will have to -- because as the business grows, fee -- the fee will grow and it has to be compensated.","William N. Scheffel","A few states, particularly some that don't have any not-for-profits and managed care, are building into the rates, but that's probably the small minority. I think most of them are probably going to do it through a reconciliation and true-up process in the September time frame, for purposes of actually making the payment. Again, the documentation, we would try to get right now, which will allow us to accrue for that over the course of the year.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just on a different topic, one more, which is you mentioned the hep C new drug patient load being very, very small. What reason would you -- I mean, given the efficacy of the drug, and I'm obviously not an expert on it, but I would have expected a much bigger number there. I'm just curious if you can elaborate on that.","Mary V. Mason","It's a very good question. And right now, genotype 2 and 3, which is a much smaller percentage of the -- genotype 1 is the most common, which is about 80% of cases. Really, only for genotype 2 and 3 is there an all-oral interferon-free treatment. So that's really probably why you're seeing it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Wright at Monness, Crespi, Hardt.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Last quarter, you had showed the DCPs have 42.9 days and the -- it looks like there may be a reclass this quarter because now you're showing the September ending quarter at 40.6 days. So if you could just help us out with that.","William N. Scheffel","Sure. The reclassification of Kentucky as discontinued results in the medical claims liability account to be adjusted to carve out the Kentucky piece, so we recalculate the DCP. And in the page in press release, I think we show 5 quarters worth of the DCP from continuing operations like every other -- almost every other number in there, and that's really the cause of the changes, just without Kentucky.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just one follow-up. Was there any benefit in the quarter from retro rates in Georgia or Florida?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think that, in both cases, we received the rate amendments in the quarter. So certainly, for the -- that was anticipated for the whole year, and...","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","So it was in the prior guidance...","William N. Scheffel","It's always been in the guidance for the whole year and it came in consistent with that.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Is that around $6 million or something like that or more?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I don't think we quantify usually the amount of a rate increase for a particular state, so. It's included in the 2.7%, I think, which is the composite rate increase that Michael gave earlier for 2013.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Halper at FBR.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just 2 questions. The enrollment for the exchange products were coming in lower than your expectations. And what does this mean in terms of how you evaluate that line of business as you consider participation in 2015 because those decisions need to be made in the first half of this year? And then, what were your expectation for 2015 in terms of adding a state or 2 from what you see right now?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes. I guess, I'd comment that what we look primarily is the strategy. And we've articulated from the beginning that our focus would be on what we call the churn. Those that gain and lose Medicaid membership and go in and out. And that appears to be the case, Steve. So we'll continue to monitor that. And if it's working in that case, in that basis, we'll continue down the line. We'll look at the overall financial results, all of the things that one looks at this type of thing. Anything you'd add, Rone?","K. Rone Baldwin","Yes. I think, also, we've consistently said that we -- 2014 we viewed as our major goal to get a smart launch off into the exchanges and that we viewed this as a longer-term opportunity over a series of years. So I think that what we're seeing in 2014 to date doesn't impact our long-term view about the potential that this could be a meaningful opportunity for us. And we'll look at -- we are looking at additional geographic expansion, additional service areas in our existing states, and then additional -- new states. And I'm sure we will do some service area expansion, and the level will depend on how we assess our experience and our success in feeling like we can come out with a competitive product and network in those additional service areas.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And just the second question in terms of the visibility and to potentially adding your other states away from the -- not relating to the enrollment, the exchange business.","Michael F. Neidorff","Right. So we, obviously, we had some -- our intelligence tells us there's some new RFPs being contemplated by the states. We'll monitor those. When they come out, we'll make a determination as we always do, the size, the scale of the opportunity for it, and make that decision once we get the fact book and information. So it's kind of hard to sit here and get too specific, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl McDonald at Citi.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In the states where you do compete with not-for-profits, do you have a preference for how the state treats the industry fee? Just thinking about from a competitive perspective, and if we use like Texas as an example, if you do $4 billion in Texas revenue and fully implemented the industry fees, maybe something around 4% of premiums, that's $150 million, $160 million a year. So over a 10-year budget window, you're talking about $1.5 billion using the for-profit versus not-for-profit. So maybe you can just walk through maybe there's a matching impact from the federal government or just sort of how states are thinking about that.","Michael F. Neidorff","What the states are looking at is that they will -- in Texas, most of them say, \"We're not going to give you a rate adjustment across-the-board that the not-for-profits benefit from.\" What we will do is we'll look at an actual reimbursement. I think, Rone said that a little bit earlier that they'll look and see what our costs were. And at the end of their fiscal year, they'll write the check and they'll work with CMS from their side on what federal reimbursement they get.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Right. I'm just thinking about if you're a state and you're looking at a 10-year budget window and you say if I choose a not-for-profit, the cost visibility are $1.5 billion lower than choosing a for-profit, how will they think about that?","Michael F. Neidorff","I don't think -- I mean, over time, I don't think that's a criteria that they're looking at. They're looking at the overall capabilities of planning the outcomes and what we're delivering, I mean, savings. There are some -- there was one governor, I remember, who made a comment that, \"These big not-for-profits are costing me money, and it's the for-profits that are saving me the money.\"","Operator","At this time, we show no further questions. Would you like to make any closing remarks?","Michael F. Neidorff","No. I just -- we thank you for taking time for this call. We look forward to the first quarter results. Have a good day.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation.

A reminder, that Centene will host its first quarter 2020 earnings call on Tuesday, April 28, 2020.","And with that, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Centene\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2019 earnings call. I would like to apologize now for any residual cough you may hear as a result of some bronchitis I had a week or so ago.","Before I go to our 2019 results, let me say how pleased we are to have closed the WellCare transaction on January 23. We are cautiously optimistic that the transaction would close early in the first half of 2020 and we are happy that this was the case. We are now a $100 billion plus enterprise providing healthcare services to more than 24 million members across all 50 states or 1 in 15 individuals across the nation. Having achieved this, we still have a long runway ahead of us with enhanced scale, further diversification of products and capabilities and greater opportunities for growth across portfolio.","As we have previously disclosed, our planning assumption was to be ready to begin the integration by January 1. I am pleased to report that the integration process is well underway and teams were managing their various work streams. For example, we have begun to align 2021 bids for our Medicare business. In addition, we have activated integration plans in markets, where WellCare and Centene overlap, such as New York, Georgia and Florida. We remain on track to achieve our previously committed and communicated accretion and synergy targets. Most importantly, we are happy to welcome the WellCare team and colleagues to Centene.","Let me now turn to a recap of Centene\u2019s 2019 highlights. 2019 was another robust year for Centene. We delivered strong top and bottom line growth enabled by operational and commercial successes across our enterprise. We remain focused sticking to our business-as-usual approach. We were not distracted by the significant headline noise during the year. We continue to execute against our strategic priorities and invest in capabilities that have positioned Centene for long-term success. In 2019, we added 1.1 million members representing growth of more than 8% surpassing the 15 million member mark. This growth was achieved in the face of state eligibility re-determinations, which continued to moderate. We continue to grow our market leading position in both Medicaid and the ACA marketplace.","We grew revenues by 24% to $74.6 billion and adjusted earnings per diluted share by 25% to $4.42. The HBR increased 140 basis points to 87.3 driven by normalized margins in the exchange business relative to favorable performance in 2018 in the health insurer fee moratory. The adjusted net income margin increased 10 basis points to 2.6%. We continue to execute a smooth and seamless integration of Fidelis. The only remaining task in this process is to finalize the incorporation of Fidelis on to our claims systems platform. We also continue to invest in strengthening our products and capabilities with a focus on areas that will complement our core business, enable us to continually enhance how we impact patient outcomes while delivering long-term care.","A few highlights. We achieved meaningful progress with Centene Forward an important initiative that we expect will better position Centene for long-term growth, increase margins and profitability. In 2019, we executed on more than $500 million in initiatives and the program has now evolved into a permanent part of Centene\u2019s and the company\u2019s organization and culture. We continue to migrate our membership to RxAdvance, the technology-based pharmacy platform, which enhances quality and transparency while lowering costs. We continue to focus on proof-of-concept and we\u2019ll expand as appropriate. We increased our stake in Ribera Salud from 50% to 90%. This demonstrates our commitment to continue developing Centene\u2019s international portfolio.","We are also proud of the initiatives we announced in 2019 to enhance the health of the communities we serve. I would like to highlight just a few. In February, we formed a social health bridge trust to help organizations more effectively address the social determinants of health. In April, we launched the OpiEnd Youth Challenge to raise awareness among adolescents about opioid misuse and prevention of dependence. And in September, we launched the Food for Today and Food for Tomorrow development initiative with feeding America to help experiencing food insecurity. These initiatives are all in line with our whole health focus, an integrated and holistic approach to how we work with our communities. We are focused on addressing the broad range of social determinants of health. For example, Medicaid have always \u2013 are particularly likely to struggle with non-medical barriers to health, including nutrition, education, transportation and proper housing. As a leading multinational managed care enterprise, we will continue to lead initiatives and partner with organizations to transform the health of communities across the globe.","Moving on to the market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. During the year, we maintained our industry leading Medicaid RFP win rate of 80% with success across new contracts as well as renewals and contract expansions. Medicaid membership grew approximately 3% to year-over-year to 8.6 million recipients. Texas. In November, Centene successfully re-procured the expanded \u2013 and expanded its STAR+PLUS contract in Texas. We will be providing healthcare services to recipients in two new services, El Paso and Travis, while continuing to operate in our 7 existing service areas. Centene currently serves 140,000 beneficiaries under existing contract. The new expanded contract is scheduled to commence September 1 of 2020. On a separate note, the state of Texas has now indicated that the STAR, CHIP re-procurement announcement will be sometime in February. We remain confident in the value we bring to the state.","Pennsylvania. On January 1, 2020, Centene successfully launched the third and final phase of the Pennsylvania long-term care contract adding approximately 38,000 beneficiaries. As a reminder, we launched the southwest zone in January of 2018 and the southeast zone in January of 2019. We are the leading long-term provider in the state, currently serving approximately 90,000 recipients. The addition of the third zone will bring our total annual revenue in Pennsylvania to over $2 billion. Centene\u2019s participation in this important program reinforces our national leadership position in long-term care.","Louisiana. I am pleased to announce that on January 17, 2020, the Louisiana procurement officer found the state procurement to be the most \u2013 for the most recent RFP that I quote was fairly broad. After months of reviewing our protest, the procurement officer agreed the state failed to comply with the requirements set forth in the RFP MLR. Consequently, the procurement was rescinded and the awards were cancelled. The state and awardees have appealed the decision to the Commissioner of Administration that we are currently awaiting for results. We remain confident that Commissioner will uphold the procurement officer\u2019s decision. Centene\u2019s plan continues to operate under the previously mentioned emergency contract with the state.","North Carolina. As we have noted, Centene as a provider of that entity, has been awarded three regions in North Carolina. North Carolina\u2019s Medicaid managed care program has been delayed from its previously announced February 1, 2020 start date pending approval in the state budget. At this point, no official timeline has been announced. We continue to maintain sufficient operations for all required implementation activities during this delay. In addition, we are defending our awards against ongoing protest and expect that we will retain our awards once the process is complete.","Illinois. In February, we commenced operations on the state\u2019s foster care program, serving approximately 15,000 beneficiaries. We expect additional enrollment of approximately 17,000 later this year. Health insurance marketplaces, we remain pleased with the strength of our marketplace business, which has continued to be very popular and an attractive option for many consumers. In 2019, we retained our market leading national position. At year end, we served approximately 1.8 million exchange members in 20 states. This represented growth of approximately 20% year-over-year. For 2020, we expanded our footprint in 10 of our existing Ambetter states and 106 new towns. Our continued focus on providing high-quality affordable healthcare led to a very successful open enrollment.","In January, we had almost 2.2 million members across 20 states. This represents a year-over-year increase of approximately 200,000 beneficiaries. In addition, the key demographics of these members, remains relatively consistent with prior years. The average age declined by 1 year to 42. Our retention rate increased 2% to 82% and our effectuation rate increased by 3% to 96%. We expect to have another strong year of operations in our industry leading marketplace business.","On to Medicare, at year end, we served approximately 405,000 Medicare and MMP beneficiaries, a decrease of approximately 3% year-over-year. We do not achieve our growth expectations in Medicare, and overall performance has not kept pace with the rest of our products. We have been focused on addressing the underlying drivers of this underperformance. The addition of WellCare\u2019s high performing Medicare portfolio will serve as an important catalyst to accelerate our growth and performance in this business. As I mentioned last month at an investor conference, we plan to operate our Medicare business under the WellCare brand name. Looking ahead, I am comfortable that we will be able to reset the trajectory of this business. A couple of quick comments. Our medical costs, they remain stable and in line with our expectations in the low single digits. On the rate outlook for 2019, our composite Medicaid rate increase was 2%. We are expecting a composite Medicaid rate increase of approximately 1.5% for 2020.","Now, let me provide commentary on healthcare legislation and regulatory environment. We believe that there is little desire in Washington D.C. to revisit comprehensive healthcare reform. However, Congress and the administration continue to explore ways to improve the healthcare delivery system. We are pleased with the end-of-year legislation, which included a provision fully eliminating the health insurer fee beginning in 2021. This tax not only increased the cost for seniors and those who purchase commercial coverage, but require states to pay hundreds of millions of dollars for tax that placed significant strength under Medicaid programs. In addition, the marketplace revisions aimed at stabilized individual market further indicate bipartisan support for exchanges.","Last week, the administration announced a block grant proposal aimed at giving states more flexibility with their expansion population. We are currently reviewing this proposal and look forward to working with the administration to help promote Medicaid fiscal integrity, while making sure the program remains available to those who need it. Centene welcomes the federal government\u2019s efforts to promote safe innovation across all programs to make coverage more affordable and sustainable. It represents another opportunity to be an innovative partner with the states, and Centene with its local approach is well-positioned to do so.","In conclusion, 2019 was another very successful year for Centene. We delivered solid financial performance and made significant progress against our strategic priorities. We look forward to 2020 and beyond with confidence as we continue to build on this positive momentum with a focus on driving significant growth across the portfolio with an enterprise on organic growth and an emphasis on organic growth. Continuing our focus on operational excellence and margin expansion and investing in the strength, scale and quality of our enterprise and portfolio to position us to continue to deliver value over the long-term.","Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide you with further details on fourth quarter and full year 2019 financial results. Jeff?","Jeff Schwaneke","Thank you, Michael and good morning. This morning, we reported strong fourth quarter and full year 2019 results. Fourth quarter revenues were $18.9 billion, an increase of 14% over the fourth quarter of 2018. And adjusted diluted earnings per share were $0.73 this quarter compared to $0.69 last year. Now let me provide additional details for the fourth quarter. Total revenues grew by approximately $2.3 billion over the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily as a result of growth in the health insurance marketplace business, expansion in new programs in many of our states in 2019, particularly Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico and Pennsylvania, and our recent acquisitions in Spain, this growth was partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019.","Moving on to HBR, our health benefits ratio was 88.4% in the fourth quarter this year compared to 86.8% in last year\u2019s fourth quarter and 88.2% in the third quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase was attributable to the health insurance marketplace business where margins have normalized as expected from favorable performance in 2018. The increase was also due to the health insurer fee moratorium. Sequentially, the 20-basis-point increase in HBR from the third quarter of 2019 is primarily due to the normal seasonality in the health insurance marketplace business and a moderate increase in flu-related costs. The HBR for the fourth quarter was higher than our expectations, driven by higher-than-projected medical costs in our marketplace business and slightly higher than projected flu costs. The marketplace business continues to perform well and finished the year with pre-tax margins well within our targeted 5% to 10% range. Marketplace membership remains strong as we ended the year with approximately 1.8 million members. For 2020, we expect our peak enrollment to be approximately 2.2 million members, representing growth of over 10% from last year\u2019s peak enrollment. This is in line with the range that we provided at our December Investor Day.","Now on to SG&A, our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 9.5% in the fourth quarter this year compared to 9.9% last year and 8.8% in the third quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease reflects the leveraging of expenses over higher revenues and lower variable compensation cost in 2019. The sequential increase is primarily due to an increase in selling costs in the fourth quarter of 2019 and the impact of approximately $440 million of at-risk state directed payments in California recorded in premium revenue in the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, we spent $0.05 per diluted share on business expansion costs during the fourth quarter. During the fourth quarter, we recorded $30 million or $0.05 per diluted share of debt extinguishment costs related to the redemption of our $1.4 billion 5.625% senior notes due February 15, 2021. This includes the call premium, the write-off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a loss on the termination of the $600 million interest rate swap associated with the notes.","Investment income was $126 million during the fourth quarter compared to $67 million last year and $98 million last quarter. The year-over-year increase reflects increased investment balances over 2018, including the proceeds of our $7 billion senior note issuance related to the planned financing for the cash consideration of the WellCare acquisition, improved performance associated with our deferred compensation portfolio and the impact of higher investment balances. Sequentially, investment income increased in the fourth quarter due to the higher investment balances associated with the WellCare financing and improved performance associated with our deferred compensation investment portfolio, which fluctuates with its underlying investments. The earnings from our deferred compensation portfolio were substantially offset by increases in deferred compensation expense recorded in SG&A.","Interest expense was $113 million for the fourth quarter 2019 compared to $98 million last year and $99 million last quarter. Both the year-over-year and sequential increase reflects a net increase in borrowings related to the issuance of an additional $7 billion in senior notes in December 9, 2019, used primarily to finance the cash consideration of the WellCare transaction.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 22.3% compared to 32.5% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The decrease is driven by the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium. Sequentially, the fourth quarter tax rate was in line with our expectations and lower than the third quarter tax rate, driven by the vesting of our employee stock awards, which occurs every December.","Now on to the balance sheet, cash and investments totaled $21.4 billion at quarter end, including $7.2 billion held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Debt at quarter end was $13.7 billion, which includes $93 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio at the year-end was 34.3%, excluding our non-recourse debt and the senior notes issued to fund the WellCare transaction. This compares to 37.4% at the fourth quarter last year and 35.6% at the third quarter of 2019. Our medical claims liability totaled $7.5 billion at quarter end and represents 45 days in claims payable compared to 48 days in the third quarter of 2019. The decrease in DCP is driven by a reduction in state directed payments that are a component of our medical claims liability.","As we have highlighted in the past, we expect the DCP to be in the mid-40 range on a run rate basis, but state directed payments at the end of some quarters have increased our DCP to a higher level. In the fourth quarter, we did not have any material state directed payments included in our medical claims liability, which drove the decrease in DCP. Historically, these payments were administered as pass-through and not a component of medical cost. But as states have moved these payments into premiums with a small amount of risk, they have been included in premium revenue and medical cost. Cash flow used in operations was $651 million in the fourth quarter and cash flow provided by operations was $1.5 billion for the full year 2019 or 1.1x net earnings. Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter of 2019 was negatively affected by the timing of payments from a few of our state customers as well as the absence of material state directed payments that I previously mentioned.","Now, let me provide an update on the WellCare acquisition. We are pleased to close the WellCare acquisition on January 23 and have begun the integration process. Each WellCare share was converted into 3.38 shares of Centene common stock valued at $66.76, plus $120 per share in cash for a total value of $19.6 billion, including $1.95 billion of assumed debt. Based on the closing price of Centene stock on the acquisition date, we expect our debt-to-capital ratio to be approximately 39% at close, excluding any share repurchases or repayment of debt associated with the proceeds from divestitures. Given the closing date, the results for January will be pro-rated for our ownership period of WellCare and the divestiture of our Illinois business.","Now shifting to 2020, as stated in our press release this morning, we will be providing consolidated guidance, including the WellCare acquisition on Tuesday, March 3, with a conference call the morning of March 4 at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time. As I just highlighted, we need to close the month of January and prorate the activity for the month\u2019s performance and account for the divestiture transaction. Absent the WellCare acquisition and related divestitures, the Centene standalone guidance we provided at our Investor Day in December was still intact. We remain comfortable with the previously communicated accretion targets of no less than breakeven in the first full year post-acquisition and mid to upper single-digit accretion in the second full year. Additionally, we continue to expect year two net synergies of $500 million and run rate net synergies of $700 million. We will provide an update to all these metrics on the March 4 call.","While we will provide our formal guidance in March, I would like to highlight a few headwinds and tailwinds that will affect the guidance for 2020. First, the headwinds, in the S-4 WellCare assumed the North Carolina contract would begin on February 1. Moving the start date to October 1 in line with our model reduces revenue and earnings for 2020. Second, due to the closing date, Centene will not incorporate 22 days of WellCare\u2019s January results into the combined 2020 guidance. Additionally, the amounts in the S-4 did not account for any divestitures. The total divested business represents approximately $3.6 billion in annualized 2020 total revenue and 650,000 members.","Now turning to tailwinds, WellCare had a successful open enrollment period for both its Medicare Advantage plans and Part D plans. Medicare annual enrollment was in line with expectations and the PDP business currently has approximately 4.4 million members. Given the timing of close, we continue to review WellCare\u2019s 2019 results, including any one-time items in the effect on the 2020 forecast. As stated earlier, we will provide a full update on the March call.","In summary, 2019 was a successful year for the company as we continue to execute on our growth strategy. We grew both total revenues and adjusted earnings by approximately 24% over 2018. Total revenues grew by $14.5 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share by $0.88. We reduced our leverage by 300 basis points in 2019 in preparation for the WellCare acquisition and continue to expand net income margins. Looking forward, we expect to leverage the combined capabilities to provide meaningful growth and efficiencies across all of our product lines. We are focused on executing the integration plan and achieving our stated synergy and accretion targets.","That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Alright, great. Thanks. That WellCare commentary was helpful. But I guess I just want to see if there was anything else that you would highlight as far as the delay in the guidance, because I think you guys provided the guidance for Health Net before the transaction closed. So just wondering if there is anything else that kind of lowers your visibility or any other items that you really want to get color on before you provided maybe the proposed MA rates or anything like that, if you want to get a color on?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, just a couple of things, Kevin. I think it\u2019s just purely the timing of the closing the WellCare or the Health Net transaction closed around the end of March and their annual 10K audited financials were already out. And so, literally, I think, it\u2019s just the timing of close. And I think you also have the fact that their audit is not complete, as well as the last step in the regulatory approval process in this transaction was the Department of Justice piece. So, again, we were operating as two independent companies until the time of closure.","Michael Neidorff","That is a considerably larger complex number of states and businesses they\u2019re involved in. And we want to \u2013 as you know, Kevin, we would like to do it methodically and carefully, so taking an extra 30 days or so seemed to make sense.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then just my last question, the MLR on the exchange is coming in higher than you expect in the quarter. Can you provide a little more color as to why that was the case and why we shouldn\u2019t be worried that that\u2019s going to impact your 2020 outlook? If costs are higher, why don\u2019t you flow through into how you price for 2020 so it came in after you priced?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, I might just start and let Jeff pick it up. We want to remind you what we have said historically. One, it is falling within our guided range of 5% to 10%. Two, we had commented how we are keeping the members longer, and so that could have an impact on the MLR in the fourth quarter. But because of keeping them longerthe total margin impact is unaffected by it. You may want to go a little bit beyond that, Jeff?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I would say a couple of things, Kevin. I would say, we did see some higher non-inflation costs in the fourth quarter than we anticipated. But also a little less than half of the fourth quarter costs in the exchange business that were higher than our expectations was associated with the reconciliation of outstanding claims items that were settled and resulted in more favorable reimbursement going forward. And the majority of these were in states where we have MLR rebates. So \u2013 and then, the other thing is, we have mentioned \u2013 we did mention in our December Investor Day that we did expect exchange margins to continue to moderate slightly in 2020. So, I guess, what I would say is, you combine all that together, we\u2019re still comfortable with where our 2020 expectations are for the exchange business.","Michael Neidorff","It is a very strong business. And as I commented, all the demographics continues and still on the growth. And basically what people expected additional competition, etcetera, we continue to do well and it\u2019s \u2013 and these one-time things Jeff talks about can have an impact. But that\u2019s \u2013 that has a benefit going forward.","Kevin Fischbeck","So, I guess just to make sure, you\u2019re saying that some of these settlements were going to also prospectively impact costs upward, but there are markets where you have rebates. I guess if you had a settlement like that in Q4 and you\u2019re paying rebates why was that?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, no. What I\u2019m saying is that we had costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter that will provide better reimbursement going forward.","Kevin Fischbeck","Better.","Jeff Schwaneke","And those, yes \u2013 and the more favorable reimbursement going forward and those costs that we incurred in the fourth quarter happened to be in states where we have MLR rebates, so there is some mitigating effect. And it reduces those MLRs 3-year rolling calculations, so it reduces the effect of the MLR going forward.","Kevin Fischbeck","Alright, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Hi, thanks. Good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Josh Raskin","Good morning, Michael. The first one, just on the difference between first year at least breakeven versus missing the first three weeks. Should we assume that that\u2019s actually a favorable thing in terms of, I think, about PDP benefit design or should we think of it as 2020 no material difference than first year post-closing?","Jeff Schwaneke","Well, I mean that\u2019s why it\u2019s one of the reasons why we\u2019re waiting, Josh, is you have to actually close the month of January. And as you\u2019re well aware, there could be variability on the medical cost side. I think on the revenue side, you kind of know your members and you know the premium, but the cost side is what you don\u2019t know. And so, one of the reasons we\u2019re waiting until the beginning of March to give the combined guidance is just to get the actual numbers for January and do the proration math.","Josh Raskin","Okay. And then, how are you guys thinking about PBM opportunity on the legacy WellCare book? I don\u2019t think there was a formal announcement. I know they were talking about making some changes or at least going through the process there. Now, it\u2019s part of Centene overall, and I assume you guys will be instrumental in that decision making process. So how are you thinking about that?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, I think let me \u2013 I\u2019ll let Jeff give you the more specifics. But we said earlier that the PBM will be based in Tampa and Drew is going to drive that process for us. And we see some real benefits in the total purchasing power without having a consolidation, you can give more specifics.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, Josh. I think they were in process on an RFP. I think they have concluded that process. Right now what I would say is we are in flight on the synergy analysis, obviously looking at their contracts and our contracts and all the PBM capabilities. And I would say harmonizing those to achieve the value that we are trying for in the synergies. So I guess that\u2019s where we are. We have begun the process and we are in process on that now more to come in March.","Josh Raskin","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes, hi. Good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Ricky Goldwasser","One follow-up on your answer on the PBM question, you mentioned that WellCare concluded the RFP process. Can you just clarify did they make a decision on that or did they just concluded the review of the RFP process?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, no. They have made a decision in that. I think they extended their contract with CBS for a period of 3 years.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. Thank you for that clarification. And then just as we think about the MLR obviously you talked about the moving parts in the fourth quarter that impact your initial thoughts. So, should we think about kind of like the flu is a 20 bps impact? Do you think it was kind of like the difference between the high-end of your initial range versus where you came in? And then when we think about the impact in the first quarter and I know that you don\u2019t guide to the quarter, how should we think about the flu continuing to weigh on MLR?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I guess a couple of things. I just bifurcate the marketplace versus the flu. Again, this is versus our expectations. I would say the marketplace was two-thirds of the variance with the flu being a third. So I think that gets you close to 20 to 30 basis points on the quarter. So, I think, you are close on that. As far as the flu for Q1, we will have to wait and see, one month is not a quarter and so we will have to see how flu costs pan out for the entire quarter. As you are well aware, we did talk about the effect of Leap Year and the additional day on the first quarter\u2019s performance and I think we discussed that ad nauseam at our December Investor Day.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","Got it. Thanks. Sorry. Maybe one more follow-up on the PBM question, if it\u2019s an extension for 3 years with CVS, is there any change of control provisions that would allow you as you do the analysis to consolidate the PBM operations sooner or would you have to wait for the three years to be over to really kind of roll something altogether?","Michael Neidorff","I think there is certain flexibility that built into the contract. So, obviously, they knew they were in the middle of a transaction. And so, I think there is some flexibility in that. But again, we are doing the full analysis as we speak and more to come in March.","Jeff Schwaneke","It\u2019s really \u2013 and pricing with the amount of purchasing power we have will be very important.","Charles Rhyee","Understood. Thank you. And then just going back to individual a little bit, I think you said that for the year, you are sort of well within the target range of 5% to 10%, but when we think about margin normalization over the near and medium-term, where do you think we are in the process? Do you think we are going to \u2013 where do you think we kind of stabilize out over the next year or two? Thank you.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I will kind of go back to our \u2013 what we said at our December Investor Day. A couple of things to just highlight, remember, we have always talked about 2018 was a very good year for the marketplace business. And what we saw in \u201819 is a margin \u2013 a pre-tax margin that was very consistent with 2017, \u201816, \u201815. So, we have seen very consistent margins since the inception of the exchange business. For us, the outlier is really 2018, which had an exceptional year. And so as we close 2019, I would say, margins were exactly \u2013 they are roughly in line with that experience meaning consistent with \u201817 and \u201816. So, we are still comfortable that in the 5% to 10% range. And I think we mentioned at our Investor Day that we saw them moderating slightly, but it\u2019s not substantial. We don\u2019t see a material moderation in margin from \u201819 to \u201820.","Charles Rhyee","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. So 2020 is broadly expected to be a more competitive year for exchanges. And I am wondering if you can tell us if you have noticed any difference on the impact that it\u2019s having on market share ramp in new markets compared to expansions in past years?","Michael Neidorff","I think I heard the same thing last year. And we grew 10% in a market that shrank 1%. And I think we have strong networks. We saw the continuity of our members increase by 2%. We saw the effectuation increase. So at every level and I said all last year that we know how to be competitive. It makes us better. And I think there is \u2013 the product is strong and our consumers recognize it, like the networks we have and we expect to be more than competitive ongoing.","Sarah James","Got it. And maybe you could talk a little bit about the boost that ascension and some of the JVs could give to Medicare\u2019s growth. So should we think about that as potentially providing an opportunity to grow above market rates for Medicare?","Michael Neidorff","So I think we are still working through and now that we are able to work with WellCare and as I say, we are going to be consolidating that and we\u2019ll also be headquartered in Tampa that might poll in. And so we are working through that. They are working with us on the joint ventures. Those are things that are unfolding very nicely. They will take time. And I think the time to talk about the impacts they will have will probably be when we give guidance for 2021. And the team has had the full look at it, but we really see our trajectory changing with the input of the marketing and other capabilities that WellCare has demonstrated.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","Good morning, guys. I guess on the RxAdvance and WellCare, I am sort of curious did WellCare have full visibility into the cost and benefits of RxAdvance before renewing with CVS and what should we view as that?","Michael Neidorff","Well, we were \u2013 I want to be very clear we were very careful prior to the approval from the Department of Justice to operate as two very separate companies. And as we had no insight into their contracts and we were careful they didn\u2019t have any of ours, because the rules of that are very clear and it\u2019s the old story. You normally have to be honest and we prepared to be honest. And so we \u2013 they would had no insight into it.","Steve Tanal","Got it. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And maybe just one other on Centene Forward, wanted to understand how you guys are sort of thinking about in the context of earnings, do you expect at any point to sort of commit to certain net number or contribution and is that not \u201820 or \u201821 like just any color on that?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, let me start. I think as we said from the beginning, we are really self-funding a lot of development in our systems and systems capability. And the name of the game going forward is that and that\u2019s where our scale and size is $100 billion company is so important. We have \u2013 it gives us the resources to continue to focus on the systems that\u2019s going to deliver the kind of performance and margin improvement in \u201821, \u201822 and going forward. And as we start to, let some of that fall to the bottom line, as such, we will be in a position to disclose that in a succinct way. But it\u2019s \u2013 that so you have to cost a little bit like fingernails, you have to continually trim them. And we see this as incorporated in the company and it\u2019s a continuous process of reducing costs, while improving the capabilities of the company and we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with $500 million that we were able to achieve this past year and we see it continuing to grow in additional funding this year, which will just continue the next generation of systems work. And in fact, I am going to give just a little more color that we have \u2013 we were really bifurcating or trifurcating, I guess would be the word, our systems. We have that \u2013 we have a group that\u2019s going to be maintaining the systems that work day-in and day-out. We have a group that\u2019s going to be working on the transition, because there is a lot of transition with these systems, and I make no secret and they don\u2019t either that WellCare knew they were going to be sold at some point. And so there\u2019s a lot of little systems that\u2019s going to take some time to transition. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s a two, three-year process to do it right and get it right, and we\u2019re focused on that. And the third group are the advanced technology group. And these are the think-tank people, the people that have brought us things like Interpreta and others that give us real-time status for the physicians. They are going to take us to the next-generation. So that\u2019s being funded by these savings.","Steve Tanal","Helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research please go ahead.","Justin Lake","First, I just want to follow-up, one last question on the PBM. There was some talk by WellCare Group getting better economics potentially pulled forward into 2020 debt renewal, even though the contract doesn\u2019t begin or doesn\u2019t end to the end of the year, the original contract. So I am curious, if that is something we should consider that maybe 2020 could be - could have better PBM costs rather than 2021? And then, can you tell us if the strategy is to move Medicaid over to RxAdvance from WellCare Group early and then leave the Medicare PBM for CBS during the contract?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, Justin, Jeff here. So, as I mentioned before, I mean, we are going through the process right now comparing the PBM contracts and all the capabilities that both companies have and rationalizing that for the synergy opportunity. And so, I am not going to comment today. I kicked that question to March when we provide full combined guidance, because then we will have the opportunity to have the benefit of visibility on both those contracts.","Michael Neidorff","Yes and Justin, if I may. Just - if we think about, when you\u2019re combining these two companies, we had multiple work streams that were developed during the period of time we are waiting for Justice approval, and that\u2019s whether, its systems, and it is combining them. When you take the Florida and Georgia, they\u2019re large companies, both sides combining them. And the things that we are doing there, and while we have divested some plants, we have obligations there to ensure a smooth transition of that membership. You put all that together, it\u2019s very complex. So, we are just trying to take a - use the next few days to take a very careful view of it and get it right. We are not trying to duck anything, except, say, it just takes time when it\u2019s as complex as this one. I keep telling people, it\u2019s not how fast, it\u2019s how well you do it.","Justin Lake","Totally makes sense. I appreciate that. And then, just my follow-up is on the exchange medical costs in the fourth quarter. So, Jeff, if we think about the - you were above the high end of your range by about 20 basis points on MLR, so 80 basis points for the quarter. Can you give us some delineation in terms of how much of that was the exchange miss? Was it 50 or 60 out of the 80 basis points? Just trying to understand where exchange margins were in the quarter?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes. I will kind of package everything that I\u2019ve said together in one, maybe this will clarify everything. So, you\u2019re right on the 80 bps. So, MLR for the quarter was higher than our expectations by 80 basis points. I said two-thirds of that was marketplace, one-third, I would say, is flu. And those are just rough right? That is - and then, of the marketplace piece, I said a little bit less than half was associated with these reconciliation of the outstanding claims where we effectively had medical costs in the fourth quarter that will provide a benefit going forward, right. And some of that was in states where we had MLR rebates. And so, there is an offsetting effect there, but it\u2019s not a one to one because the MLR calculation is a three-year rolling calculation.","Michael Neidorff","I want to restate it. Just if I may my simple non-financial, okay. In fact, when you look at what we did there, we had some states where balanced going things with issues because we didn\u2019t have a contract with the hospital. We now have contracts with them. And we got those things settled, we got it right with them so we had the expense to settle those claims with those loops, but now going forward and these are larger states. Going forward in 2020, we are going to be in a stronger position because they\u2019re now part of the network. And those kind of issues won\u2019t be there. So it was really a onetime, get it right, and it could happen again just to be very candid. But I always view those things as that\u2019s where the long-term comes in. We were in this and we continue to do very well in a long time. It will cost us a couple of bps here or there in the quarter. I am looking at 2020, and I am really pleased with what we see happening, particularly when I see the membership, the effectuation rate, the demographics, it is just a really great business for us.","Justin Lake","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. Just on first, the comment about Medicaid rates, I think you came in, if I have got my notes right, into 2019 looking for a 1.5% increase. And I guess, today you are saying that you ended up with about a 2% all-in increase. And I am just wondering, is that mostly due to some true-ups around the research verifications or is it something else? And were there any reverifications of note in the fourth quarter? And you\u2019re saying 1.5% for 2020, are there potential reverifications that can help you in the early part of 2020?","Michael Neidorff","Well, I think \u2013 we said, the reveri \u2013 it is really moderating. And yes, we have had great success because of the real-time systems we have had in getting the states to recognize the membership mix and the acuity mix within it. We are never satisfied with the timing of how fast they make those adjustments, but part of it is, well, they say we have real-time systems, they have to wait and see what some others are doing that don\u2019t have that real-time capability, and that can slow down the whole process. So, on balance, we were comfortable that the stage in the large states we are working with, we are going to get it right with us. And it is just a matter of timing. So, which quarter it fall was in, that\u2019s a little more hard \u2013 that\u2019s a little harder to forecast, but it is all coming together right there too.","Jeff Schwaneke","No, I think Michael is exactly right. It is a timing perspective. We are not \u2013 there are some states that were still searching for rate adjustments heading into 2020. So, again, it is a timing issue, and we are still looking for additional rate adjustments in certain states for this effect.","A.J. Rice","Okay. But maybe, my other follow-up question would be, once you complete the WellCare deal, you said your pro forma, I think, debt to total cap would be at 39% as sort of your \u2013 where that\u2019s within your target range, I believe. So, do you need some time to digest WellCare or are you back on the acquisition hunt if something comes available that\u2019s attractive to you?","Michael Neidorff","Let me comment. One, the 39%, we still determine the proceeds of sale, and we are looking at both stock buyback and retirement of debt. So that will help. But I guess, I have to respond to this and say, we are not going to look at anything serious in large. And so, we are really comfortable that the trade this transaction and the integration has taken place to a level that\u2019s appropriate. But those people that know us know that we have an insatiable appetite. And so, I would say, as soon as \u2013 they also know we are balance sheet managers, and we look very carefully at that. So, I would say, as our balance sheet continues to strengthen, this gets integrated. And if we see opportunities, we will be back out there. But I have to emphasize what we said at our Investor Day, and I say it every chance, we are very driven by organic growth. And I remind people we had almost $7 billion of organic growth last year. So we are going to continue to focus on that and that\u2019s our primary focus. And then, as we see new capabilities and things we can add, we\u2019ll go in the M&A book. Does that help you?","A.J. Rice","Yes, that is helpful. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Andrew Mok","Hi, good morning. This is Andrew Mok on for Steve. Just wanted to follow-up on the MLR and exchange commentary, it sounds like you\u2019re attributing most of the MLR pressure to the exchange business. If we look back at full year 2019, how did Medicaid MLR perform relative to your expectations?","Jeff Schwaneke","Medicaid in aggregate, I think Medicaid was within the range. It wasn\u2019t \u2013 we would have called it out if it was a material one way or the other on the full year, when you look at year-over-year results.","Andrew Mok","And then, one clarification related to divestitures, you noted that the S-4 did not include divested business. That comment was referring purely to revenue, correct, your deal \u2013 your net deal synergies have always reflected synergies, correct?","Jeff Schwaneke","Just specifically on the revenue line.","Andrew Mok","Okay, great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Hi. First question just on the new block grant proposal, I appreciate that you are still digesting that. And Michael, I know you gave some initial comments. Just interested \u2013 just that this sort of initial sort of stance here. How are you thinking about this in terms of this being more of a net sort of positive around the innovation opportunity that you mentioned or more of a net potential negative around the funding caps and potential risk to rates or do you think that there\u2019s simply going to be some different moving pieces headwinds and tailwinds to this?","Michael Neidorff","Let me \u2013 I don\u2019t want to be very general on it because it is so early in it. But as we said, this is \u2013 this involves expansion, not the current businesses, is key and focused on the expansion of the area. Caps \u2013 block plans work really well in states that are not growing \u2013 and state of Oregon, it can have an impact, so various states will have various impacts. But as we look at it, we think \u2013 I am going to say that I tilt toward a net positive on it because it is giving the states some opportunities to be innovative. And as you know, we are very decentralized and our local plans have strong relationships with those states. And I think they will be in a position to be able to help the states with that and use some of our assistance capabilities and tests and model things, but it is limited to the expansion aspect of the business. So that\u2019s key. So I think going forward, I am going to tilt to the positive side, but we are going to continue to work with it and help to make it better.","Scott Fidel","Okay. And then, for my follow-up question, I know there are bunch of different MLR dynamics discussed in the exchanges. Jeff, just interested in sort of where the thinking is right now on the risk adjuster payable, ending the year really two things in particular I just wanted to ask about one? One of \u2013 one of your peers had cited the weekly report that came out at the end of the year, and that had led them to make some adjustments to their risk adjuster assumptions. And then also just interested just in terms of those higher 4Q costs that you had in the exchange business, does any of that sort of flow through to the estimated acuity profile of your population relative to the market or were those just sort of other factors that don\u2019t play into the risk adjuster assumptions? Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, a couple of things. I guess, our risk adjustment was in line with our expectations. And when the 10-K comes out, you\u2019ll see the total number. We have got roughly $1 billion of payable to the government on the books. So, it wasn\u2019t \u2013really a risk adjuster phenomenon for us. It was really just higher non-inpatient costs. And as you\u2019re aware, we have to get those \u2013 we are estimating a significant portion of our medical costs. And so, we\u2019ll have to wait for those claims to come in and look at the diagnosis codes and submit those for risk adjustment. And so, there may be an effect there, but it is too early to tell.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yes. A question on how you are going to manage the company going forward. And I was interested in both what is the org structure you have got in place right now as far as, Michael, to you the direct reports? And then, as you think of management process, what\u2019s the process you\u2019ve got in place now for legacy Centene, legacy WellCare and integration and how do those differ?","Michael Neidorff","Yes. I think, let me \u2013 from a management perspective, we laid out at our June Investor Day, the organization chart that we were working with us initially. And Drew is going to report to me to become part of my senior management team because of the increased focus on pharmacy at this point in time. Ken, in fact he should be here later today in his new role of markets and products he will help me to do that and bring that in place. But that is all been laid out. And we operate in what I call a partnership. And people have clear responsibility, accountability, the responsibility and the authority to manage their businesses. When you add a scale, we are \u2013 this enterprise is now international in scope, you have to do that. So it is very \u2013 the accountability is just \u2013 is very, very clear. So, going forward, in terms of the integration, as you raise it there is different work streams. The systems and I have commented on that, that\u2019s going to take time and there is a group working on the transition of systems. WellCare was in the middle of transitioning some of their systems. We are bidding in another. So, that all has to be brought into play. The general measure, I think, Jeff explained to be on a general measure by July 1. So, that will all be in place and that\u2019s in place. They will be moving to our form of \u2013 we have reserved calculations as that occurs and we are doing some of that now. We use date receipt. So all those things is different work streams for it, it\u2019s coming together. We know who will be managing what markets and then control that and that\u2019s moving through. And it\u2019s because of the need for systems that we are going \u2013 it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time, you take Florida, they had a large business, we have a large business. And so, we are going to operate there in two systems for a short period of time till we can convert to our system. So this has all been laid out and it\u2019s very detailed and it\u2019s something that the board looks at every quarter. We have probably spent 30, 40 minutes reviewing where we are and how it\u2019s going at our board meeting yesterday. So it\u2019s something we are very comfortable with.","And I remind people, it\u2019s something we have done historically. I mean, Fidelis was a large company last year and it\u2019s fully integrated, simply moving the claims to our platform, which we said all along would take some time. Health Net was integrated. So, I mean this \u2013 and the fact that we have strong management on both companies. Now, I just want to add one more thing that we just layout to everybody, so they know it that we had culture surveys out of their culture and our culture. And we can say, this is yours, this is ours and ours is the one will prevail. We are not trying to blend things and we have found historically that makes a difference. We also said right upfront that all things being equal in terms of performance, the Centene person gets a job it\u2019s as two people for the same job. That does not mean that the WellCare person will not be repurposed into a very senior that gives them challenging new opportunities, but it also gives them comfort that the next time we do a deal that they have that same protection. So, these are things that we have historically done that worked really well for us and helped to ensure a smooth transition and we expect that again. Does that help you?","Lance Wilkes","Yes, yes, it does. And just as a follow-up as you spoke about, maybe not doing large scale M&A right now until this is digested, but obviously having an ongoing appetite for M&A in general. Could you talk a little bit about the priorities and talk to whether there are regions or particular capabilities in light of having the combination of both companies?","Michael Neidorff","Okay. Well, I think it\u2019s going to \u2013 once again, it\u2019s we talk about capabilities. Some of that maybe systems and there are some smaller acquisitions we can make, because of our size and scale, we don\u2019t have to disclose it. I have jokingly told people that we did one deal and the person we say, we don\u2019t have to disclose him, because he said now my family is not going to be chasing me for some of this money. So I mean, there is some benefit there, but we do that type of thing. Two is the capability to see if some other opportunities come up nationally and internationally, we will do it, but when I say scale and size, when you are now a $100 billion plus enterprise, with $5 billion of EBITDA to bottom and the balance sheet that we have and the improved credit rating that we have. And what we are able to sell our bonds at and what our bonds are trading at it says that what\u2019s relative and what can be done has changed a little bit from several years ago, but we will once again just focus on what\u2019s the strategic value and it has to make financial sense first then strategic value and then we will look at the capabilities it brings. And I can\u2019t go beyond that, because then I would be starting to tell you who we are looking at.","Lance Wilkes","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Thanks for squeezing me in here. Just want to belabor the point on the MLR guidance for the HICS business one more time just to make sure I fully understand what you are saying. You have talked about being in the range of 5% to 10%, but you have trimmed back that guidance into that range a couple of times now, so it seems like you are probably in the mid to the lower half of that range. You talked about for next year still some non-material moderation of that. So does that really imply that next year you are going to be in the lower half of that range that you have talked about for sure? Presumably the tailwind that you picked up from the risk adjusters being a little better as of the fourth quarter reconciliations doesn\u2019t help you that much? And then finally, does this have anything to do with the Iowa Medicaid claim payments that you were delayed?","Jeff Schwaneke","The Iowa we all know had some issues. We were culpable as some of those, they got our attention, it\u2019s being fixed and we made all the progress you made and that\u2019s kind of historic. And it\u2019s not material we are going to get the funding. Is that a question there? On the medical loss ratio, I want to remind you that it will vary from quarter-to-quarter based on out-of-pockets, maximum out-of-pockets, a lot of different things. So what we are seeing is that on any given quarter, you will see some variation. Now, we also know that the last quarter, the year tends to be higher, because the maximum out-of-pockets have been met and sometimes people try to get some services and other things done. And Jeff commented that the inpatient was a little bit higher, but I expect some of that on balance, the 5% to 10% is a solid range. We are very comfortable with it. And in the first quarter, it\u2019s going to be in the higher part of that range. In the last quarter, it could be in the lower part of that range, but on balance and we tend to \u2013 we love to be conservative. We love to under-promise and over-deliver where we can. And so we are saying, it\u2019s realistic to say that as the business grows, there maybe a little moderation, but it\u2019s still solid and it\u2019s solidly in the 5% to 10% range, but if I say where then I am giving you more than we have historically \u2013 it serves no purpose. It\u2019s great business.","Peter Costa","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matthew Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch","Thank you for squeezing me in. Just a quick question about the group commercial business, I know it hasn\u2019t been front and center for a while and I am curious what your thoughts are on the state of that business as you come into 2020, the intensity of competition there?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, we have some of it in California. We have said we will maintain it. It\u2019s good business for us. And I would say that all that\u2019s under a strategic review.","Matthew Borsch","Okay.","Michael Neidorff","But honestly Matt, I am back burning a little bit, so I want to get WellCare fully integrated and get things before we start distracting people and some other opportunities.","Matthew Borsch","Alright, alright. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel","Thanks. Maybe just going back to the divestitures, thanks for the revenue number, but can you also make any comments relative to profitability and size of the proceeds and have you actually decided whether you are going to redeploy on buybacks or debt pay-down or is that still to be determined as you put the consolidated guidance together?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, we were going through right now that analysis and that\u2019s going to be a function of stock price as much as anything. And so stay tuned, that\u2019s something will resolve probably Jeff over the next 30 days or so?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes, absolutely. And then the other thing on the size of proceeds, $1 billion pre-tax, so $1 billion pre-tax is the proceeds and that \u2013 by the way that also includes statutory capital as well.","Michael Newshel","Yes, got it.","Jeff Schwaneke","I think it was a fair transaction for everybody.","Michael Newshel","Maybe one more just sorry if I missed it, but do you have any update to marketplace enrollment expectations for 2020 now that open enrollment is over?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, we said 2.2 million members peak.","Michael Newshel","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. First just a quick clarification, did you say the higher MLR was it non-inpatient? I think Jeff that\u2019s what you said, I thought Michael, in my recollection said inpatient?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, non-inpatient.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, it was non-inpatient side.","Ralph Giacobbe","And if you could just flush out when you say non-inpatient is that just elective outpatient, is it drug, just help us in terms of what areas popped to that magnitude to drive the MLR?","Michael Neidorff","I think we just saw normal PCP visits. So, it wasn\u2019t necessarily in the specialist category, so just higher doctor visits, is what I would say.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, alright. Fair enough. And then just my quick follow-up here, any initial comments around some of the proposed changes for HICS in 2021? And I guess specifically around pulling tax credits for those who pay zero premiums if they don\u2019t enroll and don\u2019t update their income. I guess just trying to understand logistically do most update each year? So it\u2019s a non-issue or how easy would it be for you all to sort of aim in making sure this sort of gets done and if you could just what percentage of your HICS enrollees pay zero premiums? Thanks.","Kevin Counihan","Hi, this is \u2013 it\u2019s Kevin Counihan. So, the payment notice just came out Friday as you know. We are still digesting a lot of those issues that you speak to. We have got broad diversity of folks within the FPL range. I think as you know though we tend to have the majority under 250, so again not trying to be evasive, but we still are just working through the payment notice.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I wanted to ask a question on revenue, may seem trivial, but you were outside of your revenue range by about $400 million. It doesn\u2019t seem like exchange retention is enough to account for all of that. I just wanted to make sure they weren\u2019t any one-time benefits flowing through the revenue line?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, I think \u2013 Dave I think, we mentioned in the \u2013 I guess in our December Investor Day that we thought of the Q3 call or December Investor Day that our fourth quarter revenue would be lower than our third, because of the size of the pass-through payments. And I think we did get a few pass-through payments in the quarter that kind of helped revenue. We don\u2019t have great visibility on these from states and so they just show up. So I think our \u2013 we expected a bigger drop in revenue from Q3 to Q4, but we had $100 million or so in payments.","Dave Windley","Okay. And then second question just again to go back to your headwind and tailwind commentary, I want to make sure I understand that, that is relative to S-4, but that your guidance both on to the earlier question about divestitures, but also in terms of timing of close that it would seem that those two items relative to what you would have baked into your neutral in year one and mid to high single-digit accretion in year two, that particularly the year one element of that, that those two things probably came out better than we expected, is that a fair conclusion, timing of close in divestitures?","Jeff Schwaneke","Which two items came out better than we expected?","Dave Windley","Timing of close and the magnitude of divestitures?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes, but the timing of close, I mean, when we gave our numbers we are \u2013 the accretion target is a full year, right. So it doesn\u2019t really matter when it starts, it\u2019s a full year. And my point on the guidance is we are going to have to pro-rate January and that\u2019s going to have an effect, right. And then if you just take the WellCare top line number that they were expected to hit for 2019 and you take 22 days out of that, that\u2019s a sizable number.","Dave Windley","Okay, fair enough.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hey, good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning, Gary.","Gary Taylor","Hi. I wanted to \u2013 I had a clarification on that last point as well. So maybe I will try to put it a little clear, because I have had a few questions. So Jeff, when you had laid out some of the headwinds around WellCare, those are relative to ultimately the 2020 consolidated pro forma guidance you are going to give, those are not headwinds to the year one at least neutral accretion guidance?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes \u2013 yes, that is correct, yes, yes, you\u2019re correct on that.","Gary Taylor","Okay. I just had a couple of questions. My last one I wanted to go back to the exchange question just one more time and make sure I understood about \u2013 you had mentioned that some of the increased costs were in states where you were already up against the minimum MLRs that had some accruals. So effectively costs \u2013 additional costs you would have incurred in those states, I guess might have \u2013 would not have impacted earnings, because you had already \u2013 your margin is essentially already capped \u2013 your MLR is already capped and then consequently, moving into next year any improvement wouldn\u2019t flow through to earnings, because again, your MLR at least is already essentially capped, if you are into the minimum MLRs. Am I understanding that correctly or is there a different point you were trying to convey on that part?","Jeff Schwaneke","The biggest piece of that that you are missing is that the MLR calculation is a 3-year rolling calculation.","Gary Taylor","Right.","Jeff Schwaneke","So to the extent we had cost in the fourth quarter and you are in a minimum MLR rebate, it\u2019s not a 1:1, right and it depends on the magnitude of the prior year MLR rebates. And so when you go forward, if I had lower MLR rebate in 2019 that is a lower amount that I have to deal with in the future, right. So it\u2019s not a 1:1. I mean, you could \u2013 if everything was equal per year, you could say it\u2019s a one-third benefit. So, if we had costs in the fourth quarter, we would get a third of that back, but the math isn\u2019t that simple, because every year is a different MLR number.","Gary Taylor","So the math is complex, but I think the point you were trying to convey though at least was that the thought that in incurring some of these settlements and reaching in network agreements with some of these PCPs ultimately was going to provide some better MLR performance in 2020. Is that fair?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. Well, I would say there is two things. Number one it\u2019s better reimbursement, more favorable reimbursement for us going forward as a contracted provider, right. So that helps. And then yes, it reduces the aggregate level of MLR payable that you have and so thereby provides a benefit going forward.","Gary Taylor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes.","Operator","Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","George Hill","Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for squeezing me in. A lot of my questions have been answered. I guess, I would ask one kind of philosophically on the Medicaid demonstration projects around the block grants. Do you guys in the pharmacy business feel like you are better off with the statutory rebate on the drug side or do you feel these guys feel like the business would be better served taking a formulary approach in being able to negotiate your own discounts and rebates? Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Well, I mean, I always \u2013 I\u2019ve always liked the idea we are more masters of our destiny, right, but I think, when you have the systems we have and the capabilities where we are going, we have the flexibility to work either way. So, we will make our decisions as I have always said, based on the facts of what they are at the time and these are still issues under discussion and there is opportunities to influence some aspects of that we believe and that\u2019s what we will do and it\u2019s \u2013 we just take a very open-ended approach to it. And I am comfortable we will end up in a strong position at the end of the day.","George Hill","Thanks. I appreciate the color.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael Neidorff","Well, we thank you for your comments and thoughts today and the chance to clarify some of these things and we are looking forward to the March 4, as I recall that\u2019s the date, Jeff, where we are going to be able to give you the full guidance and kind of set the baseline on what this combined company will be doing going forward. We believe it will be very significant. So, thank you and we will be talking to you again in March.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ed Kroll, Senior Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Ed Kroll","Thank you, Nicole, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our first quarter 2019 earnings results conference call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Jeff Schwaneke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene will host this morning's call, which can also be accessed through our website at centene.com.","A replay will be available shortly after the call's completion also at centene.com or by dialing (877) 344-7529 in the U.S. and Canada, or in other countries by dialing (412) 317-0088.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recent Form 10-Q filed today, April 23, 2019 and the Form 10-K dated February 19, 2019, and other public SEC filings.","Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its estimates to change.

Michael?","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's first quarter 2019 earnings call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our first quarter financial results and provide update on Centene's markets and products. We will also provide commentary around our regulatory and legislative environment and our recently announced agreement to acquire WellCare. I want to emphasize, while we have an experienced team working on the WellCare integration, our main focus continues to be the results of the core business. This includes executing on our transformation project Centene Forward.","Let me begin with first quarter 2019 financials. We were pleased to begin 2019 with another strong quarter marked by solid top and bottom line growth and robust operating cash flows. Membership at quarter end was 14.7 million recipients. This represents an increase of 1.8 million beneficiaries within the first quarter of 2018. First quarter revenues increased 40% year-over-year to $18.4 billion. The HBR increased 140 [ph] basis points year-over-year to 85.7%. This was primarily due to Fidelis Care which we noted when we announced the acquisition operates at a higher HBR as well as the impact of the health moratorium in 2019.","We reported adjusted first quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.39 compared to $1.09 in the same period last year. This represents 28% growth year-over-year. We are pleased to report our adjusted net earnings margin improved 40 basis points year-over-year. This improvement was due to better network management, leveraging our scale and enhanced medical management efforts. We continue to see opportunity for further improvement.","Lastly, operating cash flows came in at $1.3 billion or 2.5 times net earnings above the high-end of our previously stated range of 1.5 times to 2 times net earnings. Jeff will provide further financial details including increased 2019 guidance in his prepared remarks. A quick comment on medical cost. Medical cost remained stable and in line with our expectations of low single digits.","Moving on to markets and product updates, first we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity. Our Medicaid book of business performed well in the first quarter. On March 31, we had 8.6 million recipients representing a year-over-year growth of 1.5 million or 21%. As we have previously mentioned, we see an opportunity to continue to improve our overall Medicaid margins.","Now on to state updates. New Hampshire, in March we successfully reprocured our state-wide Medicaid contracts in New Hampshire. The new program covers 180,000 recipients. The new contract is expected to commence September 1, 2019. At March 31 we served 83,000 beneficiaries in the state.","North Carolina, I will remind you that we won two large regions in the recent RFP [ph] to have an active appeal process with the balance of the state. We remain cautiously optimistic regarding the appeal. Iowa, on July 1, 2019 Centene will commence operations in the Iowa's managed Medicaid program. The state is moving from three to two plans and beneficiaries will be split equally between the two. We are confident the state is committed to operate a sustainable Medicaid managed care program.","I will remind you, we book a higher HBR in the initial quarters of any and all new Medicaid managed care contracts and Iowa is no different. As our medical management efforts gained traction over time we will attain experience and knowledge with respect to our new members. It is at this point that margins will begin to normalize. We fully expect Iowa to match this pattern and believe we will be able to succeed in this program.","Next Medicare, at March 31we served 394,000 Medicare and MMP beneficiaries across 20 states. This represents a year-over-year increase of over 50,000 recipients. On a sequential basis membership declined by approximately 23,000 as previously projected. This is due to the repositioning of Fidelis to get back its four star rating. We continue to expect 2019 MA revenue membership to be flat compared to 2018.","We believe as previously discussed 2020 will be an inflection point for our Medicare Advantage book of business. Centene will return to a four star MA apparently in the next year. We expect this along with the joint venture with Ascension and the addition of WellCare's top performing MA platform to accelerate profitable growth as previously suggested in the 2020s and beyond.","Now, health insurance marketplaces. The marketplace business cleared up another strong quarterly performance consistent with our expectations. At March 31, we served approximately 2 million exchange members across 20 states. This represents a sequential increase of 510,000 beneficiaries or 35% on a year-over-year basis. Membership increased by 365,000 beneficiaries or 23%. The key demographics of these members remained consistent with prior years. Approximately 90% are enrolled in silver-tier plans and greater than 90% received subsidies. Additionally we see a slightly higher retention rate compared to last year which is reflected in our updated guidance. We expect to have another strong year of operations as the national leader of the exchange process.","Next, I'll provide an update on healthcare legislation and regulatory environment. At this time, we believe there is little appetite in Washington to revisit comprehensive healthcare reforms. With the political class turning its attention to the 2020 presidential and congressional elections, we welcome the discussion on ways to improve and expand government health programs. States and federal government continue to see private sector solutions to enhance quality and lower cost of health care. This is evidenced by 68% of Medicaid beneficiaries and 34% of Medicare recipients and private Medicare plans.","Centene will continue to work with both parties on a bipartisan solution that strengthens the nation's healthcare delivery system. We are pleased to see bipartisan efforts put forth on reducing prescription drug costs. Centene will continue to advocate for greater price transparency. This includes moving towards net pricing. We have stressed these things in our recent response to the draft rule on PBM rebates.","We have been ahead of the curve with our equity interests in RxAdvance. This is a national full service cloud-based PBM that manages standard and specialty drugs benefits with unmatched compliance and transparency. Thus far Centene has successfully migrated two states into the RxAdvance platform, Mississippi and Nebraska. The implementation went seamlessly. We expect the rollout of Centene's Medicaid and exchange states to be accretive by the end of 2020.","We commend the administration's efforts on giving states greater flexibility to be [indiscernible]. This was most recently exemplified with CMS approval of Utah's waver to a partial Medicaid expansion. Centene believes in allowing states to expand their Medicaid population up to 100% of federal quality level. This would enable every American below 100% of the federal quality level to obtain coverage to Medicaid.","Americans above 100% of the [indiscernible] would continue to be able to purchase affordable comprehensive coverage to the marketplace with the help of advanced tax credits. We look forward to working with the states that are on the front line in making sure all their citizens have access to affordable high-quality health care. I'd like to remind you, with over three decades of experience, Centene and its predecessor companies have demonstrated their ability to adapt and adjust to political and regulatory changes at any given time.","I would now like to make a few comments about our recently announced agreement to acquire WellCare. This combination is expected to bring together two top-performing companies creating a premier healthcare enterprise focused primarily on government sponsored programs. The addition of WellCare will bolster and diversify our product offerings, significantly increase our scale and provide access to new markets. WellCare has developed a strong portfolio of Medicare assets which is expected to provide Centene additional Medicare capabilities including both Medicare Advantage and Part D.","WellCare's Part D offering will significantly enhance and increase our scale and progress. On a combined basis our pro forma annual growth spend will be approximately $30 billion and growing. We also believe the addition of WellCare's Medicare expertise creates significant opportunities across Centene's existing markets. I think it will strengthen and accelerate the growth of our existing NAH [ph] portfolio. WellCare's approach to Medicare Advantage is complimentary to Centene's strategy. Both companies focus on providing high quality low cost healthcare to low income seniors.","It is important to note that substantial opportunity this of course presents for the combined company. More than 10,000 people a day in the U.S. turn 65 and 55% of seniors are at or below 400% of the federal [indiscernible] our target market. The combination will also further extend Centene's robust Medicaid offerings. Additionally, it will benefit from Centene's growing exchange presence as we will be able to leverage our exchange price across in new markets.","Expanding WellCare we will expand our footprint from 32 to 50 states. The combined company will provide healthcare services to 22 million recipients in the U.S. This consists of over 12 million Medicaid and 5 million Medicare beneficiaries including Part D clients. We will also be servicing individuals on the exchanges and those enrolled in the TRICARE program. The addition of WellCare will expand our position as the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the country.","We will remain the largest provider of exchange offerings and we will become the fourth largest Medicaid company. We're already working on integration planning and believe our similar values including both company's local approach and integrated care models with help ensure we achieve a seamless transition. We expect to hit the ground running when we close. Our integration priorities include delivering values for members, capturing synergies and retaining and attracting the best talent. We have experienced integration leaders in both companies and are confident in the accretion and synergy targets that we outlined when we announced the transaction. We believe Centene's leading technology platform will be essential to our success as a combined company which will provide competitive advantage.","It will provide our platform including our data analytical tools such as [indiscernible] to further enhance the quality of care with the combined company logistics. We will continue to invest in cutting-edge technology, systems and capabilities. This will significantly enhance our ability to scale, coordinate competitive managed care while leading to lower costs. Further with the integration of Centene's specialty platform across WellCare's membership base should also enhance quality and processing practice. We recognize the importance of network advocacy. We want to ensure access to high high-quality cost-effective providers. We also want to ensure that these providers are appropriately and adequately compensated.","We have initiated appropriate preliminarily regulatory discussions at the federal level with the appropriate adjustments. We will describe these discussions as constructive and have laid out a timetable for submission. At the state level five [indiscernible] have been found and others are in the process of being found. Some preliminary discussions with the appropriate regulatory authorities in our largest states have taken place. It is our opinion these processes will protect recipients, providers, and states.","As I have commented previously, there may be some form of divestitures in Nebraska and Missouri. Based on our access thus far, we continue to maintain our internal timelines for the approval of [indiscernible]. The combined company will have estimated pro forma 2019 revenues of approximately $100 billion and pro forma EBITDA of $5 billion. The pro forma revenue mix consists of 65% for Medicaid, 15% for Medicare and 15% that we stated. We are confident the combination will provide significant value to our collective shareholders, members, state partners and other stakeholders. We look forward to providing updates as we move to the transactions process.","A quick note on Fidelis, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Fidelis approximately 10 months since the close of this transaction and integration is running smoothly. We remain on track to realize our synergies and accretion targets.","Shifting gears to our rate outlook, we continue to expect a composite Medicaid rate adjustment of an increase of approximately 1.5% with is one in IT. In February [ph] CMS recently issued 2020 plan of Medicare Advantage rate notice and restatement better than expected. In summary, our strong first quarter results set the stage for us to maintain positive momentum throughout 2019 and beyond.","Our pipeline of opportunities across all lines of business remains robust. We believe the additional scale and diversification that the WellCare acquisition provides will enhance the sustainability of Centene's long-term growth. We are optimistic about our future and ability to extend Centene's leadership position in governments who want to partner [ph].","As Ed reminded you, our Investor Day is June 14, in New York City. We look forward to seeing you there. We thank you for your continued interest in Centene and we'll now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Schwaneke","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning we reported strong first quarter 2019 results. First quarter revenues were $18.4 billion, an increase of 40% over the first quarter of 2018 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.39 this quarter compared to $1.9 last year. Before I get into the details, I want to remind everyone that the company\u2019s stock split was distributed on February 6, 2019 to stockholders of record as of December 24, 2018.","Now let me provide additional details for the first quarter. Total revenues grew by approximately $5.3 billion year-over-year, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Fidelis Care, growth in the health insurance marketplace business, expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2018 and 2019 including the Illinois contract expansion, another region going live for the Pennsylvania LTSS program, and the beginning of operations in New Mexico and approximately $500 million of pass-through payments from the State of California and approximately $435 million of pass-through payments from the state of New York. This growth was partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019.","Moving on to HBR, health benefits ratio was 85.7% in the first quarter this year compared to 84.3% in last year\u2019s first quarter and 86.8% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of Fidelis Care which operates at a higher HBR and the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019. These items contributed to 130 basis points in the increase from last year. Sequentially the 110 basis point decrease in HBR from the fourth quarter of 2018 is primarily due to the performance and seasonality in the health insurance marketplace business, partially offset by the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019.","The marketplace business continues to perform well and membership remains strong as we ended the quarter with approximately 2 million members. We continue to expect pretax margins for the year to be within our stated 5% to 10% range.","Now on to SG&A, our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 9.5% in the first quarter this year compared to 10.3% last year and 9.9% in the fourth quarter of 2018. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the acquisition of Fidelis Care which lowered the ratio by 70 basis points. The sequential decrease is primarily due to seasonal open enrollment costs associated with the health insurance marketplace and Medicare businesses that were recognized in the fourth quarter of 2018. Additionally, we spent $0.02 per diluted share on business expansion costs during the first quarter.","Investment income was $99 million during the first quarter compared to $41 million last year and $67 million last quarter. The increase year-over-year is due to higher investment balances mainly associated with the Fidelis acquisition, higher interest rates on short-term investments and improved performance associated with our deferred compensation investment portfolio which fluctuates with this underlying investments.","The earnings from our deferred compensation portfolio were substantially offset by increases in deferred compensation expense which is recorded in SG&A. Sequentially, investment income increased due to the previously mentioned improved earnings from our deferred compensation portfolio as well as higher average investment balances and higher interest rates on short-term investments.","Interest expense was $99 million for the first quarter of 2019 compared to $68 million last year and $98 million last quarter, the increase year-over-year was driven by additional debt to fund the Fidelis acquisition and higher interest rates on our debt associated with our interest rate swaps. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter was 24.2% compared to 34.1% in the first quarter of 2018. The lower tax rate was driven by the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019 and lower tax expense associated with a favorable outcome of a federal tax audit with respect to R&D tax credits. This favorable outcome accounted for 150 basis points of the reduction in the first quarter 2019 tax rates.","Now on to the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled $14.8 billion at quarter end, including $507 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level [ph]. Debt at quarter end was $6.8 billion which includes $357 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility at quarter end. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 36.5% excluding our nonrecourse debt compared to 40.3% last year and 37.4% at the fourth quarter of 2018.","Our medical claims liability totaled $7.4 billion at quarter end and represents 48 days in claims payable which is consistent with the fourth quarter of 2018. We continue to expect the DCP to be in the mid-40 range on a run rate basis with the inclusion of Fidelis.","Cash flow provided by operations was $1.3 billion in the first quarter or 2.5 times net earnings. The cash provided by operating activities in 2019 was due to net earnings, an increase in medical claims liabilities primarily resulting from growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the commencement or expansion of the Arkansas, Florida, Pennsylvania and New Mexico health plans and an increase in other long-term liabilities driven by the recognition of the risk adjustment payable for the health insurance marketplace business in 2019.","Cash flow from operations were partially offset by an increase in premium and trade receivables of $662 million primarily due to a delay in payment from one of our state customers which was received in early April.","Before I discuss our revised guidance, let me make a few comments on the WellCare acquisition. As Michael commented, we are working through the regulatory approval process and have begun integration planning activities. While it is still early in the integration planning and regulatory approval process, we continue to be comfortable with the synergy and accretion targets we communicated at transaction announcement. As we progress through this process we look forward to keeping you updated.","Now on to guidance. We updated our 2019 annual guidance for the following items; first, we are increasing the total revenue guidance at the midpoint by $2.5 billion primarily driven by $1 billion of additional pass-through payments in New York and California, $700 million associated with the health insurance marketplace driven business, driven by a combination of higher-than-expected member retention and risk adjustment, and $500 million due to the proposed changes in the Iowa contract award.","Second, we are decreasing our full year effective tax rate by 50 basis points to reflect the lower tax expense recognized in the first quarter associated with the favorable audit results, lastly, we are increasing our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance at the midpoint by $0.13 per share. This is the second increase so far this year and is driven by the first quarter results, $0.05 per diluted share for a higher expected investment income and $0.05 per diluted share associated with increased health insurance marketplace revenue I previously mentioned. These increases are partially offset by increased business expansion costs of $0.02 per diluted share.","In summary, our full-year updated 2019 guidance is as follows; total revenues of $72.8 billion to $73.6 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.67 to $3.84, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.24 to $4.44 an HBR of 86.5% to 87% and SG&A ratio of 9.4% to 9.9% an adjusted SG&A ratio of 9.3% to 9.8%, an effective tax rate of 24.5% to 26.5% and diluted shares outstanding of 421 million to 422 million shares.","Overall, we had a good start to the year with good performance across all of our business segments. We believe the continued growth in revenue provides opportunity for future earnings growth.","That concludes my remarks and operator you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Hi, good morning. Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Josh Raskin","Goof morning Michael. So my question just it sounded like a little bit more excitement around the Medicare opportunity for next year, talking about the inflection point, and so I was wondering if you could help sort of flesh out what gives you that confidence, how you guys are thinking about your bids with a month and a half to go on that?","And then was there any thought as to waiting for the WellCare acquisition to close and giving yourself a little bit more time and information and management expertise and Part D plans et cetera, or is it sort of now we\u2019ve got the four stars for Centene and that\u2019s all we need? And then just one quick one on the WellCare progress, I understood the integration started et cetera, anymore updated thoughts on combined management team? I think that\u2019d be helpful as well.","Michael Neidorff","Josh, I\u2019ll start off on the Medicare and then others can jump in a little bit. On the Medicare we\u2019ve said that the 2020 will be the year where we come together, we\u2019ve been testing things. Our re-contracting with providers on this space contracts and the things that create successful Medicare products, so we will continue to move ahead on our own recognizing that until we close we can\u2019t work with WellCare, once we do close they have a strong platform, we have added some new talent here and into the integration process we\u2019ll be putting those two talents together and I think 2020 will be a very strong year for Medicare on that basis.","On the organization I\u2019m not going to comment. I think before I say too much on a call like this, first the Centene people and as well as, and the WellCare people need to know what the new organization will look like. And we\u2019re not going to get into that until we get closer to the, knowing it\u2019s closing, simply we have, as I said earlier everybody is focused on their respective businesses and that they will move through that, I'm absolutely not going to say anything about it. That\u2019s a better place to be.","Josh Raskin","Okay.","Michael Neidorff","But, see, I will add this much, just that we are working with some of the senior management at WellCare and have some very important responsible positions at, they'll be able to move into this new $100 billion company.","Josh Raskin","That\u2019s helpful Michael. And just one quick followup on the Medicare comment 2020, you've talked about Medicare contributing as much as 20% of growth in future years, is 2020 that year where we start thinking about as much as 20% of the growth coming from Medicare?","Michael Neidorff","You know, I think I said in the course of a decade, so I\u2019ve been, well sorry for it Josh, and then you\u2019ll see it continue to ramp up. It's not going to be access rates.","Josh Raskin","Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. I wanted to ask a question on the WellCare deal. It sounds like you have already started the process with the states and again you going to find a couple of states where you expect there to be divestitures. Is it safe to say that based upon the conversations with the other states where you have above average pro forma market share, you still feel confident that divestitures will not be required? And then, I guess how do you think about the sustainability of a state where you have pro forma 50% market share? How did you factor in the potential risk that in two years during the reprocurement the state might add a new player in to replace the fact that you've consolidated WellCare?","Michael Neidorff","I will tell you this, Kevin I think you know we, we tried to plan ahead and we\u2019ve thought through those kinds of issues and looking at this with different [ph] transaction, I\u2019m not going to front run the states with a lot of discussion as to what our discussions with them. They are very constructive and I would go this far and say that before we shared focus I'm worried about the recipients and what\u2019s best for them. Then we look at the provider networks ensuring that their well taken care of in terms of provided for in this situation and protected and then to say discuss this. So we\u2019re focused on all three of those things.","As far as divestitures are concerned, those are subject to discussion and even in Missouri and Nebraska we're in discussions as to what if anything they want us to do. I\u2019ve mentioned that the days we have talked about it in the past as where there are three and two of the three are WellCare and Centene. So we\u2019re working through and see what they want to do there and go from there.","Kevin Fischbeck","I guess in the past you talked about the accretion the 30 numbers [ph] assuming approved in amount of divestitures, did it take into account potential issues a couple years down the road when you get to that two-year clich\u00e9 number does that also factor in any kind of loss of membership if states were going into divestiture [ph]?","Michael Neidorff","Oh yes, yes sure. It factors in a conservative position on that, so we\u2019re, absolutely.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, then if I could ask one more question, you mentioned that Medicaid margins have room for improvement, where, how do we think about where we are in that process, is this a multiyear process, where are we versus your target margins and how long it takes to get there? Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Well, we\u2019ll never perceive from a manager's standpoint scale the Jeff and all us here, Chris, we'll never take the pressure off improving margins, because the moment you stop trying to improve they are going bounce off. So it's an ongoing process and, but we want to do it in a way that is sustainable, it\u2019s like we don\u2019t want a short-term, big, huge improvement and then have something come up, so we\u2019re working on this. The network, the contracts with various providers and keep it balanced with them because we view then as a part of our product, we don\u2019t want to, you never want to hurt your products, you want to maintain it. So it\u2019s a total process we\u2019re going through and we\u2019re moving more and more to risk-based management where the providers can do very well when they work with us and manage it. So it\u2019s a longer-term thing, but I think what's important is that we see it on a sustained basis. I hope that helps.","Kevin Fischbeck","Yes, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. I wanted to drill down on the services line. It looked like costs of services increased about 250 basis points year-over-year and we\u2019re estimating that was about $0.04 headwind which implies the underlying health plan results were strong. So on the services line I knew there were some moving pieces with the VA contract and the NHS [ph] acquisition, can you help us bridge 1Q 2019 to historical levels and how we should think about revenue and gross margin on that product going forward?","Michael Neidorff","I'm going to point that one to Jeff.","Jeff Schwaneke","Thanks Michael. Obviously, I think a couple of things first, I think you hit the nail on the head there Sarah, I think a few things is, it is a different mix of business than we had in the first quarter of last year. So I guess what I would say is I would bridge from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. I think that\u2019s more appropriate given the fact that we had the VA business that\u2019s no longer a part of that line and then you also have a couple of acquisitions that we\u2019ve made that are changing the mix profile of that business. And so, I guess what I would say is, I would look at the fourth quarter of last year bridging to Q1 and I think that\u2019s pretty consistent and I think that\u2019s what you would expect to see for the remainder of the year.","There is some lumpiness in those because there are certain - like for example the home health business has some contract reconciliations that are normal and occur every year either in the third or fourth quarter, so it doesn\u2019t mean every quarter is going to have a consistent cost of service percentage, but for the full year we would expect it to look similar to the fourth quarter maybe a little bit lower.","Sarah James","Got it and one clarification here on guidance, last quarter you guys talked about 60% one half 40% second half and last year you talked about a 10% or so historical average for the risk-adjusted through up which, based on today\u2019s Q would be about $93 million benefit to Q2 2019. So I just want to make sure on those two aspects that\u2019s still what guidance has been there is a 60-40 seasonality split and about a 10% [ph] risk adjusted through up benefit in 2Q?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, the 60-40 is consistent with what we said. The through-up piece, you just have to make sure that when you do the through-up it\u2019s really based on last year\u2019s, it\u2019s on 2018 business right? You can\u2019t roll in the first quarter of 2019\u2019s risk adjustment in order to calculate the 10%. So, it\u2019s a state-by-state calculation that\u2019s really based on the business activity in the 2018 year.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Good morning. Nice quarter guys.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning, thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Good morning.","Peter Costa","Can you tell us a little about what you're thinking about what the PBM at this point? You\u2019ve had a couple of states now convert to RxAdvance, you\u2019re starting to see how that\u2019s performing. Is that performing up to your expectations at this point or do you think you can do better by looking at what WellCare is doing, given that WellCare has the buying power of much bigger CVS [ph] behind it than what RxAdvance has which maybe doesn\u2019t matter in the Medicaid space but certainly matters in the Medicare space?","Michael Neidorff","I think one, the first part, the RxAdvance has been flawless in the implementation. I expect that as we continue to enroll more states we\u2019ll continue to find ways to improve and always do better. Two, I think you are going to find that RxAdvance will provide some really useful tools to the WellCare and what they\u2019re doing with the purchasing they are doing. And this is really a very modern day PBM type sale with a lot of transparency, a lot of great information that I think it\u2019s going to serve everybody well. So, the combined and the combination of the two will help and Jeff do you want to add something?","Jeff do you want to add something ?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, thanks Michael. So I think just to your point Peter I think this is, we're looking at the combined business. Yes, we do recognize the importance of pharmacy cost management on the MA and PDP businesses and we think as Michael referenced the combination will certainly have the ability to leverage the capabilities from the WellCare team and their experience.","Peter Costa","So are you talking about some kind of a combination of RxAdvance and what WellCare us doing currently with CVS?","Michael Neidorff","Well we're working through the integration now and we'll determine what part each one should play in it. And so you're probably about two months ahead of us. But it's a good question Peter.","Peter Costa","All right, and this is the last question. The third quarter of last year you had some reconciliation benefit from the California in-home services and sports program ending and you talked about perhaps getting some more of that reconciliation completed in 2019, was there any of that in this quarter and do you expect any for the remainder of the year?","Jeff Schwaneke","There was not any of that in this quarter and as you are well aware typically what happens you know you are waiting for the final reconciliation and the state notifies you, so we don\u2019t have any of that included in our guidance and more to come, I guess we're waiting to see what the results are.","Peter Costa","And you do expect that to be positive when it happens?","Jeff Schwaneke","I mean we've made our best estimate, so it could go either way, but we\u2019ve had a history of making relatively conservative estimates, so that I guess I'll leave it at that.","Peter Costa","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Scott Fidel of Stephens. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks, good morning. First question, just interested in your assessment on the final 2020 exchange reg that came out late Thursday? Then just specifically also whether you think the subsidy tweak that CMS made will have any impact on exchange market fundamentals or it is just you don\u2019t see it as being particularly material?","Michael Neidorff","Kevin, do you want to comment on that?","Kevin Counihan","Sure. Hi Scott. You know, I think in general we're pretty much supportive of the new final rule. We think the lower user fee is definitely appropriate. We support the fact that there\u2019s no change in either the silver loading or the automatic reenrollment. We also are supportive of the exclusion of the of the manufacturer coupons for patient cost sharing which we think is going to actually incent members to take more attractive generics. And we think some of that offset, some of that headwind that you are talking about could be offset both by the lower user fee as well as the fact that manufacturer rebate or manufacturer coupon changes I talked about is also going to create more incentives for people to take generics. So we think some of that projected $980 million less APTC which I think is what you\u2019re referring to will be offset by those two items.","Scott Fidel","Got it. So net-net when you look at all the different variables, would you attribute the final exchange rule as more of a sort of neutral to slightly positive overall?","Kevin Counihan","That's our view.","Scott Fidel","Okay and then just I had a follow question, just actually wanted to tack on to Sarah's question just about some of the moving pieces in the specialty segment, I actually noticed in the Q you guys mentioned how in the 2Q we'll probably see more of a noticeable shift from earnings from specialty over to managed care as you continue to implement the new RX pricing model. Jeff interested if you could may be just walk us through sort of functionally how that plays out within the two P&Ls, is it basically you have a lower gross margin in the specialty segmented and it benefits the MLR in the managed care segment or just interested in the exact mechanics of how that works out? Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, you know, you are exactly right, that's what we preview included that language in our 10-K, you\u2019re exactly right there would be a lower gross margin in the segment results for the specialty that would in turn directly benefit the health plan results. And just to make sure I clarify for everybody that\u2019s only in the segment disclosure and that\u2019s a intercompany item. So that gets eliminated in the consolidation. So for - you know we're not talking about the cost of service line for example, it\u2019s reported on the GAAP financials.","Scott Fidel","Okay, all right, thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yep.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi thanks, good morning. I want to ask a followup and pharmacy, Michael I believe I caught you saying in your prepared remarks that Centene would be supportive of a move to net pricing and if I'm interpreting that right elimination of rebates and a reduction in manufacturer price to net, if I'm interpreting that correctly, I'm curious what mechanism you would see as the governor to pharmaceutical price increases after that happens?","Michael Neidorff","Well, I think one, I said some time ago that that's something I believe we work fully hard to try to move to. And if we are successful in it the governor on price increases would obviously be the competitive world and we will be a - we will have the critical mass in drug purchasing that all the pharmacists who will cover us will have to take it seriously, because we said that 30 billion we see as a growing number. And as that continues to grow it is RxAdvance information becomes ever more credible. I think we'll have the data we need to encourage competitive pricing.","Dave Windley","Got it, thanks. If I come back to medical costs free-sheet the reconciling items that you provided, I'm curious if there's any difference year-over-year in the contribution or lack thereof from flu and with a relatively I guess in line expectation after those adjustments, if there were other moving parts, if flu was better this year, for example, were there other moving parts as an offset?","Michael Neidorff","I'll let Jeff answer that. I'll cover the flu initially, but I want to remind you the flu we had a flu season it looked like two years ago, not last year, but when you have the scale and size over $70 billion enterprise this year before Health Net that the medical costs associated to flu is really not a major factor as part of the total medical cost. So that's something that we plan fully booked for variation will not have a material effect. Jeff?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, thanks, Michael. Dave, I think, Michael is spot on. We're obviously calling out the large drivers, the largest drivers obviously which being Fidelis in the health insurer fee moratorium are the two largest pieces. I would say, we did see a lighter flu than we did in the first quarter a year ago, but we also had, I'd say, a lot of new businesses starting up, including the Pennsylvania LTSS.","New Mexico, and as Michael mentioned, we record a higher level of HBR in those because you're also building margin at the inception. And then we had new members in both Illinois and Florida. And so I think those were smaller drivers on an absolute basis, but you add all that together and they're kind of offsetting.","Dave Windley","Great, very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","Yes. Maybe you could talk about the Iowa situation, and how you expect that to unfold and what gives you confidence that unlike the peer companies had exited the market you cannot, you can reach a mutually workable rate arrangement?","Michael Neidorff","Well, I think, one, we've had discussions over a long period of time, at the most senior levels at this stage in the regulatory environment. And we have a comfort in their commitment to have a very successful managed care program. It's fairly obvious, you know, historically, we've been offered contracts and have turned them down rather than end up entering a new contract and filing a PDR [ph] before you even have your first member, that's something we try to avoid.","So we \u2013 but this time we looked at it, our actuaries looked at it. The state just - the legislation just floated additional $150 million available to help sustain the program and improve it. So everything we looked at said that this will be a successful program. And also some peers have exited. It was a different time. If I had entered when they did I might have a different feeling than I do coming in now with the new administration in place the past year or so and very aggressively looking at how they can have a successful program.","Matt Borsch","Michael, I would follow that with one question partly related which is, do you have a view on the optimal number of participants in a given state? I know the question isn\u2019t quite as simple as that, because you've got small states and large states but\u2026?","Michael Neidorff","Right.","Matt Borsch","You know are two plans sufficient for some states like the size of Iowa?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, we are, let me put it this way. Regardless of the size, I think the optimum is it was just us.","Matt Borsch","Okay. Got it.","Michael Neidorff","Have it both way, we would be on that, you kind of hit it on. I think in Iowa, the size and scale two is appropriate. If it was three then you can deal with that. We saw Georgia go from three to four. So in aggregate, did not have much of an impact and that's fine, because you have choice, and when you have the, it always starts out with choice and we have the network we have and the reputation we have in most of these states, we can do well with this choice.","So, we deal with it as it is. In Florida there are some counties, I think there they have as many as six plans in it and that's okay. But either way, the algorithms work on auto-assigns and have a member of the families in and other members get a size of that plan they, it's the states that have been doing for a while, understand and get it right. And obviously when you look at the growth we've had, and how we're doing, we're very comfortable with the way it is. And so you really hit on it, it is really a function of the size the state is as to how many.","Matt Borsch","Okay, all right, thank you very much.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","Yes, thanks for taking the question. I'd like to go back to pharmacy, a little bit, and you talked to and this idea of going to - of supporting credit price transparency. When it comes to pharmacy, my understanding, generally speaking right, states have tended to like the current rebate model in part because rebates don't necessarily have to be from a back to healthcare and can be used for general sort of budget purposes.","As you see the market moving maybe towards greater transparency and maybe even towards the net pricing model, how do you see states moving towards this as well, and how do you see them sort of operating within this kind of this new world, I guess, as we think about the way pricing starts to evolve and sort of how do you think this would impact your pharmacy business, particularly if you try to rollout RxAdvance? Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","I think that's where they are right now. I mean they are pushing more and more for transparency and where it is for pass-throughs or the pricing and how to do it. So they really have moved away from just the pure rebate type model and we're hearing more and more of the federal level of rebates at point-of-sale and that type of thing.","So that's a whole, it is all in transition, it's in flux right now and I think the things we can do and we can move to a net price type thing. And everybody can do much better with the transparency, the competitive bidding et cetera. So, as you know our plan with discounts and rebates and volumes and things, is here's the drug cost and it's particularly important in specialty pharma. So this is something that can apply to both. So I think the states are really adapting to it and have been in their own way moving more towards it on an ongoing basis.","Charles Rhyee","And then maybe following up on Dave's question, in terms of sort of a governor for price increase in the future, you talked about price competition from transparency, but what about - in many cases, right a lot of these particularly in specialty, a lot of these drugs are the only drug in their class, so there's really no competition. How do you look to manage costs in those particular drugs where there is little to no competition?","Michael Neidorff","Well, you know, you manage through effect by managing the utilization effectively. I mean, if you have only one drug, it is a curative drug. So you negotiate the best as you can, but rebates aren\u2019t going to help you there, one way or the other. I mean it's, I think as we raised it earlier, it is going to be the same, this is what you do is you manage the utilization and ensure the people are getting especially pharma drug, whether you use genome or other things, it's going to be supportive and helpful for them. And you know if it's curative, you're going to get it for them and that's what's important. When the hep C drugs first came out they were expensive and it didn't take long before a second one showed up.","So it's not \u2013 usually not very long. I used to be in pharma side Bristol-Myers and eventually for a little time Bayer and we learned very quickly, if you take your margins up too high, you're just leaving room for somebody to come in under you. And so, you are going to get competition very quickly if the pricing gets too abusive. Does that help?","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Tanal","Good morning, guys, thanks for taking the question.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Stephen Tanal","I guess the, I wanted to follow up on just sort of the HBR, the new programs and then talk about DCPs for a second. So I guess, come out this is flattish HBR ex-Fidelis in the half. It looks like a pretty solid outcome when you've expanded or entered into new programs in four new states. I guess I'd first ask how those programs are shaping up in their early days, but it seems like that the numbers would suggest quite good and so maybe the real question is around just comment on DCPs returning to the mid 40s, from 47.9 at the end of the first quarter to 2.9 days, 3 days to get to 45, let's say, it's sort of like $450 million of excess reserves using Q1 claims per day.","So does that math sound right? Is it fair to think about that as an excess or are there seasonal fluctuations around marketplace or otherwise we should be thinking of and just finally, is there anything you'd tell us about sort of the path and time line to returning to mid 40s, if that's the right level? Thank you, guys.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, certainly, Steve, a lot in that question. But I'll start with the DCP in the first. I mean what we're saying is, that's our long-term range. That doesn't mean by the end of this year. There's a couple of things with the Fidelis on the cash timing that we're still working through that could reduce that sometime this year. So think of it is more like a day, maybe two by the end of this year.","And ultimately when you look at DCP, a lot of that has to do with timing of payments. Right? It's really a timing of payment measure, not necessarily how your reserves are. We look at reserves differently as a percentage of medical expense, which we've been very consistent over the - since over the last five, ten years, and had a very consistent reserving methodology. So I guess, what I would say is, it's more timing related than anything.","The other thing is, we have obviously some risk-based contracts with some providers. Those accruals are in the IBNR balance, some of those accruals in the IBNR in our balance. So when those get paid, IBNR goes down. So those are the things that we're dealing with and why we call out timing of payments from a quarter-to-quarter perspective.","Stephen Tanal","Perfect, very helpful. And just any comments on those - on the new state programs, Florida, Illinois and [indiscernible]?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, sure. On the HBR side, I guess what I would say is, it's in line with our expectations. You have to remember the Pennsylvania is an LTSS award. So it's going to be in the 90%-plus range from an HBR. So it's really a mix of business that obviously impact on the total HBR of the company.","But in general, those programs are and the expansions are running exactly in line with our expectations. As Michael mentioned before, a lot of times there's continuity of care periods and then obviously you have to build margin on that additional new business and that impacts the HBR early in the program, but nothing outside of our expectations.","Michael Neidorff","I think - if I may just add that, in the new plan, you don't have, - we used the date received methodology for calculating, and its proved to be a very accurate way to do this claims, but you need the history of quarters - two, three quarters to be able to do the accurate accounting of it. I think we'll never say never, but we are proud of the fact you don't see a lot of prior period adjustments and so, it works. So rather than, take the chance, we typically will book it at 90% for the first three quarters or so. So just not knowing if it's where it is and that has typically served us well. So that's the approach we take to it.","Stephen Tanal","Perfect, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte of SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Yes, thanks good morning. I appreciate you taking the question. On the deal again, as you're having conversations with the DOJ, which I'm assuming will be the arbiter here in the States. As you have like a broad platform now across Medicaid exchanges and Medicare, do they view that in a favorable context and what types of what type of feedback are you getting from the DOJ and states, if any? And how does that dovetail with kind of this integrated, no it is not integrated, but states looking for players to be in Medicaid to participate in the Special Needs Plans and so on and on in places like Florida?","Michael Neidorff","I think the states recognize a leader, they recognize the systems and the capability we have to really improve outcomes and control costs and a very fair balance basis, so that goes a long way. Now there has not been this kind of Medicaid acquisition going back, I think they said it was, I guess Amerigroup was the last one that occurred.","And so, that is alluded they are reestablishing the grounds. But when you look at this as a different form of competition, you have states setting rates, you have things of that nature. So it's working through and talking about all these elements, and I don't want to get ahead of them, but we're finding that their questions are really the kind anyone should expect in this kind of transaction.","And it's constructive, and as I said, it's really focused in three areas, one payer to first what's best for the recipient. As we deal with a fragile population we emphasize that, and it's important to think about them to the provider network. This is not just gaining critical mass against them, but how do you get the kind of size and scale that allows you to do the risk based contracting so many of them want and we show the data and what we can do and how we do that.","And thirdly, the state, how we're able to contain costs, and how the benefit of large numbers, everybody wins. So it's - and it's been an enlightening process and I think I'll add one other thing and we've done other deals with, I'm finding that we have a lot of very smart regulators at the state level, and they're asking the right questions, they understand it and they're able to think through it. I find that positive and I think we'll find that the Justice Department is and the federal level there are equally trying to get this right, and now and so, I'm very encouraged just by the question that doesn\u2019t guarantee the absolute maximum outcome we have, I'm not trying to further than that, but I feel good about where it is at this point in time.","Ana Gupte","Thanks for the update. And then one more on the Texas and the Louisiana re-procurements any updates there?","Michael Neidorff","Well the Louisiana, well that just went in\u2026","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, Louisiana, I think is due to be submitted in next week and no update on the Texas timeline other than what we've previously discussed, I think May or June timeframe.","Ana Gupte","Got it. Thanks so much, I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from A. J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A. J. Rice","Hi. Yes, hi everybody. First one is on the public exchange comments, you highlight member retention being better and favorable, risk adjustment, I wonder if you could flush those out a little more, what you are talking about there? And I think last call when the - or maybe was on the Investor Day when you gave guidance about the exchange this year, you said you'd be in the 5% to 10% range as the last year but down slightly and margin within that range, is that still your thinking or have you changed in the way you think about what the margin looks like this year versus last year?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, Jeff?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, thanks AJ, it's Jeff. Yes, no, nothing different than what we said in our, in our previous guidance with respect to exchange. Yes, we do expect it to be a little bit down from 2018 more similar to '17, '16, '15; the margin that we had there. As far as the retention, I think we have a normal retention rate that we've assumed based on our historical experience, meaning how long a member stays with us and pays premiums. Obviously, you can go back and look at the historical retention rate from beginning to end, and we've been obviously tracking that and what we're seeing is that members are actually staying and paying in premiums longer, which is, which is obviously a good thing and that's driving, I guess the additional revenue that we added to the guidance today.","And the other piece is risk adjustment and on the risk adjustments side we have certain geographical areas where we've got a lot of scale. We've grown the business very successfully. And as you continue to grow, and capture a larger percentage of that market, you do see a little bit of a return to the mean on the risk scores, nothing significant, but obviously, that was the other piece of the guidance increase on the revenue line.","A. J. Rice","Okay. And then, and just taking a quick glance at your 10-Q, I mean hopefully I have this right, it looks like you're up about $230 million in prior year development, this year's first quarter versus last. Now I know that' s a gross number. Is that a function of the Fidelis and the exchange, new exchange volume or is it - what's driving that and any comment about that?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, that's pretty much all related to Fidelis. We put a note actually in the table of our press release, kind of highlighting that the press release has a 12-month roll forward, which does not include the Fidelis business, because that transaction happened July 1st of last year. So, the development is not included in that 12-month roll forward, but in the 10-Q that is a 3-month roll forward from December's number, which obviously does include Fidelis. And so that's the difference there.","A. J. Rice","Okay. all right, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Hi. Thanks, good morning, couple of follow-ups here. One on the PBM side, when you've looked at, now that you've had some conversations I assume some greater conversations with WellCare Group on their ability to drive cost savings it may pop a lot about how much they've been able to save with CVS and use their scale, is there any comparison, you've been able to kind of make versus your kind of cost of goods on the PBM side of Centene? And is it comparable, dose WellCare look greater, or are you guys great or any kind of color you can give us there?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, Justin. So I think just, obviously there was a limited amount that we can comment on with respect to relative pricing on those things and that's obviously we went through an appropriate process on that in the diligence phase. And I think as we said, as part of the announcement of the deal that there are kind of net synergies anticipated on the pharmacy front. So I don't think it would be appropriate to go into too much more detail than that at this point.","Justin Lake","Okay, and then just following up on the risk adjustment side. Can you give us an idea of how big you expect that risk adjustment payable to be at this point given the kind of shift in the risk pool, you're talking about here? And, any impact or kind of update you can give us on margins that you're seeing kind of you as you get a full look at the book?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, a couple of things Justin. I would say risk adjustment, obviously we continually update that estimate every single quarter and so that changes. but I would say over $800 million is what we're anticipating on a risk adjustment payable for the year. On the margin side, it was right in line with our expectations and obviously we expected and we expecting for the year, a little bit lower in our margin range compared to last year. So nothing out of the ordinary there as the exchange business performed well, and it was right in line with our expectations for the quarter.","Justin Lake","Okay, great, thanks for the call.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning. I want to go back to Iowa quickly. I think in your prepared remarks, you said that those U&H [ph] slides would be split equally, but the 500 million boost in your guide for the back half seems a little bit lighter as I thought the United business was closer to the 3 billion annualized number. So, is that related to the mix, is it maybe timing, just hoping you can maybe reconcile that?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I know, I mean, I think if you look at United, they had a larger percentage of the business. They didn't have just half. And so we've previously given a range of membership, I think, of 180,000 to 200,000 members. So we've updated that to half the market and obviously you're only getting half of the year, so nothing unusual other than the mathematics behind that.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. And then you said you assume a higher MLR in new businesses you've talked about which would certainly makes sense. For this, just remind us, are you assuming a loss in year one or more breakeven and if it is a loss or breakeven?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, more breakeven, which is why you didn't see any earnings flow through on the increase in the revenue line for the six months and we're not talking about 20, so and just for the six months in '19 we're assuming breakeven.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, that's helpful, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. Just three clarifications, nothing original at this point and all financials, so sorry Michael, let me go to Jeff.","Michael Neidorff","Okay, it's okay. I understand financials too so\u2026","Gary Taylor","That's fair. Well you take a shot at this. Just on days claims payable and I appreciate the comments about timing and in fact, when I look at the roll forward for the first quarter in the Q, it does look like the ratio of current paid versus incurred slipped about 300 basis points year-over-year from about 64 to 61 so a lot of that, a lot of the impact on days claims payable does look like it's sort of timing related. Is there anything to call out on that or is this just illustrating the point that you were making earlier?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, no, nothing to call out. I mean I would say that this is a three-month roll forward that's in the 10-Q, and so that number, I mean, we've only had three months of run out on those medical claims from December. So, that number will, all things being considered would in theory, continue to grow. So you have to \u2013 it is only three months out and usually in the press release it is a full year roll forward.","So, that number will continue to change, I guess is what I would say, but no, nothing unusual, which is, I mean from our view, it's consistent, on a percentage of medical costs, that's how we track it. We show this information to our audit committee, and Board every single quarter, it's been very consistent for a long period of time. The methodology hasn't changed, so we're comfortable where it is.","Gary Taylor","Got you. And, just trying to understand on the investments I caught what you said about little bit higher balances and higher rates, but the investment income more than doubled year-over-year and above a 12% year-over-year increase and the investment balance you called out a little better investment income in the quarter, but you also guided for that continuing for the year and part of the guidance raise. So is there any extra color on how you're doing so much better on investment income per the growth in balance?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, sure. Good question, two things Fidelis. So, you have the impact of Fidelis, we have their investments. We didn't have those in the first quarter or second quarter of last year. So you get the full effect of the Fidelis investments. The other thing is, on the health insurer fee we had received payments for the last year's health insurer fee reimbursement from a lot of our states earlier, than we have historically. So think of that number to $300 million to $400 million, that we have earlier in the year than we've had in the past and so you're earning investment income on that. And then obviously we had a strong cash flow generation for the quarter and a lot of that cash goes to the balance sheet, and we earn a short-term interest rate on it. So ultimately, you add up all those three things, and that's really driving the increase on a year-over-year basis.","Gary Taylor","Okay. And then final one was, I think Scott had mentioned the 10-K disclosure about move starting in the second quarter seeing some of specialty earnings moving to MCO intra company, in the elimination, is the effect of that or what's driving that merely less retained rebate at the PBM more going to the health plan or what's the dynamic that drives that?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, it's nothing other than internal dynamics as far as the margin on as we move to transparent pricing, there used to be a margin there, that's no longer going to be there. There's going to be a small piece really on administrative front, but the margin just moves into the health plan segment. So nothing other than I would say internal company activity.","Gary Taylor","Okay, thank you.","Jeff Schwaneke","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael Neidorff","Yes, thank you for your questions, your attention, your participation.

Kroll","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our third quarter earnings call.","Michael Neidorff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Scheffel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene Corporation will host this morning's call.

Please mark your calendars. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael F. Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call.","During the course of today's call, we will discuss our strong third quarter results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products, and our view of the Affordable Care Act. I will begin with highlights of our third quarter financial results. We reported third quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.34, or $1.22 when excluding the $0.15 impact of the ACA health insurance fee and $0.06 of transaction costs, and an income tax benefit of $0.33 related to periods prior to the third quarter of 2014.","We added 1.1 million new members year-over-year in the third quarter. This represents a 42% increase to 3.7 million covered lives. Premium and Service revenues grew 53% to $4.2 billion.","The HBR increased 80 basis points sequentially to 89.7%. This reflects an increase in new business, primarily attributable to the increase in high acuity membership. Bill will provide further HBR detail, including new and existing business mix.","Overall, we continue to see, as well as anticipate, stable medical trends. Now on to markets and product updates.","First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activities.","Florida. In August, we completed the phase in of Centene's 9 regions under the state's MMA program. At September 30, we had approximately 355,000 MMA lives in the state. Also in August, we completed the phase in of all 11 regions and is the sole provider for the Child Welfare Specialty Plan, Florida's new Foster Care program. And as of September 30, we had approximately 24,000 Foster Care beneficiaries in the state. These 2 contracts are the primary drivers of our 31% sequential membership growth in Florida.","The MMA and Foster Care programs are performing according to plan, which is at a higher HBR than historical memos. This is consistent with our plans. Medical costs, including pharmaceuticals, are in line with our expectations.","Illinois. In July, we began operating a new administrative and specialty services contract with the Cook County Health and Hospital system. This contract serves nearly 100,000 new members under the CountyCare program. The size of the program is expected to grow as CountyCare enters additional state Medicaid programs. Also in September, Centene began serving additional members under Illinois' current Medicaid program as Medicaid expansion.","Mississippi. The rollout of MississippiCAN expansion of an additional [indiscernible] lives is expected to commence at the end of 2014. This will continue to the third quarter 2015.","Louisiana. This past Friday, the state announced a notice of award for a pre-procurement of its value health program. We are pleased that our Louisiana subsidiary was recommended for a contract.","As part of the reprocurement, all beneficiaries will be placed in a full risk health plan. We anticipate serving 320,000 to 350,000 lives under the new contract. This will move -- this will more than double our annual revenue in the state. We expect to have this contract in place early in the first quarter of 2015.","Texas. In September, we successfully launched a new contract to serve STAR+PLUS members in 2 Medicaid rural service areas.","Moving on to dual eligibles. At September 30, we had 16,400 dual eligible members in Illinois and Ohio. Membership will continue to increase slightly throughout the remainder of 2014 in these 2 states. We continue to expect Michigan, South Carolina and Texas to go live with their dual demonstration projects during the first half of 2015.","Now a brief update on the ACA. First the health insurer fees. Centene has received signed agreements from 15 of our 17 applicable states, which provides for the reimbursement of the health insurance fee on a grossed up basis. This represents approximately 60% of the total amount.","CMS recently clarified that states should factor in the health insurer fee in setting rates paid to Medicaid's managed care clients.","We expect to receive a contract amendment from Texas in the fourth quarter of 2014. This is reflected in our guidance.","Next, Health Insurance Marketplaces. At September 30, we had 76,000 enrolled in paid exchange lives. The demographics of our enrollees continues to be in line with our pricing. Members are predominantly lower income, and over 90% are eligible for premium subsidies. The financial performance of our exchange business is in line with and slightly ahead of our expectations.","Lastly, Medicaid expansion. We ended the quarter with approximately 193,000 expansion lives in 6 states. Longer term, we continue to view this as a growth opportunity as more states adopt expansion.","Now hepatitis C therapies. We continue to manage the utilization of hepatitis C drugs in a responsible way on behalf of our state customers. Our medical management capabilities in Centene's clinical policies, in addition to sound state guidelines, have enabled us to successfully manage hepatitis C costs. Our experience to date has been consistent with our estimates. The net cost impact to Centene in the third quarter of 2014 declined sequentially. However, future costs are likely to increase as new therapies continue to be approved. In early October, an all oral hepatitis C drug was approved with genotype 1 patients. We are engaged in ongoing discussions with our states to ensure that all new treatments are properly managed and fully reflected in our reimbursement.","A quick comment on rates. We continue to expect the 2014 composite rate adjustment to be relatively flat. This is reflected in our updated guidance. In conclusion, we are pleased with our operating and financial performance during the first 2 quarters of the year. We expect to maintain this positive momentum in the fourth quarter 2014 and beyond. We are raising our 2014 financial guidance accordingly. It is important to note that excluding the tax benefit we recognized this year, we still have increased our EPS guidance by $0.14 at the low end and $0.09 at the high end. We look forward to seeing you at our December 12 Investor Day in New York City. Thank you for your interest in Centene, and now I'll turn the call over to Bill.","William N. Scheffel","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. As I begin this morning, let me first recap our third quarter EPS results. Our press release laid out the components of our results in the table on Page 1.","First, our GAAP EPS was $1.34 per diluted share. Similar to the first 2 quarters of 2014, there is a $0.15 impact related to the health insurer fee. And our acquisition transaction costs were $0.06 in Q3. The final item is a tax benefit of $0.33 related to the reversal of amounts accrued in prior periods, related to the limitation on compensation deduction applicable to certain health insurance issuers. In late September, the IRS issued final regulations on the application of the limitation on compensation deductions. Based on our analysis of the final regulations, we now believe that we are not subject to the limitation for 2013 and 2014. Therefore, we reversed the amounts previously recorded for 2013 of approximately $0.24 per share and $0.09 per share for the first half of 2014, for the total benefit of $0.33 per share.","The net of these adjustments is $1.22 per share for the third quarter of this year compared to the $0.88 per share reported in the third quarter of 2013.","Additionally, the third quarter this year also benefited by approximately $0.06 per share from not having to record the tax expense related to the limitation. Going now to our normal discussion of results. Premium and Service revenues approached $4.2 billion in the third quarter, an increase of 53% over the third quarter last year. The premium increase results from expansions in Florida, Ohio, Washington and Illinois and the addition of the California, New Hampshire, and Health Insurance Marketplace operations between years.","Our service revenues increased by $265 million between years, reflecting the growth in the carrier health and the addition of U.S. Medical Management. Our consolidated health benefits ratio was 89.7% this quarter, an increase of 190 basis points from last year's third quarter and 80 basis points sequentially.","The increase between years and sequentially is primarily attributable to the increase in higher acuity membership. As discussed during our Investor Day in June, the higher acuity products, like long-term care and dual eligibles, have higher targeted loss ratios. This results in an increase in our consolidated HBR, when the portion of our revenues from higher acuity membership increases. But then we also benefit from a lower G&A ratio due to the higher premiums received for these members.","For the third quarter, 27% of our revenues came from new business and 73% from existing business, similar to our second quarter split. The HBR for our new business was 91.4% in the third quarter and 89.0% for our existing business.","Our general and administrative expenses ratio was 8.0% this quarter compared to 9.1% last year, an improvement of 110 basis points. This year's third quarter includes $0.06 per share of acquisition transaction costs. Sequentially, we are down by 60 basis points from the second quarter. The continued reduction in our G&A ratio primarily reflects the benefit of the leverage we are receiving from our higher revenue base. For the third quarter, we recorded $32 million of revenue related to the reimbursement of the health insurer fee. And in September, we paid $126 million to the IRS for our 2014 fee. For Texas, our largest state, we continue to expect to receive a signed agreement before year end. And for all of 2014, we believe that the health insurer fee will net out and will not impact our overall results.","Investment income was $5.7 million in the third quarter compared to $4.8 million last year. Interest expense was $9.3 million this year compared to $6.6 million last year, reflecting a higher balance on our revolver and new issuance of the $300 million of senior notes earlier this year. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter excluding the effects of noncontrolling interest was 24.8%, which reflects the benefit of the final compensation deduction regulations discussed earlier.","Excluding the favorable impact from prior periods, the third quarter rate would've been approximately 46%, the rate we expect to apply to the fourth quarter this year as well. Our diluted earnings per share for GAAP purposes was $1.34 compared to $0.88 last year. Diluted shares outstanding were 60.7 million shares for the third quarter compared to 59.7 million shares in the second quarter.","At September 30, we had $2.9 billion of cash, investments and restricted deposits, including $70 million held by unregulated entities. Our risk-based capital continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level, excluding any statutory impact related to the treatment of the health insurer fee during the year.","Our total debt was $955 million at quarter end, including $140 million of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Our debt-to-capital ratio, excluding our $71 million nonrecourse mortgage note was 35.0%. Medical claim liabilities totaled $1.6 billion at September 30 and represented 43.1 days in claims payable.","Cash flow from operations was $442 million for the third quarter and $854 million year-to-date, both of which were over 5x net earnings for each of the respective periods.","Our full year guidance numbers have been updated to reflect our third quarter results. For 2014, we expect Premium and Service Revenues of $15.3 billion to $15.8 billion. Diluted earnings per share, $4.35 to $4.50; consolidated health benefits ratio, 88.9% to 89.4%; general and administrative expense ratio, 8.2% to 8.6%; and an effective tax rate for the year of 40% to 42%. Diluted shares outstanding, 60.0 million to 60.4 million shares. We have included a table in our press release reconciling our EPS guidance provided as part of our second quarter press release to today's updated guidance. Our 2014 guidance assumes we will receive the signed health insurer fee agreement in Texas, our most significant state in terms of dollars, in the fourth quarter. As a result, we believe there will be no significant impact to the quarter -- to the company for the full year related to the health insurer fee. For income taxes, we have recognized a $0.24 benefit during 2014 related to prior years and acquisition transaction costs are expected to total $0.12 per share for all of 2014.","We also believe that based on our 2014 revenue estimates, we will not be subject to the additional tax related to the limitation on compensation deduction in 2015. Our business expansion costs for the year are estimated to be $0.55 to $0.60, and include $0.12 in acquisition transaction costs for U.S. Medical Management, Louisiana and Spain. Third quarter, expansion costs were approximately $0.14, which is less than we previously estimated due to a lower amount of acquisition costs. This now concludes our prepared remarks, and operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Joshua Raskin of Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So the question -- just around the tax rate. I just want to make sure I understand it. Is it a permanent change that will -- it sounds like you're expecting it, Bill, to continue into '15. But what exactly changed around the deductibility compensation expenses? And I think, you said it was revenue dependent i.e. should we think about this 45% to 46% tax rate for eternity, or is there something that can change that would put you back up towards that 50% tax rate?","William N. Scheffel","The final regulations which were issued in September laid out the calculations in terms of how this is to be done and essentially what happens is there's a 1 year lag. So the 2013 revenue amounts are calculated and depending on where those fall, they dictate whether you'd be subject to this limitation in 2013 and 2014 in that case because that was the first year of the tax. And so the tax is calculated based on, I will use a broad word like commercial revenues divided by total revenues and there's a limitation on how much that can be, whether you're subject to the tax or not. We are below those revenue -- below those de minimis tests in 2013. So therefore, we didn't have to pay tax for 2013 and 2014. And based on our 2014 revenues we don't think we will be applicable -- we will have to pay this tax in 2015. This is a year-by-year calculation and it will depend on our operations going forward. But obviously, it's something we'd be looking at very closely.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So. I mean, just to give us a sense, Bill, are you guys close to hitting the commercial limitation? Would you have to exit some exchange business to make sure you don't hit that? Like, just in terms of likelihood of this actually persisting?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think right now, it's hard to have a good crystal ball forever but as I said, we don't think it's going to be applicable to us for 2013, 2014 and 2015. And I'll leave 2016 to some other time.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","All right. And then just -- you didn't mention Florida. But after -- okay last quarter, I'm curious if you have got any more color on Florida specifically?","William N. Scheffel","Sure. I think in Florida, we've got 3 new products effectively going in there, including long-term care, the basic Medicaid program and the Foster Care program. I think with respect to long-term care, we're working with the states -- the state on finalizing the rates for September 1, and dealing with some of the issues there in long-term care, and we expect that to be done later this quarter. I think the other programs quite frankly, are performing near our expectations and what we originally contemplated when we prepared our bids and submitted those to the state.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes. I would say -- I'll just add, Josh. As we impose [ph] that the MMA, the Foster Care as I said in my prepared remarks is consistent with our expectation, our pricing, pharmacy costs are in line and we have real-time pharmacy costs from our PBM. So we're comfortable with Florida. We're comfortable we're working to any issues that come up in Florida, as they have been very responsible partners at every level.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I'm sorry to sneak in a last one. But any commentary on 2015 revenues? I think you guys previously suggested $18.5 billion if you didn't win anything, et cetera, at the Investor Day. I assume, obviously, that's gone a little bit higher based on some of the contract wins but if there are starting...","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes. And I guess some people may try and figure out where it was going from there. But we're going to wait until December 12, when we just give a very complete picture of how we see it, Josh. And that's probably [indiscernible] we say we see it up by how much or something in that nature. I do expect it'll be stronger. I will tell you that.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Carter of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher R. Carter - Credit Suisse (Deutschland) Aktiengesellschaft","Just on the MLR. I mean, a little bit higher than we expected. It looked like the new business MLR was down sequentially, so pretty good, but the existing business MLR was up. I mean, can you just give us any color in terms of what's driving that maybe?","William N. Scheffel","I think the primary thing is, we talked about is the higher acuity business. When the state rates each of these products, they have a targeted loss ratio and just, you're usually in the 90s for things, a lot of SSI products, a lot of long-term care and the duals, among other things. And so as that mix shifts towards more of that, you'll see an increase in the consolidated ratio. So we did not see an increase in medical cost trends or utilization really. I would say it's pretty much all mix at this point in time and nothing that was unusual from our vantage point.","Christopher R. Carter - Credit Suisse (Deutschland) Aktiengesellschaft","But I guess, did anything else really move into that bucket in the quarter?","William N. Scheffel","I mean, you've got stuff that was long term, some of the regions from long-term care in Florida would've moved into that bucket because they started last year in August, but only a little bit.","Christopher R. Carter - Credit Suisse (Deutschland) Aktiengesellschaft","Okay. And then just ...","Michael F. Neidorff","I would say, I think importantly, it's performing in line with expectations, and from a general trend standpoint it's doing just fine.","Christopher R. Carter - Credit Suisse (Deutschland) Aktiengesellschaft","Okay. And then just on the Louisiana contract. I know you guys said, you think you can hit kind of 320,000 or 350,000 members next year. I mean, I think that implies a pretty high retention rate of the CHS lives, I guess. How do we get comfort that -- you guys can kind of pick up those numbers as opposed to them being I guess, assigned to the new entrant, or even, United, I think that was in the share savings program?","Michael F. Neidorff","I'll let Jesse respond to that.","Jesse N. Hunter","Sure. Chris. I think, what the state has layed out, I think with some clarity, kind of the process, if you will, for how members will via [ph] move under the new contract. So as it stands today, we have 2 contracts, 1 full risk and then the CHS shared risk contract. So the formula that the state has laid out includes first and foremost member choice. And so we -- that's always the starting point. But the other 2 criteria are -- include primary care continuity, so having the same primary care from one -- kind of from one program or one product to the other. And then the -- we've got really the MCO history, if you will, so when we look at our experience having the operating, the shared savings contract for a period of time in 2014, and then the very strong primary care network overlap that exists between our kind of risk product and the shared savings product. We do have confidence with a retention rate for the CHS business that is reflected in that 320,000 to 350,000 member range under the new contract.","Operator","Our next question is from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","You mentioned in the prepared remarks that you expect Texas to update the contract for the health insurance fee by year end. But I believe their session doesn't start until January '15. So if you could talk about what gives you confidence that there will be a...","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I think there's 2 issues. I think there is the issue of when they sign the agreement and when they fund it. And what's important is that if they sign this year, we can recognize it and then if they fund it in, it becomes receivable. They fund it in the first quarter, January, February, that's fine. You just have to draw that distinction, Sarah, between a signed agreement and the actual payment. And we're talking about being able to recognize it in the fourth quarter.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And then last question here is on the expansion eligible population. I know that last quarter there were some states that were still working through their backlog. In particular, I believe California had about 600,000. Can you update us on the progress of those backlogs in your expansion states? And should we think about expansion enrollment increasing through the end of the year? Or are you about -- where you expect today on that?","Michael F. Neidorff","Rone?","K. Rone Baldwin","Well, we have seen continued increases in enrollment in our Medicaid expansion states, especially Washington and California, to some extent, Ohio. We have seen states get through a lot of the backlog as you mentioned plus with respect to woodwork, we have identified woodwork as being a factor in those states where we have seen Medicaid expansion. So we continue to think, we'll see some growth in enrollment but it -- probably the bulk of it has happened through the 3 quarters at this point for 2014.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","William Benjamin Brandt - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Bo on for Matt. A quick question on service revenues, down sequentially. Is that a product of flattening Sovaldi?","William N. Scheffel","I think that's the simple answer. We did peak in the third quarter. As we said -- at the end of the second quarter, I think we said we thought we'd see some plateauing of those costs and revenues in effect and then the fourth quarter we expect to see that reverse with the new products.","William Benjamin Brandt - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Got it. And with these new products are there any new agreements, or can you provide any commentary on what some of the states are working on for potential carve-outs or reimbursement?","Michael F. Neidorff","I will start off and then ask Mary. I will start off and ask Mary, if she wishes to add something or Rone. But we are working with them now and we're following the same general procedures we did with the initial hepatitis C products. And so we see ourselves continuing on what was a very effective course. Rone would you give more color?","K. Rone Baldwin","Well, we've been working on this issue with the states and since the beginning of the year, both for Sovaldi as well as for the new therapies that are coming on. And the states have recognized the need to make an adjustment for these new therapies. The majority of our states have put in place or putting in place either a carve-out program or a kick payment or some sort of reinsurance, or we are not covering pharmacy in that actual state. So that can cover the majority of our states. The others have put in place some form of rate adjustments going, for 2014 and going forward. And so in aggregate, we think the states have responded with fairly meaningful programs to mitigate the costs of these -- existing therapies as well as the additional therapies going forward. But this is something we continue to work with the states on as well as the experience with these drugs emerges.","William Benjamin Brandt - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Will this be a continual rate negotiation with the states on a go-forward basis? Or have they made the adjustment and this will be applicable for 2015 going forward?","K. Rone Baldwin","Again it varies a little bit by state for the states that have put in some of the risk mitigation programs I mentioned previously. It's not a rate dependent issue for the states that are relying on this, more on a rate basis. There is an aspect where they want to look at the actual experience and then reflect that in the rates. So it's a mix.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just maybe a quick housekeeping one here. Looks like for the 2 recent -- the transaction costs for the deals here, you only booked about $0.06 in the quarter. I thought originally it was supposed to be a $0.12, did anything change there or maybe that's going to be fourth quarter? Anything we should be thinking about there?","William N. Scheffel","I think that our estimate we gave in July tended to be high. We actually came in at $0.06 or lower than what we thought we were after we did all of our purchase accounting and ran all the transaction through.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then thinking about your investments and expectations for start-up costs in '14, can you kind of remind us how those ramped and progressed through the quarter year-to-date, and maybe how should we be thinking about some of those costs into 2015?","William N. Scheffel","I think that they're generally equal for each quarter depending on the acquisition transaction costs. So we had that in the first quarter and then somewhat in the third quarter. It's not unusual with some of the product start-ups that we'll have fourth quarter -- higher level of fourth quarter costs as we get ready to do a couple of those. But I don't know that there is great variability from quarter-to-quarter other than, which occurs as a result of acquisition transaction costs.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So it's still the $0.60 to $0.65, I think you called out. Is that still what it is?","William N. Scheffel","I think I said $0.55 to $0.60 in my script.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Sorry. Sorry, I missed that. Okay. And then for next year, I mean how should we maybe, just big picture, be thinking about that?","Michael F. Neidorff","We'll be talking about that on December 12.","William N. Scheffel","The only thing I'd say is we always expect to have business expansion costs. Now as our revenue grows the -- as a percentage of revenues it probably doesn't grow. It probably gets smaller, but it's still a hefty amount in terms of cents per share.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Fidel from Deutsche Bank.","Shawn Bevec - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Shawn Bevec on for Scott. Question about the MLRs. Obviously, higher acuity membership mix is likely to continue to grow, which will continue pushing your MLRs higher. Do you think that MLR trends going forward will sort of be in that low 90% range?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think it depends where we end up from the mix standpoint. I would say they will get closer to 90%. I don't know if they'll get to 90% on a blended overall basis yet.","Shawn Bevec - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then one question on the exchange business. I know it's small for you guys, but can you talk about any of the 3Rs accruals that you've been making this year?","William N. Scheffel","At this point in time, we don't have any substantive dollars for the specific 3R accruals. We're continuing to develop information with respect to things like risk adjustment, et cetera, and there's a little bit of reinsurance as a result of claims over the certain dollar amount, but nothing of any great consequence.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Lake of JP Morgan.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Mike Newshel in for Justin. First, just one clarification on the tax benefit. I think you mentioned that in addition to the $0.33 of prior period benefit in this quarter, there's also $0.06. And so is that basically a $0.12 benefit from -- for the fourth quarter?","William N. Scheffel","I think that's correct, right. I would say, rough numbers is $0.24 related to 2013 and before, $0.27 related to 2014.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then, so essentially for the EPS number for the quarter excluding the tax benefit from the prior periods and the quarter itself comes to about $0.95, is that right?","William N. Scheffel","Well, we reported $1.34. So I understand your math, which pieces you take out and which ones you add in. But that's -- I'll leave that to you.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And just one more thing on the premium tax. You didn't mention California. Do you still expect to be reimbursed there, or is it just because it's so small that it's negligible either way?","William N. Scheffel","The state issued a letter earlier in the year indicating they're going to reimburse it. It wasn't of sufficient nature to actually record the fee at that point in time, but fully expect to receive that. In our case, we only had 2 months of operations in 2013, so it would've been subject to tax for this year. So it's very immaterial for us.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Halper of FBR.","Steven P. Halper - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Just regarding the Texas fee in the fourth quarter. What does the accounting look like? Is that just one big revenue adjustment in the quarter?","William N. Scheffel","Essentially, we -- yes. Well, basically, we obviously didn't record it in the first 3 quarters. So I think we reported an impact of $0.16 for Q1 and Q2, and $0.15 in Q3. So that would all reverse in the third quarter if we record -- receive the Texas one. So we'd have all 4 quarters.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you can talk a little bit about kind of rates, coming at it from a couple of angles. On the one hand, we are seeing some surveys that suggest that more states are adding benefits to Medicaid programs looking into 2015, so that would obviously be a need for an increase in your rates to cover that. On the other hand, I'm wondering to what extent, probably particularly in Medicaid expansion, where rates were high in year 1 in anticipation of pent-up demand and higher utilization from new populations. How do we think about blending those types of things together into a composite rate outlook for 2015? Anybody there?","Operator","I'm not sure, has the speaker location muted their line?","[Technical Difficulty]","Michael F. Neidorff","Can you hear us, operator?","Operator","Yes. It's clear now. Please go ahead.","William N. Scheffel","So I'm not sure if everybody caught all that or not. But with respect to new benefits that are added, that's generally covered by additional rates that are paid by the state. That's a normal process that occurs all the time. That's almost like a pass through in many cases and then with respect to the new Medicaid expansion rates, which were higher, let's say, because there was some concept of pent-up demand, that's all being discussed with the states as we move forward into 2015 and there's really no -- nothing new there at this point in time to say their rate adjustment will be very significant.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","So Bill, do you have a view on a rate -- a composite rate? Or should we expect something around flat like it was for -- or like you're anticipating for '14? Or is it too early to really think about a point estimate number?","William N. Scheffel","Yes. I would say it's fairly early. We don't expect to have significant rates increases in any cases. We've always said it's rather modest, particularly, net of changes in the Medicaid fee schedule. So we'll talk about that more on December 12 at our Investor Day, when we specifically cover 2015.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes. It tends to be a state-by-state negotiation we do, and then we'll see that all rolls up, and we'll give you the number on the 12th.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","And then maybe a follow-up question. On your G&A ratio, is there -- I guess, is there a floor on that, as you're -- to the earlier question about MLRs moving up as higher acuity populations move into the mix or grow in the mix. Obviously, I would think that your offset would be leverage on SG&A. Is there -- what's the level at which you've kind of achieved full leverage and that number can't go any lower?","William N. Scheffel","That's a good question. I'm not sure I have an answer on that at this point. I think, obviously continue to go lower. We had 8.0% for this quarter, but we had $0.06 of transaction costs included in that number. So obviously, if you factor that out, it will be lower than 8%. So I think clearly, it can be in the 7s. How much we're in that, I don't know yet but I think we do obviously see the benefits, where we're just adding additional revenue, in that the fixed costs that we have are spread out over a wider base.","Michael F. Neidorff","I mean, it goes back to products mix, because if you think about in Louisiana, we're adding the standard Medicaid type population and in other states the high acuity. So it's how all that mix comes together.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna International Group.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I hopped down a little late here, so I apologize if these were asked or covered already. But I think some states still have in sort of the traditional Medicaid managed care bucket rate increases in the second and third quarter, like Georgia, Texas, Florida. Were there any notable rate actions or lack thereof in the period?","William N. Scheffel","It's interesting because this year has been rather quiet in that regard, and so the rate adjustments for July 1 in Georgia or September 1 in Texas are rather modest on both sides -- both cases.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. But just no material impact in third quarter results?","William N. Scheffel","Nothing in the third quarter. I guess, I said earlier, I think in Florida we're working on long-term care rates which we expect to get resolved in the fourth quarter, but obviously there would only be -- that would have been a September 1 effective date, so it's only 1 month that's -- would've been in the third quarter anyway.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then on the increase to the revenue outlook for the year. Is that primarily coming from one cohort of membership? Or is it pretty broad based?","William N. Scheffel","I'd say, it's pretty broad based.","Michael F. Neidorff","That's across the business.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly. When I look at the sort of core increase in guidance of the $0.09 to $0.14, that's all operations, correct? Not the tax impact is -- are the numbers below that, the $3.84 to $3.99, is that correct?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think if you look at the table, we've put in the full tax impact in there. $0.51 I think was subtracted out. That is the full impact for both last year and this year. So that excludes the impact of any favorable tax adjustments so...","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. But I mean, and I'm sorry, maybe I'm just not getting this, but just to be clear. So the $0.27 is for all of the 2014, not just the first 3 quarter catch up, is that fair?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, correct. Yes, I think that's right. What we tried to provide in the last page or so of our press release on the guidance tables was a reconciliation, and that's for the full year. We always give guidance on a full year basis. So what we've done is broken out the tax benefit calculation into the 2 parts, last year and this year. So on a going-forward basis, obviously, the $0.27 is just we would've previously thought we were going to accrue for that, now we're not. So you can throw that into the run rate numbers and do whatever you choose to in terms of your models.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America.","Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Steve on for Kevin. I wanted to come back to MLR. So I appreciate the shift towards higher acuity overall on your book. But it looks like sequentially, the MLR for the Medicaid shift Foster Care and exchange business is up about 190 basis points and the ABD long-term care in duals MLR actually declined about 100 basis points. So I was just hoping you can give some color maybe what's driving the sequential increase in the lower acuity book?","William N. Scheffel","I think one of the things that has a big impact is, in Florida, the MMA business is in the first line for Medicaid, and I think that as Michael indicated, I think, in his remarks, the HBR for that -- the MMA business in Florida is at a higher rate than was traditionally incurred in Florida. So year-over-year, you'd see an increase. That was consistent with our expectations and what we put in the bid documents, but year-over-year, you would see that type of adjustment.","Michael F. Neidorff","It was a big population, but important, can't emphasize enough. It didn't come as a surprise. We -- everything is coming in as expected.","Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So the shift from Q2 to Q3 is largely driven by the growing population in Florida. That's kind of continuing to come in around the same MLR for that new program? Is that the right way to think about it?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, if you think about...","William N. Scheffel","Right. The new MMA business is at a higher rate than the old Medicaid business was in Florida.","Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just looking at the MLR guidance then. It came up a little bit. Is that driven by a certain segment performing differently than maybe you expected? Or is the mix just coming in a little differently?","William N. Scheffel","I think it's generally mix that -- those have gone upward, as we've continued to grow. We've continued to see duals growing.","Stephen Baxter - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just on the trajectory for guidance. I was just wondering if you could help us maybe if there's any puts and takes that we should be kind of thinking about as we build our model for the fourth quarter. If I kind of just carry the same MLR to the fourth quarter, I'm coming in kind of towards the top end of your range. So if there's anything that we could be thinking about there, that would be great.","William N. Scheffel","I don't know if there's any specifics on the fourth quarter that we have to offer. I think that at this point, the guidance we gave for the full year, you should be able to kind of get some idea where the fourth quarter falls out, and we'll leave it at that.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Showing no further questions. That concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael F. Neidorff","All right. Thank you, all, for joining us, and we look forward to continuing what you've seen through the first 3 quarters in the Q4 and beyond. And we will be talking to you in the near future. Look forward to December 12, where we'll give you a lot of information that you've been looking for. Thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

[Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to Ed Kroll, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations and Finance. Please go ahead.","Ed Kroll","Thank you, Steve, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on our 2017 third quarter earnings results conference call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Jeff Schwaneke, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene will host this morning's call, which can also be accessed through our website at centene.com.","A replay will be available shortly after the call's completion, also at centene.com or by dialing 877-344-7529 in the US and Canada or in other countries by dialing 412-317-0088. The playback code for both dial-ins is 10111720.","Any remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.","Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recently filed Form 10-Q dated today October 24, 2017, the Form 10-K dated February 21, 2017 and other public SEC filings.","Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.","The call will also refer to certain non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of these measures with the most directly comparable GAAP measures can be found in our third quarter 2017 press release, which is available on our website centene.com under the Investors section.","Finally, a reminder that our next investor day will be on Friday, December 15, 2017, as always, in New York City.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's third quarter 2017 earnings call. During the course of this call, we will discuss our third quarter financial results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products.","In addition, we will provide commentary around the ongoing healthcare discussions in Washington, as well as discuss Centene's recently announced acquisition of Fidelis Care.","I would like to begin with the healthcare regulatory landscape. After several repeal and replace efforts in Washington failed, we fully recognize the possibility that cost-sharing reductions, CSRs, might not continue to be funded, and as such, planned accordingly.","We filed 2018 rates in all our exchange markets, assuming there would be no CSR payments. And they have now been approved in all markets.","I would like to note there seems to be a misunderstanding regarding the applications of CSRs. They are not a profit contributor. Instead, they are intended to cover the out-of-pocket healthcare costs for the country's most vulnerable population. The CSR pass-throughs are reconciled annually. And any overage is paid back to CMS.","I would like to remind everyone, in 2015, the Supreme Court ruled the ACA's advance premium tax credits legal. These credits cannot be removed via executive order.","It is important to note, contrary to the administration's desired impact of reducing insurance premium costs, the de-funding of the CSRs will cause the federal government to spend more money through higher funding of premium tax credit.","In fact, the Congressional Budget Office recently estimated that defunding of CSRs would increase federal spending by almost $200 billion over a ten-year period or $20 billion per year. Note the federal government currently spends approximately $7 billion annually on CSR payments.","Equally important, we're putting in place a system to track the incremental premiums being charged. In doing so, we know what refunds would be required if the decision is reversed by the courts or the Congress.","The process has a long way to play out. Injunctions have been filed and legal actions taken on multiple fronts.","I want to emphasize the importance of vulnerable populations having access to high-quality affordable healthcare. Centene will continue to work with members of both parties on stabilizing the marketplace and improving the healthcare delivery system. We also believe important social change should be a bipartisan effort.","In the meantime, it is business as usual for Centene. We make decisions based on the facts in front of us at any given time. We will continue to focus on fundamentals, as evidenced by another strong quarterly financial performance.","Next, I will discuss the acquisition of Fidelis. On September 12, we signed a definitive agreement under which Fidelis Care will become Centene's health plan in New York State.","Fidelis Care is a not-for-profit diversified leader in government-sponsored programs across the State of New York.","New York is the second largest managed-care state. By adding Fidelis Care, Centene will have a leadership position in the four largest managed care states \u2013 California, Florida, New York and Texas.","Under the terms of the agreement, we will require substantially all of the assets of Fidelis Care for approximately $3.75 billion.","New York law allows for the acquisition of assets of a not-for-profit rather than the conversion to a for-profit entity. This facilitates our ability to complete the transaction. ","This deal is positive from both a strategic and financial standpoint. We expect it to create significant value for Centene's shareholders and both companies' stakeholders.","Fidelis Care is quite complementary to Centene. The company takes a local approach towards providing high-quality affordable healthcare to low-income vulnerable populations.","The company is ranked number one in state-sponsored programs in the State of New York. It is the fastest growing New York Medicaid and managed long-term care plan, as well as the second fastest growing New York Medicare Advantage plans.","It is the only plan that operates Medicaid CHIP and managed long-term care plans in all 62 counties in the state.","At June 30, 2017, Fidelis Care served over 1.6 million beneficiaries. And for the first six months ended June 30, 2017, Fidelis Care's revenue was $4.8 billion.","Through the incorporation of our data analytics tools, case management and award-winning clinical management programs, we will be able to further build upon and enhance the existing capabilities of Fidelis. ","We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive to GAAP EPS. We anticipate high-single-digit percentage accretion to adjusted EPS in the first 12 months following the close. And low to mid-teens percentage accretion to adjusted EPS in the second full year following the close.","We also anticipate generating approximately $25 million in pretax synergies in the first 12 months following the close and $100 million in pretax net run [ph] synergies. ","These synergies will primarily be attributable to use of our medical management programs, and especially services. We expect Fidelis Care to add approximately $500 million of 2018 adjusted EBITDA, including net synergies.","On October 2, it was announced that Centene was granted early termination of the waiting period under Hart-Scott-Rodino. ","We are moving through the process for approval from regulatory agencies in New York. The initial integration planning process is underway and is going extremely well. In fact, it is ahead of where we were at this time after the announcement of the Health Net acquisition.","We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of 2018. New York will mark Centene's 29th state of operation.","Now, on to third quarter financials. We are pleased to report a strong third quarter, marked by solid top and bottom line growth. ","Membership at quarter-end was 12.3 million individuals, representing an increase of approximately 875,000 recipients or 8% compared to the third quarter of 2016.","Total revenues increased approximately 10% year-over-year to $11.9 billion.","The HBR increased 100 basis points year-over-year and 170 basis points sequentially to 88%. These increases are primarily due to new and expanded health plans, which initially operate at a higher HBR and an increase in higher acuity members. Additionally, a rate reduction for California Medicaid expansion also contributed to the uptick in HBR.","Lastly, we reported third quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.35. This compares to $1.12 reported in the same period last year and represents year-over-year increase of approximately 21%.","Jeff will provide further financial details, including updated 2017 guidance. ","A quick comment on medicals costs. We continue to see, as well as anticipate, overall stable medical cost trends, consistent with our expectations in the low single digit.","Moving on to markets and product updates, Bruce will discuss recent Medicaid activities.","Nevada. On July 1, we began providing healthcare services to Medicaid beneficiaries enrolled in Nevada's managed care program. The contract launched as expected. ","At September 30, we served approximately 17,000 beneficiaries in the state. We expect continued growth for the balance of the year.","Illinois. In August, our Illinois subsidiary IlliniCare was awarded a statewide contract for the Medicaid managed care program. This contract now includes needy children.","Centene is currently contracted to provide healthcare services in the state's Medicaid and dual-eligible population in 12 counties. The new contract expands our footprint to all 102 counties in the state. It is expected to commence on January 1, 2018.","Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania long-term care contract remains on track to commence on January 1, 2018. Pennsylvania HealthChoices [indiscernible] continues to be subject to protests. We anticipate the award will not meet the initial expectation of a January 1, 2018 start date.","Next, Centurion. In August, Centurion successfully re-secured its contract in Tennessee. At September 30, Centurion provided healthcare services for over 22,000 inmates in the state.","A new contract is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2018. Centurion currently operates in seven states, providing correctional healthcare services to 158,000 individuals as of September 30.","Now, on the Medicare, at quarter-end, we served approximately 330,000 Medicare and dual-eligible beneficiaries. As I have previously stated, we are applying a test-and-learn approach to our first year of Medicare Advantage expansion in four Centene Medicaid states.","We are pleased with the operating performance of our Medicare Advantage for [indiscernible] thus far in 2017. We have applied the insights we have gained thus far this year to Centene's 2018 Medicare Advantage and D-SNP plans.","Next year, we will be offering plans in eight new Centene Medicaid states. These plans will be launched under our national Medicare Advantage brand name Allwell and are all eligible for a premium bonus under our four-star parent rating in 2018.","The annual enrollment process began on October 15. We were pleased with the competitive position of our products and engagement from the broke community as well.","While it is still early, the initial metrics for 2018 membership growth are in line with our expectations.","Upon the close of the Fidelis Care deal, we'll also be serving Medicare Advantage members in New York. ","We were disappointed by CMS' recent downgrade of four-star parent rating to 3.5 for 2019 and are currently in the process of appealing. This [indiscernible] downgrade was the result of a 2015 program [indiscernible].","Health Net and California's underlying performance reflects a four-star rating performance. However, CMS lowered a single measure, BAPP, beneficiary access and performance problem due to the civil monetary penalty associated with a plan audit in 2015. This caused a decline in the overall score to 3.5 service.","The overall quality results improved on a year-over-year basis. However, this improvement was insufficient to compensate for the lower BAPP measure.","It is important to note that this is a short-term issue. We will still be receiving the 5% bonus payments in 2018.","The penalty related to the 2015 program audit will only impact the 2019 bonus share and will not have a continuing impact on the star ratings in future years. ","As I said earlier, we are in the process of appealing. We're also evaluating additional options at this time to mitigate the effect of the loss of the 4-star parent rating for the 2019 year.","Over the long-term, we continue to expect our Medicare Advantage products to drive over 20% of our annual growth rate.","Next on to health insurance marketplaces. At September 30, we served approximately 1 million exchange members. This represents a sequential decline of approximately 60,000 beneficiaries due to normal attrition and is in line with our expectations.","The key demographics of these members including age, gender, financial assistance and [indiscernible] remain consistent. Over 90% of [indiscernible] and over 90% of the gold and silver tier plans. ","Our exchange business continued to perform well in 2017. As I said in my earlier remarks, it is business as usual. We remain focused on providing high quality affordable healthcare to low income individuals.","In addition to expanding our footprint in six existing Centene markets next year, [indiscernible] three new exchange states in 2018 \u2013 Kansas, Missouri and Nevada. ","Open enrollment starts November 1. Jeff's guidance includes incremental marketing and other outreach efforts to offset the federal government's cuts.","Upon the close of Fidelis Care, we will also be offering exchange products in New York.","Shifting gears to our rate outlook, we continue to expect 2017 net composite Medicaid rate adjustment of 0% to 1%, consistent with the past few years.","In summary, third quarter results offer continued evidence of Centene's financial strength and operating capabilities.","While we will give full 2018 financial guidance at our December investor day, it is important to recognize the operating momentum we have going in to 2018.","Centene has been and continues to be a growth company. We will continue to execute on our growth strategy, as evidenced by recent announcement of the Fidelis Care acquisition and, as previously discussed, the Illinois and Missouri expense, which are already in our numbers.","Centene's entry into the State of New York is consistent with our strategy to continue to be the national leader in government-sponsored healthcare.","Regarding healthcare policy, there will continue to be headline volatility. It is important to differentiate between this and the actual results we're delivering. As I have said many times before, this process is complicated and will take quite some time to play out.","It is also important to remember Centene is agile. We have a solid track record of demonstrating our capacity and capability to navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, customers and shareholders.","As a reminder, our next investor day is on December 15 in New York City. We look forward to seeing you then. We thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further detail on our third quarter financial results.","Jeff Schwaneke ","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Earlier this morning, we reported strong third-quarter 2017 results, with both top and bottom line growth. Total revenues were $11.9 billion and increased to 10% over the third quarter of 2016 and GAAP diluted EPS was $1.16.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.35 this quarter compared to $1.12 last year, representing 21% year-over-year growth. As a reminder, adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the amortization of the acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related expenses.","Additionally, for the third quarter of 2017, adjusted diluted EPS excludes additional expense of $0.03 per diluted share associated with the Penn Treaty guaranty assessment. During the third quarter, we received updated information from the California Guaranty Association regarding our share of the assessment.","Let me provide some of the performance highlights for the quarter. Total revenues grew by $1.1 billion year-over-year, primarily as a result of growth in the health insurance marketplace business, the expansion of the Missouri contract in May of 2017, a full quarter of business expansions in Texas, and the startup of our Nebraska health plan on January 1, 2017.","This growth was partially offset by the one-year moratorium of the health insurer fee, lower membership in the commercial business in California as a result of improvement actions taken last year, and lower revenue in Georgia, driven by the addition of a fourth competitor in July 2017.","Moving on to HBR, our health benefits ratio was 88% in the third quarter this year compared to 87% in last year's third quarter and 86.3% in the second quarter. The increase year-over-year is primarily driven by new or expanded markets, which initially operate at a higher HBR, an increase in higher acuity membership year-over-year, and a premium rate reduction in our Medicaid expansion business in California effective July 2017.","Sequentially, the 170-basis point increase from the second quarter is primarily attributable to the favorable risk adjustment in our marketplace business recorded in the second quarter of 2017, the California Medicaid expansion premium rate reduction previously mentioned and normal seasonality of the business.","Turning to our 2017 marketplace business. For the third quarter and nine months ended, the marketplace business continues to perform in line with expectations. We have provided disclosure in our press release and other filings this morning with respect to the CSRs for 2017.","If the federal government does not pay the CSRs in the fourth quarter, we expect the lack of those payments could reduce our diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter and full year 2017 by $0.07 to $0.12 per diluted share.","This estimate primarily represents states where we are projecting receivable positions on CSRs by the end of the year. For the majority of our states, we have received CSR payments through the third quarter that represent our full year CSR expectations. And as a result, do not believe we have exposure associated with those states.","As there is still a lot to play out with respect to CSRs in the fourth quarter, including court cases and potential legislative actions, we have not included the defunding of CSRs in our updated guidance announced today.","Moving on, our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 8.9% in the third quarter this year compared to 9.1% last year and 9.3% in the second quarter of 2017. ","The decrease in the ratio as compared to the prior-year is primarily due to the leveraging of expenses over a higher revenue base. The decrease sequentially is a result of higher incentive compensation expense recorded in the second quarter as a result of higher earnings.","Additionally, during the quarter, we incurred $0.12 of business expansion costs. Due to the open enrollment period for both the Medicare and marketplace business, we expect the fourth quarter adjusted SG&A ratio to be in excess of 10.5%.","Interest expense was $65 million in the third quarter compared to $57 million in the third quarter of 2016 and $62 million in the second quarter of 2017. The increase year-over-year is due to the increase in senior notes over 2016.","Our effective income tax rate was 38.3% in the third quarter of 2017. The lower tax rate compared to the prior-year is due to the one-year moratorium of the health insurer fee.","Now, on to the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled $9.9 billion at quarter-end, including $308 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.","Debt on September 30 was $4.7 billion, including a $150 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 41.2%, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note, compared to 43.7% at last year-end and 42.1% at the end of the second quarter 2017.","We are pleased with the continued deleveraging of the company and continue to focus on returning our debt to capital ratio to the mid to high 30% range.","Our medical claims liability totaled $4.3 billion at September 30 and represents 42 days in claims payable compared to 40 days last quarter. The increase in days in claims payable is due to the timing of payments at quarter-end and the impact of new business. ","Cash flow provided by operations was $97 million in the third quarter. Operating cash flows for the third quarter were affected by the 2016 marketplace risk adjustment payment of $437 million paid during the quarter.","Next, I would like to provide an update on the Fidelis transaction. As Michael mentioned, we have received early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and continue to work on the remaining regulatory approvals.","We continue to believe the transaction will close in the first quarter and plan to fund the transaction with approximately $2.3 billion of equity and $1.6 billion of debt. The timing of the financing is subject to market conditions.","Lastly, turning to guidance, we have increased our annual total revenue guidance for the performance in the third quarter and additional revenue of approximately $700 million that is expected in the fourth quarter from pass-through payments, primarily in California.","We do not anticipate the same level of these pass-through payments in 2018 as the state is contemplating changing their process for these types of payments.","We have adjusted our GAAP and diluted earnings per share guidance for several items, including the performance for the third quarter 2017, an increase in merger-related costs from $0.02 to $0.03 per diluted share to $0.07 to $0.09 per diluted share, reflecting additional costs associated with the Fidelis transaction we expect to incur in 2017, and an increase in business expansion costs from $0.42 to $0.47 to $0.46 to $0.51 associated with additional marketing and membership outreach efforts as a result of the decrease in spending on these programs at the federal level.","The midpoint of our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance has been increased based on the strong third-quarter performance, partially offset by the increase in business expansion costs noted previously.","In summary, our updated full-year 2017 guidance is as follows. Total revenues between $47.4 billion and $48.2 billion, an HBR ratio of 87% to 87.4%, SG&A expense ratio of 9.4% to 9.8%, adjusted SG&A expense ratio of 9.3% to 9.7%, GAAP earnings per share $4.04 to $4.18, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.86 to $5.04, an effective tax rate between 39% and 41% and diluted shares outstanding between 176.3 million and 177.3 million shares.","While there is a lot of noise in the market, we continue to focus on the fundamentals in the business and we are pleased with the third quarter results. The strong third-quarter results provide operating momentum heading into 2018.","That concludes my remarks. And, operator, you may now open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to follow up on, I guess, maybe that last point about the revenue guidance, including the pass-through payments for California. I just want to make sure that that number is basically kind of a zero-margin revenue adjustment. Just trying to think if there's a headwind from that from next year.","Jeff Schwaneke","No, no. It will be in premium tax revenue and premium tax expense in our pass-through line. So, it's a zero.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, great. And then, as far as the commentary around the star ratings, it sounds like you're thinking that basically, one way or another, either through an appeal or through mitigation efforts, you would not expect there to be a stars headwind in 2019. Is that the right way to think about it?","Michael Neidorff","I think that's \u2013 we do anticipate the appeal. I think there are some good reasons to appeal. And at the end, there are ways to mitigate the impact of the finance. And do you want to add to that, Jesse?","Jesse Hunter","No, Kevin. There's certainly some precedent with respect to contract migrations and related activities from other plans. The legacy Health Net organization is experiencing that within California. So, we're familiar with that approach. And I think, by the combination of the appeal process and other mitigation activities, which we can control, we think that this is a manageable risk for 2019.","Michael Neidorff","[indiscernible] launching the new plans in 2018 in the expansion areas will not be impacted in that first year.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, great. And then, just maybe last question, as far the exchanges go, it sounds like you're saying that you do not expect the CSRs to be a headwind at all to 2018 profit targets. Is that right?","Michael Neidorff","That's right. I think we have the premium adjustment tax. And so, they now offset it and we'll have the same plan as the CSRs.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. I wanted to go a little bit deeper on the exchange performance. So, initially, when you set margins for 2017, it was 150 basis points conservatism or about $0.20 EPS. Then you outperformed about $0.16 in the first half and took the remaining $0.04 out of guidance for conservatism buffers. So, it sounded like you were back to expecting a 5% margin for 2017. Am I thinking about that right? Are you still expecting 5%? And how did 3Q exchange performance compare to those expectations?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah. This is Jeff. First, on the third quarter, you have to realize there's some seasonality in the exchange business. So, the profit is more, I would say, front-end loaded because the design of the products more towards the commercial-type product.","And I think your math is correct on the conservatism \u2013 original conservatism. So, yeah, I think our expectations for the performance for the year that it's going to be at the high-end of the range.","Sarah James","Got it. And can you walk us through some of the headwinds and tailwinds you expect to impact sequential progression of the fourth quarter MLR? Specifically, I'm thinking about potential for hurricanes or flood-related issues to change seasonal progression or asthma in Texas, the heightened flu season that we've seen in the southern hemisphere, how you guys approached flu expectations this year, and, I guess, if there's any offsets for medical management and or some high acuity contracts that you're making changes and that could be a positive influence in the fourth quarter.","Michael Neidorff","Yeah, I'll start it off. As it relates to floods and hurricanes, tell us when and where they're going to hit and I can \u2013 something of a guess and it will still be a guess because look what happened in Florida and elsewhere, minimal impact.","Because the flu \u2013 we're anticipating normal flu season. And that says that we've booked the necessary expense for what would be a normal flu season. If it is milder or lighter, we'd be in a better position to give you insights on that in the fourth quarter earnings. So, it's kind of business as usual. We see \u2013 we have to plan on a normalized fourth quarter without those contingencies. And if they develop, we'll kind of deal with those as we always have at that point in time. I'm not sure how much that helps, but I'm trying.","Sarah James","That's helpful. And just, any good guys on the fourth quarter as we think through MLR \u2013 so, you had flagged in the third quarter, pressure on MLR from some of the new high acuity contracts. So, as we think through your medical management process, is there any good guys coming on those new contracts?","Michael Neidorff","Jeff, do you want to\u2026?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah. I will tell you, the medical management process is a continuous process. It's going on all the time. The only thing I would say is that if you kind of look at the seasonality of the business, if you kind of look at last year's HBRs, I think November tends to be a pretty good month for us and it just depends on how the calendar falls. But there is some seasonality to the business between the quarters and that's what I would point to. ","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg","Good morning. I was just hoping to get a clarification on the way you guys are thinking about the CSR impact. Did I understand you correctly that in states where you're currently in a payable position, all things being equal, even if you're in a payable position at the end of the year, you'll keep that money or is that not what you tried to imply?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, I think what \u2013 you're right. If you look at our filings, we are in a net payable position. And I think what you have to understand is that the regulations provide for an annual reconciliation. So, what we're saying is that in the majority of our states, our payable position as of the end of the third quarter is large enough that we don't really need any CSR payments in those states for the rest of the year. So, only in states where we are projecting a receivable position would we have exposure. And that's what the $0.07 to $0.12 represents.","Chris Rigg","Great. And then, just a follow-up on one of the prior questions with regard to the fourth quarter, it looks, when we back into it, about flattish to maybe even down a little bit sequentially. And I heard your comments about November. But is the seasonality mostly in the Medicaid business and you do expect the health insurance exchange enrollees to see a spike up in the fourth quarter? Just want to better understand how you think about the MCR in Q4. Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah. Again, I think I'd point you to last year as far as a relative comparison on the HBR. I think if you look at last year, we did have a lower HBR in the fourth quarter than we did in the third quarter, so there is seasonality there. And that would be business outside of the exchange because the exchange, the fourth quarter is the highest MLR of the year.","Chris Rigg","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. ","Lance Wilkes","A couple of questions on the medical cost trend in pricing. Can you just walk through, for the traditional Medicaid programs, for the higher acuity programs in public exchange, what you're seeing as far as medical cost trend and utilization specifically?","Jeff Schwaneke","Well, are you specifically talking about what's priced in? There's a big difference in pricing on the Medicaid and LTSS side. Those are primarily priced by the states using historical cost data versus the exchange business, which is more of a premium bid and more prospective. So, there's a differential there. And I would say, consistent with what we've said in the past, it's low single-digit cost trends on the Medicaid side and a little bit higher in the exchange side. It's more of a commercial product.","Lance Wilkes","Got you. And where I was going with it is on the higher acuity side, especially with the newer contracts, are you seeing kind of higher-than-expected utilization relative to, obviously, the premiums and is that consistent with your expectations and how long does it normally take for that utilization to kind of come back into line with maybe a more seasoned book of business?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah, two things just to make clear. And, generally, in the higher acuity business, they are rated at a higher MLR. So, when we talk about the impact on the consolidated MLR, it's really a mix issue, meaning if we have more higher acuity business, it's underwritten into the low 90s versus more exchange business, which is a lot lower in HBR.","I would say a lot of the programs that you enter into initially have continuity of care periods, where we are not allowed to effectively apply all of our medical management procedures. Those can range from three months to six months. And then after that, we are able to apply our full tools. But nothing outside of what we have experienced in the past.","Michael Neidorff","I think when you look at it, we've always said we book a higher MLR until you get the actual experience. And then, two, we've always said plan on three, four quarters for normalization. And that's just a general rule that one can follow when looking at it.","Lance Wilkes","And just the last one, what was the impact of the California Medicaid expansion rate reduction relative to the overall change in HBR kind of year-over-year?","Jeff Schwaneke","So, we mentioned \u2013 I think we mentioned \u2013 well, year-over-year \u2013 I'll just do sequential. From Q2 to Q3, there's 170 basis points. I would say between the risk adjustment recorded in Q2 and the rate decrease in California, that's about half of that, that movement. The rest is really seasonality in the business.","Lance Wilkes","That's great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Matt Borsch","Thanks. Good morning. Just on the \u2013 I'm sorry, can you hear me? ","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah, yeah. ","Matt Borsch","Okay, I'm sorry. On the exchanges, I realize that your member mix has stayed pretty stable at about 9% receiving subsidies. Can you just drill down a little bit into that, in the sense of, do you have any numbers that you can share about what percentage of those are below 250% of the federal poverty level? Or anything like that relative to how much subsidy they're getting?","Michael Neidorff","I don't know that we have that specific available, but we've kind of said it's consistently at the 90% of our population who receive subsidies. It runs the gamut, but it's probably a pretty normalized curve.","Matt Borsch","I guess what I'm getting at is, I'm wondering \u2013 clearly, you've had a pretty targeted approach with targeted \u2013 mostly is a byproduct of the way that you build your network, so that it's sort of a near Medicaid population. But is that \u2013 is that going to change as you go into 2018 and we have fewer health plan or offerings relative to what Centene's got out there? And then, if it does change, obviously, there's the risk that partially subsidized or unsubsidized members may be heavily skewed to those who need immediate care?","Michael Neidorff","I don't think so, Matt. I think about Maricopa County last year took over the whole county and state pretty consistent. So, we see no sign when you see a change because of the change in the providers available. And so, I think don't so. We've not historically seen any of that and we have no indications at this point.","Matt Borsch","Sorry. I've just got one more sort of granular question. If you directionally \u2013 can you tell us, in Maricopa, did you see then a higher percentage of unsubsidized in that population, if you can measure that, as a result of being the only carrier left in that county?","Michael Neidorff","Well, if there was any, it was negligible. It was not really worthy of comment, Matt. ","Matt Borsch","Okay, okay. Let me just ask one more, if I could, on a different \u2013 can you tell us you just directionally what sort headwinds and tailwinds you're expecting at this point going into 2018?","Michael Neidorff","Well, we're going to give guidance on December 18. He will have a good sense of the population mix at that point, much better sense. ","Matt Borsch","Okay, okay.","Michael Neidorff","With the growth we're anticipating and Fidelis coming in, hopefully, in the first quarter as planned, I think you can expect us to just to continue the kind of momentum you've seen from us historically.","Matt Borsch","Great. All right, thank you. ","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Hi, thanks. I was hoping you could go back to the MLR question for a minute and talk about the part of the MLR change that was mix related when we look year-over-year. So, there was 100 basis point increase year-over-year. So, how much was mix related versus how much was the rate cut?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah. I'm not going to quantify those two for you, Pete. So, 100 basis points is, on a year-over-year basis \u2013 I'm not going to bifurcate, is what I would say. ","Peter Costa","Okay. And then a second question if you don't mind. Seems like I had nothing on the first one. Can you explain how the Maryland physicians involved contract affected service revenues and cost of services and SG&A in the quarter? And then, if that wasn't part of the change in terms of the lower cost of services, can you explain why cost of services was so much lower this quarter?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah. On the cost of services side, specifically, we saw favorable performance in the fed services contract, behavioral health and also you mentioned the startup of the Maryland contract which \u2013 those carry higher operating margins, and also the performance of our home health business. ","On the federal services side, there was some performance incentives under the current contract, which played out very well, and the performance of the shared savings programs in the home health business were good as well.","Peter Costa","So, you wouldn't expect that to continue into the fourth quarter? ","Jeff Schwaneke","I would quite put them on an annual basis, for example. On the home health business, those are really annual reconciliations. So, I would say, in the fourth quarter, probably not to that magnitude, but on an annual basis, I would say it's all inclusive.","Peter Costa","Okay, thank.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Halper with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Steven Halper","So, when you think about the impact of the CSRs, assuming they're not paid next year, is it \u2013 and recognizing that you put out rates for your 2018 reflecting potential non-payment, are you able to sort of understand what happens from a demand side? ","Asked another way, what do you think membership \u2013 what do you think the membership trend is for 2018, given the substantial increase in premiums?","Michael Neidorff","Well, I think business as usual. I'll have Jesse add here in a minute, but from the perspective of the end-user, they are going to see the rates, they are going to see the subsidies and there will be no change visible to them. Jesse, do you want to add?","Jesse Hunter","Yes. A couple of things. One, so with respect to our population, in particular, obviously, we already have a targeted subsidized population. We've got a book of million people across the country. So, one of the things we are very focused on is continuity of coverage for those individuals and consistency in our plan design for retention purposes. So, we're very focused on that on a year-over-year basis. So, we think any kind of movement, if you will, on our end will be mitigated based on the combination of those things. ","But we've done a lot of scenarios, as you would expect, with respect to 2018. I think we're comfortable saying at this point, we view 2018 as a growth year for marketplace and we maintain our ability to operate within our targeted profit margins.","Steven Halper","Great. That's very helpful. Thank you. ","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Windley with Jeffries. Please go ahead. ","Dave Windley","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to shift to Fidelis, what low hanging fruit, in light of the fact that you're looking at medical costs specifically for your synergy achievement, where are the low hanging fruit items there and how long should we expect it to take for you to rollout your case management and clinical management programs into Fidelis?","Michael Neidorff","I think when you look at it, it covers the gamut of our TruCare and all the programs into the integration process now. They're analyzing what they can use and establishing priorities for implementing it. And we have to look at the interface with [indiscernible] for those kinds of things you're looking at.","And I think we indicated, in the second full year, you'll see low double-digit accretion from it and most of that's medical management. So, it's very successful opportunity.","Dave Windley","Okay. And shifting, a follow-up then on a different topic. In California, you've highlighted already a couple of times that you took some rate actions to improve margin in the commercial book. It looks like if I extract the growth in individual from your commercial numbers, it looks like membership is down 116,000 members year-over-year. ","I guess I'd be curious about your views on the efficacy of the actions that you took. Have they brought margin to your expected level? Is there still upside room going forward? And would you expect there to be still some membership sensitivity there as you take those actions?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah, this is Jeff. What I would say is that, yes, they have. Those actions have been effectively, specifically on the small group side. Those actions have been very effective. It's probably operating where we would expect it to operate.","On the large group side, there is probably more opportunity for margin expansion. But, really, what we've done is kind of reestablish the baseline of membership and then we're going to try to grow from there. So, I think that's what's most important. And you're right, on a decline, it's not right in the ballpark there.","Dave Windley","Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christine Arnold with Cowen. Please go ahead. ","Christine Arnold","Hi there. Fidelis, I know that you put in the assumption that CSRs wouldn't be paid out. Can I assume that they bid similarly assuming CSRs wouldn't be paid out? And then also on individual, can give us a sense for the enrollment you might be thinking about next year, given who you've seen leave versus stay? And were you able to build in things in the executive orders, like the skinny short-term plans, the low enrollment time, lower money spent to attract people in? Was that built into your bids? Or was there something surprising that could come from the executive orders that we should be thinking about? Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","I'll handle the first part. On the no CSRs\/Fidelis, that is correct. They did have rates that [indiscernible] assuming no CSRs and a lot of questions there.","So, on the second piece \u2013 what was the \u2013 what was your second question right after the CSR?","Christine Arnold","Talk about individual enrollment next year, given who has paid, who left, recognizing that we don't have access until November 1.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah, we're not going to get into any specific enrollment projections here. So, more of that will come on investor day in December.","Christine Arnold","And then, on your bid strategy, I understand that you were thinking about CSRs. You rightly built them into bids for worst-case scenario. But what about the short-term plans coming in, potentially skimming healthy risk, the lower open enrollment period, them spending less and all the other stuff they're doing to kind of sabotage the risk pool? Were you able to anticipate that and build all of that in or how do we think about that?","Jesse Hunter","Christine, this is Jesse. I think the executive orders are what capture most of the things that you're talking about there. So, as you look at the specifics there, the starting point is really asking the various kind of relevant agencies to come up with their plans within the next 60 to 90 days. So, there is not a level of specificity in those plans to being effective, certainly for the beginning kind of open enrollment and the beginning of 2018.","So, at this point, we're really thinking about those as 2019, in fact.","Michael Neidorff","I think there is three different regulatory agencies involved in establishing [indiscernible]. It has a ways to play out, Christine.","Christine Arnold","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Good morning, guys.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Josh Raskin","So, the first question, just taking a step back on all of this is, as you think about 2018 and assuming Fidelis closes early in the year, you're approaching a run rate, let's call it, almost $60 billion in revenues, you'll have the debt-to-CapEx of the deal below 40%. And so, as you think about sort of that change sort of from where you were before Health Net to sort of where you are after Fidelis, what are some of the new advantages that that size brings? And then, what areas of investment are you most excited about, maybe that you haven't been able to do in the past due to size?","Michael Neidorff","I think Health Net, as we had talked about at this time, that gave us the critical mass that we look for to bringing down the debt-to-cap. Debt-to-cap was higher only because of the stock price at that point. So, from a cash flow and everything else standpoint, nothing really changed.","[indiscernible] the fourth large state [indiscernible] this is the second largest in the country. And it's growing and they have aligned capabilities. So, we see being in there, it just gives us \u2013 it improves the buying leverage in various things that we do. So, it's \u2013 I don't know that we have a lot more capabilities than we had before. We have a very strong balance sheet coming out of this. We've always been balance sheet managers. And it puts us in a position when we see some technology companies and others of that nature that we are interested in, we're in a strong position to take the actions that make sense.","Josh Raskin","Great. Got it, Michael. And then, I get the second question, a little bit related. As you know, Fidelis is one of the larger Medicaid deals we've seen. I guess, not just Medicaid deals, but one of the larger deals we've seen for a little while, at least in terms of revenues, are there other opportunities? As you guys were going through your analysis of the deal, do you think there's other opportunities of similar size?","And then, I'm curious in what's the seller's motivation now. Why do you think a seller would be interested today?","Michael Neidorff","Well, I think you have to look at \u2013 I think there is a couple of things. One \u2013 I'm not going to go into [indiscernible] that's competitive. You understand that. But I think what you're going to see in sellers is that you need the critical mass that we've now achieved as a minimum to be able to afford the investments in technology. We're spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get the kind of medical management and technology systems that we need. So, that's a motivation.","The Fidelis one, the church saw an opportunity to monetize this asset and still put it into a foundation and be able to continue the charity work and the things that they'd like to. So, I think it was a \u2013 they also realized, as we've talked throughout, the efficiencies we're going to get from the medical management that they also were confronting huge investments and probably, in some cases, beyond what a company even with $10 billion in revenue can do at this point in time.","So, it goes back to when we did the Health Net. We talked about the need to have critical mass to be able to build on.","Josh Raskin","Got you. Okay. Thanks, Michael.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. ","Michael Newshel","Thanks. Good morning. So, how are you thinking about the risk from expiration of CHIP funding? Do you think any of your states could actually move to restrict enrollment if the reauthorization slips further to, like, year-end or later or do you think there's enough unspent funds or other stopgap measures to last until Congress finally actually passes that?","Michael Neidorff","Well, I think \u2013 I'll take the glass is half full. I think that's just going to be an additional motivation for Congress to act. The CHIP has been successful and I'm not sure anybody really wants to sort of now taking funding away from disadvantaged youth. We're talking about vulnerable populations, of vulnerable youth. So, I'd say that I think the need to restore the CHIP funding will give them vehicles to look at the total impact they're having on the \u2013 that Congress would take a total look at the impact they're having on vulnerable populations. So, I see it as giving us some upside.","Michael Newshel","Got it. Can you actually break out how many CHIP lives you have out of that kind of CHIP category?","Michael Neidorff","Do you have that handy? 400,000.","Michael Newshel","400,000?","Michael Neidorff","200,000.","Michael Newshel","200,000. All right, great. Great, got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. ","Zack Sopcak","Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. I just wanted to follow up on the additional $0.04 business expansion costs. And just clarify, is the bigger issue with that the shortened open enrollment period or just the lack of dollars being spent by the federal government?","And then, should we think about, is that a one-time type expense to be prepared for this or is there something where if we continue with a lack of funding, shortened season could bring on additional expenses in future years?","Michael Neidorff","I think when we saw \u2013 we anticipated what happened there. You have to think about \u2013 we knew that we could do direct enrollment. So, you start to put together the program and the training, if you will, to take those calls. We started doing the direct marketing, all the things one does when one is building a business.","So, we have been doing ongoing evaluations of general satisfaction. We know it's high and Jesse might add to some of the [indiscernible] we have a strong business. We want to protect it and we believe we're going to grow it through these kinds of activities. We might give a sense of what we're doing and how we're [indiscernible] that incremental funding to offset some of the government spending that got cut back.","Jesse Hunter","Right. So, we \u2013 obviously, we're ramping up our investment in the fourth quarter. So, I think it's a combination of the two things that you had referenced \u2013 the shortened open enrollment period, all of which is in 2017 for 2018, as well as the reduced funding. So, we're obviously taking a very targeted approach. And we've seen very high engagement from our marketplace members on our Ambetter products. So, that's something that we really try to take advantage of throughout the course of the year. So, this is not something we're just initiating now. We've had a number of campaigns on all fronts. So, TV, print, direct kind of engagement, digital, all the things that you would anticipate. And we had good kind of predation with respect to what we did last year. So, what we're doing is we're already leveraging that success and expanding it with a focus on our population and we expect similarly positive results for next year.","Zack Sopcak","Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gary Taylor with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. I just had a couple. I'm not sure I caught quite, Michael, the complete discussion about the star ratings. Maybe in particular, what is your outlook for potentially cross walking that to another star rating, given the success Humana and others have had in mitigating rating pressure with [indiscernible].","Michael Neidorff","I think that's one of the techniques one will use [indiscernible]. The first course of action, of course, is the appeal. I think there's a good [indiscernible]. Add to that, then you start looking at the cross walking and [indiscernible] done to mitigate the impact of it. It's kind of a standard procedure when we do.","Gary Taylor","Okay. Just wanted to make sure you weren't ruling that out. ","Michael Neidorff","You probably know this by now. We don't rule anything out [indiscernible].","Gary Taylor","Yes. I appreciate that. Just wanted to clarify. And then a last quick one for Jeff. When we think about the marketplace plans, generally, I think we'd be expecting MLRs north of 100 for 4Q and that's just the seasonality in those plans. Can you give us a ballpark on 3Q? Are exchanges still making money in the 3Q? Are we moving closer to break even and then moving to that seasonal loss in the fourth quarter? ","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah. They are still making. I think your \u2013 you mentioned the 100%. It's not that high in the fourth quarter. But I would say that the bulk of the profitability is made in the first three quarters. Absolutely.","Gary Taylor","And is the \u2013 I know your enrollment almost has doubled year-over-year. But is the actual MLR in the exchange business \u2013 third quarter of 2017 versus third quarter of 2016, is that similar, materially higher or lower? ","Jeff Schwaneke","I think they're relatively similar. They may be a little bit higher in this quarter, but not much. Year-over-year, that is.","Gary Taylor","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. Just want to come back on a couple of things. First, the MLR implied in the fourth quarter. Just some back-of-the-envelope math, I'm getting to about 86.5% give or take in terms of kind of the implied EPS in terms of what you'd have to do on MLR. Is that a ballpark [indiscernible]?","Jeff Schwaneke","Well, obviously, you are backing into it. So, you're relatively close. To get to the full year, where we are at full year \u2013","Michael Neidorff","Yes.","Jeff Schwaneke","There's only one quarter to go, right? So\u2026","Justin Lake","Okay. So, that declines by about 150 bps sequentially. And I'm just thinking about the drivers there. I know it declined a little bit sequentially last year, but there was a benefit last year I think from California true-up on Medicaid expansion. And this year, instead, you're dealing with a pretty large rate cut. And then, in addition, you're much bigger in the expansion side, which I think is perhaps higher sequential MLRs. So, that would be a headwind. So, I'm just thinking about, what are the offsets to those two kind of points that I mentioned there, that will drive that kind of sequential decline?","Jeff Schwaneke","I think it's going to be normal seasonality in the business. I mentioned before that November is usually \u2013 I think I've said this historically. November is usually one of the best months of the year for the Medicaid business, which continues to be the majority of our business. So, usually, June and November are two very good months in the Medicaid side for the year. Those are the two best months.","Justin Lake","Okay, great. And then, on the specialty side, just anything else you can kind of parse out in terms of \u2013 it was just an incredibly strong quarter from a gross profit perspective at least. What should we think about for the contribution to that specialty business in Q4 as well?","Jeff Schwaneke","I think I had mentioned a little bit earlier that I wouldn't expect the fourth quarter to be as profitable as the third because some of these programs, specifically in the home health business, those are reconciled and announced annually, roughly at the same time in the third quarter. So, I think on annual basis, it's much more in line with our expectations. So, I guess, that would be my thoughts.","Justin Lake","Yeah. I guess I was just looking for a little more specificity in terms of \u2013 is it still closer to the Q3 performance or closer to Q1, Q2 performance?","Jeff Schwaneke","I would say that it's probably closer to the annual performance, if you look at the full year. Yeah, I think the fourth quarter is going to more in line with what you would expect on a full year basis.","Justin Lake","Got it. And just lastly, on CSRs, clearly, from your 10-K disclosure and your discussion today, you think the \u2013 that you'll be able to reconcile through the end of the year on that payable, on the CSRs. Can you just tell us, has the government made that very clear that the reconciliation will be as of 12\/31 or is that just your working assumption?","Jeff Schwaneke","I think that's the federal law. So, if you actually read the Code of Federal Regulations around these programs \u2013 this isn't just CSRs by the way. It's risk adjustment. It was all of the 3R programs. Those regulations establish a specific criteria and that's what we're basing that conclusion on. ","Justin Lake","Got it. Thanks for all the color, guys.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Michael Baker","Yeah, thanks a lot. Just wanted to get your perspective on the Massachusetts waiver, particularly as it related to their request for more active formulary management in Medicaid. As you speak with other states, is this something being closely watched, so that if the government does agree to it, there will be others that will join in? Are people taking more of a wait-and-see approach? Just trying to get a general sense on that particular dynamic.","Michael Neidorff","In the context I've put out there, I haven't seen where \u2013 and if you guys are looking at Massachusetts as an example for that type of thing, it's an unusual market. There's more doctors in Massachusetts almost than there are patients. So, it's a very unusual market and I see no indication where they are going to be a trendsetter on that. ","Michael Baker","Thanks for the update.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead. ","Ana Gupte","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. So, following again on the exchange margins, I think I'm estimating you're at the upper end of your 4% to 6% range. And then I go back to the true-up that happened in July, I think it came out roughly $200 million better than expected. And I'm just trying to get a sense for \u2013 as you're monitoring this on a go-forward basis, have you any data points from weekly for this year and then for 2018? Is the methodology likely to change? Or as you think about the interface with the potential defunding of CSRs and possibly mix shifting of healthier folks to more barebones plans with this executive order, how predictable do you think the risk adjusters are for the rest of 2017 and, to the extent, they're contributing a fairly big percentage of your margin for exchanges this year, into 2018?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah. I can handle the risk adjuster comment. We've had a very consistent methodology here on risk adjustment, which has proven to be very accurate. So, we consistently use that methodology and use information from the data aggregators on that. So, I think \u2013 I don't see any difference going forward.","Michael Neidorff","I think the only other thing that I would \u2013","Ana Gupte","Yeah, sorry.","Michael Neidorff","Just real quick, you had mentioned the potential impact of any short-term plans and the like and impact on the risk pool. So, I think, as we said before, we still need a lot more information with respect to what those are and when they would be effective before we can comment on any potential impact.","Ana Gupte","Okay, thanks. The second question was about Fidelis. And you're doing really well on improving margins. But as you think about the top line growth, where do you see the growth coming from and is this likely to be in line with your aspiration of low double-digit cross Medicaid expansion, which is leveling off now? Exchanges where there is potentially [indiscernible] that's the biggest driver. FIDA has been a weak program and you have LTSS. And then I think in Medicaid, they saw downgrade well on the rating from Star, 4 to 3.5.","Michael Neidorff","[indiscernible] we'll give guidance on the growth December [indiscernible]. A little bit of guidance on [indiscernible] because that can create the wrong image. And we saw the situation in Fidelis there and [indiscernible] as well.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yeah. I would just go back to, I think, what we mentioned on the call when we announced the Fidelis transaction is that we believe that was in line with our double-digit growth percentage on a going forward basis, and we believe that that was not going to change that.","Ana Gupte","And will you be appealing the decision, you and Fidelis on the star rating? Am I correct? I think that's what we observed. There was a downgrading for them in addition to Health Net.","Jesse Hunter","Our understanding is that they do not intend to appeal that, but similar to our situation, and every organization who is in the MA business, continual focus on improving kind of the fundamentals around star 4.","Ana Gupte","Okay. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Could you just give an update on the RFP pipeline? And in particular, what portion of it is higher acuity? And then, in general, how is the size of that looking and are states behaving as they had in the past given all the uncertainty with federal regulation?","Michael Neidorff","I think there's a \u2013 as you know, there is a robust pipeline coming up with Texas, Florida, large states that we typically have done well in [indiscernible] we're now continuing to do generally well. And [indiscernible] I think \u2013 I've not seen any indication where they are changing their approach to things. [indiscernible] that's when they need us more than ever because we're saving them a lot of money with higher outcomes. So, I don't see any material change there. You may have one [indiscernible] takes one action, but there will be a counteracting \u2013 and that's the benefit of having 28 states, soon 29 with Fidelis there. And [indiscernible] offset it. We've been tending to look at it across our whole book of business and we're comfortable with what the opportunities are there.","Lance Wilkes","And are you seeing more states that are looking at putting higher acuity populations out to RFP or initiating\u2026?","Michael Neidorff","I would say they're very encouraging. That's where we're talking to them all the time, trying to encourage them to do that. We have the systems and capabilities to manage that and that's where we've been the most good. So, we will be pushing at it every level. And it varies on \u2013 particularly around governor or Medicaid director, what their attitudes have been. So, I would say there's probably \u2013 for 2020, they'd want to include the higher acuity.","Lance Wilkes","Okay, thank you so much.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael Neidorff","I just want to thank you for your continued interest in Centene. We're pleased with this quarter. And as I emphasized, we have the momentum going into the fourth quarter, going into 2018. And look forward to seeing at our investor day.

Michael?","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining Centene\u2019s second quarter 2017 earnings call. During the course of this morning\u2019s call, we will discuss our second quarter financial results and provide update on Centene\u2019s markets and products. Additionally, we\u2019ll provide commentary around our understanding of the status of the Affordable Care Act.","I\u2019d like to begin with comments on the healthcare legislation landscape. It is a moving target with a long way to play out, but you know that. Centene\u2019s priority has always been to ensure this country\u2019s most vulnerable populations have access to high-quality affordable healthcare. We remain committed to working closely with federal and state regulators and policy makers to collaborate on actions needed to stabilize the market.","Whether or not, members of Congress believe a Medicaid design or a commercial design is the best way to deliver high-quality healthcare to low income individuals, Centene is the market leader in both platforms. We have the credibility as well as the experience to work with Congress on ways to address the challenges associated with the current law.","We believe some improvements that need to be included in any picture, eliminating the taxes, which will drive down premiums, maintaining CSRs or some similar mechanism to make coverage affordable for low income non-Medicaid eligible Mississippian\u2019s and reinsurance, which COB has estimated will result in significant premium reductions.","We believe, it is important for health plans to take some risk to ensure care continues to be managed appropriately. It is important to note, that every repeal and replace proposal in the House of Senate as well as the House Budget has included CSRs, as a necessary component to stabilize the marketplace. Republicans and Democrats are like have shown how [indiscernible] CSRs are to the stability of the marketplace.","At times, we can all get wrapped up in the political debate going on in Washington. However any intentional act to stop these CSR payments, there\u2019s not advanced debate on how to fix our healthcare delivery system. It only hurts the millions of Americans, who currently have affordable healthcare insurance in the marketplace.","The leadership in Washington bares a responsibility to ensure that it\u2019s not happen. In the meantime, we are focused on business fundamentals as evidence by another strong quarterly financial performance and positive operating momentum.","Now onto second quarter financials. We were please to report a strong second quarter marked by solid top and bottom line growth. Membership at quarter-end was 12.2 million individuals, representing an increase of approximately 790,000 recipients compared to the second quarter of 2016.","Total revenues increased 10% year-over-year to $12 billion, the HBR improved 30 basis points year-over-year to 86.3%. This was primarily attributable to growth in our insurance exchange business in 2017.","Lastly, we reported second quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.59 this includes a $0.17 benefit related to the 2016 risk adjustments reconciliation under the ACA. This compares to $1.29 reported in the same period last year, which included a $0.19 benefit related to the 2015 risk adjustment.","Jeff will provide further financial details including updated 2017 guidance. A quick comment on medicals cost. We continue to see as well as anticipate overall stable medical costs trends, consistent with our expectations in the low single-digits.","Moving onto markets and product updates. First, Medicaid, we were pleased to have grown our overall Medicaid growth by over 400,000 beneficiaries compared to same periods last year. Recent Medicaid state updates include, Missouri. In May, we commenced operations under Missouri statewide expansion of its Medicaid program.","Centene now provides healthcare services over 278,000 Medicaid recipients in all 114 counties in the state. This represents a sequential increase of over 172,000 members. State of Washington also in May, Centene successfully re-procuredits Apple Health contract in the North Central Region of the State. The new contract indicates behavioral health into the program as expected to commence in the first quarter of 2018.","Mississippi, in June, Centene successfully re-procured its contract to serve Medicaid recipients under the State MississippiCAN program. A new contract is expected to begin mid-year 2018. Georgia, in July, we commenced operation under a new statewide Medicaid contract in Georgia, this was a successful re-procurement of our previous contract with that state.","Nevada, also in July, we began providing healthcare services to Medicaid beneficiaries of all in the States, Medicaid managed care program, while this is initially a small market for Centene, it should continue to grow overtime with add marks Centene 28 states of operation.","Next in Centurion, in June, Centurion began operating under an expanded contract to provide correctional healthcare services to over 15,000 inmates in South Florida. We now provide services to over 85,000 inmates in the state. Centene currently serves over 150,000 inmates across eight states.","Now Medicare, at quarter-end, we served approximately 328,000 Medicare and Dual beneficiaries. As I have previously stated, we are applying a test-and-learn approach to our first year of Medicare Advantage operations in our core of Centene Medicaid states.","We are applying the insights we\u2019ve gain thus far this year, to Centene\u2019s 2018 Medicare Advantage Plans. Consistent with our overall strategy, we are focused on providing high-quality affordable Medicare Advantage products to low income beneficiaries. It is important to note, the low income Medicare opportunity across Centene\u2019s existing states is an excess of a $150 billion.","For 2018, we have file bids for new Medicare Advantage contracts in six markets as well as bids in additional markets focused on D-SNP products. These will be launched under Centene\u2019s new national Medicare Advantage going all well. They are eligible for a premium bonus under our four-star parent rating. This rating allows our work to be marketed as a high-quality Medicare Advantage program. Over the long-term, we expect our Medicare Advantage product to drive over 20% of our annual growth rate.","Next onto the Health Insurance marketplaces. At June 30, we served approximately 1.1 million exchange members. This represents a sequential decline of approximately 100,000 beneficiaries in line with our expectations. The key demographic of these members including age, gender, financial assistance and metal tier remain consistent. This highlights Centene\u2019s continued success in attracting and retaining our targeted customer segment. This has been done through effective sales, marketing and member engagement activities.","Our exchange business continues to perform well in 2017. We now have regions to believe, our margins will be at a high-end of our guidance range. As a result, we have removed the conservatism that was previously included in our 2017 financial guidance. Jeff will provide further detail on this topic.","For 2018, we intend to grow this profitable segment of our business. We remain focus on providing on high-quality affordable healthcare to low income individuals. Next year, we plan to enter Kansas, Missouri and Nevada, and expand our footprint in Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Ohio, Texas, and Washington. International, our international business continues to perform as expected and we\u2019re encouraged by its long-term growth prospects.","Lastly, Envolve, in July, our specialty solutions subsidiary Envolve began providing a comprehensive management services for approximately 200,000 Medicaid members of a health plan in Maryland.","Shifting gears to the rate outlook. We continue to expect 2017 net composite Medicaid rate adjustments of zero to 1%, consistent with the past few years.","In summary, we delivered another strong quarter and raise 2017 financial guidance. This was achieved, while increasing our investments in clinical opportunities as evidenced by the increase in our expected business development cost.","Headline annoys regarding repeal and replace efforts in Congress will posses. It is important to remember, despite political or industry distraction, the need for high-quality affordable healthcare remains constant.","In the past, we have demonstrated our ability and capacity to navigate industry changes to the benefit of our members, shareholders and government partners. As such, we continue to follow, our business as usual approach from an execution standpoint. We\u2019re a growth company and our pipeline of opportunity across all the lines of our business remains robust.","We are optimistic about our future and ability to extend Centene\u2019s leadership position in government sponsored healthcare. We thank you for your continued interest in Centene.","Jeff will now provide further details on our second quarter financial results.","Jeff Schwaneke","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Earlier this morning, we reported strong second quarter 2017 results with both top and bottom line growth. Total revenues were $12 billion, an increase of 10% over the second quarter 2016 and GAAP diluted earnings per share was a $1.44. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $1.59 compared to $1.29 last year.","We had strong performance across our products and markets during the quarter, with the marketplace business performing exceptionally well. The performance of Marketplace was driven by a pre-tax net benefit of $48 million or $0.17 per diluted share, associated with the reconciliation of the 2016 risk adjustment provisions under the ACA.","As a result of the strong second quarter performance, we have increased the midpoint of our GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance range by $0.18, while increasing our business expansion cost by $0.17 per diluted share at the midpoint to fund further growth in 2018.","Let me provide some of the performance highlights for the quarter. Total revenues grew by $1.1 billion year-over-year, primarily as a result of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, a full quarter of business expansions in 2016 in Texas and Louisiana. The expansion of the Missouri contract in May of 2017 and the start up of our Nebraska health plan on January 1, 2017.","This growth was partially offset by the one-year moratorium of the health insurer fee, lower specialty pharmacy revenue, and lower membership in the commercial business in California, as a result of margin improvement actions taken last year.","Sequentially, total revenues for the second quarter increased by $230 million from the first quarter of 2017. The increase was driven by favorable risk adjustment in our marketplace business, recorded in the second quarter of 2017, as well as the expansion of our contract in Missouri.","We expect total revenues to be lower in the third and fourth quarter compared to the second quarter of 2017, due to the addition of a competitor in Georgia, and the normal membership attrition on the marketplace business.","Moving on HBR, our health benefits ratio was 86.3% in the second quarter this year, compared to 86.6% in last year\u2019s second quarter, and 87.6% in the first quarter. The decrease year-over-year is primarily driven by the growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business which operates at a lower HBR.","Sequentially, the 130 basis point decrease in the first quarter is primarily attributable to the favorable risk adjustment in our marketplace business, recorded in the second quarter of 2017, and normal seasonality of the business in the first quarter, as a result of flu-related costs.","As I mentioned earlier, during the second quarter CMS release reconciliation information related to the risk adjustment provisions associated with the 2016 marketplace business. The reconciliation of the risk adjustment provisions for 2016 improved our results for the second quarter by approximately $0.17 per diluted share. This is after considering the risk-sharing contracts primarily in California, the risk corridor and the minimum MLR.","Turning to our 2017 marketplace business, the metal tiers enrolled demographics and profiles of our membership continues to be in line with our expectations. Additionally, the claims experience and the initial information we received in the second quarter from the data aggregators, associated with the 2017 risk adjustment estimates have provided additional comfort regarding our margin expectations for the year.","As a result, we have removed all of the initial $0.20 per diluted share of conservatism from our annual GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance. This includes $0.04 per diluted share that was related to the first quarter, $0.12 per diluted share related to the second quarter and the remaining $0.04 per diluted share related to the second half of 2017. We continue to utilize our consistent reserving methodology for the risk adjustment program, as we have done since the inception of the marketplace business.","Moving on our selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 9.3% in Q2 this year, excluding the Health Net merger costs compared to 9% last year, and 9.3% in the first quarter of 2017. The increase in the ratios compared the prior year is primarily due to the increase business expansion costs and higher variable compensation expense based on the performance of the business and the first half of 2017.","Interest expense was $62 million in the second quarter, compared to $52 million in the second quarter of 2016, and $62 million in the first quarter of 2017. The increase year-over-year is due to the increase in senior notes over 2016.","Our effective income tax rate was 40.1% in the second quarter at 2017. The lower tax rate compared to the prior year is due to the one-year moratorium of the health insurer fee.","Now on to the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled $10 billion at quarter-end, including $291 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.","Debt on June 30 was $4.7 billion, including $150 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 42.1%, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note compared to 43.7% last year-end and 43% at the end of the first quarter 2017.","Our medical claims liabilities totaled $4.2 billion at June 30, and represents 40 days in claims payable compared to 41 days last quarter. The decrease in the days in claims payable is due to the timing of payments associated with improved auto-adjudication rates on the legacy Health Net business. As we highlighted at our mid-year Investor Day, we have improved the auto-adjudication rates by over 10% since the fourth quarter of 2016.","Cash flow used in operations was $306 million in the second quarter. Operating cash flows for the second quarter was negatively affected by approximately $750 million of delayed payment, primarily from several our states as result of their fiscal year ends. We expect to receive the majority of these delayed payments by the end of July 2017.","Turning to guidance. We have adjusted our 2017 annual guidance to reflect the following items. The strong performance for the second quarter, an increase on our business expansion costs to $0.42 to $0.47 per diluted share reflecting the shortening of the open enrollment period for the Marketplace business, and additional investments and growth initiatives in Medicare Marketplace for 2018; and an increase in our 2017, margin expectations for the Marketplace business.","Our updated full-year 2017 guidance is as follows. Total revenues between $46.4 billion and $47.2 billion, an HBR ratio of 87% to 87.4%, SG&A expense ratio of 9.4% to 9.8%, adjusted SG&A expense ratio of 9.3% to 9.7%, GAAP earnings per share of $3.96 to $4.29, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.70 to $5.06, effective tax rate between 39% and 41%, and diluted shares outstanding between 176.3 million and 177.3 million.","The increase in the SG&A and the adjusted SG&A expansion ratio is due to the increase in business expansion costs, which we expect to occur primarily in the fourth quarter.","In summary, we were pleased with the second results and the operating momentum heading into the remainder of the year. That concludes my remarks.","And operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Gary Taylor","Thank you. I\u2019m just wonder, if you could go into a little more detail on the additional G&A spending, which I guess calculates up to all most a couple $100 million. Maybe just explain why the shorter open enrollment period derives some increase spending in a little more detail on those investments for 2018?","Michael Neidorff","I don\u2019t think is that much for Jeff?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I\u2019m not. I\u2019m not sure the math there on the couple $100 million. But ultimately, we are investing in further growth initiatives. The shortening of the enrollment period on there, is that you have costs that you encourage enroll members and that used to go up for a longer period in some of those costs would end up in the next fiscal year, but they\u2019ve shortened that cycle. So all those costs will end up in the fourth quarter of this year, and then we are making additional investments in the expansion states which Michael mentioned for exchange as well as Medicare.","Michael Neidorff","Medicare. And Medicare marketing is not in-expensive.","Gary Taylor","I did have a math error on my \u2013 you increase the G&A ratio by 20% to 30%, just had a math error there. But I appreciate the detail. Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. I\u2019m trying to\u2026","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Sarah James","Good morning. I\u2019m trying to bridge the guidance change here. If I take the prior guidance and in just for the hits for reconciliation, the outperformance in exchanges the carve in of conservatism, which I was estimating to be about $0.06 and then the SG&A headwind? I\u2019m still getting about another $0.27 benefit between where that math leads me to the current guidance. I\u2019m wondering, if there\u2019s some other improvements going on maybe on the Medicaid side, or if that data really is just even more outperformance to come on exchanges?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. Again, I\u2019m not certain of your math there. I understand that you\u2019re picking up the 25 or the change in the midpoint of G&A ratio, but that would assume that our guidance was at the midpoint initially. So but I follow your math with the outperformance of the second quarter, I think the way we\u2019ve laid out in the press release is the outperformance, we have the $0.17 on the exchange 2016 reconciliation, which is really offset by the additional investments that we have. So I think that\u2019s the rule for that that we\u2019ve done in the press release.","Sarah James","Got it. And you mentioned expanding into more bear accounting as for the exchanges. How do you get comfortable with the margin profile on that business, and are there any similarities between those markets in Arizona which seems to be performing well?","Michael Neidorff","I think, it\u2019s the same principle. I mean these are markets that were you say \u2013 you take result were involved in the Medicaid products and they spend in there. And so it\u2019s a \u2013 we have the networks in place, the medical management in place, and it\u2019s really success is a great year of our success is the medical management programs and our systems that allow us to do that effectively in serious. So I think, we\u2019re comfortable, we have it in the new counties, so and you pointed out, as we did in Maricopa, when that opened up last year.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from the Zack Sopcak with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Zack Sopcak","Hi, good morning. Thanks for the call.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Zack Sopcak","Congratulations on the quarter. Wanted to ask a question about drug trend for a second \u2013 and if there\u2019s anything you see that could impact cost this year or next year on such as Spinraza drug by Biogen?","Ken Yamaguchi","Hi, this is Ken Yamaguchi, the CMO. No. Spinraza exposure for us has been very, very low. The indications for that medication are also very, very tight. So at this point, we\u2019re watching it carefully but to hide. So at this point, we\u2019re watching it carefully but really our exposure has been low. And then we really haven\u2019t seen any drug trends that are concerning right now.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I don\u2019t \u2013 this is Jeff. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything outside of our expectations right now, what we\u2019re looking at.","Zack Sopcak","Okay, great. Thank you so much for the question.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Hey, good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Lance Wilkes","Want to hear little more color on pipeline in particular, the higher acuity populations and how you\u2019re seeing that pipeline develop. And then, are you seeing any slowdown or delay in pipeline as a result of clinical uncertainty?","Jesse Hunter","Yes, Lance. Jesse Hunter here. So the answer for your second question first. No. We are definitely not seeing a slowdown. We are quite actives on multiple fronts, have you seen by some recent announcements and reprocurements and I would say more to come there. And I think to your first question. We\u2019ve seen the \u2013 this trend initiate a number of years ago and if anything, I\u2019d say it\u2019s accelerating as you look at the impact that these programs are acuity, managed care programs have add on both cost and quality. So we continue to see that as a significant growth opportunity going forward.","Michael Neidorff","And my comment that I have for years commented that the higher acuity programs is where the states get the greatest benefits, our systems and medical management is really mature and you can expect the medical loss ratio to be higher, but the G&A the lower. So it\u2019s something that we\u2019re very comfortable with.","Lance Wilkes","Great. And on the higher acuity programs, can you just talk a little bit about your value proposition, especially with the breadth of specially programs that you\u2019ve got. And how that compares with some reveals in that space?","Michael Neidorff","I\u2019m going to let the others talk about their progress, we\u2019ve kind of focus on our assumption, you\u2019ve really understand that.","Lance Wilkes","Yes.","Michael Neidorff","But we have Casenet, we have a serious of programs that where \u2013 we saw it coming, which for a long time. And we we\u2019ve built the systems that predictive models, the case management, medical management, programs and systems to deliver effectively with it. Now, it\u2019s a not an accident that where the largest and long-term care. And I think, we\u2019ve continued rule that for the states recognize the capabilities there. So it\u2019s something that we anticipated for years and we go down as it\u2019s a very local type approach and that\u2019s something that has also serves us very well. Jesse, anything you want to add that.","Jesse Hunter","Yes. Just to Michael\u2019s last one around the local approach, we may not obviously been a hallmark of our net orientation how we serve these populations. I think particularly, on the higher acuity programs including LTSS, yes, these are not just medical programs. So you really have to understand the social determinates and the environmental factors and having a high touch local approach really is a differentiator for us there.","Lance Wilkes","Great, thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Great, thanks. Just want to a add couple questions on MA. You mentioned that some of the business expenditure costs related to the MA. Is that sign that you\u2019re going to try to push a little bit faster into Medicare Advantage in 2018 than you had previously been thinking?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I mean, I think those additional costs are representative of that. I mean I think, we had a targeted approach and I think we\u2019re comfortable with adding some extra dollars there. We did have a base line of costs in our original guidance. And I think we\u2019re just increasing those.","Michael Neidorff","I think Kevin, if you in call, we said, we viewed 2017 as a learning year when we were into it. So where we see expand in the states that we\u2019re in, as well as the six new markets that we\u2019re looking at a couple D-SNPs markets, we\u2019re adding. So now it\u2019s just time to put that learning to work and we\u2019re taking them in the same approach we did on the exchanges [indiscernible] it\u2019s not how fast but how well and as it continues to do well, then you start building momentum.","So it\u2019s not just what 2018 bears but 2019 in and out and we \u2013 at the time, we do the health plans we said that, we see going to the end of this decade and the next decade material growth out of the Medicare Advantage products.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, thanks. I think in the past you guys have said that, you expected MA in 2017 to be profitable as larger to existing California business. Is that still on track I assume, given it\u2019s...","Michael Neidorff","Yes. It is.","Kevin Fischbeck","And then as far as Health Net goes, you mentioned that DCPs were down, because even proven auto-adjudication is that largely now run rate? Or there still room for that to go? What should we expect DCPs to go from here?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, I think there still room for that to go and specifically, because we have done all the operational systems conversions. So the Centene platform has a higher auto-adjudication rate. And so I think there\u2019s more room to go on the legacy system. And I think there is additional room even further out in the future on after the system \u2013 post system conversion.","Michael Neidorff","And more, we\u2019re looking at February 2018 for that conversion at this point. Right?","Jeff Schwaneke","That\u2019s correct, Michael.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then I guess last question. So it\u2019s hopefully be lot of time ask about \u2013 I guess call it for California Health plan. Just want to make sure that that business continues to come in line with your expectations?","Michael Neidorff","I would say clearly within our expectations because we\u2019re very pleased with the integration is where it should be the synergies are being delivered. The team out there is incredibly strong, I think they\u2019re enjoying the business more that they have some of the systems support that we\u2019re given them, Casenet and other, so it\u2019s proving to be very well clever move.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Rigg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg","Good morning. Just wanted to get your view mid-year coming into 2017, people were concerned about a county like Maricopa for I think only insurer, I guess with six months on the above, how do you feel about the conceptually, when you\u2019re the only insurer to market. Does that make you feel more comfortable or less comfortable about that serving that population?","Michael Neidorff","Well, it\u2019s kind of a two hedged sort. One, we like it being the only one to whom we get the full population, some we get the sick, it\u2019s been well at the full mix. When is the second brand there, we get the benefits of showing, how good we are, by comparing the others. So this kind of mix but I have been full risk is consistent with sound insurance policy. So we\u2019re very comfortable with it.","Chris Rigg","Okay. And then just to come back to the higher SG&A outlook. I mean by my math the increase is about $0.40 of headwind. You\u2019ve talk about of $0.17 of incremental investment spending or business expansion costs. I know, we\u2019re all trying to get to sort of an exact number here, but the $0.23 Delta is that compensation expense. Are there something else in there? Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","I think, there some in the variable compensation category, because obviously, we did increase our guidance substantially. But in general, you\u2019re resuming that our internal forecast was at the midpoint. So if you notice, we did actually take the HBR range [Audio Dip] (36:17)-(36:23)","Chris Rigg","Great, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Dave Windley","I want to clarify, Jeff some comments you made in your prepared remarks about the taking the conservatism on the exchange a marketplace business, that was it was previously in there. You said $0.04 in 1Q, $0.12 in 2Q and $0.04 in the second half. Is that when you are taking those amounts into earnings? Or is that where they were mapped out to benefit you in guidance sort to be kind of guided in the guidance?","Jeff Schwaneke","Well. Actually there\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re not really taking them into earnings, right. Because it was \u2013 we took our \u2013 if you will, our forecast and added the conservatism on top of the forecast, so when we say that, we beat the expectations in the 2017 marketplace for this quarter by $0.12, that\u2019s effectively a piece of that original $0.20 of the conservatism.","Dave Windley","Right. Okay. And so the\u2026","Jeff Schwaneke","So I guess the way I look at has we originally had $0.20 of conservatism, when we talked everybody in December that\u2019s all out of it \u2013 it\u2019s all out now. We\u2019ve taken all that conservatism out of our current guidance.","Dave Windley","Yes, understood. So it\u2019s not so much that the exchanges were inline \u2013 and then inline in the second quarter and then you took the additional $0.12 out of the conservatism.","Jeff Schwaneke","I would say that the exchange performance was stronger than the numbers with the conservatism in. Right, we had better performance \u2013 we had better performance, I would say more inline with how the bids changed performed in 2016.","Dave Windley","Got it. And then follow question here on the risk adjustment. You had positive settlement impact of $0.17, for 2017 it sounds like you need to increase your payable, is that \u2013 am I thinking about that right, that those are moving in kind of opposite directions and was that based on a different set of assumptions for 2017 or different methodology in 2017, when you had applied in 2016.","Jeff Schwaneke","No, no. We didn\u2019t have to increase our payable. What I\u2019d say is, I guess are payables kind of consistent as it was in 2016. But obviously the business is grown. So it\u2019s going to be a larger dollar amount. So I guess what I would say is that the exchange performed kind of better than we anticipated with the conservatism and inline with 2016 and I think that\u2019s where it is.","Dave Windley","Okay. All right, thank you.","Michael Neidorff","I think I might just add a thing, that they\u2019ve done \u2013 they understand how it works and we\u2019ve booked the appropriate levels.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes. I would say, again my comment was we are using the same reserving methodology for risk adjustment that we have for the past three years.","Dave Windley","Okay.","Jeff Schwaneke","Exact state. Nothing is different there.","Dave Windley","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Can you explained to me little bit what you think the direction of your margins will be going forward, if you\u2019re at the high end of your prior margins on the exchange business. I think that was a 3% to 5% targeted margin. So with high end of that there. And then Medicare business is still sort of growing. And so I imagine, you\u2019re on the lower side, we\u2019re targeted margins there what you think your overall margins will go over the next few years.","Jeff Schwaneke","Hopefully. Yes, I mean obviously we\u2019re focused on improving and approving the margins on a going forward basis. But again, I think I mentioned this at our Investor Day, I think the largest driver of our margins going forward is going to be the business mix. So the exchange is at the higher end of the margins, the Medicaid\u2019s are little bit lower than that, there\u2019s obviously opportunity for additional interest income and investment income depending on what interest rates do. So I think we would like to see margin expansion in the future. But what\u2019s going to be driving that is how much Medicare and exchange in long-term care and it\u2019s a mix of contracts and business that we have that\u2019s going to drive \u2013 I would say the bottom line margin number.","Michael Neidorff","I think that would be growth that we anticipate have been demonstrating. You don\u2019t get \u2013you\u2019re not leveraging the overhead quite as much when you grow that [indiscernible] grow and so. But we expect it to expand.","Peter Costa","And then can you break that down by business line in terms of which direction you think the margins will go?","Michael Neidorff","I think that detail will be\u2026","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I\u2019ve think you highlighted for example Medicaid, we would not anticipate to operate long-term at the lower end of the margin range on that. But we\u2019re in investment node. So I think you\u2019re what you said earlier is probably what the expectations are.","Peter Costa","Okay, thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Fidel with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks, good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Scott Fidel","Just on the \u2013 have any update on, if there\u2019s been any developments just on that LTSS carve-out situation in California. I know you had put the billion dollar sort of placeholder on the 2018, but it sounded like that situation still a little fluid at the Investor Day.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I think it was in the governor\u2019s budget, the governor\u2019s budget was improved slight, I believe that\u2019s done, I think it\u2019s carved down.","Michael Neidorff","Chris, do you want to add to that?","Unidentified Company Representative","Sure. I just add one point of that, Michael, I think that there\u2019s just as it did get passed the governor\u2019s budget, but we continue to work with the counties in the state to look for ways to work together on the home support services.","Scott Fidel","Okay, got it. Then just on second question, just I know on the services that revenue is can be heavily sensitive to changes in the specialty business but looks like it was down around 10% year-over-year. So with that all just relating to the specialty biz and then how should, we think about I guess revenue growth in that business in the back half of the year.","Jeff Schwaneke","I can comment on initially on it\u2019s down in the specialty pharmacy business and it\u2019s a related to have see I think that\u2019s a macro trend. And then as far as growth going forward on Jesse if you want a comment on that.","Jesse Hunter","Yes. I think Scott one of thing that we seen, we have talked about a few times with the variability in that line has trended with this Jeff reference more of the macro Hep C trends. So I think we\u2019ve got it certainly a more stable point and we view that as a growth part of the business. So you should expect, see that going forward.","Michael Neidorff","I think as we look at the business, it\u2019s large \u2013 it\u2019s $46 billion and you going to have some product that are ups, some that are down, and so that we see is the benefit of the diversity that we have to continue to build into the business that Hep C might be down because of the trends, but there\u2019s other thing that will pick it up, and so we tend to manage at macro level of the overall trends in Centene, what will we expect it.","Scott Fidel","Got it, just one last quick numbers. One just on do you have where the Georgia lives ended up settling out in July with the fourth vendor coming on?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. We don\u2019t really comment on \u2013 I would say inner quarter membership. So but it was inline with our expectations.","Scott Fidel","Okay, thank you.","Michael Neidorff","We have the total we had a good quarter year-over-year growth in Medicaid. Go ahead, I am sorry. Operator?","Operator","I\u2019m sorry. The next question comes from Justin Lake from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Justin Lake","First, just kind of following-up on the last question, given the strength of the exchange margins, would you expect this is our reasonable run rate for this business going forward? Or would you expect good bids similar conservatism in 2018 that you did this year on exchanges?","Jeff Schwaneke","Let me \u2013 I think if you recall why we put the conservatism in is it really is a result of the presidential election. And so I mean I guess, I\u2019m not giving 2018 guidance down. But there\u2019s a lot of things that have to play out between now and December.","Justin Lake","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then you just in terms 2018 revenue outlook, I was hoping you might better give us some color on what kind of exchange membership growth was kind of built into that revenue outlook you gave us at the Investor Day. And can you tell us what percentage of your membership this year gets CSRs?","Michael Neidorff","I think, just I want to do, I want to be careful, we\u2019re not going to give specific guidance until December 15, I mean that\u2019s always been our policy in practice. So please be aware with us on that, we give in June we give the trend and the directional thing and we\u2019ve expressed historically that 19% and more trends have subsidies at different levels, it\u2019s not all four subsidies that depends on the tears and the income of the individuals.","Justin Lake","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. If I could just speak one last numbers question. If there the variable comp you talked about this year, the increase be through SG&A. Can you put some numbers around that, so that we can understand how much might normal I doubt next year\u2026","Michael Neidorff","I\u2019m not going to give that specific. I mean we had a very strong quarters, I think you all recognized. And so therefore the variable comp will be booked accordingly. And that avoids anyone of the quarter taken in appropriate head because up or down. So we bounce it up. But I don\u2019t want give any specific because of the changes that can take place from quarter-to-quarter.","Justin Lake","All right. Thanks again guys.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning. I just want to go back to business expansion cost $0.42 to $0.47. I think the cost was $0.05 in the first quarter. I mean, Jeff just give me impact in the second quarter.","Jeff Schwaneke","$0.07.","Ralph Giacobbe","$0.07? Okay.","Jeff Schwaneke","We did not give that. But it was $0.07 in the second quarter. And again, I think my comment was the increase is going to be more in the fourth quarter. So this increase that we put in the $0.17 the midpoint, I think most of that the majority that\u2019s going to be in Q4. Because that\u2019s one\u2026","Ralph Giacobbe","I think about I mean $0.05 in the first, $0.07 second, it\u2019s been looks like \u2013 there\u2019s going to be close to the $0.30 impact in the fourth quarter. Is that fair?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, that\u2019s close enough.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. And you get any that back on sort of an ongoing like when we think ahead to next year to some of that come back or is that just an embedded costs sort of going forward.","Jeff Schwaneke","If you comparing into 2017, yes, because in 2017 in the first quarter there were exchange open enrollment costs, so when you go to 2018 and there they wouldn\u2019t be but the cost would be higher in the fourth quarter. So I think we\u2019re not going to quantify that but don\u2019t know how much that the differences.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. All right. And then is the underlying base case for hits on enrollment next year to be flat, can you sort of level said already you take the overall pool is?","Jeff Schwaneke","I\u2019ll go back to Michael\u2019s comment. I think we\u2019re not going to consistent with what we\u2019ve done the past we\u2019re not getting in the 2018 membership. I mean we\u2019re still in pricing cycles and those things sort so\u2026","Michael Neidorff","Yes, we did comment to it. We\u2019re entering new markets than expanding existing markets. So that would probably give the sense that there will be some growth which will detail in December.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. But just I guess just help sort of frame a little bit just given sort of the you certainly done well in the exchanges to this point, there\u2019s obviously a lot of headline risk still as we think about on next year is why questions around sort of mandate that may not be enforced and the potential sort of drop-off health to your life\u2019s given some of redneck out of the administration currently, I guess how do you get comfort with that in terms of how you price the business as you think about 2018?","Michael Neidorff","I think when we have a little timing at that price, 2018 to \u2013 we were articulated again and again. We will make our decision based on the facts as they are today. And it\u2019s trying to do what if that\u2019s we end up with what I would call Polaris by analysis. And so as we get closer, we will continue to look at the facts, and we make those decisions based on where we are. And as I said in my opening remarks, I think this has a long way to play out and I genuinely believe in the time I spend worse than, there is not the appetite across the broad perspective of both Houses to take the most vulnerable populations and leave them without insurance. When do our programs that are working very well. It\u2019s a matter how they cover it to exchanges, how they cover it through Medicaid to at level that we have been giving some very constructive program, that I was quoted last week on \u2013 at the bill head been moving in the right direction. And we think that \u2013 in the end, they would do the right thing for the part of this vulnerable population.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Fair enough. And then one more, if I could squeeze it in, can you just remind us, if there is any tailwind of earning this year from the health moratorium. And maybe frame a size of potential headwind next year. Where is a full pass through with maybe more marginal impact from the Health Net commercial book?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I mean for us \u2013 I mean, we\u2019re still heavily weighted towards the Medicaid side. So that\u2019s the predominately pass through side. And then commercial, you\u2019re \u2013 to some extent pricing that end. So I think the margin impact will be very small. If any, if any.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Ana Gupte with Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Yes. Hi, thanks. Good morning. The first question I had was on the Florida RFP that came out earlier this month. And can you talk about your views on the consolidation of supplier\u2026","Michael Neidorff","When there\u2019s \u2013 an active RFP, we are prohibited from commenting out of it, by law. And I\u2019m not going to give people a pure opportunity.","Ana Gupte","All right. Understood, okay. The second question, some of it\u2019s been asked already, but in terms of the CSRs, what types of conversations are you having with the State Insurance Commissioners, where some of the states are offering a within, without type scenario. And do you think, at the end of the day, they don\u2019t want to leave whole bunch of low income citizens uninsured, that they will at least come in right\u2026","Michael Neidorff","I think there\u2019s too long, Ana. First of all most of the conversations we have at state and federal level have been very quiet. And we find that really works much better, when you\u2019re not out front in specifics. We are left clearly with the few only in that \u2013 at state and federal level. Leadership understands that to eliminate CSRs, who is to create havoc to the insured marketplace. And if you read through many of the comments made by the people and listen to it, they talk about stabilizing the insurance market. It\u2019s not destroying them. So I\u2019m personally I was thinking, we are corporately convinced that when all with that settles. There will be subsidies in some form, CSRs, tax credits would have it \u2013 pass through tax credit that will protect the low income vulnerable citizens.","Ana Gupte","Got it. Yes, one last question I agree with you one that. The last question is on your announcement about Schnucks and the clinic in Ferguson do you thing that\u2019s\u2026","Michael Neidorff","Yes.","Ana Gupte","One off because you\u2019re trying into the community outreach or is it more business oriented around your Medicare population and or third party services?","Michael Neidorff","I think people will learn from this but \u2013 National Chairman of the Urban League, in fact our convention is here, national convention is here this week since my board meetings over I put out different hat. But Ferguson, we decided two years ago as a community and as a business community, the companies that we would \u2013 we had an obligation to show what to do and how to correct the kinds of issues that were reflected in Ferguson.","There are 150 cities in this country with that same thing could have happen and we\u2019re showing the road map, that it\u2019s creating jobs, small businesses supporting them, the Save Our Sons program that the Urban League put together. So in this Schnucks opened up a supermarket there. But now great separate leaders in the community as well and what they did. I know their Chairman, we know each other. I said, why don\u2019t we put a health center in there that\u2019s going to be man \u2013 qualifying health centers.","So that population now has access to high quality healthcare but it has another advantage not only can they gets urgent care, but if they see something that\u2019s more chronic, they can then refer to the health center where they can get continued continuity of care. So it\u2019s a combination of doing what\u2019s right for the community and getting some learning that may or may not apply in some other environment.","But thank you for your questions. You gave me a chance to get on my hobby.","Ana Gupte","Thanks Michael. Appreciate it.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you. ","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Michael Neidorff our Chairman and CEO for any closing comments.","Michael Neidorff","I just want to thank everybody, for the time in the call.

Michael Neidorff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Scheffel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene will host this morning's call.","The call should last approximately 45 minutes and may also be accessed through our Web site at centene.com.

As a reminder, our next Investor Day is June 17, in New York City.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining Centene\u2019s fourth quarter, and full year 2015 earnings call. I would like to begin with an update on the status of the Health Net acquisition. We have made significant progress towards completing this transaction. We have received all necessarily approvals with the exception of California, which remains pending.","On January 22, Centene participated in a public hearing with the California Department of Insurance [ph]. We believe the meeting was informative and there were no surprises. It was conducted in a professional and respectful manner, a report of what has been a fair sale process.","We continue to work through the process with the Department of Insurance and the Department of Managed Healthcare, and are finalizing our mutual agreement. We remain confident of the first quarter growth. We have slightly adjusted our 2016 guidance to reflect to March 1 closing date for Health Net. Jeff will provide further details on this.","I would like to take a moment to remind you of the rationale behind the Health Net acquisition. It is a significant set in our strategy to build critical mass and expertise within the government-sponsored healthcare category. When the deal closes, Centene will be a $40 billion-plus company. We will be the largest Medicaid-managed care organization in the country and the leader in managed long-term support services.","The addition of Health Net\u2019s Medicare Advantage platform, including its four star rating creates numerous opportunities within our existing markets, which we estimate to be in excess of $150 million. Health Net will increase our marketplace presence to 15 states, with total membership of approximately 500,000 individuals. There are significant opportunities to deploy Centene specialty solutions across the Health Net platform.","Health Net has been an innovator in value-based provider contracting and risk sharing [indiscernible]. Finally, the deal is 20% accretive in adjusted EPS in the first year following the close [ph]. The planning portion of Centene\u2019s comprehensive integration process is now largely completed. We have reorganized our management team to facilitate collaboration and efficiency. We will be ready to hit the ground running to begin executing a plan on the day it closes.","Now shifting to fourth quarter and full year 2015 highlights; Centene ended 2015 in a strong balance and secure structural and financial position. What do I mean by this? Several months ago, when I questioned a single contractor, [indiscernible] Bill Scheffel, our CFO for the next few days, commented, we are an aircraft carrier, and you don\u2019t throw aircraft carriers off course very easily. Today, we are in 23 states, soon to be 24 with Nebraska. In these 23 states we have 231 separate solutions, which our products could contract. This diversity provides strength and stability. In other words, if one product in one state has an issue, rate, something of that nature, there are more than enough offsets. Many of you will recognize that this has been our strategy from the beginning.","Clearly 2015 was a banner year for Centene. Our long-term growth strategy is intact. We continue to execute against our pipeline, as evidenced by recent wins in Florida and Nebraska. We added over 1 million members, representing growth of 26%, with 5.1 million beneficiaries. Premium and service revenues increased 36% year-over-year, to $21.3 billion. [Indiscernible] the HBR improved 40 basis points year-over-year, to 88.9%. We reported diluted earnings per share of $2.89, or $3.03 when excluding $0.14 of Health Net merger-related expenses. This compares to $2.23 reported for full year 2014.","The pretax margin excluding merger costs improved to 3.4%, from 2.9% in 2014 and 2.6% in 2013. We remain committed to margin and future margin expansion, with the targeted range of 3% to 5%. Bill will provide further financial details in his prepared remarks.","A quick note on flu; current indicators point to a slower start to the 2015-2016 flu season, it is however still too early to draw an absolute conclusion. Overall, we continue to see, as well as anticipate stable medical cost trend.","Next, market and product updates. First we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. Nebraska, we were pleased to be selected last week as one of three managed care organizations to administer Nebraska\u2019s Heritage Health program. Heritage Health is the new healthcare delivery system that combines the state\u2019s current physical health, behavioral health, and pharmacy program into a single comprehensive and coordinated system. This program covers 230 Medicaid and CHIP enrollees.","Centene will operate statewide in Nebraska, which marks our 24th state of operations. The contract is expected to commence on January 1, 2017, and we expect a normal margin ramp. This entry point will provide future opportunities in the state, such as long-term therapy.","Arizona, the fourth quarter was our first full quarter providing services under the expanded contract for Arizona\u2019s newly formed southern region. Membership in Arizona doubled over the third quarter of 2015. At December 31, we served approximately 441,000 beneficiaries in the state.","Mississippi; Mississippi became a $1 billion market for Centene in 2015. In December, we began managing inpatient services for Medicaid and ABD members in the state. We ended the year with 302,000 lives. This compares to 109,000 at the end of 2014.","Louisiana; Louisiana also became a $1 billion market in 2015. During the year we executed a successful acquisition and integration in the state. We more than doubled our at-risk memberships to 382,000 lives. In December we further expanded our Louisiana contract to begin including behavioral health benefits. The carve-in of additional benefits to Mississippi and Louisiana is consistent with Centene\u2019s holistic approach to provide integrated care for its members.","Oregon, the fourth quarter marked the first full quarter of operations for our Trillium subsidiary, which provides Medicaid, Medicare Advantage, and marketplace services to Oregon residents. Membership at year end was approximately 100,000. While it is still early, Trillium is performing in line with our expectation.","Now on to Dual Eligible, we ended the fourth quarter with 26,300 members across our five dual demonstration contracts. We continue to work with our state provides and CMS to make these programs successful and sustainable. I remind you that we have always taken the view that the dual demonstration programs would not be a significant near-term growth driver for Centene.","Next, Medicaid expansion, we ended 2015 with almost 450,000 Medicaid expansion members, more than double of what was at the end of 2014. In January, the government of Louisiana signed an executive order to expand Medicaid coverage under ACA by July 1 of 2016. This represents a future growth opportunity for Centene, given our status as the largest Medicaid health brand in the state. We have not yet included the Louisiana expansion in our 2016 financial guidance. We will provide an update when additional information becomes available.","Health Insurance Marketplace, our exchange experience continues to be favorable; 92% of our membership is subsidy eligible. And we are achieving margins within our targeted range. We have taken a disciplined approach to pricing from day one. In fact, the aggregate in each of Centene\u2019s states reflected a payable position for both 2014 and 2015 for the Three Rs program. This approach has allowed us to grow profitably from 75,000 members in nine states in 2014 to over 146,000 in 12 states in 2015. Please note, we have not been impacted by special enrollment period.","For 2016, we expanded into a 13th state, New Hampshire. We have also increased our geographic footprint in certain of our other 12 states. Enrollment so far in 2016 is in line or ahead of expectations. The demographics of these new members are consistent with previous years, and over 90% [indiscernible]. Our pricing and underwriting is also in line with prior years, and we are not reliant on risk corridors.","Centurion, we continue to successfully expand our correctional health business. Last week, Centurion reached a formal agreement with the Florida Department of Corrections to provide comprehensive healthcare services to over 70,000 inmates through the three regions. The contract was awarded through an accelerated GAAP procurement, the restructures, as a cost-plus arrangement, with a maximum $267 million in annual revenue. Centurion was the only awardee. This contract is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2016, and runs through January of 2018.","Shifting gears, our rate outlook; the 2015 composite rate adjustment was approximately 1%, in line with our expectations. Composite rate adjustment had been consistent for the past few years. We expect a similar composite rate readjustment in 2016.","In conclusion, our strong 2015 results reaffirm our growth momentum for 2016, and beyond. As we begin this New Year we are in a good place, both financially and strategically. With the additional products and capabilities Health Net provides, our growth pipeline is bigger than ever. We are well-positioned to gain market share in the government-sponsored healthcare space, the fastest growing category in the industry.","Thank you for your interest in Centene. Before I turn the call over to Bill, I want to thank him for his years of dedicated service. As previously announced, he will be retiring at the end of the month after the K is filed. We will now witness part of that turnover. Bill will cover 2015 information, and Jeff will pick up and report information relative to 2016.","Bill, I turn it over to you.","Bill Scheffel","Thank you, Michael, and good morning everyone. This morning we will cover both our fourth quarter and full year 2015 results. For the fourth quarter, premium and service revenues were 5.9 billion, an increase of 33% over the fourth quarter of 2014. And diluted earnings per share, excluding Health Net merger costs were $0.95, compared to $0.87 last year. And as you will recall, last year\u2019s fourth quarter included a $0.24 benefit from reporting the health insurer fee reimbursement for Texas for all of 2014 in the fourth quarter.","Looking at the full year for 2015, membership was 5.1 million members, an increase of 26% between years. Premium and service revenues were 21.3 billion, an increase of 36%. Earnings from operations were 705 million, an increase of 52%; and diluted earnings per share excluding Health Net merger costs was $3.03, an increase of 36% between years, and well above our most recent guidance numbers, of $2.90 to $2.94.","In more detail, premium and service revenues grew by 1.4 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year, primarily as a result of expansion or new programs in many of our states. During the fourth quarter [technical difficulty] included some newly added revenue in several areas. We began an expanded contract in the Southern region of Arizona on October 1 [technical difficulty] Louisiana beginning December 1. The inpatient services were added in Mississippi beginning December 1. And the fourth quarter included a full quarter of operations in Oregon relating to our acquisition [technical difficulty]. We also benefited from the addition of almost 250,000 more Medicaid Expansion members at this year end over the last year.","During 2015, we recognized $344 million in revenue associated with the health insurer fee, compared to 195 million in 2014. For both years the recorded, there was virtually all of the health insurer fee on a grossed up basis for [technical difficulty].","Our health benefit ratio was 88.0% in the fourth quarter this year, compared to 89.3% in the last year\u2019s fourth quarter, and 89.0% in the third quarter. The 130 basis point decrease year-over-year results from improvement in the overall HBR for higher acuity membership, particularly long-term care, premium increases and adjustments, and a milder flu season in the fourth quarter of this year.","Sequentially, the 100 basis point improvement in the third quarter reflects rate increases and adjustments received during the third and fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, 20% of premium and service revenues came from new business, compared to 30% in the fourth quarter of 2014. The health benefits ratio for new business was 88.2%, and existing business was 88.0% in the fourth quarter. Both of which are decreases of 120 basis points between years.","The Health Insurance Marketplace product has performed well for us in 2014, and 2015, reflecting our disciplined strategy [technical difficulty] subsidized members familiar with our provider network. This same methodology and process is used for 2016 as well. Similar to last year end, we continue to be in a payable position with the risk corridor and risk adjustments [technical difficulty]. We also have a payable at year end recorded with the minimum loss ratio for the Health Insurance Marketplace business. For the 2014 plan year, we have settled the Three R amounts and paid the rebates related to the minimum loss ratio.","Our general and administrative ratio was 8.8% in Q4 of this year, 8.7% without Health Net merger costs, compared to 8.2% last year, and 8.2% in the [technical difficulty] quarter, also [technical difficulty]. The increase in the fourth quarter of this year bought year-over-year and sequentially reflect a higher level of seasonal cause related to the open enrollment period where the marketplace exchanged process, and higher amounts of renewable compensation process.","Excluding Health Net merger [technical difficulty] third and fourth quarters at $0.23 [technical difficulty]. Investment and other income was 8 million for the fourth quarter, compared to 10 million last year and 8 million in the third quarter. [Technical difficulty] 11 million this year, compared to 10 million last year and $11 million in the third quarter.","Our effective income tax rate was 48.4% in the fourth quarter, and 48.6% through all of 2015, the relatively high rate [technical difficulty].","Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations in the fourth quarter were $0.91 [technical difficulty] excluding the Health Net merger. For the full year 2015, our EPS was $2.89 or $3.03, excluding [technical difficulty].","Cash in investment totaled almost $4 billion at year end, [technical difficulty] 78 million held by unregulated [technical difficulty]. Our risk-based capital percentage continues to be [technical difficulty].","Debt by December 31 was 1.2 billion, including 225 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt to capital ratio was 34.7%, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note compared to [technical difficulty] last year.","Medical claims liabilities totaled $2.3 billion at December 31 and represent [technical difficulty]. Cash flow from operations was 201 million in the fourth quarter and 668 million for the full year. Both amounts to approximately 1.8 times net earnings [technical difficulty] our expected range of 1.5 to 2.4 times net earnings.","Now for 2016, Jeff Schwaneke will discuss the 2016 guidance.","Jeff Schwaneke","Thank you, Bill, and good morning. I would like to spend a few minutes to discuss our combined guidance for 2016. In our press release this morning, reporting our full year results for 2015 we have also included our 2016 annual guidance.","The guidance has been adjusted for the following items; first, we have changed our assumption with respect to the closing date of the Health Net transaction. We're now assuming the transaction closes on March 1. While this does not impact our run rate revenues or earnings, it does change the number of months in Health Net we're able to include in the consolidated financial statements for 2016.","As mentioned in our December Investor Day, one month of Health Net revenue is approximately $1.3 billion. The March 1 closing date is an assumption we have made for guidance purposes, and the transaction remains subject to regulatory approval in California. The actual closing date of the Health Net transaction will determine the number of months and days of Health Net results that will be included in our consolidated financial statements for 2016.","Second, we recently announced the pricing of 2.4 billion of senior unsecured debt in connection with the Health Net transaction and have updated our assumptions with respect to interest expense. Consistent with what we have done in the past in matching our balance sheet exposure to short-term interest rates, we intend to swap up to approximately $1.6 billion of the senior debt to a floating rate of interest at transaction closing. Since we have entered into the interest rate swap agreements, the ultimate interest rate of the transaction financing will continue to fluctuate.","Third, we have adjusted our range on Health Net merger-related expenses, which will continue to change until closing and have reduced the guidance range for the amortization of intangible asset associated with acquisitions by one month to reflect the assumed March 1 closing date.","And finally we have updated our guidance to include the recent contract award for Centurion in Florida. As a result of all these items for 2016, our combined guidance is as follows; total revenues of $40 billion to $40.8 billion, GAAP diluted earnings per share of $2.80 to $3.15, adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.05 to $4.40.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the amortization of intangible assets associated with acquisitions, which we estimate to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per share, and Health Net related merger expenses, which we estimate to be between $0.70 and $0.75 per diluted share with both items reflecting the revised closing date assumption.","We have adjusted the bottom-end of our diluted earnings per share range to reflect the one month delay and the assumed closing date of the Health Net transaction. For 2016, we expect approximately 45% of our annual adjusted diluted earnings per share we earned in the first half of the year, and we expect the first quarter to be lower than the second quarter, due to seasonality of the business, the extra day from leap year, and only including one month of Health Net in our consolidated results for the first quarter.","Additionally, our guidance assumes no receivables for the risk corridor program and a payable for the risk adjustment program in 2016. We will provide further details on our 2016 guidance after regulatory approval, and the closing of the Health Net transaction.","This concludes our remarks. Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Scott Fidel of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. Good morning. First question just is on Nebraska and just interested first what type of start-up expenses the guidance may assume now for this year ahead of that. And then secondly, just if you can talk about how you feel the initial rates are looking for this program? I know it\u2019s a mature managed care market already, but obviously they\u2019re moving more to an integrated benefit now. So interested how you feel about the rates.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, this is Jeff. I can cover the -- the start-up costs are in our current guidance. And as far as the second question, was on rates?","Scott Fidel","That\u2019s right.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes.","Jesse Hunter","Yes, Scott. This is Jesse Hunter. I think as you mentioned, Nebraska\u2019s got the experience with existing Medicaid managed care players. I think when you take that, plus the benefits of the integrated services that you referenced, particularly on behavioral and pharmacy, we think there\u2019s been a very prudent process with good visibility on rate setting, actuarial soundness and the like. So we feel, you know, there\u2019s always some question mark when you go into these things. But we are not looking at this as a negative rate kind of entry point. We think there\u2019s good visibility on the path to achieving our target margins in Nebraska.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Then I just had a follow-up question, just heard when listening to the California hearing that Steve Sell from Health Net is going to be running the California business after the merger. So it sounds like you guys have made some decisions around the management team at this point. Just interested if there\u2019s any updates on any other decisions there, particularly as it relates to some of the senior management from Health Net? Just sort of interested with Jay Gellert and with Jim Woys, for example, whether it\u2019s been determined what their role would be post the merger?","Michael Neidorff","I think we have set up the structure, and [indiscernible] has done a good job getting it all laid out with the team, and as I said in my comments, it's in place to hit the ground running. We\u2019ll be working with Jim on a consulting basis as appropriate, and Jay, we\u2019re in conversations with, but there won\u2019t be any active participation in the new company. It would be in a consulting role for both of them [ph].","Scott Fidel","Okay, thanks.","Michael Neidorff","That\u2019s if there is a consulting\u2026","Scott Fidel","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just to come back to Health Net quickly, I know during the hearing your counsel had sort of proposed if you met the last remaining document requests that the insurance commissioner might close the record as of the 29 -- 29 of January. Has the record been closed at this point?","Michael Neidorff","Chris, as I understand it, it\u2019s still open. They\u2019re reviewing all the documents they have. And they just want to make sure they have what they need before they close it, but we\u2019ve had no additional requests since then. We\u2019re discussing the agreements that we\u2019ll have between the two of us. The lawyers are [technical difficulty]. It\u2019s moving along. And as you probably saw, if you watched the hearing, it was a very professional, well-conducted hearing.","Chris Rigg","Yes, I know. I seems like everything went pretty smoothly. It\u2019s just, at least to me, I don\u2019t pay attention to a lot of these things but\u2026","Michael Neidorff","We got -- we heard no testimony that was not anticipated.","Chris Rigg","Yes, I guess I\u2019m just trying -- if you\u2019re looking at a March -- again my understanding as of the date, once he closes the record that starts the 30-day clock. So if we\u2019re already\u2026","Michael Neidorff","[Technical difficulty] he doesn\u2019t have to wait 30 days.","Chris Rigg","Okay.","Michael Neidorff","[Technical difficulty] with the agreements we\u2019ve reached he can [indiscernible] approved at any point he wishes.","Chris Rigg","Okay, great. And then just can you help us -- and this is sort of the follow-up on the previous question, with regard to just insuring it. What is the incremental revenue from that contract and the guidance relative to the offset from the timing delay of Health Net?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I think Michael had quoted the number in his script as far as what the annual revenue is. Yes, it\u2019s over 267 million, and I think the start date is in Q2.","Chris Rigg","Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","Our next question is from A.J. Rice of UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Thanks. So first all I just wanted to ask on the service revenue. I saw that it\u2019s declined sequentially from 480 [ph] million in third quarter to 442. Is that just seasonality or is there anything else going on there?","Jesse Hunter","I would say that\u2019s primarily seasonality, and a lot of that's going to be based on Hep C.","A.J. Rice","Okay. And then the comments on the financing around the Health Net deal, I wasn\u2019t a 100% clear. Is that the rates that you were able to attain in the marketplace? Were they consistent with what you had anticipated? And is your guidance based on current debt that\u2019s outstanding, or are you factoring in those swap transactions, which I guess would probably lower the rate flip into the floating rate, and maybe I should confirm that as well.","Jesse Hunter","Yes, you\u2019re correct. So obviously we\u2019ve already priced the debt. And I think what I\u2019m saying today is that we are anticipating swapping up to a 1.6 billion to a floating rate of interest consistent with what we\u2019ve done in the past. Our current guidance does assume some blending form of the coupon plus the benefit of the swaps. Obviously we wouldn\u2019t execute the swap transactions if they weren\u2019t beneficial. So I would say right now we believe we have a relatively conservative assumption based on where the spreads are on the swaps today.","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Joshua Raskin of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to see if there was any seasonality around the Health Net earnings, just taking the low end down by just $0.5, maybe some of that's offset by the Centurion win as well, but if it does get delayed a little bit longer, past March 1, should we think about earnings coming in kind of ratably through the year for Health Net or is there some seasonality that we should be aware of?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, Josh. This is Jeff. I mean, as you are aware, not all months are created equal. So I\u2019m not going to get into the details on a month-by-month basis of Health Net. However I would say, when you shift out an entire month of the transaction, there\u2019s a lot of things that play into that, amortization, share count on the diluted shares outstanding, et cetera. So I think we had a lot of puts and takes. And when you add it all together we feel comfortable with our guidance range where it is now.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. And then just a second question. You guys have talked about this Medicare platform from Health Net as a new platform to expand Medicare into your markets. And it hadn\u2019t really been a growth business; they lost another 5%, maybe 20,000-plus lives according to the CMS data in January. So I\u2019m just curious what gives you confidence that that becomes a growth platform. That you can kind of turn it around, and what exactly are you acquiring that gives you comfort that you\u2019re going to be able to become a larger MA player?","Michael Neidorff","I think, one, we\u2019ve indicated we\u2019re going to enter methodically, carefully, and this will probably -- three new markets in January, next year. We\u2019re not saying which ones for obvious competitive reasons.","I think that the big difference is that we\u2019ve done -- some of us have done Medicare before, and they understand it, but they have some systems and capabilities. They have the four stars, which does give you a premium benefit with the first two years, 5%. And I think the major difference, Josh, is that there\u2019s a corporation now that has the commitment to build the systems and capabilities to continue to grow and expand the MA, versus someone -- a company that was in a different mode, and in the middle of outsourcing a lot of things before the acquisition. It\u2019s almost a mentality thing, as much as anything. There\u2019s very capable people there that are excited about what this opportunity working with us means.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. Okay, that\u2019s helpful, Michael. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks. I just wanted to follow back up with the services question. When you say that Hep C was down, is that something that -- is something that we should expect to continue in 2016, or is there just something seasonally or economy-wise about that in Q4?","Bill Scheffel","Well, I think on Hep C we\u2019ve seen a little bit of plateauing that has occurred. And I think with some of the changing guidelines in the future, that may ramp up again. But right now I think what you\u2019re seeing, our 2015 results is more of a plateauing.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, so is that what you\u2019re assuming in 2016 or you\u2019re assuming that ramp now spike up?","Bill Scheffel","We don\u2019t have any significant ramp up in 2016 in our initial guidance and plan.","Michael Neidorff","I think you know we\u2019ve been by our abundance of [technical difficulty].","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then if you could just provide a little more color I guess on the Q4 [indiscernible] I guess -- you meant to kind of impact [indiscernible] in Q3 and Q4 to MLR. Can you just go through what exactly that was?","Bill Scheffel","Sure. If you look at the quarter-over-quarter, we improved 130 basis points. And for us that was the largest item dealt with the improvement in higher acuity membership, particularly long-term care, where we see probably both -- medical management techniques that we\u2019ve applied, and rates over the year. We\u2019ve also had the premium increases and adjustments that we received between year-over-year, particularly in some of our larger states. And then flu season was much lower this year than last year.","Kevin Fischbeck","Then I guess just the premium adjustments. So was there something out of period or unusual in the quarter? [Indiscernible] something like that whether it was just a normal rate update?","Bill Scheffel","It\u2019s a combination of both. We get rate increases in three of our largest states in the second half of the year, with Georgia on July 1, and Florida and Texas on September 1. And then there\u2019s also risk adjustments that are made periodically by the states. And those can be somewhat lumpy at times, as when those are actually provided to us. So the combination of all those things gave us the overall rate and improvement.","Michael Neidorff","I think also -- I think one of the important elements is that we look at, and you\u2019ve seen it -- and we\u2019ve talked about it historically. How over a course of a year the medical loss ratio and health benefit ratio normalize. And it was the significant aspects of that with the higher acuity population [technical difficulty] you expect some improvements in operations.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then just last question. On the exchanges, it seems like some of the companies have had I guess unusual Q4 results as you kind of true up through the year end either a positive or negative. Anything go on there as far as free [ph] articles or trend that you would highlight into Q4 versus your expectations for first three quarters?","Michael Neidorff","I\u2019ll start. [Indiscernible] but I view that as an accounting issue. And I think our team here has, of whether it be refunds to states or any aspect of it, understands wholly the business, and accrues the appropriate amounts on an ongoing basis. And that\u2019s what the Board and myself expect of them. And so those kind of surprises are few and far between.","Bill Scheffel","Yes, I agree. The product has performed very steadily for us, and well over the last two years. And there was nothing in the fourth quarter that really was a significant adjustment that changed anything of any consequence.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi, a follow-up to that last one. In terms of your comments in the prepared remarks about, I think you said enrollment in the individual business was in-line to maybe slightly better than what your early expectations were. Can you confirm that? And then what are your expectations for margin performance in the individual business baked into your guidance? Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","I think we commented that, one, the growth is in line with what we expected. And you have the initial enrollment, and those that actually paid the premium were good. So that\u2019s coming in as we would expect it to. And on margins, we continue to price it. And it continues to perform in line fully with our margins. As I said, we have not priced this profit [indiscernible] prices with a great deal of dependency on the PRs and hence we've had a payable when you safely look at those aspects on a [indiscernible] basis within the state. We see no reason why that\u2019s going to change. We've maintained the same approach, we have the subsidy population, we commented in the script that the profile of the individual goals are the same and so it\u2019s a matter of -- we're in the risk business and it's called managing the risk.","Dave Windley","And so, Michael, those expectations are 3% or -- what is your level of expectation?","Michael Neidorff","We have the -- 3%.","Dave Windley","And then my follow-up would be just around guidance assumptions.","Michael Neidorff","Let's say 3.2% to 3.5% to be more accurate.","Dave Windley","I appreciate the precision. In terms of comments on flu, are you assuming in the early part of '16 that you'll maybe making a conservative assumption about flu clinical catching up and then what are your assumptions for the end of 2016 and flu season in the fourth quarter of '16?","Michael Neidorff","I think we see some indications of [technical difficulty] at this point in time. That's why I said it's too early to say that it's going to be no flu season at all this year. We've seen the flu season come early; we've seen them come late. I would say on fourth quarter, and Jeff can confirm this, but we have looked the normal flu range that we do as we did in every quarter. And if not the high-end or the low-end, it's what we reasonably expected.","Dave Windley","Very good, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","First off, let me tell you, thanks and congratulations Bill, you did a great job for us and for Centene, and good luck Jeff going forward. And I get to my question which is really about reserves for the company and days in claims payables. What do you expect days in claims payables to do this year given all the moving parts with sort of what's new business and help that coming on board? What should we be expecting to see in the days claims payable end?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, this is Jeff. I mean as far as on a combined basis with Health Net we haven't given out anything on that as far as Centene is concerned. I think we have a range from the 40, you know, low 40s to mid-40s, I'd still expect to be in that range. I don't see anything unusual happening there. I think the biggest thing that impacts that is that how fast we receive claims and the EDI rate that we have, and we have continued to see an increase in the EDI rate. And so over time you would expect that to reduce your days in claims payable, but nothing significant that I would expect.","Bill Scheffel","I said probably in many presentations [technical difficulty]. We are averaging 98 plus percent, 98.6% payment and [indiscernible]. We have 99% accuracy within the payment of those things. So you put all those kinds of factors together, it gives you a high degree of confidence in your like tables, and those factors -- I think the greatest impact as Jeff highlighted will [indiscernible] some investors. That\u2019s the variable, and when you have a constant on the other end of it that says you don't have to measure as many different views -- date received methodology. So if things [indiscernible].","Peter Costa","Should we expect any sort of the slowdown as you bring on the Health Net systems and then [indiscernible] on to your servers?","Michael Neidorff","Well, we have stated that we are going to be very methodical in bringing answers to routine. Too many times when people try to do it quickly and they feel the twist and [indiscernible]. We stated that we anticipate it's going to take two years to fully integrate all systems. They are in the middle of a lot of outsourcing. That\u2019s all coming back in. They have a lot of people offshore that will be coming back. So there's lot of different aspects. So it's anticipated couple of years, and we\u2019ll keep you informed as\u2026","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. Again, the most significant component of time on days in claims payable is how long it takes from the date of service to when we receive the claims. And that\u2019s the majority of the time as Michael mentioned how fast we actually process those payments once we receive the claim.","Peter Costa","Okay, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andy Schenker","Thanks, good morning. So in the past when you provide guidance you've called out kind of an investment and expansion cause. I mean given the new programs and expansion to share, excluding Health Net, maybe how should we think about investment costs in either ideally absolute terms or at least relative to 2015 and how should we think about that trend going forward? Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, this is Jeff. I mean we haven't -- we\u2019re in this spot here where we are kind of waiting for the Health Net transaction to close here. So we haven't gotten into those details. I think once the transaction closes we\u2019ll provide all of the normal, I would say, guidance information including tax rates, shares outstanding, start-up costs etcetera, etcetera, but right now we\u2019re just in a position where as you've seen we went from February to March 1, we are just in a position where we really have to wait until closing.","Andy Schenker","Okay. Switching gears, so Dual, obviously never been meaningful for Centene and definitely been a slightly disappointing program here but given concerns around the program, are you seeing any changes from the state around renewed interest and maybe independent or separate long-term support services programs, or do you think any potential growth in that RFE pipeline, you talked about LTSS as a separate [indiscernible] thing?","Michael Neidorff","I've had some discussions with [indiscernible], some of the needs they have to do to reduce the system enrollment [indiscernible] population. We're doing a little better or higher, I think we are -- last time I looked, it was 30% versus 50% in some other states, but I think the states recognize this and it's just a matter of what they have on their plate and their willingness and ability to do that.","Jesse Hunter","Yes, just on the second part of that, Andy, we have seen the momentum really is around states looking at the other LTSS programs for Managed long-term care as kind of an extension, if you will, of the dual demo program. So you're not seeing a lot of new dual demo programs coming up, but you are seeing a meaningful amount of momentum on Managed long-term care contracts, either embedded within kind of existing states or RFEs that would be specific for that set of services.","Andy Schenker","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Steve Halper of FBR. Please go ahead.","Steve Halper","Yes, hi good morning. Any update on the disk drive issue?","Michael Neidorff","Yes. So let me [technical difficulty] is really a data issue in our Phase 2 with no inclusion or no hacking [technical difficulty]. It was very important. If we continue down the process with continued look at it, we continue to apply an abundance of conservatism and transparency source. Clearly to this point we have seen no hint or any indication of any inappropriate user's data, and we\u2019ll continue the discharge and looking to see if we have 22,000 -- and you're looking for sixth, that\u2019s -- we don\u2019t exactly know when we're doing that. Historically, again just -- that we would check. So there is no update beyond that, but it's -- as I said, we\u2019re following through, we\u2019re notifying everybody and importantly see if this data was an incredibly drop form. We're using it to line up the safe laboratory and other data. So it's not a very usable thing. We really have to have a lot of our systems we get to, but once again, as soon as see something that could be a issue, our policy is to get it out.","Steve Halper","Right. So, just to confirm from your understanding, there's been no inappropriate use of any of the data that would have been on these strives?","Michael Neidorff","No. Absolutely no hints even\u2026","Steve Halper","Okay. Thank you very much.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. I just want to go back to the exchanges real quick, I certainly understand that -- I guess the enrollment numbers are coming in line with your expectation. Can you give us what those numbers are in terms of where you are at right now through open enrollment?","And then second piece is just the renewal percentage, like so, of the exchange book last year, can you give us a sense of what percentage\u2026","Michael Neidorff","Roughly my memory is that [indiscernible] was around 600,000, but that doesn\u2019t include those that have paid and [technical difficulty] for those numbers. So we expected probably the 75% or something of -- what has shown in indication is always the [indiscernible].","Ralph Giacobbe","Sorry I missed that. Did you say 600, so 146 up to 600,000 and then you think maybe 75% stay?","Michael Neidorff","Maybe they were about 400 or so, 500 or so\u2026","Bill Scheffel","Yes. Again that\u2019s about the number for the peak point enrollment. I think it's important to know that the enrollments peaks and then continues to reduce down through the year. We anticipate that experience, so your 146 is the low point of the year in terms of comparison in terms of that.","Jesse Hunter","Yes, this is Jesse, I would just add to that, Michael mentioned these comments in his prepared remarks; the growth that we are seeing is in the states where we have had longstanding participation in the market place. We are known in those products and we've seen the demographics, consistent approach that we have taken in terms of discipline or networks and pricing etcetera, and the demographics for those peak memberships that Michael referenced is wholesale in line with what we have seen over the past two years.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, and then the 146 from last year, do you have a renewal process like the most of those renew as the renewal rate is high?","Bill Scheffel","The renewal rate is very high, so we did see most of our people -- reasonable number renewal like we expected.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, and then just one more, can you maybe help frame the opportunity from Louisiana expanding Medicaid. I think you mentioned it isn\u2019t in guidance, so just wondering sort of the opportunity there maybe reminders of cost trend and MLR within the states that already have expanded Medicaid. I think in the past you've suggested that MLR actually runs lower than average within the Medicaid expansion population. Should we expect the same from Louisiana? Thanks.","Bill Scheffel","MLRs are slightly lower for the Medicaid expansion population than our overall average MLR, given the lower -- slightly lower acuity of the population. So that would be kind of in line with our expectations. And then the total program size is about -- expected to be 250,000 members. That could grow over time and there are five managed care organizations in Louisiana. So those are the rough dimensions for the opportunity.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. That\u2019s helpful thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Good morning. The first question is on the guidance, so you might have said a little bit of this yesterday, but since one of your contracts -- just on a standalone basis, what are you modeling in the guidance for your presenting loss ratio consolidated across your fixed growth, expansion growth, and any rate changes and then within the [indiscernible]?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. This is Jeff. You're a little hard to hear there, but you know, I think as I commented in our Investor Day, we're not going to give standalone guidance for Centene. So we'll have to get into that on a combined basis once the transaction closes.","Ana Gupte","So specifically then I guess if I don't get the overall number for a directional trend, when you said start-up costs, are you modeling in a like a PDR type thing for this new correctional contract in Nebraska and all from '16 losses in two year guidance, so you don't really see that as an accounting practice that you will adopt?","Michael Neidorff","[Technical difficulty] business and we tend to avoid going to businesses where there is a PDR before you see your first\u2026","Bill Scheffel","The only thing I would add is that when we prepare our budgets and operating plans, we assume we\u2019re going to win business and have new plans coming in every year. So when we said for example in the fourth quarter we've included the start-up cost for something like Nebraska that\u2019s because we are always anticipating a certain level of those business expansion costs.","Ana Gupte","Okay. So no PDR, but expansion costs. And then finally just, you know, looking at some of the news flow which major [indiscernible] risks, but with what's going on in Kentucky with the new Governor, and Iowa with the Democratic Senate and all, do you think about any potential downside risks on rates and expansion states? California for Health Net and anything else you're doing, where might you see any\u2026","Michael Neidorff","We have really great actuaries [ph]. We will not sign a contract that we don\u2019t think is adequate. We looked at it. We recognized that it may not be profitable from day one, so we have to have service ability and I can tell you it is [indiscernible].","Ana Gupte","Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch","Yes. Hi, good morning. Sorry if you covered this already, but can you just comment on your outlook for the California Duals program. I realized that's not under your umbrella yet, but it will be soon. And it's been -- the program has been held up politically, I'm just wondering what type of opportunity you see there and how you think it might unfold?","Michael Neidorff","It was important. [Indiscernible] no way at any time [technical difficulty] as we look to the dual product for any of our growth, we recognized it was a very slow, difficult process the way it was structured with the opt-out, et cetera, and for that reason we have said from the beginning that it's just not something that we put our [indiscernible]. We are doing enough. I think we said it at the Investor Day [technical difficulty]. We're doing enough to demonstrate that we're ready to do it, and do it well. So when we are working with the state issues that affect the offset, so that when a new city decides to do something about it, we are in a strong position. And beyond that, I have no great expectations that it's not going to make any state or [indiscernible].","Matthew Borsch","Just philosophically, do you think the dual program can work on an opt-out basis, or do you think we're going to have to get to a point where you put one program in as opposed to running two concurrently?","Michael Neidorff","I think you are going to have to [indiscernible] dramatic changes to minimize the opt-out. There always will be some, but you can't have 50% opt-out and have any continuity affairs. That has changed.","Matthew Borsch","Okay, thank you.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you. I want to thank you all for your interest, comments, and I look forward to another very strong year. I hope Jeff will be giving the same kind of reports that Bill has. So, thank you everybody, have a good day.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"4217":["Centene Corp.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene's most recently filed Form 10-Q filed today April 26, 2016; Form 10-K, which was filed February 22, 2016 and other public SEC filings. Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so.","And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Centene's first quarter 2016 earnings call. We are very pleased to have closed the Health Net acquisition within the first quarter as projected. I would like to begin with a few comments on why the addition of Health Net is transformational.","In closing the acquisition, Centene has achieved the following: further critical mass including additional product diversification within the government-sponsored healthcare space. We are a $40 billion-plus company. We are the largest Medicaid managed care organizations in the country, serving 6.7 million Medicaid members at March 31.","We are the leader in three of the largest Medicaid states; California, Texas and Florida. We are the largest provider of managed long-term support services, one of the fastest-growing segments of the market. We have a 4 Star Medicare Advantage product that can be exploited to additional market. And we provide services under contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs. This greater scale enhances the positive view of Centene nationally as well as by state and local government. It strengthens our ability to help shape sound public health care policy. In addition, it enhances our purchasing power and is beneficial from a balance sheet perspective.","Centene is now clearly a large-cap company in stock. We recently joined the S&P 500 Index. This is important to us as this index is regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Additionally, it will widen our potential investor base and lead to increase liquidity of our stock. Lastly, this acquisition enhances and solidifies the sustainability of Centene's long-term growth rate.","I would now like to comment on the timing of the approval process and provide an update on integration. While the regulatory process in California was lengthier than expected, it was fair and the undertakings contained no surprises. We will be making investments in certain state-affiliated investment-grade vehicles as well as in a local service center. The placement of a service center in California is consistent with Centene's local approach.","We will work with the state to find a suitable location in an economically-disadvantaged area, where job creation is needed. The investments and charitable contributions associated with these undertakings have been included in our guidance and will be made over a multiple-year period.","The planning portion of the integration process was largely completed prior to closing. Our integration team did extensive work to ensure a smooth and seamless combination. We were able to ground running the day of the close and the integration is proceeding as expected.","Before I provide first-quarter highlights, I want to remind you that our first quarter results included only eight days of Health Net's financials as the transaction closed on March 24. Our prior guidance had assumed a March 1 close date. We have updated our 2016 guidance to reflect the latest close. This is a timing issue only and we remain confident that our previously-anticipated run rate earnings remain on track.","Additionally, we have adjusted our reporting to reflect the increased scale of the business and our new product mix. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors and it will continue to evolve as we complete the Health Net integration.","Turning to the first quarter financials, we are pleased with the results of the first quarter. There were many moving parts when combining the two companies, including one-time charges and prorating with timing. Total revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $7 billion. Membership at quarter end was 11.5 million, representing an increase of 7.1 million members or 162% over the first quarter of 2015. The HBR improved 110 basis points year-over-year to 88.7%.","The first quarter pre-tax margin, excluding acquisition related costs, improved 30 basis points year-over-year to 3%. We reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.74. This compares to $0.55 in the first quarter of 2015. Jeff will provide further financial details including the updated 2016 guidance in his prepared remarks.","A quick note on flu, we saw an uptick in flu during the first quarter. The flu appears to have peaked in March and overall costs were in line with our expectations. Overall, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends.","Next market and product updates, first we will discuss recent Medicaid activities. Washing state, in April, Centene commenced operations under the Apple Foster Care contract in Washington as a sole provider for this program. The contract is performing in line with expectations and we anticipate serving over 20,000 foster children. With the addition of this contract, Centene would serve approximately 100,000 foster care beneficiaries across all of our markets.","Nebraska, also in April, Centene executed a contract with Nebraska as one of the three managed care organizations to administer the state's new Heritage Health Program, which covers 230 Medicaid, CHIP and ABD enrolled. This contract is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2017.","Texas, we expect the STAR Kids contract in Texas to commence in the latter part of 2016. Centene is the only managed care organization in Texas that participates in all of the state's Medicaid and Medicaid-related product lines.","Next, Medicaid expansion. At March 31, we served approximately 985,000 Medicaid expansion members in nine states. This represents an increase of more than 650,000 recipients over the first quarter of 2015. This growth was primarily driven by the addition of Health Net's Medicaid expansion members.","In January, the Governor of Louisiana signed an executive order to expand Medicaid coverage under the ACA. This is expected to begin in July and is now included in our updated 2016 guidance.","Now Medicare & Duals, at March 31, we served over 303,000 Medicare and Dual beneficiaries. We continue to expect to launch additional Medicare Advantage plans in four Centene states in 2017. The new Medicare Advantage plans will be launched under our 4 Star banner, which will give us the benefit of incremental premium revenues.","Next, Health Insurance Marketplace, Centene's exchange experience continues to be favorable and we are achieving margins at the higher end of our targeted range. Our marketplace strategy has been and continues to be focused on targeted low-income subsidized individuals, many of whom were previously Medicaid eligible. We designed our exchange solutions to be able to leverage our Medicaid platform including provider networks.","In the majority of our markets, we have both Medicaid and market-based product offerings. We coined the term churn to reference those members who can retain coverage through a high-quality affordable Centene product in either Medicaid or the exchange. In the first quarter, over 90% of our exchange members were subsidy eligible. This is consistent with 2014 and 2015.","Centene has maintained a disciplined approach to pricing from day one. In fact, we are in a net payable position for the 3Rs program. At March 31, we served over 680,000 exchange members across 15 states. At year-end, we expect over 550,000 exchange beneficiaries due to the normal attrition.","Now, Centurion, our correctional health business continues to successfully expand. At March 31, we served 59,000 correctional members represent year-over-year growth of 38%. In April, Centurion replaced its existing one-year contract in Mississippi with a new three-year contract, which is expected to commence in July. Also in April, we began providing correctional health services in three regions in Florida. This marks Centurion's sixth state population.","Finally, commercial, we ended the first quarter with over 830,000 commercial members. We are fully committed to the success of the existing business, especially in California. However, we have no plans at this time to expand into additional states.","Shifting gears to our rate outlook. For Medicaid, we continue to expect a 2016 composite rate adjustment of between zero and 1%, consistent with the past three years. We have known rates for our Medicaid business representing approximately 65% of the projected 2016 member months. For Medicare Advantage, final 2017 rates were announced on April 4. These were in line with our expectations of an approximate 1% increase.","In conclusion, with first quarter results we're off to a good start in 2016. We expect this momentum to continue throughout the year. We are on track with our integration of Health Net. Our synergy targets remain $75 million for the first 12 months following the close and $150 million in the second 12 months following the close. While we remain committed to long-term margin expansion, we continue to expect that 2016 pre-tax margins remain relatively flat compared to 2015 as we focus on integration.","Our growth pipeline is bigger than ever with the additional products and capabilities in healthcare. We are optimistic about the future and our ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government-sponsored healthcare. As a reminder, our Investor Day is on June 17 in New York City. We look forward to seeing you then. We thank you for your continued interest in Centene.","Jeff will now provide further details on our first quarter financial results. Jeff?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning I will begin with highlighting the results for the first quarter of 2016 and then provide an update on our 2016 full-year guidance, including the acquisition of Health Net.","First, I would like to highlight the effect of the Health Net transaction on the first quarter 2016 results. As previously announced, we completed the acquisition of Health Net on March 24, 2016 for a purchase price of $6 billion, including the assumption of debt. In connection with the completion of the acquisition, we incurred approximately $189 million or $0.83 per diluted share of transaction costs, which includes accelerated stock compensation and severance, investment banking fees, legal costs and the present value of a $65 million charitable donation under agreements with various regulatory agencies. Additionally, we have included eight days of Health Net activity in our first quarter of 2016 results. The eight days of activity represents approximately $350 million of revenue and had a minimal effect on our HBR, G&A ratio and adjusted diluted earnings per share.","Now on to the first quarter highlights. For the first quarter, membership was 11.5 million members, an increase of 162% between years, driven by the Health Net acquisition. Total revenues were approximately $7 billion, an increase of 36% over Q1 of 2015. Diluted loss per share for the first quarter of 2016 was $0.13 and adjusted diluted earnings per share is $0.74, when excluding Health Net acquisition costs and intangible amortization compared to $0.55 on an adjusted basis last year.","In more detail, total revenues grew by $1.8 billion in the first quarter, primarily as a result of expansions for new programs in many of our states in 2015, growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and eight days of revenue for the Health Net acquisition.","Our Health Benefits Ratio was 88.7% in the first quarter this year compared to 89.8% in last year's first quarter or 88% for the fourth quarter. The 110 basis point decrease year-over-year was loss from the improvement in the overall HBR for higher-acuity membership, particularly long-term care, and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace membership, which continues to perform well.","Sequentially, the 70 basis point increase from the fourth quarter reflects a later start to the flu season, which was more fragment with the first quarter of 2016. In the first quarter, 18% of premium and service revenues came from new business compared to 23% in the first quarter of 2015.","The existing business metrics for the quarter includes Health Net since the acquisition date and we expect the percentage of revenue from new business to decrease to a single-digit percentage by the end of the year due to the larger revenue base and the denominator. The Health Benefits Ratio for new business were 90.6% and 88.3% for existing business in the first quarter.","The Health Insurance Marketplace product continues to perform well in 2016 with over 680,000 members at March 31. With the addition of Health Net, we continue to be in a net payable position for the risk corridor and risk adjustment components of the 3Rs. As part of our initial valuation procedures associated with the acquisition, we have reduced the book value of the Health Net risk corridor as equal to zero. Additionally, consistent with our historical accounting practice and guidance, we will not report any risk corridor receivables through 2016 benefit year.","Our general and administrative expense ratio was 11.3% in the first quarter this year or 8.3% without the costs associated with the Health Net acquisition compared to 8.3% last year and 8.7% in the fourth quarter, also excluding Health Net acquisition costs. The decrease from the fourth quarter of 2015 reflects the reduction in costs related to build and enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace product.","During the first quarter, we incurred $0.02 per diluted share of business expansion costs compared to $0.06 in the prior year. Investment and other income was $15 million in the first quarter compared to $9 million last year and $8 million in the fourth quarter.","Interest expense was $33 million for the first quarter of 2016 compared to $10 million for the first quarter last year and $11 million in the fourth quarter last year. The increase is due to the issuance of $2.4 billion of senior notes on February 11 of 2016 to fund the cash portion of the consideration for the Health Net acquisition. Consistent with what we've done in the past in matching our balance sheet exposure to short-term interest rates, on March 30, 2016, we entered into an interest rate swap agreement for a notional amount of $1.6 million, converting a substantial portion of our senior notes to the floating rate of interest at the 3-month LIBOR plus 4.36%.","We reported tax expense of $17 million on a pre-tax income of $2 million for the first quarter of 2016 due to the non-deductibility of certain Health Net acquisition costs as well as the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee. GAAP diluted loss per share from continued operations for the first quarter was $0.13. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the first quarter was $0.74. Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes $0.83 associated with the Health Net acquisition costs and $0.04 associated with intangible amortization.","Cash and investments totaled almost $8 billion at quarter end, including $139 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. We estimate our NAIC risk-based capital percentage to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Debt on March 31 was $4.3 billion, including $515 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt to capital ratio was 44.3%, excluding our non-recourse mortgage notes compared to 34.7% in fourth quarter 2015.","Our medical claim liability totaled $3.9 billion at March 31, representing 42 days in claims payable, normalizing the Health Net acquisition. During the first quarter, we made provisional estimates for the fair value of the medical claims liabilities associated with Health Net. We have not completed our fair valuation exercise and the announcement is subject to change. Any change to the provisional estimates will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance sheet and will have no effect on net earnings.","Cash flow from operations was $195 million in the first quarter compared to $45 million in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, you will note that we have adjusted our reporting this quarter to reflect the scale of the business with new products. We believe this provides meaningful information to investors as we continue to evolve as we complete the integration of Health Net.","This concludes my remarks for the first quarter results and now I would like to provide an update on our full-year guidance. We have adjusted our 2016 guidance to reflect the March 22 closing of the Health Net acquisition. We have lowered the top and bottom end of the revenue guidance by $1 billion. We lowered both ends of our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.05 to reflect the transaction closing shifting from March 1 to March 24. Changing closing date does not have an impact on our run rate revenues or earnings. We now expect total revenues to be between $39 million and $39.8 million, which represents an increase of approximately 73% at the midpoint of our guidance range as compared to 2015.","Our 2016 guidance for our Health Benefits Ratio is 87% to 87.5%, a decrease from 2015 of approximately 160 basis points at the midpoint of the guidance range. Reduction in HBR year-over-year is due to the addition of Health Net, which operates with a lower HBR due to the higher mix commercial business and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace, which operates in lower HBR, higher G&A ratio.","General and administrative expense ratio is expected to be between 9.4% and 9.9% in 2016. On an adjusted basis, and excluding acquisition costs, the G&A ratio is expected to increase by 75 basis points between years to 9% to 9.5%. This increase is due to the addition of Health Net, which operates at a higher general and administrative expense ratio due to the mix of business, offset by additional leverage associated with revenue growth and cost synergies.","Other revenue and expense, interest income is forecasted to be between $90 million and $100 million and interest expense is estimated to be between $180 million and $190 million. We estimate business expansion cost of $0.25 to $0.30 in 2016.","We estimate that our effective income tax rate for 2016, excluding non-controlling interest, would be 55% to 57%. A relatively high effective tax rate reflects the impact of non-deductibility of the health insurer fee and the non-deductibility of certain acquisition costs associated with the Health Net acquisition. 2016, we anticipate the health insurer fee increases to approximately $450 million. We estimate our diluted shares outstanding to be between 162.5 million and 163.5 million shares.","2016, we expect GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $2.45 and $2.80, adjusted diluted earnings per share to be between $4 and $4.35. These amounts include Health Net and the related synergies for nine months and eight days of 2016.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes two items; first, the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition, which we estimate to be between $0.50 and $0.55 per share; and two, Health Net acquisition-related expenses, which we estimate to be between $1 and $1.05 per diluted share. Additionally, our guidance assumes no receivables for the risk corridor program and payable for the risk adjustment program in 2016.","We believe the guidance we now provided today are generally consistent with financial information in the joint proxy statement, adjusted to include only nine months and eight days of Health Net activity due to the March 22 closing. We continue to expect $75 million of net synergies in the 12 months following the closing of the transaction. We estimate our operating cash flow to be between 1.5 times to 2 times net earnings.","That concludes my remarks and operator you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question is from Scott Fidel of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. First question, just interested if you can give you us some insights into how the Health Net business has been performing recently, interested in sort of some of the products or markets for them that may be performing better and if there's any markets where they're seeing any headwinds relative to when you were initially anticipating the guidance? And then, just relative to the Health Net. Jeff, just wanted to clarify it was little hard to hear you, just on Health Net's risk corridor receivable, just want to clarify you did say that you wrote that down to zero, right?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. This is Jeff. I'll answer the second question first, which is, yes, we did write that down to zero and I think we'd mentioned that previously on our Investor Days that that was the anticipation of the plan.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Scott, I think regarding your first question, I think we commented it's performing in line with our expectations. And Rone, you may want to add some comments, some more color to it, but it's against what we originally planned, is a little bit up and down. But on balance, in total, it's performing where we expected.","Kenneth Rone Baldwin - Executive Vice President of Insurance Group Business Unit","That's exactly right, Michael, in line with our expectations, in aggregate.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then, just a follow-up question just on the exchange business. And first, if you could tease out what the California exchange enrollment was out of the total? And then, just talking about sort of the additional growth that you had this year, if there's any particular states where you saw that driving the growth? And then, just any early indicators on if the risk mix or the membership profile of the new growth is different than the existing HIX members that you've already added? Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I think I'll start with the back with the last question first, we're starting a pattern here. But I would say that we're seeing the mix consistent with what I described in the churn and our strategy for 2014, 2015 and now 2016 is intact. The other question relative to California, I don't have an exact number at hand, but it was a sizable chunk of the business.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just kind of a follow-up here to Scott's question on the risk corridors. Health Net, historically, there has been always sort of these perpetual concerns about their days claims payable. When we think about the medical claims liability at this point, were there any other sort of reconciling adjustments at close to the reserves or do you feel comfortable where they were at on March 24?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Chris, this is Jeff. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned relatively all the fair valuation exercise related to the Health Net balance sheet, it remains open and really just due to the timing of the closing being relatively close to the end of the quarter. So, what I indicated was that we've made provisional estimates for all these things and we would expect that there is potential for true-up in the second quarter as we complete our fair valuation exercise.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","And that would not run through the income statement or it would just be a one-time item that you would spike out?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, that would not run through the income statement. Those effectively go back to the day-one opening balance sheet that we would've acquired. So, those would be balance sheet-only adjustments.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Okay. Great. And then, just a more forward-looking question. Obviously, you still have the four companies involved in the big M&A transactions right now, obviously, speculation about divestitures there. Are you guys interested at all in potentially being a potential divestee for Medicare Advantage assets or do you think you're going to go at it organically at this point? Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think there's a couple of elements; one, we do not participate in any processes or auctions or whatever you call it today. So, to the extent that is, we're out of that. Two, the controlling issue, and particularly in the Medicare-related business, will be the network. If they have a network that's not in our sweet spot, which is at the lower socioeconomic level, then we won't have any interest in it. So, we have so much organic opportunity. I mean, our pipeline is very robust. We're not really of a mind that we need that to meet our growth targets. If it's there and it makes sense, we do it.","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Christine Arnold of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi there. I know the regs were just out last night and they're voluminous. Do you guys have any first-blush takeaway, positive or negative? And can you give us a sense for potential large contracts on the RFP radar screen? Is Louisiana still on track for July 1 and where does Alabama stands?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'll agree with you on your first statement. It was voluminous and it did come out late last night. We did have a quick review of it. We see nothing that's troublesome to the Medicaid business and we're comfortable with what we've seen. We'll continue to evaluate it and if there's something different we will try to let people know through healthcare conferences and things. But right now, it seems just fine. Your second question was?","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","A sense for potential large contracts? Is Louisiana still on track by 1, and where does Alabama stand? Is there anything else we should be seeing on our radar screen?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Louisiana, we believe, is on track for July 1, and Rone, I think, Alabama is on track for...","Kenneth Rone Baldwin - Executive Vice President of Insurance Group Business Unit","Yes, Alabama is on track for the fourth quarter this year.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","For the fourth quarter this year. And then there's other ones we're obviously waiting to hear like others \u2013 I mean it's been public that we're one of the people that bid on Pennsylvania. So, we expect to hear about that momentarily and that would probably be a first quarter start. So, there's a lot out there.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. I just wanted to ask you about the exchanges. Obviously, you've got United looking to exit a number of exchanges and some of them, they're your biggest competitor at the local level. Just wanted to see what you thought or if you were at all concerned about the potential to take in some of that membership when you've got some of your competitors leaving?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think United \u2013 and I've a lot of respect for Steve Hemsley and his people and what they do and their approach to things. But they're in a different market than we are, from what I can see. They lost a lot of individuals at ACA and they're at the higher end in the platinum and the gold. To the extent that they have a membership that would fit within our model, sure, we'd take them on. But I'm not anticipating a large gain from that either, just because of the differences.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And are you looking at entering more state exchanges for 2017?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Right now, that's under evaluation and based on the results we've had to date, we would continue to do it. Obviously, it works where we have our Medicaid. I think I commented in my prepared remarks that it works well where we have a strong Medicaid product, because it \u2013 we get the term we coined, churn, in and out of Medicaid. So yes, we would do that where those factors are in place.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And I think you said that you're going to enter four states for Medicare next year.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Any color on discussions \u2013 potential discussions with provider networks and things like that, how that's progressing?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, obviously, we believe it's going well. And once again, in many conferences I've commented it's a $700 billion category, of which 65% is at 400% of the Federal poverty level and lower. And that's our sweet spot and that's where our networks are now. And so, to the extent \u2013 and that's why when people ask about some things that others may have to give up, we question the network that they serve. But we think we have in place a network that that population prefers to use and we'll just expand it, very candidly, when you're in Medicare, you have more orthopedic surgeons and other things that affect more the elderly population. And so, we are filling that out as appropriate and we have a strong team doing it.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks for the question. You're no longer spiking out loss ratios by segment. Can you give us a feeling for how those loss ratios may have progressed this year or this quarter? And then, in particular, the Medicare \u2013 I'm sorry the Medicaid expansion business, what's going on in the rate environment there?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jeff, do you want to make some comments?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think the Medicaid expansion business has been relatively consistent. I think, as you're aware, there's minimum MLR rebate payables in a lot of our states. So, the HBR year-over-year has been very consistent. I think in my prepared remarks, we mentioned improvement in the complex care HBR year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. That was really driven by what I'd say the long-term care and some of that in the duals product as well.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And in terms of what we spike out and how we do it, I think we also commented that's going to have to evolve because with the eight days of Health Net added in, it changed the mix dramatically. And yet, there was not a lot of time to take that approach and feel comfortable that we're giving you the kind of information that made sense at that point. So, we will continue to work on it. And I think we've always looked for transparency where we had confidence and we're providing sound information.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And in terms of \u2013 this is a follow-up, the specialty services business seemed to be a little bit under pressure relative to the way it's been the last year. Can you talk about what's going on there and what you expect going forward?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, if you're looking at this service revenue line, the decrease is really due to a lower volume in our Specialty Pharmacy, specifically related to hepatitis C and I think that's probably a general industry trend there. And then, we did have the loss of a co-op customer in our Pharmacy Services business.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jesse, anything you want to add to that?","Jesse N. Hunter - Chief Business Development Officer & Executive VP","No. I think that's right. I mean those are \u2013 I think as Jeff referenced on the Specialty Pharmacy front, there's some more macro trends with respect to that particular therapy and then just a one-off customer-specific item that was in the one-time category.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just following up real quick on the services line there, I mean, when should we see Health Net volumes flow through the various components within that? Are there some contractual obligations limiting your ability to kind of roll through some of maybe the pharmacy or the behavioral services into their book? So, how should we see that play out there?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I mean, I think what you'll see is if you take Centene's 2015 service revenue and roughly layer in the government services business for Health Net, then that would be kind of close to what we would expect for 2016, obviously, prorating for the nine months and eight days.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Right. But then going forward, is there \u2013 how should we think about the longer-term upside opportunity as well?","Jesse N. Hunter - Chief Business Development Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. I think the part of the issue \u2013 or Andy, this is Jesse Hunter. So, part of the issue is how that will be reported. So, you have some internal versus external. So, to the extent that you're talking about the integration, if you will, of specialty services, that is \u2013 comments there are consistent with what we talked about separately. There is very much a plan to in-source what we can in terms of the specialty services. That will happen over the course of time in a way that we feel like those things can be done efficiently and effectively. But that won't necessarily flow through the kind of the line item on the P&L that you're referencing.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then you called out the investment and expansion costs of $0.25 to $0.30, a little hard to hear on the call, but it sounded like there was only $0.02 in the quarter. So, if you can maybe talk about how those costs ramp through the year? I assume there's some pretty heavy investments in the end of the year for Nebraska. But anything else we should think about around seasonality of those cost items?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think you're right. It's probably weighted more towards the end of the year, specifically with Alabama and Nebraska.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, just one quick modeling question as well. Run rate interest expense given the timing of the debt issuance and the corridor and the swaps, I mean, what should we be thinking about for the run rate interest expense going forward?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think I gave you the \u2013 I mean, it's kind of challenging to tell you that, because a lot of our interest expense now is based on a floating rate of interest, right. So, I think I gave you the components, the $2.4 billion, obviously, the coupons we issued, the $1.6 billion is at LIBOR plus 4.3%, but it would be north of $200 million on an annualized basis.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from A.J. Rice of UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody. Maybe one granular question and then one big-picture one. In the Q1 cost trend, obviously, your MLR year-to-year improved nicely, as a lot of the Managed Care companies and providers, for that matter, are calling out leap year and Easter. And you said that flu was in line with your expectation. How about those two dynamics and how much of an impact did they have? Do they offset each other in your view? Any comments there?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. This is Jeff. I mean, I think the way we always look at leap year is just it's an extra day of medical costs when we do our forecasting when we put our budget together. I think Easter may have had a slightly favorable impact to that. But the way we really forecasted it was just we include an extra day of medical costs in the quarter.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, again, I think the improvement that you're seeing is reference to the complex care and additionally the growth in the Medicaid expansion obviously \u2013 excuse me, the Health Insurance Marketplace products, right, and they carry a lot lower HBR than our average.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Sure. Sure. Then maybe a bigger picture, there's a lot of \u2013 there's moving parts this year, even more than usual. There's always a lot of opportunities and some challenges. I wonder, if you look at the guidance that you now are blessing and reiterating with the exception of the three-and-a-half-week delay on the deal, would you point to one or two things that look like might be the \u2013 if you end up beating the estimates, coming ahead of the estimates, that those would be the likely sources of potential upside? And is there one or two things that are the challenges you face as you look out at the rest of the year?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think if we saw something that was certainly one sided I think we would adjust the guidance in line with that. So, there's no one thing that we can call out. And Jeff can add if he wishes. The only thing I'd call out that's a positive or a negative. But as I've talked about historically, we have a size and a scale that with 24, 25 states growing the number, 260 different contracts within those states, at any given time, you'll have one contract in a state that's an issue and you will have a couple that are offsetting it. So, it's the security and stability of diversification. So, that's what makes it so hard to call out any one particular thing, because I'd like to think there's no one issue that can have a total deleterious effect on the whole company. Hope that helps.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thank you. I wanted to circle back to the exchange risk mix. It looks like in the Q, risk adjusters were up about 120% versus the combined Centene-Health Net at year end and at 680,000 enrollment, I was getting up about 36% from the 500,000 range you previously talked about. So, I'm just trying to understand the delta there between the degree to which risk adjusters went up versus the degree which enrollment went up?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, this is Jeff. I mean I think you're correct. Risk adjustment, the liability payable did increase during the quarter. I would say that is a function of \u2013 I mean we're seeing the same kind of member demographics that we've seen consistently. And as you're aware, we've been in a risk adjustment payable for the last two years. So, adding additional member volume has really just increased that risk adjustment payable.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","I guess I'm \u2013 the degree of difference between the enrollment change in the adjuster balance was just surprising. One of your peers this quarter had talked about their risk mix deteriorating. So, I just wanted to make sure there wasn't any sign of that.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that may be their \u2013 that's their issue. I think in our comment I said that we saw our performance at the high end of our range. So, our experience is contrary to that. You would have to ask them why their performance is so different from ours.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Sure. Absolutely. And then I know it's early days on it, but as Zika tends to progress to South Florida, are you noticing any increased demand for OB visits or ER and how is the dialog going with the state on how to address those additional costs?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Ken, do you want to comment on the...","Ken Yamaguchi - Chief Medical Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, to-date, there has only been just symptomatic flu-type cases of Zika. There has not really been a case of the catastrophic consequences except for one in Hawaii. We're tracking that. The projections of Zika are really unpredictable based on Latin American experience. But we are optimistic that the government's position or file chief's position that the burden, the disease burden on the United States should be very small is probably very accurate. And the cost of testing or visits should be relatively minimal.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a quick...","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","...clarification or two. Thanks, Michael. Just the Health Net merger cost went up about $0.30. I know it's excluded from your adjusted earnings. But is that just the charitable contribution or was there something else in there?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Josh. The primary driver was the present value of the charitable contribution and there was some shifting of, I would say, stock compensation, severance, really spending over the quarters versus all one-time. But the charitables are the most significant item.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then what was the Health Net membership change on sort of a sequential basis, if you can just look at what Health Net membership did?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Josh, I don't think we're going to get into too much of that. I'd say it's relatively flat. But again, we're not really going to start separating the Health Net and Centene business on a going-forward basis.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think, I mean we made a very conscious decision last year that at this point now it's all Centene and we'll just reported it as a consolidated Centene business as trying to compare one from the other. I mean, I just look at the total and it's all headed the right way.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I just wanted a starting point, but that's fine. And then, just lastly on the Medicare expansion, I know you guys talked about the four new markets. What does success look like? What sort of critical mass do you need? Or should we think of this as existing Medicaid market, so infrastructure may be more in place, you don't necessarily have to see a big ramp in membership to make those plans successful next year?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think the infrastructure, of course, is in place. And the advantage we have is that we have very strong decentralized plans that, if you will, to coin a word, our local CEOs and their teams know how to indiginitize product in their market, because you don't just take something from California and parachute it in, right. So, there's that aspect of it.","I think the thing that we're cognizant of and thinking about is there's a different acquisition costs in Medicare products, some of us have done historically understand. So, it will not take a gigantic, significant amount of critical mass to start to see it provide some margin to us. But I expect in the first few quarters to have some expense that will not necessarily be fully offset by the revenue. And that's something we'll get more into at year end when we have the specifics and give guidance on 2017, as we always do.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And Michael, what's \u2013 so then, just on that, what's the network strategy? I assume you'll need to augment your networks for different providers in the Medicare business versus Medicaid and I'm curious what your thought is on rates. Are you paying off a Medicare Fee Schedule or do you think you can look something more like Medicaid?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it will be a combination depending on the particular services. And we're going to \u2013 as I said earlier, I think you're going find \u2013 you're going to have more orthopedic surgeons type. You're going to have gerontologists. You're going to have certain \u2013 you may have more of rheumatologists, those things. And some of those sub-specialties, I expect the rates will be higher than the Medicaid level, because we're not using that much in Medicaid. We're not driving the volume there. So, it's a matter of just being very surgical as we demonstrated before. But the primary care will be our current network and we'll adjust the rate as we see appropriate as we do now with the exchange versus Medicaid. But it's all in line with providing adequate, equitable reimbursement and protecting our margin.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Perfect. Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Wright of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Could you give us an update on kind of adjusted scripts on a \u2013 annually on a combined basis and maybe how that compared to before the transaction?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Scripts?","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Yeah?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","As I said, we're kind of looking at it as a total business now. And to try and break that out, it probably takes more time and energy for any benefit from our running the business.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Is that thought of as an area in the synergies category or is there any opportunity in their?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, there's synergy. Jesse, why don't you...?","Jesse N. Hunter - Chief Business Development Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, Brian, this is Jesse. So, definitely, as we referenced before, pharmacy is a meaningful part of the overall synergy story. So, the additional volume from the combined business is part of that. But we're not going to go down the path of breaking out specific script volume in conjunction with that.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I mean, I might add, Brian. I've said in various investor conferences, we're now purchasing $5 billion in pharmaceutical. So, you're going to get the benefit of that kind of scale. In my script, I commented on the purchasing power this company now has as a $40 billion company versus a $22 billion company.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Great. Great. And if I could just have one detailed follow-up, with the new exchange members, do those go into the existing MLR or new business MLR? Just how does that break out?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we include those in existing. I think our definition of new and existing was a significant \u2013 a geographical or product expansion. So, these are really in existing states. And so, we count that as organic growth and it's in the existing business.","Brian Michael Wright - Sterne Agee CRT","Great. Thank you so much.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe of Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. Good morning. Just want to circle back on the risk corridor. Is the write off, the $214 million, previously on the Health Net books or has that number changed?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, obviously, there had been \u2013 it changed, because there is activity between the December balance sheet and when we acquired the company on March 24. So, I'm not going to get into the exact number, but...","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, I mean, maybe can you help us with the timing at least in terms of when you get visibility from the government, because you wrote it down to zero, if you get anything back. I mean I know last year it was 13%. Can you help us with timing? Does that ultimately run through the P&L, if you get anything back?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I guess, the question is if we get something back, and yes it ultimately would. I mean, our requirement under accounting standards is to fair value that receivable as of the date of acquisition, using information as of the date of the acquisition. So, that's what we did. Again, these are all provisional estimates. We haven't finalized that. But that's what we did and that would be our view.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough. And then, looks like you had a fairly big increase in the return of premium payable on the balance sheet. I think it went up to about $579 million, it had been running at a couple hundred million. Is that just the addition of sort of Health Net? And is that all rebate dollars? And does that just reflect sort California coming on and the rebate back from the Medicaid expansion?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, yeah, that's \u2013 you're correct. It is the addition of Health Net. I think if you look at Health Net's 10-K, they've disclosed it over the last couple of years they've had increases in the MLR rebate payable in the California business, specifically related to the Medicaid expansion. So, that's all driven by that amount. I think the dollar amount of that rebate is somewhere north of $400 million on rebates for the Medicaid expansion business for Health Net in California.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks. Jeff, on your provisional estimates, and you referenced that you've also taken a look at medical claims reserves on the Health Net side and made some provisional estimates there. Would be willing to add some color to that directionally, magnitude, anything like that, that would help us there? I'm thinking about that in the context of the combined days claims payable dropping by a couple of days?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. No, I'm not going to get into any specifics. Again, I think the most important piece is that really with the timing of the acquisition, we've made what I would call high-level estimates and we haven't completed the analysis. And we look to complete the bulk of that analysis in the second quarter. Again, the accounting requirement's to make sure that we have those reserves at fair value as of the acquisition date. So, I mean, realistically, we should only be responsible for eight days of March, right. So, that's the work that we're looking to complete in the second quarter.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","But you're responsible for liabilities that predate the acquisition, right, because you're buying their liabilities too?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's exactly right. But we fair value those. We have not completed our analysis on those yet. And any adjustment to the opening balance sheet, again, would be a balance sheet-only adjustment.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, separate question. On the synergy commentary, Michael, you referenced the $75 million, we're familiar with that number. I think the way that was presented originally was it was $75 million for each year in addition to or over and above any savings that Health Net had previously expected to achieve through their Cognizant deal. So, I know you're expecting to get both buckets. What about the pace of achievement of the Cognizant-related savings that they're no longer Cognizant-related, but are those kind of pro rata with your synergy achievement or are they on the old schedule or how should we think about that?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's all there, it's pro rata. I mean, if you look at our guidance, it's been consistent. We're realizing it as we expected it. And you know we \u2013 Mark is familiar with all of it, having come in as CIO and just working through it and it's where we expected to be and it's pro rata and it's just as we have reported previously.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","We're achieving what we want.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Last question, what are your expectations around reduction of debt to cap over time? What's your target and by what timeframe?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Jeff, we've talked about it.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think we previously commented that we're looking to get our debt to capital ratio into the high-30% \u2013 mid-to high 30% range in the next 18 months to 24 months. I think that still continues to be the plan.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And we started off with a little higher midpoint because of the stock price, but we'll still get there.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks for fitting me in this morning. The first question's, again, on the regulatory framework for the managed Medicaid Federal MLR floor, trying to get some clarity on is this going to again be on a blended basis across the expansion in TANF lives with long-term support services, ABD and so on? And in essence, does it become a tailwind for you as you kind of cross subsidize this or does that come out of the final reg? It wasn't clear to me and does that differ by state?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","You probably had \u2013 we've had our board meetings and our committee meetings and things taking place last night and today. You probably had a little \u2013 I mean, I'm not trying to be smart about it, but you've probably had more time to look at it than we had to this point. And I just had our Washington office give us a quick summary that they see nothing deleterious to our operation and no surprises. And that's the extent I have right now until the team moves past the next day or so and then can really dig into it.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. Okay. Understood, we'll look forward to an update. Another regulatory question sort of, I guess, in 2017 I completely understand that you with the 250% sort of roughly limit on the exchanges are more profitable than those that are seeking to be more than Medicaid Plus. But next year when reinsurance goes away and then United's exiting from multiple states, might there be pressure as they're pooling the risk with you on your risk adjusters? And do you foresee margin compression in states that are...?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think if you look at \u2013 on the risk adjusting, we feel we're the net payer in our states. So, it really does not have an impact as in the same sense that somebody that has the receivable.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","But would it be a net payable to a larger degree, if you will, next year because the margins for the Aetnas and the Anthems of the world, and the Blues, will be even worse, I would imagine, unless they get a huge amount of price increase. Even if so, they may not get...?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I guess maybe I'm not following the question 100%, but I mean if our acuity goes up, our payable on risk adjustment would go down. So, if that's what you're trying to state.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","No, I was more saying that risk adjusters will be pooled \u2013 though you are profitable and maybe they are not, it's a pooled program as I understand. So, if they're in worst acuity, even though you may get better acuity, might your payable be meaningfully higher than it is in 2016? Because if they raise prices a lot, healthier people could fall off and their risk gets worse, if you will. So, I'm just wondering what happens there.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Rone?","Kenneth Rone Baldwin - Executive Vice President of Insurance Group Business Unit","Well, I think we price for the estimated risk pool in the state and we try to be careful about looking at the changes that are going to happen from one year to the next with respect to that risk pool. And I think we've had a pretty good track record with respect to being able to do that to this point. I think that if they raise their prices some of the healthier members we would hope would accrue to us with respect to that. And again, we try to carefully look at the dynamics of how that would affect the actual risk adjustment amount that we might have to reflect related to our acuity, including how the risk adjuster pool works in each state. And I think that we've reflected what we think is an accurate view of the dynamics for 2017.","Just back to another comment you mentioned that the reinsurance program is going away in 2017 and that is certainly something that will need to be reflected in our pricing in 2017 and something that we're very mindful of.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Thanks so much. Appreciate squeezing me in.","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yes. Thank you for squeezing me in. I had a question on the \u2013 I know you don't want to break it out, but when you're starting with this Health Net \u2013 large book of Health Net ACA exchange membership, is it profitable now and was it profitable when you exclude the risk corridor from that business or do you have to do something to get it to profitability? And what level of profitability is that, because I assume it's somewhat less than what Centene has realized?","Kenneth Rone Baldwin - Executive Vice President of Insurance Group Business Unit","Yeah. So, this is Rone Baldwin. In aggregate, the exchange business at Centene \u2013 excuse me, at Health Net has been profitable. The one area of challenge with respect to the exchange business at Health Net has been Arizona. And Health Net did take actions with respect to this open enrollment period to make changes in the product lineup and the pricing for Arizona to be able to get that back on track.","But California, they pursue a strategy very similar to Centene's strategy in terms of tailored narrow networks with a focus on the subsidized population. And that's worked well for them and they're seeing results in line with what we've seen on the exchanges. And this does \u2013 this is a view that also takes into account the risk corridor and with respect to not booking any receivables for it going forward.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then just one more, if I could. As you think about California moving ahead, how do you think, what's going to be the key growth driver in that market? Given the Medicaid expansion has already happened, the exchange take-up has been fairly robust, where do you grow in that market?","Michael F. Neidorff - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think there's \u2013 it will still be very balanced growth. There's probably 4 million lives unidentified \u2013 undocumented as well as unidentified Medicaid lives, plus all the categories that are there that will provide growth, this ongoing exchange business, we continue to increase penetration. So, it's what you see against all our markets with other new products and things that we do over time. And I'm not going to tip my hand to the competition what I have in mind, but we have thought and expect it to grow consistent with our rates of growth.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is a follow-up from Christine Arnold of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hey, and thank you again. I have a quick follow-up on the tax rate in 2017. You've referenced before changes to the compensation tax rate and then there has also been a new FASB rule, how should we be thinking about the tax rate in 2017, obviously, excluding HIF, like an ex-HIF tax rate, 2016 to 2017? Thanks.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I'm not going to get into 2017 tax rate guidance. We're a little early for that. But I will tell you, and we've have quoted this number before, that the HIF is roughly over 10% to our tax rate. So, that will be \u2013 obviously get you somewhere in the 40% range, but that's all I'd say at this point.","Christine Arnold - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael F.

Michael?","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene\u2019s second quarter 2019 earnings call. During the course of this morning\u2019s call, we will discuss our second quarter results and provide update on Centene\u2019s markets and products. We will also provide commentary around the healthcare legislative and regulatory environment as well as an update on the acquisition of WellCare.","Let me begin with second quarter 2019 financials. We are pleased to report another solid quarter marked by robust top and bottom line growth and operating cash flows. Membership at quarter-end was 15 million recipients. This represents an increase of 2.2 million beneficiaries with 17% over the second quarter of 2018.","Second quarter revenues increased 29% year-over-year to $18.4 billion. The HBR increased 100 basis points year-over-year to 86.7%. This was primarily attributable to the Marketplace business. As expected, margins have normalized from the favorable performance in 2018. The increase was also attributable to the HIF moratorium as well as the acquisition of Fidelis.","We reported adjusted second quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.34. This compares to $0.90 reported in the same period last year, representing 49% increase year-over-year growth. Lastly, operating cash flows came in at $917 million or 1.9 times net earnings. This is the high end of our previously stated range of 1.5 times to 2 times net earnings. These solid results reflect the benefit of our ongoing diversification strategy, which has led us to become $74 billion enterprise. We\u2019re no longer simply a Medicaid healthcare company.","One has to look at the totality of this enterprise, as the scale and diversity allows us to absorb the ups and downs in rate cycles, markets and subsidiary performance. This ensures that no one part of the portfolio can jeopardize our total organization. Jeff will provide further financial details including updated 2019 guidance in his prepared remarks.","A quick comment on medical costs. They remain stable and in line with our expectations in the low single digits. Moving onto markets and product updates; first we\u2019ll discuss Medicaid activity. Our Medicaid book of business continues to perform well in the second quarter. At June 30 we had 8.5 million recipients, represent year-over-your growth of 1.3 million or 18%. We continue to win Medicaid RFPs in new and existing states, upholding our industry-leading RFP win rate of 80%.","Now onto state updates, Oregon. In July Centene successfully re-procured its Oregon Medicaid managed care contract. We expanded our presence under this new contract adding three additional counties. We will now be operating in six counties including Metro Portland. Centene currently provides care to 92,000 beneficiaries in the state. The additional three counties will maturely increase our membership in Oregon.","We look forward to continue to work with the state demonstrating the value of integrated care, focusing on social determinants of health and maintaining sustainable cost control. The new contract is expected to commence January, 2020 and we\u2019ll run through December 31, 2024. Iowa, July 1 we began operating in Iowa\u2019s Medicaid managed care program, a new state for Centene. Operations commenced as expected and we are now providing healthcare to approximately 254,000 beneficiaries.","Iowa is committed to operating a sustainable Medicaid managed care program as evidenced by the recent rate increase which we did anticipate. We expect to achieve a normal margin within a typical ramp up period for any new Medicaid contract. Iowa marks Centene\u2019s 32nd state of operation.","New York, it has been just over one year since we closed the Fidelis acquisition and we could not be more pleased with the performance. The integration of the company is running smoothly and we are realizing our synergy and accretion targets. North Carolina, as we have previously noted, Centene won two large regions in North Carolina Medicaid RFP and has an active appeal for the balance of the state. We remained cautiously optimistic regarding our appeal.","Texas, Texas recently decided to delay the start of procurement announcement until the end of August. We remained confident in the value we bring to the state. Louisiana has also delayed the announcement of its reprocurement. We now expect to hear late July and remained confident in our prospects there.","Next Medicare, at June 30 we served just under 400,000 Medicare and MMP beneficiaries across 20 states. This represents a year-over-year increase of approximately 55,000 recipients. On a sequential basis, membership increased over 4,500 recipients. As we have previously commented, we expect 2019 MA revenue and membership to be flat compared to 2018. This is net of the actions taken by Fidelis to reestablish their poor star rating, which includes exiting 26 counties in 2019. Next year, we plan to expand into 100 counties and existing states and add one more new state, Nevada.","We will begin our joint venture with Ascension in poor geographies in 2020. Further, Centene will return to a four star MA parent rating, and the addition of WellCare\u2019s high-performing MA portfolio will bolster our MA platform. Going forward, this should accelerate profitable long-term growth in the 2020 and beyond.","Now Health Insurance Marketplace, the Marketplace business continues to perform well consistent with our expectations. At June 30 we served approximately 1.9 million exchange members across 20 states. This represents a sequential decline of 58,000 recipients, which is lower than our historic attrition rate. We continue to see higher member retention than in prior years, which we previously noted. Importantly, the key demographics of our membership remain in line with our previous remarks on this subject.","Consistent with our previous comments, our Marketplace margins continue to be in the 5% to 10% range. We continue to anticipate another strong year of operations as the national leader of exchange products and expect to continue to grow this business in 2020.","Next international, in late June we purchased an additional 40% ownership in Ribera Salud from Banco Sabadell, expanding our stake to 90%. We believe our knowledge and skills along with our leading edge IT systems has further enhanced an already strong business in Spain. We continue to look for opportunities to expand our international business. Please note, our growing international business will not distract, impede our ability to pursue the growth opportunities in the U.S.","I will now provide an update on the healthcare legislative regulatory environment. Although there appears to be [indiscernible] to revisit comprehensive healthcare reform, Congress and the administration continue exploring ways to improve healthcare delivery systems. We support the administration\u2019s decision to withdraw its rebate proposal to eliminate the existing safe harbor protection within Medicare, Medicaid.","While the Centene still needs to take up the matter, the House recently voted on a very bipartisan basis to eliminate the health insurance fee. Importantly, there are opportunities in which we can work together to bring down not only pharmaceutical costs, but costs across the entire healthcare delivery system. The administration\u2019s approach to deal with the rebate tool is another example demonstrating how Centene does not focus on short-term headline volatility. We focus on the facts as we know them today.","We continue to advocate for greater price transparency, which includes moving towards net pricing and pharmacy. In the same rate, we commend Congress on their bipartisan effort to take steps to reduce the amount of money Americans pay out of their pocket for their healthcare costs by ending surprise billings. We continue to see efforts both in Washington State that further stabilize the marketplace.","The administration\u2019s final rule allowing employers to offer HRAs as an option to pay for marketplace coverage provides an opportunity to have a positive impact on premiums. Also, pending waivers in Utah and Georgia, aim to stabilize the marketplace to provide affordable comprehensive coverage to those between 100% and 250% for the Federal poverty level. This has a potential to improve affordability for those with and without subsidies.","As exemplified by Georgia, states are taking the lead with meaningful discussions on how to improve and expand government healthcare programs. They are focusing on taking private sector solutions to enhance quality and lower cost of healthcare. We are well positioned to be supportive of these efforts. We are encouraged by anything that moves us back from politics to policy. Centene is committed to working with both parties on bipartisan solutions that strengthens the nation\u2019s healthcare delivery system.","I would now like to provide an update on the acquisition of WellCare. We were pleased shareholders of both Centene and WellCare overwhelmingly to approve the acquisition on June 24. We appreciate the mandate of our investors as they recognize the value of this transaction. Regulatory discussions are well underway and have been very constructive.","Both companies are currently working through the state insurance approval process, required for the completion of the transaction. The requirement Form As and Es have been filed in 27 states. Additional approvals have been obtained in eight states, which is ahead of schedule. We\u2019re applicable, the divestiture process is underway, and we are pleased to be seeing a great deal of interest in potential acquirers.","Centene and WellCare have each received a request for additional information and documented materials from the Department of Justice. This was expected given the size of this transaction. Both companies continue to work expeditiously and cooperatively with the DOJ.","Integration planning is well underway. Our teams are doing extensive work to ensure a smooth and seamless combination of the companies. Both companies are fully engaged and integration planning is progressing well. We remind you that the combined company will have estimated pro forma 2019 revenues in excess of $100 billion and EBITDA of $5 billion. We are comfortable with our previously communicated synergy and accretion targets. We continue to be comfortable that we will receive all necessary approvals to close the deal in the first half of 2020. Given the progress of activities to date, there may be an opportunity to close earlier in 2020.","Shifting gear to our RADAR growth. We expect a composite Medicaid rate increase of approximately 1.5% to 2% for 2019. In summary, Centene continues to be a growth company both organically and to M&A. Our targeted pipeline remains robust. We continue to focus on margin expansion and already realizing benefits from our Centene board transformation project.","The pending WellCare acquisition firmly solidifies our 2020 vision of maintaining our industry-leading position in the highly competitive government-sponsored healthcare market. We look forward to leveraging the strength of each company brings in terms of providing high quality healthcare at lower costs to our recipients and state customers.","We thank you for your continued interest in Centene. And I\u2019ll now turn it over to Jeff.","Jeff Schwaneke","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning we reported solid second quarter 2019 results. Second quarter revenues were $18.4 billion, an increase of 29% over the second quarter of 2018, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.34 this quarter compared to $0.90 last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2019 was driven by solid performance across our business segments. The reconciliation of the 2018 marketplace risk adjustment, which exceeded our expectations by $0.05 per diluted share and $0.03 per diluted share associated with a gain on the Ribera Salud acquisition.","Let me provide additional details for the quarter. Total revenues grew by approximately $4.2 billion over the second quarter of 2018, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Fidelis Care, growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2018 and 2019, particularly Arkansas, New Mexico and Pennsylvania. This growth was partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019.","Moving on to HBR, our health benefits ratio was 86.7% in the second quarter of this year compared to 85.7% in last year\u2019s second quarter and 85.7% in the first quarter of 2019. The HBR increase was primarily driven by the performance in the Marketplace business, the acquisition of Fidelis, which operates at a higher HBR and the health insurer fee moratorium. As we have highlighted previously at our Investor Day, we expected a return to more normalized margins in 2019 for our marketplace business.","Additionally, we continue to experience a higher membership retention rate compared to prior years. As members stay with us longer, it increases medical costs in the HBR. I just want to emphasize that this is a slight increase and we are still well within our 5% to 10% pre-tax margin targets for the product. Sequentially, the 100 basis point increase in HBR from the first quarter of 2019 is primarily due to the performance and seasonality in the Health Insurance Marketplace business.","Before I get into SG&A, let me provide an update on the Marketplace business. As expected and highlighted at our Investor Day, the final risk adjustment was lower than our year-end accrual by $238 million. Additionally, after adjusting for other risk sharing programs, including ML, MLRs, our estimated RADV adjustment and other programs, the net amount exceeded our expectations by approximately $31 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Recall, we had included approximately $100 million in our annual guidance. This benefit was driven by our Centene Forward program and as highlighted during our Investor Day in June, we are reinvesting this amount and other Centene Forward initiatives in the back half of the year.","Now on to SG&A. Our adjusted selling general and administrative expense ratio was 9% in the second quarter of this year compared to 9.6% last year and 9.5% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by the acquisition of Fidelis Care, which lowered the ratio by 60 basis points. The sequential decrease is primarily due to the higher selling costs in the first quarter associated with the Marketplace and Medicare products. Additionally, we spent $0.04 per diluted share in business expansion costs during the second quarter.","Investment in other income was $120 million during the second quarter compared to $65 million last year and $99 million last quarter. The increase reflects increased investment balances over 2018 as a result of the Fidelis Care acquisition, higher interest rates and a gain of $16 million associated with this step up and basis of our previously held equity investment in Ribera Salud upon acquiring a controlling interest. Sequentially, investment income increase due to the previously mentioned gain on the acquisition of Ribera Salud recognized in the second quarter.","Interest expense was $101 million for the second quarter 2019 compared to $80 million last year and $99 million last quarter. The increase year-over-year was driven by the additional debt to fund the Fidelis acquisition and higher interest rates associated with our interest rate swaps. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 25.7% compared to 36.9% in the second quarter of 2018, which reflects the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium.","Now onto the balance sheet. Cash and investments total $15.9 billion at quarter-end, including $801 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be an excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Debt at quarter-end was $7.1 billion, which includes $513 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility.","Our debt to capital ratio was 36.3% excluding our non-recourse debt compared to 36.7% last year and 36.5% at the first quarter of 2019. Our medical claims liability totaled $7.4 billion at quarter-end and represents 47 days in claims payable compared to 48 days in the first quarter of 2019. We continue to expect the DCP to be in the mid-40 range on a run rate basis with the inclusion of Fidelis.","Cash flow provided by operations was $917 million in the second quarter or 1.9 times earnings. The cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter of 2019 was due to net earnings collections as premium and trade receivables and an increase in other long-term liabilities driven by the risk adjustment payable for the Health Insurance Marketplace business in 2019.","Lastly, I would like to highlight a few of the changes to our 2019 annual guidance. We are increasing the total revenues guidance at the midpoint by $700 million to reflect the second quarter results in higher membership retention in the Marketplace business. Additionally, we are increasing our GAAP and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance at the midpoints by $0.03 and $0.05 per share respectively associated with the second quarter performance and the gain from the Ribera Salud acquisition.","While risk adjustment delivered an additional $0.05 per diluted share of earnings during the quarter, we are reinvesting the additional earnings and other initiatives to accelerate the Centene Forward program. Overall, the operating metrics for the second quarter were good across all of our business segments. We believe the continued growth in revenue provides opportunity for future earnings growth.","That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Scott Fidel","I just wanted to start on the exchanges. And maybe just update us in terms of the margin front. I know that you\u2019re still within that 5% to 10% range. Just interested in terms of are you tracking sort of right to where you had thought previously? And any sense in terms of within that range you maybe sort of tracking for the year.","Then just as a follow-up, just on the exchanges as well. Just interested, we\u2019re seeing a lot of the rate filings coming out and the proposed rates for 2020. And just interested in your updated views on how the pricing environment appears to be trending for 2020 and the exchanges and just reviews on whether competition is increasing in the marketplace? Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Okay. I want to start-off with the margins, make a little comment on competition, and then let Jeff and Kevin and others comment. The margins are well within a 5% to 10% targeted range. I cannot emphasize enough to everybody that in this business and I\u2019ve said this historically at Investor Day so many times, you will see movement up and down within that range.","Now in this instance, we commented our retention of membership has been longer than typically \u2013 what we have typically seen. That means we are going to get increased revenue because we\u2019re retaining that membership. They will reach their maximum amount of pockets. And so some of the cost will go up, but we\u2019ll still have increased revenue and increased earnings from that increase. It\u2019s the nature of this insurance business. And it\u2019s really what one expects. And the longer we retain a member, the better it is, because over time, we have demonstrated we\u2019re keeping for a long period of time, we\u2019re bringing the cost down for that person.","So as I said, it\u2019s a little frustrating to see people concerned about a margin and moving the margin which is doing so well within the range is normal health insurance performance and shows that this business is really growing and performing as we expected to. And we\u2019ve commented earlier to expect this. So from a margin standpoint, it\u2019s doing just what we wanted to do and what we expected to do. And we see that continuing. And the longer you keep the member, the higher the MLR it might go. But also you get all that incremental revenue, in the end which gives you actual dollar earnings increases, and the shareholders, everybody benefit from it.","I\u2019ll start off a little bit from the competitive standpoint, but we like competition. And we think it\u2019s important we have \u2013 it just makes us better. And we\u2019ve also commented that in our segment, which is 400% the Federal poverty level and below that it\u2019s fully subsidized, highly subsidized and therefore price in those types of issues do not give somebody trying to commit on price and advantage. So I think this is a solid business. The actions we took in building it and becoming a leader of it I think it\u2019s going to pay a lot of dividends for our shareholders going forward.","Jeff, anything you want to add?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I think Michael addressed the member staying longer comment. I think the only thing I would like to bifurcate is we did talk about \u2013 previously about margin normalization and if marketplace margins would be consistent with 2017, 2016 and 2015 and that 2018 was a very good year. And so that piece was completely expected in our forecast.","And then the second piece, I think that Michael mentioned here was the member staying longer, which just to highlight, we\u2019ve increased our guidance, our revenue guidance over $1.4 billion for the first and second quarters here, really due to the member retention and them staying longer. And I completely agree with the comments you stated about them.","Michael Neidorff","I want to make one more comment. When we have a $75 billion business, similarly, you have a $20 billion, $30 billion business. And we have more complexity, you have more products, you have more states. It\u2019s going to be some variability, but it\u2019s really a very strong position to be in. And that it really affords us the offsets. And with that site business and now going international \u2013 even every market they may have an issue. It\u2019s no different than investors that have funds and have a stock that maybe is not [indiscernible] if others have offset it. Marketplace is one of our key strengths and I can\u2019t emphasize that enough, Scott.","Scott Fidel","Got it. And it sounds like Michael, so just to clarify on 2020, with what you\u2019re seeing the pricing at this point, it sounds like you\u2019re still comfortable with the growth rates that you\u2019ve been targeting in that market for next year.","Michael Neidorff","Yes. I think I commented in my prepared remarks that I expected to grow next year. So \u2013 and I think that\u2019s \u2013 and I still feel that way.","Scott Fidel","Okay, thanks for the color.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin Fischbeck","Good morning, thanks. So I guess maybe two questions. First question being when you think about the guidance update, there are a few item in there. You had the $0.03 gain, and then you had the $0.05 that came in, but I think you\u2019re spending $0.05 away. When you think about the components of the guidance raise because I think the raise is a little bit less than what the beat leverage versus consensus in the quarter. How do you think about that guidance raise? How much of that is kind of core operational earnings versus kind of one-time things versus potential offsets as far as reinvestments?","Michael Neidorff","I will make one comment and Jeff can go into all the detail you want, okay. But what we\u2019re trying to say is that we have this Centene Forward, which is really working well. It\u2019s going to \u2013 it\u2019s used to freed up funds to invest in technology, the things that are paying big dividends going forward, couldn\u2019t be more pleased with it. What happened is we started to realize results in this quarter. And the shovel-ready projects won\u2019t be ready until next quarter. So we had to take the earnings but \u2013 and in fact said, we\u2019ve taken the earnings this quarter. But next quarter, we\u2019re going to have the expense. And Jeff, you might just further\u2026","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I mean, a couple of things I would say is that if you\u2019re comparing to I think, the consensus number, I think that was around $1.24, that\u2019s $0.10. So we were at $1.34. So that\u2019s a $0.10 beat. $0.05 is really driven by what Michael mentioned to Centene Forward, which we\u2019re reinvesting in the back half of the year. And then you would have another, call it, $0.05, $0.03, from the Ribera Salud gain and call it $0.02 from operations, if you\u2019re comparing to consensus. And so I would say the guidance raise was in line with that. It\u2019s the $0.03 from the Ribera Salud gain plus $0.02 from operations, again if you\u2019re comparing against consensus that we increase the guidance by.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess, the second question being, it looks like you raised the MLR guidance by 10 basis points. Can you talk a little bit about what was driving that? I would have thought that the better exchange enrollment and retention might have helped bring that MLR down a little bit.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. So if you\u2019re comparing to year-over-year and specifically for this year, I think Michael commented on the higher member retention. So what we did have in the forecast was the margin normalization. And we talked about that at our December and probably Q1 earnings calls that we anticipated that exchange margins would be similar to 2017 and prior and then 2018 was a very good year.","And so Michael commented on the membership retention and if members are staying longer and so it\u2019s increase in the HBR, the margins just a little bit and that\u2019s why we did the tenth on the increase in the HBR guidance.","Michael Neidorff","In other words, Kevin, they stay longer, so they reach the maximum amount of profit. It doesn\u2019t mean that their health conditions have deteriorated, if anything. Over time, we\u2019ll see improvements the longer we keep them. But that\u2019s really why you see that jump \u2013 it\u2019s a normalization of the business. And the good news is I like the fact we\u2019re retaining people, this is longer term, we\u2019re going to have a very strong base there.","Kevin Fischbeck","I mean, I clearly can see why the higher MLR versus a normal exchange person. But I thought a normal exchange person had below average MLR. So even if it was higher than an average exchange person it might be lower than your consolidated MLR. You\u2019re saying that if you keep them longer, it\u2019s actually higher than your consolidated MLR, which holds up your consolidated MLR?","Jeff Schwaneke","No. No. It\u2019s just higher than our previous expectations, Kevin. I mean, we had \u2013 I mean, if you look at the Q1 and Q2 how we raised guidance at the top line, that\u2019s over \u2013 almost $1.4 billion of additional revenue. And what we\u2019re saying is that that MLR is higher than our expectations that we originally had. So the members are staying longer, which is outside of our expectations well and we\u2019re adjusting the forecast for that.","Kevin Fischbeck","All right, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just want to ask on the $0.05 that gets reinvested. I guess first question is on the $0.05. That reinvestment in Centene Forward, does any of that go into the MLR line or is that all G&A?","Jeff Schwaneke","The bulk of that would have been in the G&A line.","Josh Raskin","Okay, got it.","Michael Neidorff","But it is, Josh. It\u2019s a lot of investments. In other words, we will continue to update our systems. And we\u2019ve said when we\u2019re going to be investing in that and that\u2019s going to deliver longer return, real efficiencies. And so this whole effort on reducing our G&A costs and reinvesting that money without affecting our earnings stream, as expected, that\u2019s where it\u2019s all about. It\u2019s recognized that growth.","Josh Raskin","Okay. That makes sense. And then my real question is just from a strategic standpoint Michael, you alluded to the potential to close WellCare slightly earlier than it sounded like, by the end of the first half of next year. It sounds like you\u2019re seeing some progress on the regulatory front that gives you some comfort there. So my question on that is does that do anything strategically? As you think about the Medicare advantage line, any other investments or branding or your M&A strategy or anything along those lines that changed based on your ability to potentially close the transaction faster?","Michael Neidorff","Well, I think that, okay, one, I mean your first thing was right, we\u2019re seeing a lot of success with the states, they understand it. We\u2019ve good discussions with Justice. We understand their role and what they have to do and providing them all the material on a expeditious basis. And I want to just cautiously let people know it\u2019s going well enough that it could close earlier.","Now the sooner it closes and we get the company integrated, the sooner we\u2019re prepared to move ahead with some accelerated activity we have in mind. But we\u2019re going to be patient and manage it through carefully after we\u2019ve demonstrated this is fully integrated. We\u2019re not going to bite off more than we can chew. And we know how they integrate companies. We\u2019ve demonstrated that. And so anything that picks up that speed just puts us in a position to do something sooner.","Josh Raskin","Perfect, perfect. Thank you, Michael.","Operator","The next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. The DoDs talked about TRICARE moving to risks on the next RFP. Can you help size what that would mean for Centene if you retain the same region? And are there any quality metrics for that contract you can share with us that gives us insight onto how Centene is performing from the DoD\u2019s viewpoint?","Michael Neidorff","Kevin, you want to take that?","Kevin Counihan","Sure. Hi, good morning. We\u2019ve been working very closely with DoD for a while about this potential new arrangement and also with House and Senate Armed Services Committees. There\u2019s \u2013 to your point, there\u2019s a variety of different thinking going on within DHA as well as in House and Senate Armed Services Committees about what that final new benefit plan might look like.","The risk arrangement that you\u2019re talking about is one of the things that they\u2019re considering. But there\u2019s a lot of different things they\u2019re considering too with respect to care management, with respect to value-based contracting, with respect to network design. We\u2019re very pleased to be at the table and providing a lot of different recommendations and ideas to them.","Sarah James","Got it. And when do you think that you\u2019ll know how the contract will evolve and potential difference in size of the new contract versus what it\u2019s contributing to Centene now?","Kevin Counihan","Well, as you\u2019re probably aware, there\u2019s a leadership change that\u2019s going to be taking place over the next couple of months. And so our thinking is probably, after that takes place, which is probably in the late summer or early fall, we\u2019ll probably no more. So I would imagine with the next three to six months.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yes, good morning. Could you talk a little bit about Medicaid medical cost trend and the components of that. Was interested in what the implications are for Iowa in the latter part of the year and maybe as a contributor to MLR guidance, just given the withdrawal of the one of competitors in the end market?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. This is Jeff, Lance. I think what Michael said, we continue to see stable, stable cost trends in the Medicaid business. And as far as Iowa, it\u2019s nothing has changed. I would say our commentary around Iowa has been that we don\u2019t have that forecast that are projected to be a contributor to earnings in the first six months of operation for this year. And I think Michael had reiterated in his commentary, his prepared remarks that we do see kind of a normal, what I would call Medicaid margin profile on a going-forward basis.","Michael Neidorff","Yes. We typically have said that we always book at a higher level for the first three quarters and so, sometimes four. But it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s losing, it\u2019s just \u2013 it may be breakeven \u2013 but a new business, we work with our providers, on evolution not revolution and so it is an educational process as we work through it, and they\u2019re in our systems and things. So, we see it performing normally as all new markets do.","Lance Wilkes","And is the membership you\u2019re getting there kind of all above what your original expectations were or is it in line with those original expectations in your\u2026","Michael Neidorff","Chris, you want to comment on that?","Chris Bowers","Sure, sure. Thanks, Michael. We \u2013 as I think Michael mentioned in his remarks, we\u2019re at about 254,000. We do expect to come in close to our anticipated membership of 300,000 by the end of the year.","Michael Neidorff","So, we do see a growing and being a very effective market for us.","Lance Wilkes","Great. Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","Yes. if I could just ask the first question on the Texas RFP, The Texas Contract Awards, is there any visibility on the timing at this point?","Michael Neidorff","Yes. They\u2019ve indicated the end of August. But I\u2019ve said historically, but I think my quote is, I don\u2019t put my hand in fire for any stage in their timings.","Matt Borsch","Okay.","Michael Neidorff","Because as they do what they want, we\u2019re still confident that it\u2019s going to continue to be a good opportunity for us.","Matt Borsch","Okay. Okay. And if I could also ask, you\u2019ve talked about supporting price transparency, should I \u2013 should we take that to mean that you would support the initiative to have hospitals and insurers, essentially open up their books in terms of their negotiated rates and if so, do you think that would be something good for pricing and good for Centene?","Michael Neidorff","I think, I don\u2019t think that everything I\u2019ve read about it. Historically, where they\u2019ve tried those kinds of things, it tends to have a negative impact on pricing. All prices seem to rise to the highest level now dropped to the lowest level. I don\u2019t think \u2013 I don\u2019t think that would be good. What I\u2019m talking about is, particularly in pharmacy, I think there has been an absence because of replacing things on transparency there and we are working aggressively the move to net pricing on the pharmacy product.","Matt Borsch","Okay. And I\u2019m sorry, just last \u2013 one last one, which is, do you think that that you\u2019ll see a substantial impact from the \u2013 you\u2019ve touched on the HRA, the ability of employers to use HRAs for employees to pay ACA premiums. Do you think that\u2019s going to have significant follow through?","Michael Neidorff","I think that there\u2019s an opportunity there. But I have not quantified it yet, but team hasn\u2019t, but I think we see it as potential upside, having no downside risk to us. It\u2019s only good, but we have the risk to see how it\u2019s reacted and hopefully, in future calls we\u2019ll be able to do more guidance on it.","Matt Borsch","All right. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","Good morning guys. Thanks for the question.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Steve Tanal","I just wanted to dig into some of the specifics as much as you\u2019re willing to share on risk adjustments. So, in the queue, it sounds like $238 million favorable reduction in payables, but then a net pretax benefit of $131 million and so two questions. First, the offset sound like minimum MLRs and RADV. So, we\u2019d love if you could quantify those. But then getting back to the $0.05, it sounds like that number could have been a lot higher and I want to understand if there\u2019s any \u2013 if there\u2019s been a change, that\u2019s sort of permanent in nature and the way you\u2019ll accrue for this going forward. Does this mean that the marketplace business is more profitable essentially now that than you had been occurring for it? Just that how should we think about all that? Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","I\u2019m going to turn that over to our resident expert of risk adjustment. Jeff?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, thanks. Yes, thanks. So, we previewed this obviously at the Investor Day said, we thought at the time, it was going to be more than $200 million, so $238 million is the number. I would say I would size the minimum MLR and the RADV as the two largest components of the offsets and primarily of equal magnitude. One thing to highlight just about RADV specifically is it gets finalized in August of this year, and this is the first year that they\u2019re doing the RADV adjustment for the marketplace. And they\u2019ve decided not to collect the funds with the RADV adjustment until 2021. And as a result, there\u2019s really, there was no ability for us to offset the RADV adjustment in our minimum MLR calculation.","Meaning usually, the MLR calculations, the last, right, so you would have a RADV adjustment that would then be calculated into the minimum MLR, but as this was the first year for the RADV adjustment, we were unable to do that. So, some of the RADV adjustment would have been mitigated in our minimum MLR calculations. But it wasn\u2019t for this quarter, because of the unique circumstance. But I guess what I would say is, the Centene Forward program delivered good value and continues to do that on the risk adjustment side and I think that\u2019s a good thing long-term.","Michael Neidorff","And I just want to add this, I want to remind everybody that there\u2019s two elements to risk adjustment, one that we control that\u2019s how well we do a medical expense in our risk. But if somebody else has a negative, has a different than expected result, that impacts us and that\u2019s outside our control. So, when you look at this, it\u2019s not just how we\u2019re doing, but what the total market in a particular product is doing? I think I\u2019m telling you what you already know.","Steve Tanal","Yes, absolutely. And I guess just the $238 million; it\u2019s pretty sizable on a percentage basis. So just over the last sort of follow-up phases that you guys expect to make any changes to the way you occur or is it going to be consistent going forward?","Jeff Schwaneke","Again, I mean, we were following GAAP, right? So, our job is to make the best estimate at the end of each quarter and at the end of each year. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. So, yes, if we have historical information that indicates that we\u2019re performing better than we would absolutely include that information into our estimates.","Steve Tanal","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi. Good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Dave Windley","Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to follow up on MLR just with a cadence question. I think the first half; MLR is up about 120 basis points year-over-year. The guidance implies as the second half would be up a little less than that. Your update on exchange sounds like that drags the back half of the year up a little bit. So, I wondered kind of what\u2019s the offset that makes that year-over-year change smaller in the second half is it\u2019s Fidelis, is that, is that it exclusively or are there other factors? Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Well, I think if you\u2019re comparing year-over-year first half to second half, obviously, Fidelis is a change, meaning we did not have that in the first half of last year, right? And we do have Fidelis in the first half of this year. And as we\u2019ve commented, they were running higher HBR than the Centene-based business when we did the acquisition. So that is definitely a driver.","Dave Windley","And then just quick follow-up on a separate topic. There are, Michael, some enrollment moving parts sequentially in both your TANF\/CHIP and ABD\/LTSS categories. Could you describe what some of the moving parts are there, and then is the international line now just the change in the ownership base in Ribera Salud? Is that what drives that that addition? Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Yes. I\u2019m going to \u2013 I\u2019ll start and then Jeff pick up. Obviously, TANF are allowed aslong-term care et cetera. Now, we\u2019ve got a new business in the east side of Pennsylvania and other things. So, there are moving parts affected by new businesses coming in and all these categories. And so that\u2019s going move it to move it up, down around, but over time will smooth out. Jeff, do you want to pick up on the second part of that?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. On the second piece, your spot on, when we took control of the Ribera Salud, we\u2019ve included those members now, in our membership reporting tables. So that\u2019s the change there.","Dave Windley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions are asked and answered. But I might like to understand a couple of details. First off, what are the incremental startup costs in the fourth quarter from Oregon? And second, what are the changes to your reported earnings, revenues, MLR, and minority interest line for Ribera Salud and the change in ownership there?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. So, first question that there were \u2013 there are costs obviously associated with the Oregon startup and we had a placeholder in our original startup cost guidance. So, it fits well within what we\u2019d already previously communicated. And then the second thing when you\u2019re talking about the consolidation, now obviously, we would \u2013 the net earnings impact is in theory the same other than we have more share of those earnings. But now, we will include the revenue and we\u2019d had that in the guidance, because we had a \u2013 we knew this was \u2013 acquisition was coming. So, we\u2019d already had that the previous guidance.","Peter Costa","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hi, everybody. First off just to ask about the \u2013 an update on the PBM side of the business. I think Mississippi and Nebraska, you\u2019re rolling out RxAdvance. Any learnings from that? Maybe talk about the cadence of further roll outs there. And I know RxAdvance is talking about additional capabilities that they have care management help, operating efficiency help. Are you exploring any of that? And what kind of opportunity might that be?","Michael Neidorff","I\u2019ll ask Brandy and Kevin to pick up on that. Brandy?","Brandy Burkhalter","Hi, A.J. It\u2019s Brandy Burkhalter. So, we are currently live in six states with just over one million lives on the RxAdvance platform and very pleased with our progress in what we\u2019re seeing today. And we look forward to, I guess, exploring the new things that RxAdvance platform allows us to do. And so we\u2019ll have more to come in the future \u2013 our future calls, but very pleased with the progress today.","Kevin Counihan","Yes. If I could just amplify a little bit with brandy had said. this is Kevin. I think one of the core learnings that we\u2019ve had is the importance of engaging independent pharmacies, very early on in the process. So, we get out to the IPA, the independent pharmacy association early. We talk about what we\u2019re doing, why we\u2019re doing it, and what the new website is going to look like? Get in their newsletter, things of that sort. So that\u2019s been a core learning.","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Now, you\u2019re coming up on a year with Fidelis. I know when that deal was originally struck, there was an expectation of improving the medical loss ratio or trend, but also may be, given a little bit back in the G&A area, but that positive. Can you talk, maybe as you look back over the last year, has it developed as you expected? Are you ahead of plan, but a little bit behind, and how much is there still further things to do once you anniversary this?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. this is Jeff. And it\u2019s \u2013 I think Michael has mentioned this previously, but it\u2019s been a very good deal for the company. It\u2019s performing in line with expectations. We\u2019re capturing the synergies that we thought we would and I would see the initiatives and what we expected at the beginning where we were going to invest more G&A dollars to lower the medical costs have actually have occurred. And so we\u2019re pleased with the performance and I think there\u2019s still more opportunity for continued improvement and we\u2019re working on those actions as we speak.","A.J. Rice","Okay.","Michael Neidorff","Hey guys. As commented before that if we could find more Fidelis, I do one in the morning and one in the afternoon.","A.J. Rice","Okay, okay.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. Absolutely.","A.J. Rice","Just the last question. This guy has raised by one of your larger competitors that already reported the question of a prior period development. You don\u2019t specifically put that in the press release at least overtly. Any comment about relative to a normal quarter prior period development and that you realize this quarter relative to last year first quarter?","Michael Neidorff","It\u2019s been normal. Jeff, you think\u2026","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. it\u2019s been normal. I mean A.J., we\u2019ve talked about this before. I mean what we really focus on is the consistency, right? Of development. Meaning, we have a consistent process, we use claims received, we use an impatient validation methodology. So, our methodology is a little unique compared to others in the industry, but we look for consistency and I think ours has been consistent for a long time.","A.J. Rice","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. Most of my questions answered. So, just two quick follow-ups. It sounds like from the commentary, this is correct, but I just wanted to confirm it still on, in Spain, it was 50% ownership before, but it was not consolidated in the financials and now at 19% or wherever you are \u2013 it will be, is that correct?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Jeff Schwaneke","That is correct, yes.","Gary Taylor","Okay. And then just my other one, just going back to the exchanges and certainly acknowledging your commentary that you thought, margins would normalize to some degree after 2018. we saw in the first quarter when we look at the stat filings that, that the loss ratios and exchanges up about 300 basis points. So, when we get a chance to see that again for the 2Q, is that going to be a pretty consistent trajectory or should we anticipate based on some of your retention comments that maybe that\u2019s up a little more?","Jeff Schwaneke","No. I guess what I would say is, I think it will be up. The other thing you have to realize is when you\u2019re looking at there\u2019s a difference between the statutory and the GAAP HBRs that we talk about. So, that\u2019s all I would highlight. But yes, it will be up on a year-over-year basis.","Gary Taylor","Okay, thank you.","Michael Neidorff","As expected \u2013 go ahead.","Operator","Go ahead. Sorry.","Michael Neidorff","No. That\u2019s it.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning.","Jeff Schwaneke","Good morning.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning. First, just a question on exchanges, I appreciate the comment on the 2020 membership growth; I wanted to ask about margins. Should we expect margins to normalize lower again in 2020 or do you see the current margin is sustainable into next year?","Michael Neidorff","I think when you look at margins; it\u2019s going to be a puncture of the business you continue to attract, how long you retain your existing membership? There\u2019s multiple variables there. And what\u2019s important to me, and I said this though, we talk about a 5% to 10% range. We see nothing that\u2019s going to change that. It\u2019s going to move up and down within that range based on retention, on the membership, you attract, a series of things and that\u2019s to be expected in any insurance business.","Now as it grows and as you keep people longer, you\u2019ll see some leveling off of it. because they\u2019re being managed or under control, but \u2013 in the law of larger numbers, such as price. So, I guess going into as we look at 2020, we\u2019ll give more guidance in December, which is our standard factors versus try and get into too much at this stage and we\u2019ll have one more history at that point to understand what our retention is? What the membership is? I remind you every year, we\u2019ve retained 80% of the previous year\u2019s membership. So, all those factors come into play, Justin.","Justin Lake","Sure, that makes sense. Maybe, another way to ask it, if you\u2019re saying 5% to 10% is a reasonable range or margins, and obviously, we could pick the midpoint of 7.5%, because this year, if we think about 7.5% is the kind of midpoint of normal? Would this year be below or above that midpoint?","Michael Neidorff","Well, we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t \u2013 I\u2019m not going to get into that to that level of detail, because once again, it\u2019s a very large business and it\u2019s a growing business, it is \u2013 and we started getting that by night. We\u2019re losing sight of what this total $75 billion, soon to be a $100 billion company. So, you have to look at it in a totality and we don\u2019t look at it and say is it going to be 8%, 8.2%, 8.1%. We look at the totality of all our businesses and we beat from operations by $0.02 and that\u2019s kind of the way we look at it, Justin.","Justin Lake","Totally reasonable. Okay. And if I could just ask a quick follow-up on the MLR, you took up the guidance as we \u2013 as you mentioned by 10 basis points, just trying to figure out where that is coming from, the consensus was 86.3% this quarter, but I know you don\u2019t buy quarterly. So, we could have clearly gotten it wrong. I\u2019m just curious how the quarter that MLR looked versus your internal expectations. Was it \u2013 it was the 86.7% in line or was it a little bit higher or are you taking off the back half of the year, because of the higher retention rate? And really, the second quarter was fine relatively\u2026","Jeff Schwaneke","No, it was \u2013 yes, I mean versus our expectations, it was in line. I mean the marketplace business was in line. I mean I that\u2019s our view.","Justin Lake","So, 86.7% is pretty much where you had expected it. And the 10 basis point guide up for the year is really just taken up the back half of the year for higher retention. Is that the way we should think about this?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. that\u2019s correct.","Justin Lake","Okay.","Jeff Schwaneke","Because remember, I mean Michael explained this at the beginning. Remember, there\u2019s deductibles and maximum amount of pockets, right? So the longer \u2013 you can do the math there.","Justin Lake","Sure. Maybe you could just tell us what is \u2013 like, the member that drops off in the middle of the year that you typically see, what\u2019s the MLR on that member versus the MLR of someone else?","Michael Neidorff","Justin, we have 1.9 million members. You want to tell me which one you\u2019re thinking about? I mean, seriously, [indiscernible] but I mean, you think about it, 1.9 million members. One could have an MLR of 72%. One could have an MLR of 85%. I mean, it\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s no way of doing that.","Justin Lake","All right. I leave it there. Thanks guys.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to clarify quickly. The incremental benefit from risk adjustment comes through the MLR, right? So it benefit ratio by about 20 basis points this quarter, is that fair?","Jeff Schwaneke","You\u2019re correct. It does come through the MLR as a component of revenue, right? It\u2019s a revenue adjustment.","Ralph Giacobbe","Right. Okay. And then second question, maybe just \u2013 or back to the exchanges here, but a little bit of a different angle. Can you talk about the provider networks on the exchange at this point, how that\u2019s kind of evolved over time of you sort of adding or narrowing offerings?","And then, I guess more importantly, can you help us in terms of the annual rate bump to providers? Is that similar to kind of a composite Medicaid rate that you typically see in that low-single digit range? Or is it more like a pure commercial rate bump that maybe more in the CPI plus level? And maybe more importantly how that trended overtime? Can you give us a sense for that as you\u2019ve obviously entered into new markets? Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. That\u2019s a lot there. So first, we\u2019re not going to get into the provider specific rate increases for providers, right? But the other thing as I would say is, we continue to manage our provider network to offer competitive product and be successful and grow the business. And so that\u2019s what we continue to focus on, and that\u2019s what we continue to do, and make sure that our members have access to the highest quality care.","Michael Neidorff","And I just might add. I\u2019ve commented we\u2019re moving more and more to these risk-based contracts and providers have managed the business. And it goes back to the old fashion managing your patient and do incredibly well with that because it puts in control how they\u2019re practicing medicine. So we think there\u2019s real opportunities, where providers will do very well in our business.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you. And I want to \u2013 I just wanted to emphasize that as we sit here as a group today, we really feel very good about the business on where it is. It\u2019s performing well. It\u2019s firing on all 12 cylinders, and on balance, as you can see, there\u2019s a growth, there\u2019s people operations. We\u2019re dealing with all the issues. And so we look forward to continuing to report what we consider to be very successful quarters. Thank you for your time and look forward to seeing you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's first quarter 2015 earnings call. ","We were pleased to have started 2015 with another successful quarterly performance marked by exceptional top- and bottom-line growth. We expect this momentum to continue throughout the year and are raising our 2015 financial guidance accordingly. Bill will provide details on our enhanced outlook. During the course of this morning\u2019s call, we will discuss our strong first quarter results and provide update on Centene\u2019s market and products.","I will begin with first quarter highlights. We added 1.4 million members compared to the first quarter of 2014. This represents a 44% increase to 4.4 million beneficiaries. First quarter premium and service revenues grew 42% year-over-year to $4.8 billion.","The HBR increased 50 basis points year-over-year to 89.8%. This reflects an increase in the higher acuity membership as well as a higher flu cost, compared to last year\u2019s relatively mild flu season. Importantly, this fell within our planning assumptions and guidance. Bill will deliver further HBR detail, including new and existing business mix.","Overall, we continue to see as well as anticipate stable medical cost trends. We recorded first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.52, compared to $0.29 in last year\u2019s first quarter. I would like to note that the ACA health insurer fee had no impact on the first quarter 2015 earnings as we have secured agreement with our state for 100% of the fee on a grossed up basis.","Now on to market and product update. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. Louisiana, we added over 200,000 full risk members in the first quarter as the state transitioned out of a shared saving ASO model. At March 31, we had approximately 360,000 recipients in Louisiana, which is above the high-end of our prior guidance of 320,000 to 350,000. Centene is now the largest Medicaid managed care organization in the state.","Indiana, in February, we commenced operations under the state\u2019s new program Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0. This contract is proceeding according to plan. We expect membership to continue to increase throughout 2015. Separately, in April, Centene began serving ABD beneficiaries in Indiana under the state\u2019s new Hoosier Care Connect Program.","Texas, in February, we successfully re-secured our exclusive Foster Care contract intent. At March 31, Centene served approximately 30,000 children under this program. Centene created this innovative product with Texas in 2008 to meet the specific health care needs of a vulnerable population. Since that time, we have served over 100,000 Foster Care beneficiaries in this space. Also, this quarter, Texas began carving and nursing facilities benefit for its STAR+PLUS program.","Missouri, in March, Centene was selected to continue serving Medicaid beneficiaries in Missouri. As part of the state\u2019s reprocurement process, this contract is expected to begin in the third quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we served over 75,000 members in Missouri.","Moving on to duals. At March 31, we served 12,600 members across our dual demonstration contracts in Illinois, Ohio, South Carolina, and Texas. We are now reporting our dual membership as individuals who receive both Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries through a Centene health plan. For year-end 2014, we noted approximately 16,000 duals. This included Ohio beneficiaries receiving Medicaid, but not Medicare through a Centene health plan. Overall, these contracts are performing in line with our projections. For example, this includes an approximate 30% opt out rate in Ohio. We expect our Michigan dual program to begin in the second quarter.","Next, Centurion. Last week, Centurion was recommended for an award to provide correctional healthcare services to 17,000 individuals incarcerated in Mississippi. Operations are expected to commence in the third quarter of 2015. This is Centurion\u2019s fifth state correctional program.","Now, Health Insurance Marketplace. Marketplace membership doubled in the first quarter. At March 31, we served approximately 162,000 members in select regions across 11 states. Please note, this is the membership level at the conclusion of the open enrollment period. Membership will likely diminish slightly throughout the course of 2015. Over 90% of these beneficiaries were subsidy eligible consistent with Centene\u2019s marketplace strategy. The demographics remain in line with our pricing.","A quick comment on international, we are pleased with our investments in Spain and the UK, also proceeding as expected. We continue to look for additional international opportunities particularly in Spain. Shifting gears, our rate outlook, we continue to project a 2015 composite rate adjustment of flat to 1%.","In conclusion, first quarter results offer further evidence of Centene\u2019s financial strength and operating capabilities. Centene\u2019s pipeline of future opportunities remain robust. We continue to explore new growth and diversification prospects both domestically and internationally, while maintaining focus on margins.","We look forward to seeing you at our June 12 Investor Day in New York City. Thank you for your interest in Centene. Bill will now provide further details on our first quarter financial results. Bill?","Bill Scheffel","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Our first quarter results are consistent with the growth rate we have experienced over the last several years. Membership increased 44% year-over-year, an increase of almost 1.4 million members, and our premium and service revenues increased 42% year-over-year totaling $4.8 billion. The revenue increase between years of $1.4 billion is a result of a full quarter\u2019s impact this year from expansions and new programs in 2014 in a number of our states, particularly Florida, Illinois, and Ohio.","We increased our full risk membership in Louisiana this quarter as the new contract began, which eliminated the shared savings program and we converted 200,000 of these members to the at-risk program. In the first quarter, we also began serving additional members in Indiana for the Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0 program and we began covering nursing facility benefits in Texas. ","Service revenue increased 64% year-over-year primarily from our carrier health specialty pharmacy business. During the quarter, we received an agreement in California for the full reimbursement of the health insurer fee on a grossed up basis for income taxes. We now have agreements going forward in all of our states for reimbursement of the health insurer fee.","The consolidated health benefits ratio this quarter was 89.8%, an increase of 50 basis points over both last year\u2019s first quarter and the fourth quarter of 2014. The increase year-over-year is primarily due to the increase in higher acuity membership, which carries a higher health benefits ratio and a lower G&A ratio and higher flu cost this year, when compared to our relatively mild season last year. The increase from the fourth quarter is primarily seasonal as the first quarter is typically our highest HBR quarter.","In the first quarter, approximately 23% of our revenues were from new business compared to 20% in the first quarter of 2014. The HBR for new business was 91.0%, compared to 89.5% from existing business. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.5% this quarter, compared to 8.8% in Q1 of 2014 and 8.2% in Q4 of 2014. The 30 basis point decrease year-over-year reflects additional scale this year and the incurrence of acquisition transaction cost for U.S. medical management in Q1 of last year.","Business expansion cost, excluding the acquisition transaction cost totaled $0.06 this year, compared to $0.03 from last year\u2019s first quarter. Investment income was $9 million for Q1 and interest expense was $10 million. During the first quarter, we issued $200 million of additional 4.75% senior notes and simultaneously entered into $200 million of interest rate swap agreements, which have an interest rate of 2.88%, plus the three-month LIBOR.","The effective income tax rate was 49.2% in Q1, compared to 51.5% last year. The relatively higher tax rates are due to the non-deductibility of the health insurance fee. Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations was $0.52 this year, compared to $0.29 last year. Last year\u2019s number included a $0.11 impact from the health insurance fee and transaction cost.","Diluted shares outstanding were 122.6 million shares for this year, compared to 118.7 million shares in Q1 last year. Cash, investments and restricted deposits totaled $3 billion at March 31, including $97 million held by unregulated entities. For risk based capital, we continue to maintain capital in the excess of 350% of the authorized control level, excluding any interim statutory impact related to the health insurance fee.","Our medical claims liability was almost $2 billion at March 31, and represented 45.5 days in claims payable. Our total debt was $1.1 billion at quarter-end, including $125 million of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement. Our debt-to-capital ratio, excluding our $69 million non-recourse mortgage note was 36.6%, compared to 31.7% at year-end. Cash flow from operations was $45 million, which was 0.7 times net earnings. This is a lower level than we have been running, primarily as a result of one-state changing the timing of their payment to us. This resulted in our receiving only two monthly capitation payments during the quarter. Going forward we will receive three payments each quarter.","Our 2015 guidance numbers have been updated to reflect our first quarter performance. For the full year 2015, we expect premium and service revenues of $20.5 billion to $21 billion, diluted earnings per share $2.60 to $2.72, consolidated health benefits ratio of 89.2% to 89.6%, G&A expense ratio 8.0% to 8.4%, effective income tax rate of 48% to 50%, and diluted shares outstanding of 123 million to 124 million shares.","As has been our policy, our guidance numbers do not include any impact from acquisitions, which have not yet closed. Lastly, our business expansion costs are estimated to be between $0.22 to $0.25 per share for this year. This concludes my remarks and operator you may now open the line for questions. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, Sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Hi, thanks. Just skimming to the Q, I just want to confirm, it looks like there was a $10 million benefit from the Louisiana transaction and then I saw $10 million for charitable contributions to foundation. Is it fair to say those were offsetting and no impact to the P&L together?","Bill Scheffel","I think that\u2019s correct.","Josh Raskin","Okay. Okay. Second question, on the commercial revenues, your health insurance exchange membership came in a little bit stronger than we were looking for. Are you guys still below the 2% threshold for the deductibility of compensation expense?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, we are still below in our plans forecast and our approach to it. So it\u2019s continuing to be below 2%.","Josh Raskin","Okay. And maybe that as you trail down through the rest of the year, is that sort of fair to say?","Michael Neidorff","Yeah, there is various ways we approach it and we are ensuring that we do stay below it.","Josh Raskin","Okay. Thank you, Michael. And then just last one on sort of RFP pipeline and any changes in guidance, the revenues are up a couple of hundred million bucks. Is any of that a change in your assumptions around your underlying business or is that just sort of Centurion and things that you\u2019ve announced, I guess maybe just oppose that with how the current RFP pipeline look?","Michael Neidorff","Bill, do you want to comment on the [indiscernible]?","Bill Scheffel","I think our guidance increases generally reflecting the impact of several of the outstanding RFPs we had at the end of the year were the reprocurements. Those were all now baked into our guidance, Arizona, Missouri, and the Texas Foster Care and a few other changes that we\u2019ve had an update from that point in time. So, I\u2019ll let Jesse speak to the open RFP.","Jesse Hunter","Yeah, Josh, I would speak to just \u2013 as it relates to the cycle, there were number of RFPs that are in process right now. Once those come to their natural conclusion and we will reflect those in our results accordingly.","Josh Raskin","Okay. But you are assuming like existing business like Georgia et cetera, I assume you\u2019ve just got an assumption of reprocurement. I mean, I\u2019m curious if Ohio was [ph] in there or anything else?","Bill Scheffel","So, Georgia would not really impact 2015, I think that\u2019s a July 2016 effective date. So I think that with respect to the remainder of the year, we are not anticipating any changes in terms of particular wins or losses in our guidance numbers.","Michael Neidorff","If we go after the new state assembly, we never included those. It\u2019s one rewarded and we don\u2019t comment on until the state announces that particular [indiscernible]. ","Josh Raskin","Okay. Alright, perfect, thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Steve Baxter","Hi, this is actually Steve Baxter on for Kevin. I was hoping you could talk about the performance of the Florida MMA and Long Term Care Programs. I guess can you talk about your progress in managing medical cost lower since the launch of these contracts? And I guess whether you see a path towards sustainable margin in these businesses without receiving a rate increase from the state?","Michael Neidorff","Well, we continue to \u2013 I\u2019ll let Rone and others add to it. We continue working effectively with the state. We are looking at the rate side as well, but obviously, where you can see from the guidance we continue to believe we will achieve our goals there in that market. Anything you want to add, Rone?","Rone Baldwin","Well, we always anticipate a level of pressure with respect to the HBR in the initial year of our program and that\u2019s something that we expect. We saw that with the LTC program and we saw working with the state getting to a more appropriate place with respect to the program. We are seeing similar pressure in the MMA program and it\u2019s something that\u2019s actively been discussed among all the plans in Florida and the state of Florida as well.","Steve Baxter","And is there\u2026","Jesse Hunter","We\u2019re optimistic that this \u2013 we\u2019ve had a long history in Florida. They\u2019ve been a good partner to work with. As Rone indicated, Long Term Care was resolved last year particularly in the fourth quarter and we would expect in 2015 to have similar changes impacting the MMA program.","Steve Baxter","Okay. Now that makes sense, I guess has there been any update on the discussion around the formulary in Florida, because it seems like that would be a potentially painless way for the state to come up with a fix without necessarily having to budget more money?","Michael Neidorff","We talk about it, but as was the case last year, our guidance and budgeting includes the formulary as it is today. And if we affect any changes, we can reflect that, but as it is conservative and appropriate to not plan on one at this time.","Steve Baxter","Okay thanks and then I guess in terms of the composite rate update of 0% to 1% is there an assumption in there for Florida?","Michael Neidorff","Well it is a mix of all the plans to what amount, but \u2026","Bill Scheffel ","We\u2019ve not anticipated in the guidance numbers any significant change in the MMA program for 2015. We\u2019ve included in our guidance and where we are right now, and so we will wait and see how that progresses during the course of the year. ","Steve Baxter","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question will come from Brian Wright of Sterne, Agee. Please go ahead.","Brian Wright","Thanks good morning. I apologize if I missed this, but did you quantify the impact of flu on the quarter?","Bill Scheffel ","We didn\u2019t put specific dollars in there. I think that from our perspective we really have, last year the 13, 14 season was a relatively mild season. We anticipated in our guidance that we would have a more average flu season and I think what we probably had was slightly above average, but within our range of expectations and estimates that we had for flu during the course of this current year. So, I think from our standpoint we don\u2019t really want to quantify specific numbers, others say was within our range of expectations. ","Brian Wright","Okay. And then, so how do we think about see \u2013 historically borrowing product mix, historically the second quarter has been a better quarter than the first quarter, is that \u2013 I would expect kind of given where flu was this year that this year that trend would continue, is there any reason to not think that that would occur. ","Michael Neidorff ","Typically the first quarter is our highest cost quarter and so we have seen that year-after-year, so\u2026","Brian Wright","Okay. And then just one last follow-up if I can, the sequential increase in the services revenue, how much of that was, you told us primarily that year-over-year increase in services was a carrier, was most of the sequential increase that carry as well?","Bill Scheffel ","Yes.","Brian Wright","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead. ","Sarah James","Thank you. As some of the complex care contracts anniversary and move into the existing business line, how should we think about what an appropriate existing MLR looks like in 2015 to 2017?","Michael Neidorff ","I think that the first year obviously has been running higher. We think this is going to run closer to our longer term expectations by the time you get into the second year, but the complex care products are rated generally at a higher HBR up unto the low 90s in most cases. So, we would expect that we would have that normal progression. We give you our health benefits ratio guidance of 89.2% to 89.6%, we feel that\u2019s a good number for the whole year on a blended basis without trying to break that into a complex care and everything else. But we do expect as we\u2019ve added more complex care. So we will start rolling over into be existing business, but it won\u2019t have a dramatic impact in our overall HBR other than what we show in our guidance. ","Sarah James","Got it. And wonder if your peers, roll-out their Medicaid revenue guidance based on those opt-out turning higher than expected, can you speak to how opt-out levels are trending in your market and how that compares to your expectation?","Michael Neidorff","Bill you want to make a comment on this?","Bill Scheffel","Opt-out has affected us in our dual demonstration programs really in Ohio with this point and as Michael mentioned, our opt-out rate in his opening comments, our opt-out rate was 30% which was approximately 30%, which was very much in-line with our expectations. So, our experience with opt-out has been very much in accordance with what our projections were at this point?","Sarah James","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andy Schenker","Thanks good morning. Maybe if you could just talk about obviously you gave the flat to 1%, but within that any views on the price declines for expansion rate, if you guys have less exposure than maybe some of our peers expansions there?","Michael Neidorff ","Yeah, I think we have to be recognizing that this ongoing discussions with a lot of states is probably prudent to not get too specific on any one state to indicate what our expectations are.","Bill Scheffel","I think the one thing that I would mention is, on the Medicaid expansion business, in many of the states it started out with relatively high rates, but it had a minimum HBR. So what\u2019s happened and we had to accrue for the minimum, so to the extent that they reduced rates, it also reduced the amount that we have to pay back to the states for the minimum. So I don\u2019t think overall it\u2019s going to have much of an impact on our overall rate increase number because we were already accruing for that payback.","Andy Schenker","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Maybe change of direction here, since [indiscernible] announced another win in that program here, maybe if you could just talk to us a little bit more about how we should think about that business longer term here, the type of margin potential and it sounds like RFP is coming to market at a faster rate versus maybe your original expectations or how should we think about those opportunities coming to market? Thank you.","Michael Neidorff","Jesse?","Jesse Hunter","So, thanks for the question. Obviously, we are excited about the momentum on the correctional space with our fifth contract. And one of the things that we\u2019ve looked at from the beginning is, in the context of our \u2013 broadening our offerings for our state customers, I think Mississippi is a good example of that where we already have a strong presence in that market.","But there are \u2013 I think the reason we are going after these opportunities, there is a number of states that either have correctional programs that are coming up for bid or these services are changing or states on current departments of corrections that are moving in that general direction. So we are seeing what, I would call, a strong momentum in that area. That\u2019s a subset of the pipeline that is, I\u2019d say, quite active at this point and we are fortunate to be successful in that.","To your other question, these are going to be relatively smaller. It\u2019s not going to be the same size as, say, our health plan contracts by example. But we do think that there are some of the pricing dynamics that we talk more generally about our 3% to 5% pre-tax margin objectives. We\u2019ve had reason to believe in our initial experience that we can achieve that in the correctional space as well.","Andy Schenker","And then, just a quick follow-up on that. How do you guys consider this business, as a government business, commercial business, does it apply to the de minimis rule?","Jesse Hunter","Yeah, we definitely would consider this to be a government business.","Andy Schenker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Hi, just like to get a little more clarity on the $11 per member per month drop in revenue sequentially from fourth quarter to the first quarter. You think with the higher acuity business that would be going higher or was there some one-time items in either the fourth quarter or the first quarter that caused that to drop?","Jesse Hunter","It takes a couple of things. In the fourth quarter, we received some additional revenue in Florida on Long Term Care and a few other things which sort of raised the PMPM number in the fourth quarter. And in Q1, we also added a large membership in Louisiana for two months, which ends up showing a lower PMPM when you do that calculation. So there is nothing unusual in there.","Michael Neidorff","It\u2019s a timing mix.","Peter Costa","And rate had no impact on that, really the 0% to 1% rate is relatively true for the first quarter here?","Michael Neidorff","Yes.","Bill Scheffel","Yes.","Peter Costa","Okay. And any updates on Kentucky and what\u2019s going on there, if you don\u2019t mind?","Michael Neidorff","Well, as we\u2019ve said many times, we don\u2019t comment on litigation, so it continues to wind its way through the various courts. And as promised, it\u2019s going to take some time.","Peter Costa","Okay. Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","I might add we are still optimistic.","Operator","Our next question will come from Matt Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","Yes. Hi, I might have missed this earlier in the call, but can you talk about the 3R\u2019s and I realize it\u2019s not a big business for you, but have you finished \u2013 it looked like from the state insurance report, you did actually quite well on the exchanges in terms of underwriting results at least based on Celtic. So can you address that and then how you are treating the 3R\u2019s to come into 2015?","Bill Scheffel","Sure. I think that with respect to 2014, we did finish out better probably than we anticipated we do. And based on the information that we have and our estimations on risk adjustment for example, we estimate there will be a payer and we will have to pay back in, same thing on the risk corridor. And there is a footnote in our 10-Q on the amounts that we have as receivables and payables for December 31 and March 31, and so you can look there for additional detail. And so, we think that in 2015, it\u2019s early to have any solid predictions for the year, but right now, based on our current estimates, we\u2019re assuming we will be in a similar position on risk adjustment given we have a similar membership and the characteristics of the membership that we\u2019ve added in the states of the same.","Michael Neidorff","And those numbers have been approved. So\u2026","Bill Scheffel","Yeah, it\u2019s all\u2026","Michael Neidorff","[indiscernible] footnote. All these numbers are included, so there is no impact on the recorded earnings.","Matt Borsch","Got it. And maybe on a separate level, can you give us some sense of how many of your states you\u2019re running up against \u2013 or I should say, for full year 2014, you were running up against points where you needed to payback rebates? And I\u2019m sorry, if you disclosed this information already.","Jesse Hunter","I don\u2019t think we get into level of detail by state, but generally, I would say, most, if not all.","Matt Borsch","Okay.","Michael Neidorff","We feel pretty consistent in that.","Jesse Hunter","Yeah.","Matt Borsch","Alright. Alright, thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Yeah, thanks, good morning. So the first question is about your G&A. You came in at 8.8%, but you are reiterating 8% to 8.4%. I\u2019m curious about how those synergies are playing out with your CHS transaction in Louisiana, and if that\u2019s the driver of your guidance reiteration? And then going beyond that, if this OpEx leverage as your growing membership in existing states and shifting next to lower G&A products, what is your normalized G&A likely to be and when might you get there?","Bill Scheffel","Sure. I think for the first quarter, our G&A rate was 8.5% and our guidance for the whole year is 8.0% to 8.4%. So I think typically what happens in the first quarter, we are making our normal estimates for the whole year i.e. one fourth of the estimate [ph] for lot of items. In the fourth quarter, those accrued up to actual when you get to the end of the year. So I think we are probably a little more conservative in the first quarter on the G&A, then we might \u2013 which will play out during the course of the year. And I think that we\u2019ve also got additional revenues coming on during the course of the year. The membership for example in Louisiana was only there for two months in the first quarter as opposed to the whole quarter. And so that will have an impact \u2013 slight impact to the rest of the year also.","Ana Gupte","Okay. Thanks. So it sounds like you make 8.2%, but 8.2% your floor or can you get below that going forward? On the midpoint basis, with all the\u2026?","Bill Scheffel","I think there is a lot of different things that go into that in terms of additions in other types of business that we have, so that the mix can be an important element of that. But generally, when we peal back some of the nonrecurring items, let\u2019s say, we are seeing a definite improvement in our G&A ratio and reduction as we gain leverage with the additional revenue growth.","Ana Gupte","Okay, thanks. The second question, I\u2019m hearing again that any day this federal regulation is due for managed Medicaid and you\u2019ve talked about the rates and context of MLR floors in many states. And I think one of your competitors has been talking about cross subsidization of over earning with under earning segments. What might you be expecting going forward and what are companies like you lobbying for with CMS?","Michael Neidorff","I think, we expect minimum [indiscernible] is actively engaged on those regulations and working through it and we are comfortable that the regulations that will come out as best we can estimate it to this point in time will be consistent with our expectations and guidance.","Ana Gupte","Okay, thanks. And then last one on Georgia, any update on that as far as the current RFP and then the likelihood of ABD being privatized as well?","Michael Neidorff","[indiscernible] The RFP will continue to respond to it and we have real confidence on that. I\u2019m confident on that [indiscernible] equivocally and we are very confident on it. And as far as the additional products that have been not included in the RFP at this point in time and until they do, we presume they are not. Anything you want to add, Jesse?","Jesse Hunter","No, I think that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve certainly been preparing for reprocurement in Georgia for a long time. We are strong believers in our performance. We are doing everything we can to retain that contract and put ourselves into position that if the programs do expand, we will be able to participate in that.","Ana Gupte","Great, thanks so much, very helpful.","Operator","Our next question will come from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg","Hi good morning. I apologize if you already provided some color on this stuff, but the HPR for this sort of the traditional Medicaid chip foster care line, we you gave the detail did go up pretty meaningfully year-to-year and that looks like a slightly different trend than what we saw at the end of 2014, is there anything going on there that\u2019s notable?","Bill Scheffel","I would say that there is, you know mix comes into play in the growth that we have in some of those areas like we added in Louisiana, several hundred thousand members and so we\u2019re relatively conservative in the initial estimates for a new block of business and so that continues. Nothing I would say of any great consequence that there is true-ups in the fourth quarter sometimes, but the MMA business in Florida is still running a little higher than what the original actuarial targeted rate would be that the State set that causes some increase.","Michael Neidorff","I mean there is no underlying major increase in trend. We added 200,000 in Louisiana and that\u2019s \u2013 we always built as you know new membership at a higher MMR for the first few quarters. ","Chris Rigg","Okay. Just a follow-up on one of their earlier questions related to the RFP pipeline and clearly understand sensitivity is when you are actually involved in a process and not wanting to sort of predict the outcome, but right now we sort of have visibility that Iowa is coming down the pike and I think some more smaller chunks in maybe Louisiana, but are there any notable RPFs out there that we The Street might not be aware of that are worth highlighting to people just to get a sense for what might be coming next year [indiscernible] these invisibility and something that\u2019s known to you guys, but not to us.","Michael Neidorff","Jesse?","Jesse Hunter","I would say the answer is yes, that\u2019s part of our job. Our job obviously is to create some of these opportunities that we have visibility before we can communicate those things more broadly, both for you and for competitors and others. So, I think we\u2019re \u2013 I would say we continue to be very active on that front and optimistic that we will maintain momentum to create opportunities in new markets and additional opportunities in our existing markets.","Chris Rigg","Okay, alright, I will leave it at that. Thanks a lot guys.","Michael Neidorff ","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Styblo","Sure, good morning. It\u2019s Dave Styblo for Windley. Couple of questions, just want to start off with your capital structure that the cap is up now to 37% since steadily rising over the last several years, just curious where you guys see that shaking out in the long-term and your appetite for continuing to put on more debt versus when you might need to tap into the equity markets if ever?","Michael Neidorff ","I think that the reason that it is up in the first quarter is we had I think about $188 million of capital contributions into our subs in the first quarter. So that\u2019s a higher proportion in the first quarter than the whole, I think the whole year is around 550. So we put more than the proportion, you know the one-fourth of it in the first quarter for a number of reasons and so as a result it\u2019s a little higher now, we expect it to trend downward for the rest of calendar year and I think as we say, have been doing some of the acquisitions we\u2019ve been doing we include equity as a meaningful part of the consideration, one way or the other and I think we have still as a practice that we want to continue to follow. So, I think we are comfortable with where we are in the debt-to-cap ratio in the mid-30s. We expect to continue to be there, given the interest rates that make sense to be there and so that\u2019s our plan. ","Dave Styblo","Okay, and then at a conference last month, you had mentioned that your 2% to 3% net income margin, long term margin was partially depended on interest rates picking up and getting some sort of benefit from that, I\u2019m curious, how much of an impact from your call it, 1.5% level this year would be baked into that 2% to 3% goal?","Michael Neidorff ","I think we said, we are looking to be in the 2% to 3%, but above the 3% over time from operations. And that additional upside beyond that would be a function of interest income. ","Dave Styblo","Okay. So the 2% to 3% doesn\u2019t \u2013 you don\u2019t need any benefit from the interest income?","Michael Neidorff","We may get some from it while we are blooming through the operation side, improving operations margins, but that 2% to 3% should be from operations.","Bill Scheffel","And none of that is baked into 2015, we are not \u2013 we\u2019re considering flat rates for the year in our guidance calculations.","Dave Styblo","Okay. And then lastly just on the business expansion cost that you\u2019ve reiterated, curious how do we think about these evolving over time at some point, do you \u2013 is there some sort of leverage where you are able to possibly pull that number on down or is that sort of a sustained level that\u2019s needed as you continue to reprocure business or go after new business?","Michael Neidorff","A lot of it\u2019s going to be a size of the particular deal that we do. And so, its \u2013 there is many factors as we get larger, obviously, we expect more of if we can absorb [ph] it. We are also looking at other capabilities, other deals that maybe larger some point in time.","Bill Scheffel","I think we\u2019ve seen the market expand over the last several years as indicated by our revenue growth. So we are a key participant in that. And so I would not expect our business expansion cost to go down. I would expect they would continue to go up and that\u2019s what drives us a large revenue increase. So I would say more the same.","Dave Styblo","Sure. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. First question and sorry if this has already been addressed in the prepared remarks, but where you paid yet for the Texas industry fee that you had accrued for at the end of the year and if not in the first quarter, when are you expecting to receive that payment?","Bill Scheffel","I think the plans in Texas are to pay that in the second quarter and so everything is on target for that I believe.","Scott Fidel","Okay. And then just a second question, just on the existing MLR, looks like that increased year-over-year, was that really just a function of increased flu pressure or were there some other factor worth spiking out? And then also with Florida MMA, is that included within existing business or is that included within new business in the first quarter?","Bill Scheffel","MMA is in both because we had some pretty \u2013 we already had existing business Medicaid, TANF business in Florida market before they expanded to the whole state. I think our increase year-over-year in our HBR is really driven, we said earlier, by the mix. We continue to have higher acuity membership, which drives that.","And then when you are comparing first quarter this year to first quarter last year, last year was a relatively mild flu season. This year, we said it was a more normal average or slightly above average season, but it was within our expectations and guidance forecast. So, nothing unusual on that regard and typical first quarter has the higher \u2013 seasonally it\u2019s the highest HBR quarter for us.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Michael Neidorff for his closing remarks.","Michael Neidorff","We thank you for joining us. We look forward to seeing you June 12 in New York for our Investor Day and take care.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded.

Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in Centene\u2019s most recent Form 10-Q filed October 22, 2019 today and the Form 10-K dated February 19, 2019 and other public SEC filings.","Centene anticipates that subsequent events and developments will cause its estimates to change.

Michael?","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene\u2019s third quarter 2019 earnings call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our third quarter results and provide updates on Centene\u2019s markets and products. We'll also provide commentary around the healthcare legislative and regulatory environment, as well as an update on the acquisition of WellCare.","Let me begin with the third quarter 2019 financials. We are pleased with our third quarter results, which delivered strong top and bottom line growth. These results reflect the growth in our marketplace business, new Medicaid contracts and programs, and demonstrate the benefits of our diversified healthcare enterprise.","Membership at quarter end was 15.3 million recipients. This represents an increase of 884,000 beneficiaries or 6% over the third quarter of 2018. Third quarter revenues increased 17% year-over-year to $19 billion.","Adjusted third quarter diluted earnings per share were $0.96. This compares to $0.89 reported in the same period last year, representing 8% year-over-year growth. The $0.96 excludes a 271 million or $0.57 per diluted share non-cash impairment charge. Virtually all related to the write down of goodwill and intangible assets of our U.S. medical management subsidiary.","The third quarter HBR was 88.2% representing an increase of 190 basis points year-over-year. The HBR was impacted by a number of non-operational items, which accounted for 180 of the 190 basis point increase year-over-year. 100 basis points of the increase was attributable to the California In-Home Support Services reconciliation in the third quarter of 2018. This benefited last year the third quarter of 2018 HBR by 100 basis points. The health insurance, the moratorium increased HBR by 50 basis points quarter-over-quarter. The impact from the at-risk, state directed payments in California, was 30 basis points this quarter. I also remind you the third quarter of 2019 HBR reflects new contracts in Pennsylvania, Iowa and New Mexico, which carry higher HBRs in their first year of operation.","On a sequential basis, the HBR increased 150 basis points, which is primarily attributable to the normal seasonality of the marketplace business. Consistent with prior years, our marketplace business has higher medical expenses as the year progresses, as more members reach the out-of-pocket maximums.","The previous mentioned at-risk, state directed payments also contributed to this sequential increase of HBR. Moving into markets and product updates. First, Medicaid, our Medicaid business continues to grow benefiting from new contracts such as Iowa, New Mexico and Pennsylvania.","In aggregate, membership grew approximately 3% sequentially and approximately 1% year-over-year to 8.7 million recipients. Our new business more than offset the enrollment and revenue headwinds caused by ongoing eligibility, redeterminations in certain states. The redetermination process can cause an adverse impact on acuity levels as these enrollment members tend to have a lower HBR. We view this as a temporary issue as we continue to work with our state partners to appropriately adjust our rates.","Next, state updates North Carolina. We are pleased to announce Centene was successful in its appeal of the North Carolina Medicaid managed care RFP, resulting in an expansion of our North Carolina Medicaid contract.","Our provider led North Carolina subsidiary was awarded an additional region, which includes the Raleigh\/Durham area. With the addition of this region, we will now be providing managed care services in three regions; Region three Charlotte area, region four Raleigh\/Durham area, and region five Wilmington and Fayetteville areas.","According to stated data, these regions represent approximately 60% of total Medicaid beneficiaries covered under the program. This new three year contract is expected to commence February 1st of 2020, and includes the option to renew up to two additional years.","Texas, Texas has rescheduled its STAR+PLUS reprocurement asset until sometime later this month. The STAR and CHIP reprocurement announcement is expected in December. We remain confident that our performance and value are recognized by the state.","Louisiana, we were disappointed to not have been selected for the Medicaid contract in Louisiana, and it\u2019s recent reprocurement. We performed an extensive review of the scoring and evaluation process, and as a result, filed a protest with the state. We anticipate a decision on our appeal from the procurement officer later this month, and remain cautiously optimistic. The state is considering using emergency contracts with the incumbents to eliminate member disruption until the appeal is resolved.","New Hampshire, on September 1, we commenced operations under our new Medicaid Managed Care contract in the state. This was a successful reprocurement of an existing contract. We are now serving just under 80,000 beneficiaries in New Hampshire, which is marginally higher year-over-year.","Now Medicare. At September 30, we served approximately 405,000 Medicare and MMP beneficiaries across 20 states. This represents a year-over-year decline of approximately 30,000 recipients, which is the result of planned actions taken by Fidelis to re-establish a four star rating.","On a sequential basis, membership increased by 6000 recipients. Next year, we plan on expanding into 1000 counties and existing states in any one new state Nevada. Further Centene will return to a four star MA parent rating in 2020.","We will begin our joint venture with Ascension in four locations next year, and look forward to developing this as another potential growth engine. On the health insurance marketplaces, the marketplace business continues to perform well in the third quarter consistent with our expectations.","At September 30, we served approximately 1.9 million exchange members across 20 states. This represents a sequential decline of approximately 51,000 recipients. This is consistent with the higher member retention we are experiencing this year. Our marketplace margins continue to be within a range of 5 % to 10%.","We anticipate another strong year of operations as a national leader of exchange products. We aim to grow the business in 2020 as we expand our footprint in 10 of our existing states. I\u2019ll now provide an update on the healthcare legislative and regulatory environment.","We continue to expect most of the activity will be at the state level and in the courts. Earlier this month, a federal judge in New York blocked the implementation of the administration's public [Indiscernible]. This rule will make it more difficult for legal immigrants to obtain green cards, if they have utilized certain benefits including Medicaid and housing assistance.","In addition, we are actively monitoring the pending decision from the Fifth Circuit related to the Affordable Care Act, and the Individual Mandate. Even considering these potential issues, we remain focused on delivering against our vision which is to be the leading provider of government sponsored healthcare. We believe the demand for affordable high quality healthcare coverage will remain at constant and durable driver of long term growth for us.","Over the last 30 plus years, we have remained focused on adding value to communities under various regulatory environments. Many states are seeking to improve access and affordability. We view this as an opportunity for Centene to be an innovative partner with these states.","We continue to work to ensure issues such as pharmaceutical costs, surprise billing, and the health insurer fee are recognized and are a focus for policy makers and regulators. A couple of quick comments.","High medical costs; they remain stable and in line with our expectations in the low-single digits. On our rate outlook, we expect a composite Medicaid rate increase of approximately 1.75% to 2.25% for 2019. This is slightly higher than our previous expectations, due to increases that mitigate the higher acuity levels associated with the eligibility redetermination I previously mentioned.","I will now provide an update on the acquisition of WellCare. The approval process continues to go well and is ahead of schedule. Conditional approvals have been obtained in all, but two states; Illinois and New Jersey.","WellCare and Centene continue to work expeditiously and cooperatively with the Department of Justice. The divestiture process reached an important milestone in September, when WellCare signed a definitive agreement to sell its Missouri and Nebraska Medicaid health plans to Anthem.","The comprehensive integration planning process is well underway. Both of these are fully engaged and are doing extensive work to ensure a smooth and seamless combination. We remain comfortable with our previously communicated synergy and accretion targets. We continue to believe, we will receive all necessary approvals to close the transaction by the first half of 2020.","Given the progress of activities to date, there may be an opportunity to close earlier in 2020. Next, I\u2019d like to make some preliminary comments on 2020 guidance. Note that my comments exclude the WellCare acquisition, and include the Louisiana contract, which is currently being protested. They also assume a higher tax rate due to the return of the health insurance fee.","We are still finalizing our annual planning process, but based on our reviews to date, we expect revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share for 2020 to be consistent with the forecast included in the Form S-4 filed in conjunction with WellCare acquisition.","As is our custom, we will provide full details on 2020 guidance at our Investor Day on December 13 in New York City. In summary, we continue to deliver against the strategy and vision for Centene to be the leading government-sponsored healthcare provider. The scale and diversity of our enterprise allows us to absorb the ups and downs of rate cycles, markets and subsidiary performance.","This, is while simultaneously driving profitable growth both organically into M&A. Our targeted pipeline remains robust with more than ample opportunities. The WellCare acquisition will enhance our ability to provide recipients with access to affordable high quality services and blocks as well as deliver fair compensation for providers, increase shadings for states.","In addition, technology and innovation remain key differentiators across our enterprise, and we remain highly focused on furthering our capabilities and maximizing the impact of our investments in this area.","Fortune increasingly recognized Centene as number seven in their \"Change the World\" List through our Provider Accessibility Initiative. I recently announced strategic partnership with Walgreens and RxAdvance addresses a growing need for new approaches to pharmacy benefits management, particularly in Medicaid.","This innovative model aims to increase transparency, enhance customer experience and ultimately result in better health outcomes at lower cost. We remain focused on executing on our strategic priorities and are enthusiastic about the growth opportunities ahead.","We thank you for your continued interest Centene, and I will now turn the call over to Jeff.","Jeff Schwaneke","Thank you Michael and good morning. Let me reiterate some highlights of our third quarter results. Third quarter 2019 revenues were $19 billion, an increase of 17% over the third quarter of 2018 and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.96 this quarter compared to $0.89 last year.","Total revenues grew approximately $2.8 billion over the third quarter of 2018, primarily as a result of growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business, expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2018 and 2019 particularly, Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico and Pennsylvania. The Ribera Salud acquisition in Spain and approximately $440 million in at risk, state directed payments in California recorded in premium revenue. This growth was partially offset by the health insurer fee moratorium in 2019.","Moving on to HBR, our health benefits ratio was 88.2% in the third quarter this year compared to 86.3% in last year's third quarter, and 86.7% in the second quarter of 2019. There are a lot of moving parts in the HBR for last year and this year that are non-operational in nature and affect the year-over-year comparison.","In order to understand the changes more clearly for this quarter, we have included reconciliation in our press release. We don't expect to provide an HBR reconciliation in future releases, but felt it was important in this quarter.","Let me explain the line items one by one. First, in the third quarter 2018, the HBR benefited by 100 basis points due to the IHSS reconciliation in California that we disclosed last year. Second, the third quarter 2019 HBR was adversely affected by the health insurance fee moratorium, which accounts for 50 basis points.","And finally, the third quarter 2019 HBR was adversely affected by approximately 440 million of state directed payments in California, which accounted for 30 basis points. State directed payments or payments that had minimal risk, but are administered as a premium adjustment. These payments are recorded as premium revenue and medical expenses close to 100% HBR.","In aggregate, these items account for 180 basis points of the change from the third quarter of last year to this year. Sequentially, the 150 basis point increase in HBR from the second quarter of 2019 is primarily due to the normal seasonality in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and the state directed payments I previously mentioned.","Let me provide a quick update on the Medicaid performance and eligibility redeterminations. The Medicaid HBR was flat year-over-year. Improvements in the Medicaid HBR which were driven by network and medical management initiatives were offset by the effective membership reductions due to the eligibility redeterminations.","We have experienced continued membership declines as a result of redeterminations resulting in an overall increase in the acuity of our remaining membership. While states have responded with premium rate adjustments recognizing the change in acuity, there could be a timing difference from an HBR perspective.","Long term, we expect the eligibility reductions to subside and premium rates to align with the relative acuity of our membership. Next, marketplace. The marketplace business continues to perform well, and membership remains strong, as we ended the quarter with approximately 1.9 million members. We continue to expect pre-tax margins for the year to be within our stated 5% to 10% range.","Now onto SG&A. Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 8.8% in the third quarter of this year compared to 10% last year and 9% in the second quarter of 2019. Year-over-year decrease was primarily driven by 70 basis point reduction related to the \u201cVeterans Affairs\u201d contract expiration and our commitment to our charitable foundation recognized in the third quarter of last year.","The third quarter 2019 ratio was also affected by the state directed payments and benefited from lower variable compensation costs for programs indexed to our stock performance. Additionally, we spent $0.02 per diluted share on business expansion costs during the third quarter.","During the third quarter, we recorded $271 million or $0.57 per diluted share of non-cash goodwill and intangible assets impairment, virtually all associated with our U.S. medical management business. The impairment was identified as part of our quarterly review procedures, which included an analysis of new information related to our shared savings demonstration programs, slower than expected penetration of the home help business model into our Medicaid population, and the related impact to the revised forecasts. The business continues to be cash flow positive and remains an important part of our care management programs, but has fallen short of our profitability expectations at the time of the acquisition.","Investment income was $98 million during the third quarter, compared to $80 million last year and $120 million last quarter. The increase year-over-year reflects increased investment balances and higher interest rates. The sequential decrease is primarily related to our second quarter Ribera Salud acquisition gain.","Interest expense was $99 million for the third quarter of 2019 compared to $97 million last year, and $101 million last quarter. In October, we completed the refinancing of our 2021 senior debt securities to a floating rate Term Loan A that has a three year maturity. This lowers our interest costs, creates demand for our WellCare transaction financing, and aligns our short term interest rate risk with our investments.","One time refinancing costs associated with the transaction including the call premium were $30 million and were incurred in the fourth quarter. These are excluded from our adjusted earnings per share guidance, which I will discuss in a few minutes.","Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 45.1% compared to 33.3% in the third quarter of 2018. The increase year-over-year is driven by the non-deductibility associated with the goodwill and intangibles impairment, offset by the impact of the health insurer fee moratorium.","We have a strong balance sheet. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 35.6% excluding our non-recourse debt, improving 180 basis points from year end, and 70 basis points from last quarter. We had 415 million borrowed on our revolving credit facility, and our days and claims payable was up one day from last quarter to 48 days.","We continue to expect the DCP to be in the mid-40 range on a run rate basis. Our cash flow from the nine months ended was $2.1 billion representing 1.9 times net earnings. Cash flow used in operations was $99 million in the third quarter, driven by the payment of approximately $1 billion related to the 2018 risk adjustment to CMS and minimum MLR programs, partially offset by net earnings.","Before I get into our updated guidance, let me make a few comments on the WellCare acquisition. We are pleased with the progress and the regulatory approval and have made significant progress on the integration planning. Based on the work performed to date, we continue to be comfortable with the synergy and accretion targets that we have previously communicated.","As we continue through the integration planning and get closer to the closing date, we will provide a complete update on the acquisition. Additionally, as disclosed yesterday, our board of directors approved a $500 million increase to the company's stock repurchase program. This, together with the new Term loan A provides flexibility to the company, to either repay debt or repurchase equity with the net proceeds related to the WellCare transaction divestitures.","Now on to 2019 guidance. We are updating our GAAP diluted earnings per share and our tax rate to reflect the impairment charge, and the refinancing costs that would be incurred in the fourth quarter. For an adjusted tax rate, the previous guidance range can still be used. The remaining guidance metrics are unchanged and are included in this morning's earnings release.","One quick note, we expect our fourth quarter total revenues to be lower than the third quarter 2019 revenues, as a result of the state directed payments previously mentioned. Our headline numbers for the full year remain unchanged.","Let me take a few minutes and discuss 2020. As Michael mentioned in his comments, we expect total revenues and adjusted earnings per diluted share for 2020 to be in line with what was filed in the S4 registration statement, associated with the WellCare acquisition. This includes total revenues in excess of $79 billion and an adjusted earnings guidance range that will encompass $4.79 per diluted share which was in the filing. This of course includes Louisiana and excludes the WellCare acquisition.","Overall, we were pleased with the performance during the quarter, and the continued progress on the regulatory approval, and integration planning associated with the WellCare transaction.","We are entering the fourth quarter with positive momentum. Looking ahead at next year, we remain focused on executing against our growth and diversification strategy, delivering both top and bottom line growth, and on successfully completing the integration of WellCare.","That concludes my remarks. And operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Matt Borsch with BMO Capital Market. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","Yes. If I could just ask you about the -- with you reference to the S-4 forecast for 2020. So it looks like that is of course on a stand-alone basis before the impact of WellCare. The Street estimate is $492 million, where you guys are pointing to $479 million. I know you're not answerable to the Street estimates, and I don't know which ones include WellCare and which ones don't. But can you give us any more color on the moving parts that influence your view on 2020 at this point?","Michael Neidorff","Yes. I mean, I think a couple of things. We've obviously mentioned a little bit today about the redetermination and the reductions in membership. Obviously that would have a carryover effect into 2020. We're not going to go through I would say all the headwinds and tailwinds. We typically save that for our Investor Day in December. And I think also Michael highlighted in his prepared remarks, the tax rate, just as so everybody has a baseline here. We've historically commented that when the return of the health insurer fee comes back, it's usually 10% on the tax rate.","So I guess, what I would say is you know we're still in the early stages of our planning process. And we're comfortable with the numbers that we communicated today for 2020, and we'll give an update, a broader update on I would say the puts and takes when we get to our December Investor Day.","Jeff Schwaneke","I think, Matt -- I just, I might just add that we look at that as the baseline. And then it was thoughtful when we put it together, and it's a really good beginning point, and we want to be very careful not to get ahead of ourselves, because we always go into great detail on the December 13th in this case meeting. And so, look at that as a baseline, which from which we can we can build.","Matt Borsch","Got it. Got it. Makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. First and foremost, congrats to Ed, and good luck. And in terms of my question, I guess the first one would be the catalyst for the buyback, there seems to be a relatively new idea for Centene. You guys have been reticent in the past just being sort of so grossy. What was the catalyst? What was the decision now to decide, okay, we could, especially in light of some of the commentary that WellCare may be coming -- the closing may be coming sooner than expected?","Jeff Schwaneke","Well I think, there's a couple of factors; one, we\u2019ll be with WellCare deal, we treat that as a as a separate issue from the ongoing operations, and buyback of stock, which as you correctly pointed out, we have lots of applications for our cash in our capital. So that's -- it's -- we're treating it very separately because saying as part of this deal, what we receive on this really, and the buyback will start peaking to some minimal degree help on the accretion, things of that nature, and treat the case as just isolated and very separate from the ongoing day-to-day business, just seen the appropriate opportunity.","And we may use some of it to reduce debt. So I might also add that using it to buy back the stock at the levels the -- is trading at now also seems to make a lot of good financial sense. I think it was you or somebody said, I always hope, I have and we will. So it just makes sense, Josh.","Josh Raskin","I knew, I knew someone read one of our notes. All right.","Michael Neidorff","Okay.","Josh Raskin","It was the -- just the MLR guidance, you guys are running up about 120-ish basis points year-to-date or so of the fourth quarter, even at the high end would imply an MLR that's only up 90 basis points, and I say that because you've got some headwinds and things like that, that impacted on a year-over-year basis. So what's -- but improves in 4Q relative to what we've seen year-to-date, and should we be thinking more about sort of that higher end to the MLR guidance, the range that you guys have provided?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. Yes. Just a couple. I'm, I'm following you there, Josh. I think a couple of things. We obviously did have some new programs that started in Iowa. I would mention would be one in some other new programs that started this year. And so those, you know those usually start out at higher HBR at the beginning of the year. And you know by the time we get to the end of the year for example, the Pennsylvania LTSS we've had for almost a full year by that time. So there are things like that, that have, I would say improvements in the fourth quarter from a seasonality and a new business perspective.","So I think those are the things that, that I would point to. And you know the problem I think with looking at this year compared to last year is we've -- last year we had some unique items. This year, we have some unique items. So it's kind of difficult to get the earnings progression. But, again we didn't change our guidance range, and I think we're comfortable where it is right now.","Michael Neidorff","I'd like to just add one fact. As you recall, in my comments -- prepared comments, I went through the 180 basis points of change in what I could. And I just want to reemphasize that we -- within those numbers absorbed the incremental costs associated with the new state study. And some of you will remember going way back when we always assumed a very -- a much higher medical loss ratio 90% so I think put the first, though two, three quarters, our new business is things like the long-term care you start looking even longer while you're putting it under control.","And I also remind you that some states when you take on a new business, they have continuity and care; you can't implement new programs out the way. So there's things like that Josh that impacted. All that was absorbed within the stated MLR.","Josh Raskin","Perfect. All right. Thanks.","Operator","The next question today comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","GeorgeHill","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I guess on a different angle, I wanted to dig into a little bit on their recent Walgreens announcement in the pharmacy. I guess, can you talk about how much you've increased your stake in our RxAdvance and kind of what's different about the new relationship with Walgreens?","Michael Neidorff","Jeff, you want to talk about that?","Jeff Schwaneke","Sure, George. I think, we really made the RxAdvance investment initially. We had contemplated a few different steps along the way. And so, I think this is really kind of the one year step and so we are getting into a lot of the specifics. We increased the nominal amount, but I think its representative momentum, and the trajectory of the work that we're doing together.","And I think, in terms of the Walgreens relationship, we have -- some of you may recall when we had our Investor Day in June, we talked about the work that we're doing on the Enterprise Partnership front to identifying a few different categories, retail was one. And so, we see meaningful opportunities to engage on some of things that Michael referenced in his comments principally transparency as it relates to pharmacy for the Medicaid population, and then ongoing opportunities for consumer engagement and enhanced experience at the retail level.","Michael Neidorff","And I want to emphasize, that there are various outlets with pharmacy and Walgreens has done a particularly good job in urban areas, and is recognized for it in the inner cities where we have a large population. And so, are working closely with them is an added plus, while still maintaining relationships with the other large retail outlets.","GeorgeHill","So maybe if I can get a quick follow up then, is this really just a tighter alignment around the kind of networks and direction, or is there any actual change to how we should think about the reimbursement process in pharmacy?","Michael Neidorff","I think, I've stated our goal is to try and to move towards net price. I have said that historically, we're still working on it. We\u2019ll be working with them and other partners but, they have a lot of capabilities in that area, but I'm not prepared to get ahead of myself, because these things are a process and it takes a certain amount of time as you get there and such. It's not always a straight line, but it's moving in the right direction.","GeorgeHill","Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Thanks. And first of all just want to add my best wishes to Mr. Kroll as well. And first question is, just on the 2020 sort of the initial insights. Can you just clarify, would that include the impact of the new buyback program that you just announced this morning or should we consider that being more sort of related to some of the WellCare deal dynamics, which are not included in the guidance?","Jeff Schwaneke","That's real. That would be related to the WellCare deal dynamics, which are not in the guidance.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Then just also saw that you are reiterating your synergy views on WellCare. Also just wanted to clarify, would that be inclusive of the lower stars that WellCare will now see in 2021, and you feel that you can offset that in terms of the synergy views, and then maybe just more generally if you can talk about sort of your assessment on the star's results for Centene and for WellCare if you can, and in terms of you know maybe some of the mitigation actions that you think that you can take and how that influences your views on you know 2021 and a growth prospects for the combined company?","Michael Neidorff","I\u2019ll ask Brandy and Kevin to comment on it.","Brandy Burkhalter","So to start out with the -- from a star sort of perspective, our current star, we made significant progress in our quality programs this year. We've had two plans achieved, a four and a half star rating, and one of our largest plans is a four star rating. Although we made the progress, one state has impacted our overall parent rating, which we'll finalize in November. We estimate a miss by less than 0.2 points when it comes to this, but with all that said, we remain committed to our quality initiatives, and believe that we can make up any differences we might see from a premium sort of perspective overtime. So look forward to seeing the results in the future. And Kevin, anything you want to add related to\u2026","Kevin Counihan","We just said, I think we did it as Brandy said, we actually did expect four. We were less than 2 basis points away from getting it. Well, we know what we need to do to fix it, and we'll be on track to correct it.","Scott Fidel","Got it. And Jeff, Jeff just to clarify the on just the reiteration of the synergy view that, that would be inclusive or that exclusive of WellCare star\u2019s impact for 2021?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I mean, I'm not specifically going to comment on WellCare stars at this point, but I would say, the synergy comments would still hold given what I know about that.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you, and congratulations to Ed. You'll certainly be missed. So when you guys announced the deal, you talked about assuming a certain amount of divestitures that went into that 700 million of synergies, and the divestiture package certainly came out better than our expectations. I'm just wondering, how it compare to years. The fact that there aren't divestitures in Georgia and Ford I was not initially contemplated in your synergy guidance.","Michael Neidorff","Well I think, you're never let me see a very bright light. I\u2019m -- will be careful not to get into a lot of details here on that, but I think some of you made some assumptions that we may not have, but, let's say that the divestitures to this point have been consistent with expectations, seem reasonable and appropriate, and there still may be in a couple of states, some issues we're working through with justice and others; we're staying flexible on that you have to. But it's -- I can't say whole -- I don't think we just say whole lot more because I'm not going to negotiate that type of thing in the press, so to speak. I hope you understand what I'm trying to say.","Sarah James","Yes, absolutely. Fair enough. And then just wanted to follow up, last quarter we talked a little bit about the TRICARE potential conversion, and you guys left that thought of where you thought maybe there'd be some certainty in three months or so, and so just wanted to follow back up is there any update on the potential TRICARE conversion to risk, and how meaningful that could be?","Kevin Counihan","Hi Sarah, it's Kevin. So our relationships with TRICARE continue to deepen. We're in the midst right now of consulting with them on a variety of access and quality, and actually technology types of enhancements to the program. You're probably aware that there's a new director of BHA there and Lieutenant General Ron place, who we\u2019ve established a relationship with already. And so we're enthusiastic about the future of the program.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Lance Wilkes of Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yes. Good morning. And congratulations, Ed.","Kevin Counihan","Good morning.","Lance Wilkes","So my question is really on the PBM business, and trying to understand some of the state activities as they're looking at changing relationships with PBMs and you know how that impacts kind of existing book of business, and how RxAdvance might play into that?","Kevin Counihan","Well, I think I\u2019ll start and Jeff will add something. But the states want transparency, and we agree with that. We have moved more and more into action. I mean, so many states will have already met and exceeded maybe their expectations of transparency. I think, RxAdvance will only enhance that opportunity, and some of the systems they have and some of that information moves us in that direction and so it's great. So, now they have a unique platform. I think we're very helpful. So the same will of the transparency, That'll be administrative rates and fees and when you have multiple peers they're worried about how many people are so to speak, involved in really that pile-around. So we\u2019re clarifying that, and I think it's a fair request and we're doing with it very openly.","Lance Wilkes","Got you. And just one more follow-up on re-verification, re-determination, could you talk just a little bit about in the third quarter maybe contrasting that with the second quarter, the magnitude of impact, was third quarter sort of a larger impact that you were able to overcome in the MLR? Or was it in line with second quarter?","Michael Neidorff","Well, I'll start with, and then Jeff can speak about in details, but it's really \u2013 it has been a certain consistency. And I think what's important here is the states are realized and there's a couple of states that are more of an interpretation of this, but the states realized the impact it has on the acuity, and they're working with us on the rate adjustment. There is a lag there. And that\u2019s something we\u2019ve worked to it overtime, so it\u2019s a pace itself. Jeff?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I guess, Lance, what I would say is it\u2019s different by state, right? So is just depends, so \u2013 and aggregating that I would say off-the-cuff that it's consistent. And then we've seen this, but it it's just different by state. And the other thing to note is, if you look at the third quarter, if you be back out the new award in Iowa, our Medicaid membership in total is essentially flat from Q2.","Michael Neidorff","I also want to emphasize here, states are looking to expand coverage. So we're looking increasing the Medicaid coverage. We're looking at long-term care. So, I think -- we think we're delivering on their expectations in most cases and we see it sort of the very viable strong growing business.","Lance Wilkes","Okay. Thanks Jeff.","Operator","The next question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. Maybe I guess, just following up on the state rates around redeterminations. What would you think you're in the process of the state\u2019s kind of adjusting the rates? Are we still kind of early in that process, or we kind of well along in that way?","Michael Neidorff","I think, Jeff, you want to\u2026","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. No, I would say the states have been quick to act, but they're really \u2013 they're acting on data from months ago, right? And so, I guess what I would say is, we're not done. And they're taking quick action, but if this continues then we have to continue to see more rate adjustments and I think that's the plan obviously, but there is a timing difference. There is a timing difference from when the data comes in to when the rate adjustment happens and that's really what we're seeing in the HBR.","Michael Neidorff","If that sound more competitive then I wish, we have real time data. Whoever gives a real-time data and that's helping us, but they need to get the collective data from all the plans, and so that take some time too. So it\u2019s a process and it's not a point in time, its some things moving and I think the states recognize it and just trying to accelerate it as fast necessary information to do so.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then, going back to the divestitures and that you can process some of these proceed for share repurchase. You guys mentioned that you're to kind of assume some divestitures in your guidance. I assumed you would have assumed due to guidance proceeds from those divestitures, trying to understand whether this signals that may be you're willing to have a little bit higher pro forma leverage after the transaction if you're going to use these divestiture proceeds for share repo or how we should be thinking about that?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I think the way to think up about it now as we positioned ourselves to have optionality, right. So obviously when the transaction closes and if there are divestitures which there's already two that we've announced then we would look at all the factors including economic at the time of that and just make a decision. But the key here is I think we've now between the term loan A that we know we can prepay without penalty and the share repurchase that we just increase today, we put the company in a position to have optionality and what to do with the proceeds.","Kevin Fischbeck","In those proceeds you're going to have to wait for those proceeds to come in before you'd be able to exercise, because to your point earlier, I mean, the evaluation today is pretty compelling. My guess is when the deal closes, the market will start change the evaluation to the better, so if there's any thought about using it.","Michael Neidorff","I hope, you're right.","Kevin Fischbeck","Obviously yes. Typically the way these work is it the divestitures happen simultaneously with the transaction closing. Again, we'll just have to look at -- look at the economic factors and everything at that time and we'll make a decision.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay great. And then just maybe a last question. The impairment charge for U.S. and I'm -- I mean, pretty big impairment charge obviously implies that the run rate earnings from that business are going to be lower than what you thought. You know, I guess you're reaffirming your guidance for 2020 as far as the S-4 goes. So try to understand kind of what the impact is there may be what is coming in better to offset that.","Michael Neidorff","Kevin, let me start, then Jeff can pick up. It is large when you recognize over the -- all the years we've been in business, we haven't had many so many impairment charges. It's I -- we don't see it as overly dramatic in that when you're an enterprise of our scale and size at this point in time. Things can happen, and we have been committed that at the point in time, we recognized something as necessary that investors and you, the analyst can expect us to come forward with it immediately as quickly as it can be confirmed.","So this was just -- it it's a lot of money. It's a large number, it's non-cash and it's these are the kinds of things I probably personally expect could happen when you consider how creatively our acquisitive we are, and the total size of the company.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes Kevin, the other thing I'd highlight, it\u2019s really a magnitude issue. If you look at the size of the USMM business, it's roughly 300 million in revenue let's say. And the piece that we were missing this quarter, we mentioned this is the shared savings. And so if you look at the Shared Savings Program, it was half of what we expected, which is we expected roughly $20 million in shared savings this quarter, we got 10. And so it's a magnitude issue as you look to 2020, as all I would say.","Michael Neidorff","In the shared savings, the CMS will redeterminant every year that beside what amount and what not.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","They adjust the baselines every year.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Please go ahead.","Charles Rhyee","Yes. Thanks. And congrats to Ed, as well. Maybe just a follow-up on that, Michael. What does that say about these -- the shift to value-based care here? If the shared savings that you were kind of expecting came in half and you kind of talked about sort of baseline is moving around. Is that -- does that speak more to a fundamental problem with the structured programs, sells [ph] or what can be done to actually kind of move maybe sort of this pace for the long?","I mean you talk about kind of moving net pricing of the drug side. Overall, we're trying to -- it seems like we're overall trying to make a shift toward this more value-based type of reimbursement model across healthcare. But these kind of examples kind of point to some of the challenges here. Maybe you can give us a sense on what's your views and what changed?","Michael Neidorff","Sure. Yes. I'm glad you raised your question. One, the value-based we're doing with provider groups, doctors hospitals, pharmacies and others, that's something of that's in our control. We set baselines. We set the program. We determine how it's going to work. We have a model one that is our program. We have the reporting that can show the doctors real time virtually how they're doing against how they should be before than their peers and a lot of different things.","The -- in the case of USMM, this is something that was determined by CMS. Now in the grand scheme of things, I think it's, still worthwhile. It's a program that I think has legs and has helped save some other costs in Medicare and as our Medicare business grows will be even more important.","But we can -- I can say that with a great deal of comfort because it's such a small portion of this total enterprise we've become. And so it's absorbable and it's not that major thing. But it's very distinct, I can't emphasize that enough from the value-based contracting that we determine set up and report against.","Charles Rhyee","Thanks. That's helpful. And maybe Jeff, I can follow up on one question, you guys talked about in the adjusted SG&A. It was partly lower due to sort of lower stock compensation expense. Maybe you can give a sense sort of magnitude here if -- maybe what you would have expected relative if let's say, the share price was sort of flat year-over-year? Just trying to get a sense for sort of a baseline as we think about modeling either for next year or the rest of this year? Thanks.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. I'd say it's probably less than a $0.01 a share is what I would say, because you have to remember these are long-term -- mostly long-term plans that are built over a three-year period, and it's obviously just one quarter effect. So I would make it.","If you're looking at the G&A ratio, you really have to look at the stepping off point from Q2 of this year. And then if you factor in the $440 million of additional revenue, that's roughly 20 basis points on the G&A ratio. So that kind of bridges you from Q2 to the 8.8%, which is where we are in Q3.","Charles Rhyee","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I wondered, if I can get you to size a couple of things. In the MLR bridge, you didn't call out the -- what I think it was an extra business day and maybe an extra important business day in the third quarter of this year. I'm wondering is that in the 10 basis points of other? Or is it a bigger call out than that?","And then following up on earlier question on kind of redeterminations in state rates. Is it possible that you said the states have been pretty expeditious in responding, but are working on stale data? Is the 25 basis points that you're kind of lifting your composite rate reflective of all the states giving you some or half the stage giving you some like, just hoping to understand essentially kind of what inning are we, and how much have you gotten, and how much do you still have left to get?","Michael Neidorff","I'll take the first one, and Jeff, you pick up the -- I'll take the second part, you pick up the question. The rate adjustments, it's staggered, and it's not every state has, some are larger than others, so I can't point to a specific pattern for you. I mean it's not that -- it's not that -- did it doesn't have that kind of rhythm to it. It's really episodic and there is a state that has a larger redetermination, and they may be very quick getting back to us. So it's -- there is no set pattern to it.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. That's correct. And then the other thing, Dave, just on your first question with respect to --","Dave Windley","Extra business day.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes, the extra business day. I mean, we would -- we have that. We would account for that in our forecasting process so at the beginning of the year. I guess what I would say is, yes, there was an extra business day in the quarter. And so if that weren't the case, then our results probably would have been better than they were. But nonetheless, these are actual results, so it included the business day.","Michael Neidorff","Yes.","Dave Windley","If I could just sneak in one more. Michael, are the state or the lawsuits related to Medicaid work requirements in a couple of states, are those important to your views around Medicaid program structure and longer term views on Medicaid waiver programs and things like that?","Michael Neidorff","No. I think it's something that we adapt to work with and deal with-in. There is various programs, some we support. I mean -- so it's a -- the most states we're trying to do in a responsible way. And -- I mean, so -- no we find it does not have a significant impact on us. We've learned how to work with the states and in a supportive manner.","Dave Windley","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Thanks, and good luck, Ed. Your adjusted EPS guidance for this year is still quite broad at $4.29 to $4.49. If I take the midpoint of that, you're still $0.18 above where you're S-4 guidance would be for 2019. So you're running well ahead this year, and yet for next year, you talked about the $4.79 is being sort of the right number. Why are you not talking about being ahead 4% in next year as well?","Michael Neidorff","I want Jeff to comment. But I just want to open up by saying that we come, and we established that as a baseline. I think we will recognize we like an abundance of conservatism going into it. There are various issues we're dealing with and we will give you the full guidance at all the reasons and bridges up down otherwise on the 13th.","Jeff?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. The thing I would point to Peter, if you go back and look at the S-4 and look at the revenue number, it was roughly $70 billion, and we're almost at $74 billion. Now remember, it was the open enrollment that kind of concluded in the first part of this year on marketplace and the marketplace member staying longer and all those phenomenons that are I would say causing additional top line growth this year, which is good.","And right now as we look to next year, we're still projecting to be around that $79 plus billion range. So I think that's the difference that you're looking for. If you recall, we've increased the guidance earlier this year, actually on our year-end 2018 earnings call, we increased the guidance because of the additional marketplace membership.","Peter Costa","So you've talked about the exchange business hopefully growing next year. So what is the headwind to your top line that we should be thinking about, so is it Louisiana or?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","No. Because, we remember we said Louisiana is in, and part of it is the eligibility redeterminations that we talked about today. So obviously you guys have seen the effect of that and a lot of you have commented on it, as far as percentage wise. But that is certainly a headwind from a run rate perspective exiting this year.","Michael Neidorff","I think, we're trying to get head results. Now we've not served a lot of purpose. I mean, we have a cadence to where we will give you an indication, we'll try to give you a baseline to think about. But on the 13th, we'll be at a position, we'll have a better sense on marketplace, better sense on redetermination, better sense of what's safe to do with rates, a whole series of things. And so why, I'm not sure. It's still very, very well to try and get ahead of ourselves, and run it through on our own December 13, meeting, which is a couple of months away.","Peter Costa","Okay. Just last on that. Is the USMM issue bigger next year than it is this year because of the rate cuts and home health, or is there anything else impacting that?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","No. I would expect it to be flat year-over-year.","Peter Costa","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Tanal with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Stephen Tanal","Good morning, guys.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Stephen Tanal","Two questions from me. And congrats, Ed, as well. Just on the -- one more on the 2020 outlook in the S-4, but more of a simple question. Had that factored in Centene forward? I know you filed that in May, but you told us about Centene forward in June, but presumably had that in the works earlier. So I just want to understand if that was kind of contemplated in the number that's there.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","I think as we contemplated and talked about before is that we're continuing to use Centene forward to kind of reinvest in the business. And so there is -- that's the plan, and as we continue to get to the $0.5 billion of savings just to reinvest, and some of these things that we're working on are process automation and digitization, they're heavier lifts and they take a longer time to realize the efficiencies. So I would say right now that includes Centene forward, but the benefit is minimal.","Stephen Tanal","Okay, fair enough.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","But more to come on our December Investor Day.","Stephen Tanal","Yes, point taken on that. And just on HBR, the at-risk payments in catalogue, could you give us a little more on kind of the nature of that? It sounds like it was Medicaid. And then maybe just very specifically, would you expect to get back to 30 bps in 3Q 2020? I wasn't perfectly clear on what that is.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes, a couple of things. What I would say is the process is changing where states used to have these payments where they would give us the cash and we turn around and pay providers, and that was a one-for-one and we recorded those in premium tax revenue and premium tax expense. The process is changing to where these have to have some form of risk and so they show up is retroactive premium changes.","And so what I would say is, you'll probably see less on the pass through lines and more in premium revenue. But we would anticipate that the level of these payments would probably continue, but as you've seen they're very lumpy, right. Especially -- I mean this happen in other of our states, they're just -- they're not as large as California.","Stephen Tanal","And so I suppose that it's like a new baseline like you wouldn't just go in your model and assume you get 30 bps back in 3Q, 2020?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","That's right. We would anticipate a similar level of these types of payments in next year.","Stephen Tanal","Got it. Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question today comes from A.J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice","Hello, everybody. Best wishes to Ed too. A couple of quick things if I could get in here. When you gave the outlook for rate increases next year and said it would be a little better, you mainly pointed to premium rate adjustments. I was wondering obviously the HIF is coming back and the states -- last time it came in and out they obviously covered it. You didn't really mention that as part of the reason why the rates might be a little higher. Are you just excluding that? Is there any movement on the part of states not to include that?","And then also I just on the exchange just sort of an interesting beast. Are you feeling comfortable that you can get compensated for the HIF coming back on your exchange business next year as well?","Michael Neidorff","Jeff?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. A couple of things. On the Medicaid side, just to be clear, and I think we've commented about this before, the composite rate adjustment that we quote is net of what we would call fee skilled -- fee schedule changes and pass-throughs. So as the health insurer fee is predominantly a pass-through than Medicaid business, it's a specific add to the rate, and then this grossed up for the tax effect, then that's excluded from the composite rate that Michael commented on today and has always been.","The second thing on the marketplace, we actually price for the health insurer fee, so that's included in the pricing.","A.J. Rice","Okay. And then on another quick one on Fidelis. You anniversary that this quarter. I know when that came online; the thought was their MLR was quite high; you get some benefit over time from bringing that down. Obviously, their G&A was quite low that might creep up, but there was the synergies. Can you just -- with all the moving parts, especially on the MLR today, is that expectation on Fidelis playing out, and have you pretty much normalized their MLR at this point, or is there still more room to go?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. I'll handle the first part, which is really around the transaction and then Dave Thomas is here, he could talk about the future. I would say yes, it has played out. So we have seen meaningful improvement in I would say the revenue and medical cost line, and we did add SG&A dollars. So we have seen a slight increase in G&A, which is what we anticipated making investments to bring down the medical cost and improve the revenue performance, and that has happened.","And as far as what's remaining to go, I'll turn it over to Dave.","David Thomas","Yes. This is Dave Thomas. As Jeff said, I think we've been successful to this point. We've done very, very well with our synergies. That being said, I do think there is more real estate for us there. There is more that we can do and are doing from a medical management front. We also are continuing to grow the plan, albeit not as quickly as we had been growing historically. So we look very good in terms of both continuing to tamped down from a medical management perspective and continuing to grow the plan and continue to grow revenue as well.","Michael Neidorff","I think, I'll remind you, I said it was time in Investor Day that if we define more Fidelis, I'd like to do one in the morning and one in the afternoon.","A.J. Rice","I remember that comment. Since it's late in the call, I'm going to slip one more in, If I could. Obviously there has been so much focus on Texas and what's happening with that RFP. I wonder if you could give us any update on what the RFP pipeline looks like right now over the next six months to 12 months. I haven't heard a lot other than Kentucky, which I guess you have a history with them. I mean, I'm not sure you're bidding on that one. But is there -- are there other near term to intermediate term RFPs that are of focus right now?","Michael Neidorff","I mean there's one in Pennsylvania just came out; we wanted to do a couple of times of redoing it. So we have that one. And there is Oklahoma is looking at to subsidiary one. So I mean -- we are in conversations with states and they may not have announced it yet, so I'm going to. It's -- they haven't said they're going to do it, but it's -- I think it's appropriate for them to. But we still see, as I said a robust pipeline and opportunities.","I gave you two just -- I mentioned those two just to give you a sense it's real, not just latitudes.","A.J. Rice","Right.","Michael Neidorff","Next, anymore?","Operator","The next question today comes from Justin Lake with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Justin Lake","I appreciate your -- and congrats again to Ed. So first question, I think Josh asked this earlier, and I didn't really get into it. But just given how the year has shaped up and some of the questions around the MLR, do you -- it might be helpful just to give us an idea of where you're expected to be within that range of the guidance that you give 86.6% to 87.1%, just to help us understand how you're thinking about the fourth quarter on a large? Should it be toward the higher end of the range or toward the midpoint?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. I mean -- I guess that would -- I mean, that's why we give a range, Justin, on the HBR. So you know that we've kind of -- if I pick the number that would defeat the purpose of the range. So again, I think we're comfortable with the range where it is. And I guess that's my only comment on that.","Michael Neidorff","Yes, and I just want to \u2013 I think it really is important, because there is nobody said yet there is -- what the flu season is going to look like. There are so many things that come into place with an effective range, Justin. It's -- let's -- I'm going to support what Jeff said, that's a range.","Justin Lake","Got it. And then just CMS, it looks like they finally put out the individual market kind of landscape file today. I haven't had a chance to go through it yet, but I was wondering, if there is anything you would point to in terms of how you feel about your competitive positioning for 2020 and -- in that business in terms of membership and margin kind of thinking -- going into next year?","Michael Neidorff","I don't know that we've looked at it closely ourselves at this point. But I would tell you that we've talked, when you have competition this phase, we really like it, because it grows categories. When you \u2013 [Indiscernible] growing in and if you get something. And in a -- in that type of situation, the larger player, the number one player usually does better. So I see it is we like competition. That just makes us better and it -- I think it will help grow the market.","Justin Lake","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Ricky Goldwasser","Yes. Hi. Good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Ricky Goldwasser","A couple of follow-up questions here. So one, what -- just could you give us the update on the status of the WellCare, PBM, RFP process? How should we think about it in light of your partnership.","Michael Neidorff","Yes. I -- we can't -- we cannot comment on WellCare business at this point in time. It's still a very independent company publicly traded, so I -- we just can't get involved in that.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. Will you give any -- will you provide additional color under PBM, RFP process on the Analyst Day? I know in the past you said you would.","Michael Neidorff","So I understand.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","No. We can't really comment on the WellCare business until the transaction closes. There are a separate company, stand-alone.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay. And then another question regarding 2020. When we think about the $4.79 in the S-4, I know you said that you're assuming Louisiana is unchanged, but also a higher tax rate. So as we think about the embedded assumptions that you had back when you provided the original EPS, was the higher tax rate included in it?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. Yes, it was. It's a direct result of the health insurer fee.","Ricky Goldwasser","Okay, great. Thank you.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Gary Taylor with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi. Good morning. Just a few quick ones. The first would be Michael, you alluded to the Fifth Circuit briefly, but just wondering, do you have any sense of timing on that there?","Michael Neidorff","No. Yes. I mean it's -- I would like to say it's imminent, but not today. So I'm not sure. I have to get somebody define imminent to say that in Texas RFP to. But I think it's going to come down. But I we\u2019re not [Indiscernible] if they reverse it so much the better. If they don't, we believe it will go to Supreme Court quickly. And we have not changed our point of view. It won't be [Indiscernible] that the presidents will hold and will get reversed. So it's not something we spend any time worrying about. It's an overhang and in terms people's mind. So as soon as we get resolved and reverse, the happy we all will be.","Gary Taylor","Got you. I don't mean to pre-empt the Investor Day, but you have talked about 2020 a little bit, and you have talked about exchanges a little bit. Probably one of the most common investor questions is, whether this increased competition and lower premiums on the exchanges, how much impact that might have on your margins? Is there anything you are willing to say about 2020 exchange margin outlook at this point?","Michael Neidorff","I think it's premature to say anything at this point in time what we have. I think Jeff's comment where we're comfortable with our 5% to 10% margin range in that business. And as I've commented in the past at various meetings that doesn't mean it's going to be 7.5% it nearly moves up and down depending on the time of the year and various issues. But we're still comfortable with that kind of a range and we still see it as a growing -- very viable business for us. So we know how to manage and manage well.","Gary Taylor","Last question if I could. On the public charge rule obviously, an injunction was issued. But to the extent that rule does have drive any adverse selection in 2020 or even the fear of that rule has an impact? Is there any reason why the same ability, you had to get these rate adjustments from states for the redetermination, adverse selection would not apply to the similar dynamic that might arise from the public charge rule? Do you believe you will be able to go back and demonstrate that the states, and largely that what risk there might be?","Michael Neidorff","I think that particular thing will be little more difficult, and finally has I bigger impact on the exchange business than on the pure Medicaid to some degree. But Jeff, you want to?","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. It would follow the same. It would follow the same process. I mean the way the states view it is these are eligibility redeterminations on our members leaving the program, either way there is a shift in acuity that you would have to go back and recalculate the rates.","Gary Taylor","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","The next question today comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Ralph Giacobbe","I hop on a little bit late, so apologies if you did -- if you went through already. But did you actually quantify what the impact on the MLR was from the determinations?","And then the second part of the question, just want to kind of revisit the MLR guidance, hit to harp on it, but I understand the ramp and improvement in the new business as sort of you move through the year. But you also have a new business like Iowa that started midyear coming on, and what I assume is sort of higher MLR. At the same time you have sort of the sub-timing differences that you talked about related to redetermination.","And then the exchange business that seasonally works against you as well. So I guess I'm still having trouble reconciling the 4Q MLR. Is there anything else in terms of other payments or considerations for the fourth quarter that just gives comfort to mid or high point of the range? Thanks.","Jeffrey Schwaneke","Yes. So I guess what I would say is, you have to remember like in Iowa, we were building margin in the first quarter, right. You build margin in the first quarter after the plan goes live in that margin build and the fourth quarter is lower that be another thing that I would point to. And as far as the eligibility redeterminations impact on MLR, we did not quote a number on that.","I guess, that's the only other commentary I give you.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay, fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Chairman, President and CEO, Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael Neidorff","All right. I just want to thank everybody for your participation and with being with us along the call. And now we're really looking forward to the December 13th, meeting where we can give -- answer even more of your questions. And -- but we're feeling good about where the business is and we thank you.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Michael?","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Centene's third quarter 2018 earnings call.","During the course of this call, we will discuss third quarter financial results and provide update on Centene's markets and products. We will also bring you up to date on the integration of Fidelis.","Let me begin with Fidelis. The third quarter was our first full quarter with Fidelis operating as our New York State Healthcare. The integration is going very well progressing as expected. We will further enhance the quality of care and current capabilities of Fidelis, as we add case management and clinical programs and incorporate our data analytics tools. We are on track to achieve the synergy and increasing targets. On a run-rate basis, we expect Fidelis to add approximately $11.5 billion in revenue and over $500 million in adjusted EBITDA including net synergies.","Now on to the third quarter financial results. We are pleased to report another solid quarter marked by significant top and adjusted bottom-line growth. It is important to clarify that the operating metrics in the quarter were strong as this may have been obscured by three offsetting adjustments booked in the quarter.","Two of the adjustments relate to the contracts that have expired. These were $140 million benefit related to the California IHSS program reconciliation and a $110 million charge related to the expiration of our Veterans Affairs contract. The third adjustment related to a $30 million contribution to our charitable foundation.","Membership at quarter-end was 14.4 million recipients. This represents an increase of approximately 2.1 million beneficiaries over the third quarter of 2017. This growth is in part a result of the acquisition of Fidelis which closed effective July 1.","Third quarter revenues increased 36% year-over-year to $16.2 billion. The HBR decreased 170 basis points year-over-year to 86.3%. This was primarily attributable to the benefit of the IHSS program reconciliation and membership growth in the exchange business.","The adjusted SG&A expense ratio increased 110 points paid year-over-year to 10%. This was a result of the growth in the exchange business which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio and one-time costs associated with the exploration of our VA contract.","We reported adjusted third quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.79 compared to $1.35 in the same period last year. This represents growth of 33%. Consistent with our expectations, adjusted net earnings have developed in a quarterly pattern similar to last year.","Please note, we reiterate our comments regarding visibility into $69 billion plus in total revenue for 2019. As is our practice, we will provide full detail and an update of 2019 guidance at our December 14th, Investor Day.","We are still finalizing our annual planning process. But based on the views to-date the current adjusted earnings per share consensus for 2019 would be within our guidance range.","Jeff will provide further financial details including updated 2018 guidance in his prepared remarks.","A quick comment on Medical cost trends. We continue to see as well as anticipate overall stable medical cost trends. This is consistent with our expectation in the low-single-digits.","I would also like to make a comment on pharmaceutical cost and the evolution of the PBM model. There have been some recent media articles regarding this topic and our Ohio Medicaid Health Plan Buckeye Community Health. To clarify, Buckeye is not charging the state more than any other MCO per strip. Health plans were paid a flat per number rate and cannot charge the state a penny more, even if that member has more prescriptions.","As you know, CBS has rescinded to a original comment on this matter and there are no duplex services by CBS and involved. In fact, Buckeye's per member spend on pharmacy services of $83.79 per month, is below the all plan average in Ohio of $87.96 according to the NAIC filings for 2017.","We support a shift towards a more transparent PBM model that is sustainable with higher quality and lower costs for consumers.","Our recent investment in RxAdvance is the latest evidence of our approach. As a matter of fact, our first stage rollout with RxAdvance before year-end and we have a national roll-out for RxAdvance throughout 2017 -- 2019 excuse me. We look forward to working with the State of Ohio and others to enhance and evolve the PBM model.","Moving on to market and product updates. First, we will discuss Medicaid activity, Mississippi. In October of 2018 as part of a successful reprocurement we entered into a new agreement to continue to provide services to Medicaid recipients in more than the Mississippi Medicaid program. Note that the state added a third vendor as part of the reprocurement process.","Arizona, in October of 2018, our Arizona subsidiary Health Net Access began a new contract that integrates the support and behavioral health services to the State's Medicaid program in Central and South regions. We now have over 180,000 integrated lives in this program representing an increase of 120,000.","North Carolina, in early August of 2018, North Carolina released an RFP for the State's first time transition of Medicaid members RFP to service in the managed care. We have been planning for this RFP for several years. In January of 2017 we established a joint venture with the North Carolina State Medical Society to collaborate on a statewide member focused approach to Medicaid Managed Care.","The joint venture with Carolina Complete Health was established as a physician-led health plan to provide Medicaid Managed Care services in the state. Carolina Complete Health submitted its RFP response to tax private. We feel we are well-positioned due to our joint venture which is consistent with our local approach. Furthermore, our participation in North Carolina marketplace will be recognized in the Medicaid RFP scores, the state expects to announce winners in early of February of 2019.","Next, Centurion, in August Centurion announced that the Volusia County Florida Council voted to award Centurion a contract. Centurion will provide comprehensive healthcare services to an average of 1,425 attendees of the counties potential facilities located near Daytona, Florida. The contract is expected to commence January 1 of 2019.","Additionally, Centurion was awarded a contract to provide comprehensive healthcare services to detainees of the Metropolitan Detention Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The average detainee population for this service area is 1,550. This contract is expected to commence in February of 2019. Note these two recent correctional contract wins offer further evidence that we have gained traction in growing this relatively new product line.","Now on the Medicare, we remain focused on building a successful Medicare business. At quarter-end we served over 417,000 Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. This represents a year-over-year increase of more than 86,000 recipients in 26%. Consistent with our Medicare growth strategy, we have expanded our geographic footprint and expect to be in 21 states in 2019. The annual enrolment for the 2019 plan year began on October 15th. We continue to take a targeted approach to growing our Medicare Advantage business in markets that we are focused on; we are pleased with the competitive position of all of our products.","Further we are encouraged by CMS recently released data suggesting we will return to a Four Star MA Parent rate for the 2020 plan year. We expect this will have a positive impact on multiple new plans including the joint venture recently established with Ascension Healthcare. Please note we expect to have 68% of our MA members excluding Fidelis in four star plans in 2020 with Fidelis it will be 53%.","Next health insurance marketplace. At September 30, we served 1,530,000 exchange beneficiaries. This represents a sequential increase of over 26,000 individuals. The addition of Fidelis offsets a sequential loss members from normal attrition. On a year-over-year basis membership grew 49%. Our exchange businesses continued to perform well in the third quarter.","We expect 2019 to be another strong year for Ambetter. In addition to expanding our footprint in six existing markets next year, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kansas, Missouri, and Texas, we are aiming four new states, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. In 2019, we will be offering exchange products in 20 states.","Our strategy remains specific focusing on low income subsidized population. We do not see a significant change in the competitive dynamics of the market and pricing appears to be appropriate.","I would like to speak to the elimination of the individual mandate in 2019. We do not expect this to have a meaningful impact on the overall performance of our marketplace product. Hopefully enrollment starts November 1. Our guidance includes incremental marketing and outreach efforts to offset the Federal Government's continued reduced efforts.","Shifting gears to our radar. We continue to expect the composite Medicaid adjustment of an increase of approximately 1% for 2018 excuse me.","In conclusion, third quarter results offer further evidence of Centene's financial strength and operating capabilities. Centene's pipeline of further growth opportunities remains robust. We continue to explore new growth in the diversification prospects while maintaining our focus on margins. We're optimistic about our future and the leading role Centene will continue to play in the evolving healthcare industry.","As a reminder, our next Investor Day is on December 14th in New York City. We look forward to seeing you there. We thank you for your continued interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide you with further details on our third quarter financial results. Jeff?","Jeff Schwaneke","Thank you, Michael, and good morning.","This morning we reported strong third quarter results with total revenues of $16.2 billion an increase of 36% over 2017 and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.79 an increase of 33% over last year. Earnings for the quarter were driven by the completion of the Fidelis acquisition and the continued strong performance of the marketplace business. Additionally the third quarter results include the following items which in aggregate had no effect on diluted earnings per share.","First, during the third quarter we received cost reconciliation information from the State of California associated with the IHSS program which ended last year. The information allowed us to estimate the effect of the reconciliation and we recorded a pretax benefit of $140 million during the quarter.","Second, the Veteran Affairs contract expired this quarter. In connection with the conclusion of the contract, we recorded a pretax charge of $110 million for negotiated settlement in severance costs.","Lastly, as an offset to the first two items, we recorded a pretax charge of $30 million associated with the contribution commitment to the company's charitable foundation to continue to support the communities that we serve.","Let me provide some more details for the quarter. Total revenues grew by approximately $4.3 billion year-over-year primarily as a result of the acquisition of Fidelis Care, growth in the health insurance marketplace business, expansion in new programs in many of our states including the Illinois contract expansion, and the Pennsylvania LTSS program, other acquisitions including MHM, CMG, and Foundation Care, and the return of the health insurer fee in 2018. This growth was partially offset by lower revenues in California associated with the removal of the IHSS program for managed care which took effect January 2018 and lower membership and revenue in the Medicaid business due to eligibility redeterminations in many of our states as a result of the strengthening economy and lower unemployment.","Additionally, the IHSS adjustment this quarter lowered premium revenues by a little over $100 million.","Moving on to HBR, our health benefits ratio was 86.3% in the third quarter this year compared to 88% in last year's third quarter and 85.7% in the second quarter of 2018. The decrease year-over-year is primarily driven by the benefit of the recognition of the IHSS program reconciliation which reduced the HBR by approximately 100 basis points. Additionally, the year-over-year membership growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018 also decreased the HBR. These decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of Fidelis which operates at a higher HBR.","Sequentially, the 60 basis point increase in HBR from the second quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to normal seasonality in the commercial business and the acquisition of Fidelis Care. These increases were partially offset by the IHSS program reconciliation I previously mentioned.","Now on to SG&A. Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 10% in the third quarter of this year compared to 8.9% last year and 9.6% in the second quarter of 2018. The year-over-year increase was primarily due to growth in the health insurance marketplace business which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio. The SG&A expense ratio was also negatively impacted by approximately 70 basis points related to the costs associated with the conclusion of our contract with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the contribution commitment to our charitable foundation. These increases were partially offset by the acquisition of Fidelis Care.","The sequential increase is primarily due to costs associated with the VA contract expiration and the charitable contribution previously mentioned. These increases were partially offset by the acquisition of Fidelis Care which operates at a lower SG&A expense ratio. Additionally we spent $0.06 per diluted share on business expansion costs during the third quarter compared to $0.12 per diluted share last year.","Investment income was $80 million during the third quarter compared to $51 million last year and $65 million last quarter. The increase year-over-year is due to higher investment balances mainly associated with the Fidelis acquisition as well as higher interest rates on short-term investments. Sequentially investment income increased due to the acquisition of Fidelis.","We expect interest income to be lower in the fourth quarter due to lower investable balances associated with the payment of the health insurer fee, risk adjustment, and the California rate over payments mentioned in the second quarter.","Interest expense was $97 million for the third quarter 2018 compared to $65 million last year and $80 million for the second quarter of 2018. The increase year-over-year was driven by the additional debt to fund the Fidelis acquisition and higher interest rates on our debt associated with our interest rate swaps. The increase sequentially is driven by a full quarter of the senior notes issued to fund the Fidelis acquisition.","Our effective tax rate for the third quarter was 33.3% compared to 38.3% in the third quarter of 2017. The lower tax rate was driven by the effective income tax reform in 2018, partially offset by the return of the health insurer fee.","Now on to the balance sheet, cash investments and restricted deposits totaled $14.3 billion at quarter end, including approximately $500 million held by unregulated subsidiaries.","Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.","Debt at quarter-end was $6.4 billion which includes $100 million of borrowings on a revolving credit facility. Our debt-to-capital ratio was 36.9% excluding our non-recourse debt compared to 41.2% at the third quarter last year and 36.7% at the second quarter of 2018. We continue to target a debt-to-capital ratio in the mid to upper 30% range.","Our medical claims liability totaled $7 billion at quarter end and represents 51 days in claims payable compared to 44 days for the second quarter of 2018. The increase in DCP is the result of the addition of the Fidelis business which accounts for four days, timing of claims payments and business expansions which accounts for two days, and the impact of the IHSS program reconciliation for one day. Several of the items influencing the DCP increase this quarter are timing related and are expected to reverse. We expect the DCP to be in the mid-40 range on a run rate basis with the inclusion of Fidelis.","Cash flow provided by operations was $548 million in the third quarter. Cash flow was positively impacted by approximately $350 million due to the timing of Fidelis Care claims payments and $175 million due to increases in experience rebate payables primarily related to the performance of the health insurance marketplace business and the previously mentioned IHSS program reconciliation.","Before we discuss the changes to our 2018 annual guidance, let me spend a few minutes to update you on the Fidelis acquisition and the effect on the third quarter 2018 results. On July 1, 2018, we acquired substantially all the assets of Fidelis Care for approximately $3.5 billion in cash consideration net of the preliminary working capital adjustment. The integration is in process and we expect to achieve the previously communicated synergy targets.","In connection with the completion of the acquisition, during the third quarter, we incurred approximately $401 million or $1.46 per diluted share of transaction cost including investment banking fees, legal costs, and $324 million representing the present value of the contribution to the State of New York as part of the undertakings associated with regulatory approval.","Now on to our annual guidance. We have increased our 2018 annual adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance by $0.02 at the midpoint to reflect the performance in the third quarter and narrowed the ranges of several other guidance metrics. In summary, our updated full-year 2018 guidance is as follows: total revenues of $59.8 billion to $60.3 billion; GAAP diluted earnings per share of $4.34 to $4.50; adjusted diluted earnings per share of $6.90 to $7.10; and HBR of 85.9% to 86.3%; SG&A ratio of 10.5% to 10.9%; adjusted SG&A ratio of 9.7% to 10.1%; and effective tax rate of 34% to 36%; and diluted shares outstanding of 198.8 to 199.8 million shares. Additionally we are increasing our full-year 2018 business expansion costs from $0.28 to $0.32 per diluted share to $0.30 to $0.34 per diluted share.","In summary, we were pleased with the strong performance in the third quarter and the completion of the Fidelis acquisition that we expect to continue to drive long-term growth and margin expansion. That concludes my remarks and operator; you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","And your first question will be from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. I wanted to ask about the exchanges and how you thought about 2019, I guess you mentioned that the competitive landscape hasn't really changed that much but it does seem like that there's a number of counties that last year only had one option and this year at least have two and you guys often stepped in there to be that one option, I wanted I think initially the market was concerned that being the only one there was going to be a bad thing, you guys have really outperformed wondering now whether there's potential risk on the other side if a new competitor comes and that potentially change the risk pool for you in that market?","Michael Neidorff","No, no, no, as far as, Kevin, I don't see a change in the risk pool we have had last two, three years 80% of the enrolment of our membership. So we expect that to continue, it's a great deal of satisfaction with it and we continue to focus on the subsidized market and some of the others are coming in and higher levels than that, so I don't really see any material changes within the marketplace.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay. And then I guess a question on the MA side, it looks like you don't expect now to have the parent rating back for 2020, how did you think about the 2019 pricing for Stars and picking out some of the new contracts, you have this issue where you fell off on the Star ratings for 2019, but you expected to show improvement going forward, did you kind of think about it in price to the actual Star ratings that you had in 2019 or did you kind of take a longer-term view that it's better to grow the business and we may see some margin impact in 2019 but then getting back?","Michael Neidorff","I may ask Kevin to join in, but last year I said we're committed to growing the business, so I'd let Kevin split that up.","Kevin Counihan","Hi, Kevin. I just would win to state what Michael had said, our position has been to take the longer-term view, I think when you look at both our expansion strategies, the states we focused on, the potential Ascension alliance, I think it all reflects that.","Operator","The next question will be from Josh Raskin of Nephron Research. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Good morning, Michael. First question just on the exchangers and sort of just how you guys think about the bidding process and resetting your plans. We've talked about a margin I guess above 5% this year, as you think about 2019 is there a reset to your bid margin or do you think sort of where you are sustainable and again you've been sort of a sole operator in a lot of counties, so my guess is there's no need to make a majorization there but just how are you thinking about long-term margins and is there any reset we should expect for 2019?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, I'll let Jeff and some others comment, but as I said in my previous answer, we see our position in the marketplace is not changing but relative to Jeff has alluded.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes. Not to get to too much details about 2019 but we are certainly not planning for margin reset in 2019 that's certainly not our view.","Josh Raskin","Okay, that's perfect and then just on North Carolina as they released the set of bidders, I was actually surprised with only eight plans that were listed and so I don't know how to think about that, is that hey there is a little bit of fear around the ability to earn a reasonable return on that contract and it's a big contract, so there's risk or is it no but just such a large contract that there's only a few plans that couldn't realistically win this. I guess I'm just curious on your perspective from the competitive landscape in North Carolina?","Kevin Counihan","Hi, it\u2019s Kevin. I think one potential factor, contributing factor to what you've just said is that the -- as you probably know is that it was a complicated bid and one looks at the requirements on an MCO with respect to care management requirements and network and such, the mix between top provider organizations would be implemented as well as outside MCOs. It was -- it is a complicated bid, so again we're very excited about our bid. We believe we have a strong one but that may be a contributing factor.","Michael Neidorff","As I would just add to it, I think when you look at the scale, the size, the expectations, the technology required to do it, a lot of people who initially get excited about sit back and say, I think maybe I mean I have to sit this one out and so we'll come through acquisition, our partnership and think again we expect to do well with that.","Josh Raskin","Okay. And just to clarify, there was nothing in the bid or the RFP that came out that changed your view on the ability to earn a reasonable return, nothing around rates or continuity of care or anything like that that's going to make it onerous in the early period?","Michael Neidorff","I think no, I don\u2019t think so. I think you always look to have bifurcated how many member how many plans they have in a particular region. But I think when you look at it in total, I think it's refined, you always have your first year where you are educating people and we have plan for that accordingly and we've always said new plans, you want to go through three, four quarters. So that has same material supplies we are planning accordingly.","Operator","The next question will be from Steven Valiquette of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Just quickly for the California IHSS payment, I think you guys mentioned this at your Analyst meeting back in June, so it seems like it was included in guidance but just to clarify it was $140 million is it still subject to any material adjustments depending on minimum MLR calculations in California for those prior periods and also are these California risk orders are they all finalized now, just want to get more clarity around all that? Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, a couple of things. This was not in guidance, so it's never been in guidance but the real issue here is they are reconciling the program from the beginning its inception all the way back to 2014 and this is really the first quarter that we had cost and I would say member eligibility information from the state in order to perform the reconciliation. So the state has the data not the MCO, so obviously this is the first time we had a look at it, it is not done. I think in the press release you'll find that it says that we expect the 2014 through 2016 information to potentially get reconciled late this year or early next year and then there's still the 2017 year which would come later maybe in 2019. So what I will tell you is that it could get adjusted and if it does, we would disclose it accordingly.","Steven Valiquette","As far as the breakdown of $140 million how much of it relates to 2014 to 2016 versus 2017, is there any rough breakdown of it that way just to help us get a sense of the magnitude for how much it could be adjusted?","Jeff Schwaneke","I think there were rate changes in the program in the later years. So I think a significant piece of that relates to 2014, 2015 time periods with a little bit less in 2017. So I would say it probably starts larger at the beginning and gets smaller as the years go on.","Operator","The next question will be from Ralph Giacobbe of Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning. Obviously a lot more in parts in MLR and SG&A, any reason why you weren\u2019t excluding some of those sort of one-time items from the adjusted figures?","Jeff Schwaneke","Well, we have never historically done a, if you will an adjusted HBR, an adjusted SG&A ratio, so but I think our preference in general is to disclose and not have an adjustment such in this very long, in the filing, I think that makes it confusing and so I think our view was this was a much more easier way to just disclose the information.","Michael Neidorff","I just want to add to that. I think what really important as we change lenses to a $60 billion company versus where a lot of people remember as historically you're going to have a lot of adjustments that come through in a given quarter. That's just the nature of the business and we were -- what we did this time, we wanted to ensure that we have the offsets and ensure that there was no income taken into it, we took the $30 million and put in the foundation because weren't really even allowed.","And so -- as we -- and with Jeff obviously we decided to keep the adjustment simple, so people understand it and we believe that most people when we say here is a one-time change one way or the other tend to discount. I'm used to an environment where they say no that's to be expected in a business's size, in any given quarter, any given time there's going to be adjustments that is good and bad but you have to treat them just as one-time events and not part of the ongoing, where I'm pleased with in this quarter is the ongoing business is performing well and consistent with our expectations.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. All right, fair enough. And then just a follow-up, the administrations out yesterday sort of more flexibility states around waivers and the like, any initial thoughts around that and maybe implications to that, whether it's even a consideration for 2019 as opposed to maybe 2020, thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Kevin?","Kevin Counihan","Yes, it's a good question. I just finished reading the guidance last night. Clearly, I think we support the ability for states to have additional flexibility. I think it plays well into both our business model and also our strategy. With respect to some of the nuances and the guidance, I think we're all still studying that.","Operator","The next question will be from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","I wanted to just follow-up on the couple of the ratios, specifically first the HBR at 87.3% I mean just looking at typical and that's kind of ex the IHSS item, the typical seasonality and thinking through kind of the impact of Fidelis really trying to understand I guess the question would be what was the impact of Fidelis if you could spike that out because I think this HBR look pretty decent access.","Michael Neidorff","I want to comment but as we go forward, we've always had the policy, we look at consolidated business versus bifurcating it because it gets too confused in the next quarter what about this or that, so. We want to look at in totality, again some kind of directional.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes, I think you are exactly right, obviously you have two things. One has been here the whole year right, the HIF, the health insurer fee pulls down the HBR, if you're comparing to last year right because last year there was no health insurer fee and then you have the IHSS adjustment, so those two I would kind of put in a separate category and then you're correct you do have an increase for the Fidelis business because it does run a higher HBR and that was predominately offset by the marketplace because a lot of the growth, organic growth this year has been in the marketplace business. So the increase in volume of that business as a percentage of the total company pulls down the HBR.","Steve Tanal","Okay. And that qualify Fidelis and I guess just on the SG&A side, came in a bit higher than we were thinking and I guess one thing that I heard in the call so far was just the increased business expansion costs and that's I guess stepped up about $0.02 or so, was that in the third quarter or is that to come in the fourth quarter and just a step back on that like should we think about that $0.32 number as kind of a run rate number at this point?","Jeff Schwaneke","Some of that is in the third quarter related to our as Michael mentioned in his script related to the open enrollment period and so what you have to remember is in order what we do the business expansion costs are incremental so incremental to the prior year when you look at for example the marketplace business. so I would say it's a pretty good run rate but it can be lumpy from time to time depending on Medicaid RFPs because a lot of times if for example if we had a one-one start day we would have a lot of start-up costs in fourth quarter for that. So I would say it's a pretty good run rate, I think that's where we've been in that range for the last several years but obviously depending on the timing of awards and how many awards are in a specific year, it could change.","Operator","The next question will be from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you. I was hoping that you could walk us through capital deployment priorities as we think about the business model going forward, are there certain areas that what makes sense for us to continue to add assets or expand their exposure?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I mean I think obviously you've seen a lot of the capital that we continue to deploy, and have deployed over a long period of time is really related to growth and adding capabilities and I think you've seen some of that this year with the addition of CMG, our investment RxAdvance Interpreta. So we've continued to add capabilities to the business as well as grow the business.","So every new market requires statutory capital, that's capital deployment increasing the marketplace growth in that business. So I think it's a consistent strategy going forward, we are looking for ways to add capabilities that in the long-term will continue to grow the business successfully.","Sarah James","Okay. And can you talk about the rate outlook in a little bit more detail, you mentioned reiterating the 1% for 2018 but we've had a couple of updates recently that would put -- that were higher than that. So I\u2019m just wondering as you\u2019re looking for the rest of 2018 focusing on 4Q or kind of rolling out of the year, are you still thinking that 1% is accurate for 4Q or could the recent update provide some upside to that?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, just I think we\u2019ve been in -- I may get this a little bit off but I think we've been close to 1% for the last three years and just to give you the idea about what we're giving you as far as what the 1% it's the annualized effect of rate adjustments in this year, so it's not just as they occur, it's the annualized effect of those. And the other thing is it is a net -- it's a net rate adjustment, meaning if the state changes the fee schedule and provides a premium adjustment for that, we\u2019ve excluded those, we've netted those together because typically those are a one to one. So we\u2019re still comfortable with the 1%, we've been in the 1% range for the last several years and I think I wouldn't see anything different going forward at this point in time.","Michael Neidorff","And I think what is important Sarah is to what Jeff said, the easiest thing that 5% increases certainly but if they've raised other fees comparable to that that's a mislead. So I think we were in interest of clarity we put the net number.","Operator","The next question will be from Matt Borsch of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","Can I just ask about the tax rate, the rate looked quite low in this quarter and I think you're maintaining your tax rate guidance for the full-year, is that implying something pretty high for the fourth quarter, I'm just wondering if you could talk to what's going on there and apologies if I missed something you've already said.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, no Matt that's a good question. I think what's driving the tax rate obviously for the quarter is the significance of the adjustments related to the closing of the -- it's really the transaction costs associated with the Fidelis transaction. Those are deductible and a statutory tax rate that's roughly around 24%. So we've known about these costs for some time and our guidance has always included those. So again that's why you didn't see a revision to the tax rate range is for the full-year on a GAAP basis, we're going to get back to in between our guidance ranges that we've provided today.","Matt Borsch","Okay, okay, okay, got it.","Michael Neidorff","That's also Matt a good example I said earlier in terms of in any given quarter you can have a particular effect that impact.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, just to give you a little more detail, Matt, we've always had I would say a lower back half tax rate because of the addition of Fidelis because Fidelis is not subject to the health insurer fee this year, so their tax rate is much, much lower.","Matt Borsch","Right, got it.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, but for the full-year, we're comfortable with our guidance range.","Matt Borsch","Got it. Got it and can I just ask you a question on if you look at the organic growth going into 2019 and you're above $69 billion. Am I correct that implies a high-single-digit range for organic growth if you sort of broad side of the barn adjust out for Fidelis.","Michael Neidorff","I think we're once again for consistency; we have always when there is a partial year and something we have always had to adjust for the next year. So as you go year-over-year that's consistent, we don\u2019t see consistency in how we do this. But anyway you look at it, I mean it's a lot of significant growth for that and that reflects to what the visibility we had last June and we will update it in more detail and give you more detail in December.","Operator","The next question will be from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mr. Costa, your line is open. You may be muted on your side.","Peter Costa","Hi, good morning, sorry about that.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Peter Costa","Why did the guidance change or the metrics changing due to the performance at Fidelis being different than your expected and what things have you seen at Fidelis that's been different from your expectations either positive or negative?","Michael Neidorff","I think it's been very consistent with our expectations in the reaffirmation of the revenue and the EBITDA I think reflects that, it's a well run company and we're really pleased with that. I mean we were really able to back out and tell about innovation day one they are on our general ledger. So I mean this is a company they act together and it's everything we could have expected.","Peter Costa","And just as a follow-up, why was Fidelis's Care view of the individual mandate going away which caused them to initially seek much higher rates in the exchange business, so different from your view of the individual mandate going away, is New York somehow different and are you seeing what they initially saw now that you're seeing what's going on in New York?","Jeff Schwaneke","Okay. So you're right, New York is different, New York has a basic health plan, so I think you're probably aware of it's one of two states that and Minnesota that have that. So just by definition they're going to have different underwriting issues and risk management issues and selection issues than States without the VHP.","Peter Costa","So that's what caused them to seek much higher rates in New York than you\u2019re seeking rate increases for next year?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, if you are a state with the basic health plan like those two, there are definitely different underwriting issues, that one has versus state without that.","Peter Costa","Okay, thank you.","Michael Neidorff","And we of course could not get involved in any discussions on their rate adjustments until after closing that would have been inappropriate.","Operator","The next question will be from Michael Newshel of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel","Really looking at the RFP pipeline, is there any update on expected timing of the starship and Star Plus contracts in Texas after the cancellation and repost of the RFP a few weeks ago?","Michael Neidorff","I think it a moving -- it's a movable piece, Chris what's the best.","Chris Koster","I will give you my best shot Michael. Right now, it looks like the -- as you know both of the RFPs have been reissued and are due in mid-November, we expect that the awards are going to come Q2, Q3 of 2019 and right now the projected start dates for both of these are Star Plus will be 6\/1 of 2020 and the Chip and Star RFP will be 9\/1 of 2020.","Michael Newshel","Okay, great. And how about -- and also what's the latest on Pennsylvania whether the Health Choices contract will go through another bidding process and at the course vacated that?","Michael Neidorff","We haven't -- I haven\u2019t heard anything. I mean it's been very silent and it was a deal focused on long-term territory and a great job there in the East any way that we made up and that's going well but I've decided that's something I\u2019m just going to wait during the call and say it's time to try a third time. We have done well twice so we see what happens this time.","Michael Newshel","And existing business continue in the meantime?","Michael Neidorff","Well actually I'm unsure of it, yes. There is not a mean data they need the help they wanted. And there's a -- you have the Election coming up, the new Governor will be in place potentially. So let's wait and see what happens there. And I'm not forecasting the Election term for various reasons, so but there is a lot of variable. So we had so much going on now that if they want to wait a little bit that is okay, we have a full fight.","Operator","The next question will be from Lance Wilkes of Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Just a quick question on the days in claims payable and the timing issue more predominantly on the non-Fidelis, was that related to any particular products or if you could just give a little more color on that that would be helpful?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, no nothing specific. I mean when you look at the days in claims payable, some of this depends on which day of the month the actual quarter ends on and when our checks around are scheduled. Obviously we\u2019re fairly large so we're making a lot of payments every single day. So it just depends on that, that's what most of the timing items are related to. And I think I was pretty clear in my script that long-term we think in the mid-40s as a good proxy for where we're going to be with the addition of Fidelis.","Lance Wilkes","Okay. And then on RxAdvance, so you made additional investment in convertible preferred and you talked a little bit about the rollout in 2018, if you could talk a little more about both how you are thinking about rolling out that capability, how it replaces existing capabilities and what would be the impact to states kind of pricing model as a result of this, is it you frequently have like separate capitation rates related to pharmacy and this is going to transfer to more transparent pricing or maybe just some more color around that.","Michael Neidorff","Yes, what I'm going to do is Jesse has been leading that and so I'm going to ask him to be able to speak out.","Jesse Hunter","Yes, I think good combination questions there related to RxAdvance, so I think as Michael referenced in his comments I think the important starting point here is they were really investing in the future kind of more transparent version of the PBM model, so that includes making investments in the technology platform which is really where RxAdvance is today. So we're rolling that out on a market-by-market basis as we reference that rollout, has been in process since the initial investments and will initiate in the end of 2018 and continue to occur market-by-market through 2019.","In conjunction with those new -- the new implementation of the platform yes we will be moving to a different operating model which is built around transparency and yes more focused on cost sharing for total cost of care so integration of pharmacy cost with the more comprehensive total medical cost and we do believe that over time delivering those services more efficiently will provide both higher quality and lower costs for all of our customers including states.","Michael Neidorff","Yes, this going to be a game changer.","Operator","The next question will be from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi, thanks for taking my question and look to us that you added something like 110 counties in Medicare Advantage for 2019 you got the Centene's J.V. the stars that were discussed earlier in the call Michael I'm just interested in your kind of longer-term view aspiration for Medicare Advantage in the business mix for Centene?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, as I said that when we talk about our growth and I view the Medicare Advantage product is continue to fuel our growth into the next decade and we've been using last year a little bit this year as the learning process and gradually expanding and I keep telling you it's not how fast, it's how well get the fundamentals right and that's what we're doing but I see it as a very important part of what we're doing and you'll continue to see it and we've built systems capability for it. And I think that's also a very important whether it be the RxAdvance the Interpreta things that help improve outcomes, so we see it as a very important part going forward.","Dave Windley","Thank you. And then at the top of the call you talked about Fidelis and the adding of case management and clinical programs and things like that I think you've been fairly transparent about targeting there -- there HBR as your synergy target how quickly can those things happen and do you think the benefits of those things are fully captured in the synergy targets that you glade out or can those be exceeded over time?","Michael Neidorff","Well I think one we will be implementing them as we speak. And it's something that we've got ready for during the extended period before we could close so those are the kinds of things we could talk about and did. So I think it will and we're careful from the standpoint of GAAP reporting and how we do things that from a conservative standpoint has been consistent with appropriate GAAP accounting. I would always hope that we can under promise and over deliver a little bit and so we want to keep the expectations real and the timing real. But we're very hopeful on the benefits of all these as they are, and I know they were looking forward to our systems and our capabilities. So and as things we're learning from them, so it's so easy to put two things something together right there.","Operator","The next question will be from Zack Sopcak of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Zack Sopcak","Hey good morning. Thank you for the question. I wanted to ask first about just your turn around in MA Stars and from your perspective what really drove the improvement and were there any incremental investments involved to get you up for 2020?","Michael Neidorff","Well, I'll ask Kevin to jump in. But that's something that's a priority and we've been focusing on it and we're not satisfied with where we are, we're going to keep pushing it, the increase it and make it better and that's just when it, we are happy we got involved with it. We made the priority to make the investments to get there and then we caught a few breaks along the way as well, so Kevin you want to take?","Kevin Counihan","I think Michael said it. It is clearly a priority. Michael's made a pretty clear to us what his expectations are. We've got a strong team that's focused in on Stars as well as RA and other quality activities. So it\u2019s about execution.","Zack Sopcak","Thank you. And then just to clarify on your charitable contribution, so if I look back a year 2017 and 2016 numbers you excluded them from adjusted net earnings and but now you are including in adjusted net earnings. Going forward should I just consider your charitable contributions to be included into it in adjusted net earnings?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I think this goes back to what Michael had mentioned earlier was this is really the offset for the other two items. So to the extent that you see one like this, I think it would be disclosed similarly to what we did this quarter.","Operator","The next question will be from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake","Thanks, good morning. Just wanted to come back on the tax rate. First of all, is there you're saying that the one-time cost from Fidelis were deductible in the adjusted number?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, they are deductible on your tax return, right. They are deductible on your tax return at their effectively their statutory rate which is around 23 and change, I guess is what I would say. So I mean those are actual costs that we burden that when we file our tax return we will take a deduction form.","Justin Lake","Right. So I guess what I'm just a little bit confused by if I'm understand this correctly is you one-time the cost of the Fidelis integration right, those are not included in the adjusted, right?","Jeff Schwaneke","In the adjusted earnings right, that's exactly right, so we had the cost that we are effectively backing those out at the applicable tax rate at which they will be on our federal tax return.","Justin Lake","Right. Did you also one-time the tax benefit or the tax yield or you think you ramped that out?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, if you look at the press release, the tax is actually they are combined, the tax benefit of those deductions is disclosed in the press release but it's aggregated into one line, right.","Justin Lake","Right. That's what I thought so.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, the 65 it's the amortization and the transaction cost, the tax benefit of both of those are aggregated into one-line in the press release, yes I think it was $110 million I think for the quarter, right.","Justin Lake","Okay, so the adjusted tax rate when we look at adjusted pretax income and then adjusted aftertax income and look at the tax rate, that tax rate doesn't see the benefit, it just look somewhat low, low impacted and it kind of implies the fourth quarter is going to be pretty meaningful given the guidance so a little bit confused?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, it\u2019s the magnitude to some extent because GAAP net earnings were so low but I mean we are guiding to a GAAP number, right. So if you look at the GAAP number for the quarter is roughly 33%. I know it has a small amount of earnings because of the significance of the adjustment, right of the transaction cost but we\u2019re guiding to a GAAP range which is that's why we didn't -- we didn't actually change the range because we're going to get to that GAAP range. So recalculate your math on the GAAP financial statements and that will give you what you're looking for.","Justin Lake","Got it. So maybe if I could just follow-up the adjusted tax rate we should be thinking about for the year maybe that's the right way to think about it?","Jeff Schwaneke","Well, we don't really give an adjusted tax rate, right. I mean what I could tell you is those items specifically on the tax return are deductible at a statutory rate which by the way the difference between the statutory rate and the rate that you see on our financials has a large piece of it associated with the health insurer fee. The non-deductibility of the health insurer, yes. So that is playing into the calculation which is why the math is challenging to understand the way you're trying to do it.","Justin Lake","All right, I will take a harder look at it; I know there is a lot of moving parts in this quarter. And then just lastly on the services business when I look back at the third quarter last year obviously it looks like a pretty kind of strong margin in the quarter on the services business in 3Q 2017, obviously it looks like it's normalizing more than anything maybe in third quarter 2018, is there a way to think about this services margin as we go forward, is this a good kind of run rate just kind of low-80s kind of cost of services?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I think I'll just give you a couple of pieces here, Justin. I think the services line continues to change specifically with some of the deals that we've done last year but the services margin that you see in the financials, it would have been a little bit lower because of the VA, the VA adjustments that we took this quarter.","So if you exclude those, it would have been lower and more consistent with last year and that's because the third quarter has a lower cost of services ratio because that's typically when we get the information on the U.S. and the ACO programs and we have the reconciliation and that reconciliation is favorable to us and it was favorable to us by a similar amount last year third quarter.","So it\u2019s kind of being masked by a couple of things, the wind down of the VA program that was not work was at full speed until September 30 that wound down throughout the quarter and then these VA adjustments that we've mentioned also inflate the cost of service ratio a little bit. So I would say the mix in that line continues to change but I would say mid to low 80s is probably a good estimate and that could fluctuate by quarter depending on when we have reconciliations in a lot of these programs.","Operator","The next question will be from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Okay, thanks for taking the question. Couple of questions, the first one was as you think about your margins going forward, do you see any reason you couldn't expand margins, you are mix shifting to exchanges and MA looks like trend is weak, you have a better STAR rating 2020 investments in comp could go up with interest rates, so what would your normalized margin expectations be?","Michael Neidorff","Well as I think we will talk more about margins in 2019 in December but where we have clearly stated we are demonstrating our interest in expanding margins, we think that's appropriate the scale, the size, the activities we have going the technology we are trying to improve medical costs over time all will tend and give us the ability to expand margins, and we can be more specific on our December call.","Ana Gupte","Okay, great. Thanks, thanks for that, that's what I would have thought. The second was on exchanges for 2019, what are you expecting given on the subsidized book of business overall I mean just for the exchanges what types of assumptions are you all making and is your growth likely to come from secular growth or are you thinking of it more from just your geographic expansion and share shifting within your existing markets or a bit of both?","Michael Neidorff","Well I'm going to ask to kind of stick with us in terms of not getting too granular on 2019 until December that's a pattern that we have well established over lot of years. I will say that from the standpoint our focus continues to be on the supplements and that portion that has the premium supplement and we see that continuing going into 2019. So it's one of the business is usual for us and we\u2019re comfortable with the attrition we had this year relative to previous years, the reenrollment we had everything says it's very much business as usual and I thought -- I think you\u2019ve heard Jeff comment earlier that from a margin standpoint the business we see maintaining that. So it\u2019s a business we understand and we have developed systems to continue to build it and maintain it.","Ana Gupte","Okay. Great, thanks. One final one, any update at all on the Texas RFP? I believe they announced they were --","Michael Neidorff","I think Chris you just give a little detail, you want to repeat that?","Chris Koster","Sure, I would be happy Michael. Both of the RFPs that were cancelled have been reassured and are due in mid November, the awards will be announced, we believe in Q2 and Q3 of 2019 projected start dates for STAR Plus will be 6\/1 of 2020 and CHIP and STAR RFP our start date will be 9\/1 of 2020.","Operator","The next question will be from Gary Taylor of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi, good morning. Just a couple of questions and just sorry to go back to the tax rate again, I think there is a perception that the quarter did benefit materially from a lower tax rate and I followed your discussion but the non-deductible -- excuse me non-deductibility of the HIF actually serves to increase the effective tax rate, right. So 8 over 24 on a GAAP basis is 33 but including non-deductibility of the HIF 8 over the 202 number like a 4% number, so it does look like there was a tax benefit in the quarter different from what you've seen in the first half, in Fidelis which is a few hundred basis points I think, so you follow where I'm going and where am I wrong on looking at that?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I mean I can understand your -- I can understand where you're coming from, I guess what I would say is this is nothing different than what we've already had in our guidance from when we had these costs associated with Fidelis transaction. So yes, Fidelis lower tax rate not subject to the health insurer fee you're pulling one item and\/or two items putting them down below the line and then you're pulling them out at a statutory rate versus your annual effective rate which includes the non-deductibility of the health insurer fee. So I think it's more complicated than that but we certainly don't view that there was any tax benefit in the quarter. This has been our guidance for -- we're guiding to an adjusted number on a full-year basis and we don't see any tax benefit to core the way we\u2019ve seen it since these costs associated with the regulatory undertakings were known.","Gary Taylor","Sure. Maybe another way to sort of look at the quarter, if we look at pretax earnings were up $252 million in the first quarter, $89 million in the second quarter, adjusted pretax earnings up about $110 million this quarter, but Fidelis if it ran a 4% margin would have been over $100 million of that, so it does look like the pretax earnings growth from the rest of Centene's low this quarter? Is that something that you would acknowledge? Does that make sense?","Jeff Schwaneke","So you're adding back the -- which pieces are you adding back, the merger costs and the amortization or just the merger costs or --?","Gary Taylor","Yes, both it looks like the adjusted pretax was $490 million which is up like $110 million versus the prior year. So I think it was --","Jeff Schwaneke","The piece you may be missing is the exchange business and how the profitability of the exchange business works, right. Remember it, it makes yes -- it makes a lot and the other thing is that remember the enrollment days were accelerated this year, so the exchange business profile is actually a lot different and it's more meaningful piece of the business.","Gary Taylor","That makes some sense. Last question the specialty operating income was $51 million loss is a $102 million year-over-year, you called out the VA termination costs as the major factor there but it still would have been about $40 million of OI versus the $102 million and you said other Federal contracts and then some carve in of behavioral, is there any more color you could tell us on just the specialty operating income and where there might be some margin pressure?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, actually I think some of this is related to the integration of the physical and behavioral health, so some of those behavioral health revenues and margin is now embedded within our health plans because we moved to an integrated approach.","Operator","The next question will be from A. J. Rice of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A. J. Rice","Hi everybody. First of all maybe a numbers question and one other broader question, in the MLR when you ex out for the unusual items, your ops improved 70 basis points year-to-year and I think in the prepared remarks you said a lot of that was due to the HICs and the health insurance exchanges. I just wondered I mean say I may be wrong but four major things, your core Medicaid, your Fidelis, your HICs and then the health impact, anyway to sort of parse out where you're seeing improvement year-to-year in MVR and where is, if there is any place where there's pressure?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I mean I think those are the items that we mentioned. I mean as we look at the business, I think the Medicaid business was pretty consistent, that's why we didn't highlight it is a driver of the HBR metrics, that's why we highlighted obviously Fidelis coming in would be an increase to the HBR and the marketplace besides the business is a decrease on a year-over-year basis, so we highlighted kind of the -- what I would call the drivers for the quarter. Year-over-year by the way, I was just making sure.","A. J. Rice","Yes your HICs HBR was significantly better this year than last year?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, I think it was in line with our expectations. I think its volume, the magnitude of the business obviously a lot -- it's a lot larger.","A. J. Rice","Right, okay. So it's mainly just the growth as opposed to the actual absolute ratio?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, it's the growth on the business.","A. J. Rice","Okay. And then my bigger picture question is obviously with Fidelis now done your balance sheet still sort of within the range that you guys historically have targeted I would say and acquisitions have been a big part of the growth story for the last couple of years even bigger acquisitions. What's the appetite of the company to look in additional deals, do you need sometime or you selling in with Fidelis or you've done a couple of big ones in pretty rapid discussion are you open to other things?","Michael Neidorff","Well, I think Fidelis integration is well I mean or put in this context, we know that the closing got delayed which gives us a lot of time to prepare for a very effective integration, so it is where needs to be and it's appropriate, so it's an opportunity came along, there is no reason for this not to do, we have a strong balance sheet, we have lot of capability and we\u2019re in a position to do it but perhaps it is the right time and the right place and first financially effective and strategically.","A. J. Rice","Would it be reasonable to think that Medicare given your focus on growing that is a primary place to look or there other areas you would highlight?","Michael Neidorff","I think, I mean, I would look -- we look it at very broadly, I mean you've seen us with a focus on technology and some really effective technology that's going to be provided a lot of significant dividends and already are, our technology committee meeting yesterday demonstrated that we're moving more and more to a leadership position there, so there's a lot of very good opportunities there that stay tuned.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to hand the conference back over to Mr. Neidorff for his closing remarks.","End of Q&A","Michael Neidorff","I want to thank you for all your questions, I hope it clarified some of the outstanding issues because we I believe we had a strong quarter and the metrics were right and what people refer to as noise in puts and takes that normal course of business in a company of our size and what's important to us is that the fundamentals are strong, it's heading in a right way and we're looking forward to the fourth quarter and we're looking forward to the December we can tell you how strong 2019 will be.

[Operator Instructions] Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Ed Kroll. Please go ahead, sir.","Edmund E. Kroll","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. I'm Ed Kroll, Head of IR for Centene Corporation. Thank you for joining us on our Second Quarter Earnings Call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Scheffel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call.","The call is expected to last approximately 45 minutes, and may also be accessed through our website live at centene.com. A replay will be available shortly after the call's completion also at centene.com or by dialing, in the U.S., (877) 344-7529 in the U.S. and Canada, or in other countries, by dialing (412) 317-0088. The playback number for both calls is 10030660.","Any remarks that Centene may make about future expectations, plans and prospects constitute forward-looking statements for purposes of the Safe Harbor provision under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may differ materially from those indicated by these forward-looking statements as a result of various important factors, including those discussed in the Form 10-Q that we filed this morning with the SEC.","Centene anticipates subsequent events and developments will cause estimates to change. While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically decline any obligation to do so.","As a reminder, you can find our remaining 2013 release dates on our websites, and our next Investor Day will be Friday, December 13, 2013, in New York City. Please mark your calendars. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff.","Michael F. Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's second quarter earnings call. During the course of today's call, we will discuss our solid second quarter results, growth opportunities, including the upcoming implementation of the Affordable Care Act, state updates and some brief comments on our recent exit from Kentucky.","We are pleased with our second quarter results. We continue to produce strong revenue growth and we are particularly pleased by and with the sequential improvement in our pretax margin. This increased by 90 basis points in the second quarter. The improvement was due to a better HBR and solid expense control at the G&A level.","Now let's discuss some highlights of our second quarter results.","Membership increased 12% year-over-year to $2.7 million covered lives. Premium and Service revenues grew 28% year-over-year to $2.6 billion. The faster premium growth relative to membership growth is driven by the continued mix shift towards higher acuity beneficiaries. Long-term-care membership increased almost 200% to 24,400 lives. ABD and Medicare membership increased almost 20% to 322,500 lives. The increase in high acuity membership is consistent with Centene's strategic priority to diversify its product lines and businesses, to maximize cost savings for states. Note that the long-term care growth should accelerate over the next several quarters when the Florida expansion commences.","The health benefits ratio improved 410 basis points year-over-year and 160 basis points sequentially to 88.8%. The HBR for our existing business was 88.4% and was 20.7% for the new business. We successfully transitioned a large block of business from the new to existing category during the quarter. This continues to give us confidence in our ability to manage new business ramps in the second half of 2013 as we approach our near-term margin objective of 3%, and our long-term objective of 3% to 5%.","During the second quarter, we continue to experience a modest reduction in medical trend across our existing business. This included inpatient premature births and certain outpatient cost. For example, ER utilization declined 5.9% sequentially and 1.2% year-over-year. We remain optimistic in our ability to drive utilization lower in the second half, but we are maintaining our medical trend in HBR estimates for the full year. This recognizes the possibility of a late year-end spike in flu cost similar to what occurred last year.","The G&A ratio increased 50 basis points year-over-year and 40 basis points sequentially to 8.7%. Please note that the 8.7% includes a normal level of performance-based compensation, as well as closing costs related to the Acaria acquisition.","Now onto opportunities, including the implementation of ACA. Our future pipeline remains extremely robust at $138 billion through 2016. We expect to continue our recognized success in winning new business, as well as diversifying by geography and product line, with the goal of driving profitable growth. As discussed at our Investor Day, we already have visibility on at least 15% revenue growth in 2014, excluding health care reform.","There has been a lot of discussion in Washington, D.C., and elsewhere as to whether all provisions of the ACA will commence on January 1. In fact, the employer mandate has been delayed until 2015. In any event, Centene will be ready for the exchanges and the Medicaid expansion. We have been preparing for quite some time. We have scalable infrastructure and the overall bandwidth to manage the Medicaid expansion. We are taking a selective approach to participation in the exchanges by focusing on certain markets within a subset of our current states.","Now a quick comment on the industry tax. We continue to believe appropriate congressional action will exempt Medicaid from this tax grant. However, we are engaged in constructive discussions with our state customers to include the tax in our rates should Congress fail to intervene.","Next, onto state updates. Texas. A 2.9% supplemental rate increase for the rural service area was finalized in June. We continue to work productively with the state in evaluating overall rate adequacy for the regular September 1 rate adjustment.","Ohio. At the beginning of July, our Ohio subsidiary began operating under a new and expanded contract. Centene now serves beneficiaries state-wide to Ohio's newly aligned 3 regions. The ramp of additional lives on the new contract has been slightly slower than we previously expected. Also, the dual eligible demonstration project has been delayed and will likely commence in 2014. We are closely working with the state on both of these matters and anticipate an ongoing enrollment ramp into 2014 for Ohio.","Illinois. The duals demonstration project in Illinois will also be delayed into 2014. However, we have been approved in several new service areas for non-dual beneficiaries starting later this year.","I would now like to discuss recent and upcoming contract starts.","Centurion. We recently entered the correctional healthcare market through a joint venture with MHM, a national leader in providing health care services to correctional systems. We see the correctional market as a $9 billion to $10 billion market opportunity. Centurion can deliver cost savings and higher-quality states for the inmate population, the same type of solution we deliver for states in our other businesses.","On July 1, Centurion began operating under a new contract with the Department of Corrections in Massachusetts. Centurion also signed a contract for a similar program in Tennessee operations. In Tennessee, we're expected to commence in the third quarter of 2013.","California. We have 1 -- 2 Medicare contracts in California -- Medi-Cal contracts in California. Under the first contract, Centene will serve members in the state's Medi-Cal manage rural expansion program in 18 counties. Under the second contract, Centene will begin serving Medi-Cal beneficiaries in Imperial County. Enrollment is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2013 for both contracts.","Florida. We will be participating in Florida's Medicaid managed long-term-care program. This program is proceeding as planned, with enrollment set to be phased in by region beginning in August of 2013 through March of 2014.","New Hampshire. There is increasing momentum for the launch of the state's managed care program. We now expect to begin serving beneficiaries in late 2013.","Switching to the rate outlook. We continue to expect a composite rate increase of 1% to 3% for 2013.","Finally, some brief comments on Kentucky. As you know, we exited Kentucky effective July 5, July 5. We are winding down operations, which will be substantially complete by the end of this year. Our statutory capital of $80 million will likely be tied up until resolution of the legal matters, which may take several years. Due to ongoing litigation with the Commonwealth, we cannot comment any further on Kentucky on this call. We did provide some updated disclosure on the matter in our second quarter Form 10-Q, which we filed this morning.","In closing, our view of 2013 and 2014 remains positive. We are raising our earnings guidance by $0.05 on the low-end to $2.65 to $2.90. As Bill will discuss, we also increased our revenue guidance to effect new contract wins. I thank you for your support and interest in Centene. I will now turn the call over to Bill.","William N. Scheffel","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. For the second quarter of 2013, we recorded Premium and Service revenues of $2.6 billion, a 28% increase over last year. Our revenue increase resulted from the addition of the Missouri and Washington contracts in July 2012; the pharmacy carve-in Louisiana, effective November 1, the additional membership in Mississippi resulting from the December 1 program expansion; the start of the Kansas contract on January 1 this year; the acquisition of AcariaHealth on April 1; year-over-year increase in membership in Texas; and rate increases in several of our markets between years. The $79 million increase in service revenues between years relates to the Acaria acquisition.","Our consolidated health benefits ratio was 88.8% in the second quarter compared to 92.9% in the second quarter of 2012, and 90.4% in the first quarter of this year. The decrease in our HBR between years of 410 basis points is a result of the higher medical cost experienced in 2012 for the Texas expansion area, Kentucky business and the individual health business. Those issues have been addressed between years, such that our overall HBR in the second quarter of this year is running at a more normal historical rate. Adjusted for the mix shift, which has occurred through the addition of higher acuity membership in the ABD and long-term care areas.","Sequentially, our HBR decreased by 160 basis points, which reflects the high level of flu costs incurred in the first quarter and normal seasonality.","For the second quarter of 2013, we have seen a significant decrease in the portion of our revenue with less than a full 12 months of operations. 17% of our consolidated Premium and Service revenues came from new business this quarter compared to 31% for last year's second quarter and 35% in the first quarter this year. This primarily reflects the shift of the Texas expansion business to existing business as of the second quarter.","The HBR for our new business declined to 90.7% in the second quarter this year compared to 102.3% in the second quarter last year. The higher 2012 level was also due to the Texas expansion, Kentucky and individual health businesses. The existing business HBR was 88.4% for the second quarter compared to 88.7% in last year's second quarter and 88.4% in the first quarter of this year.","Our general administrative expense ratio was 8.7% in the second quarter compared to 8.2% in Q2 of last year and 8.3% in the first quarter of this year. The year-over-year increase of 50 basis points is related to additional performance-based compensation recorded this year, approximately $0.07 of transaction costs for the Acaria acquisition, which closes this quarter, offset by additional leverage from our growth. Our total business expansion cost were $0.17 this quarter, which includes the $0.07 in Acaria cost, compared to $0.11 in last year's second quarter and $0.09 in Q1 of this year.","Investment income was $4.3 million in Q2 this year compared to $4.0 million in the comparable period last year. The increase is due to higher invested balances.","Interest expense increased from $4.7 million last year to $7.0 million in the second quarter of 2013, reflecting the expense from the additional $175 million in senior notes issued in the fourth quarter last year.","Our income tax rate for the second quarter was 39%, excluding the effects of noncontrolling interest. The rate in the second quarter last year was 19.7%, which was impacted from the non-deductibility of our impairment charge. Our diluted earnings per share was $0.70, which includes the $0.07 in expense for the Acaria transaction cost. Our diluted average shares outstanding is 56.6 million shares for the second quarter, which increased by approximately 2.3 million shares in Q1 due to the shares issued for the Acaria acquisition. At June 30, we had cash, investments and restricted deposits of $1.6 billion, including $34 million held by unregulated entities.","We continue to maintain our risk-based capital in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Our debt at June 30 totaled $551 million, including $30 million drawn on our revolving credit agreement. Our debt-to-capital ratio, excluding the $74 million in nonrecourse mortgage note, was 29.8%, a decline from the 31.9% at March 31. Our medical claims liability totaled $1.1 billion at June 30 and represents 43.7 days in claims payable. The increase from 42.4 days at the end of the first quarter is primarily due to the processing and timing of payments at quarter-end.","Cash flow from operations was $37.9 million which is almost 1x net earnings for the second quarter.","Our updated 2013 guidance is Premium and Service revenues, $10.3 billion to $10.6 billion; diluted earnings per share, $2.65 to $2.90; consolidated health benefits ratio, 88% to 89%; general and administrative expense ratio, 8.8% to 9.3%; and diluted shares outstanding, 56 million to 56.5 million shares. Now these numbers are GAAP numbers and include the $0.07 for Acaria transaction costs. Our guidance assumptions include the start-ups for Centurion and the beginning of operations in California and New Hampshire in late 2013. Business expansion costs are expected to be $0.60 to $0.65 for all of 2013.","Operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Josh Raskin from Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So first question, just -- I know you're not going to comment further on Kentucky. But just maybe, Bill, any changes in the premium deficiency reserve? Any accrual updates, et cetera, on potential losses in Kentucky impacting the second quarter?","William N. Scheffel","Sure. Josh, I think the premium deficiency reserve that we had at the end of the first quarter was around $18 million. We had $1 million left on our balance sheet at June 30, and that really represents the operating period from July 1 to July 5. Now we did incur additional costs in the first -- second quarter for some of the ramp-up of the things we're doing. So that was about $0.04 a share that we incurred for Q2. And we expect to continue to incur that $3 million, is what it roughly was, in Q3 and Q4, and those costs are built into our guidance for the year.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Now were those previously expect -- those are exit costs, is that what that would be, Bill?","William N. Scheffel","I would say they're a variety of things that as we looked at the close for June 30 and the expectation, obviously, we already know we were out on July 5, that we did everything we could to identify costs in the Kentucky book of business and make sure we have those properly accrued for at quarter-end.","William N. Scheffel","I mean, it's wind down of people, Josh. It's legal expense, things like that.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. You're still paying claims, et cetera, through the end...","Michael F. Neidorff","And we'll be doing that for most of this year.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then sort of shifting gears to exchanges. That was an opportunity that you guys have been talking a lot about. I guess, 2 questions around that. First is just how do you think about the capabilities needed in 2014, and maybe where are you along that continuum? You guys added underwriters and things like that. And then secondarily, just looking at the subset. I think you guys have 9 states, at least, that we have identified that you're going to be participating in. I think Arkansas is probably the only one where you don't have a Medicaid presence, but I know there was that -- the legacy acquisition there. So I'm just curious, how did you sort of pare down the list? What made a state more attractive, and how you sort of thought about that?","Michael F. Neidorff","I'll ask William to comment.","William N. Scheffel","On the capabilities for 2014, we've had a team building out the IT and operations infrastructure, as well as the sales and marketing capabilities that we're looking for to be able to expand our -- enter the exchanges and build our exchange presence in 2014. Clearly, the intent behind our exchange strategy has been to leverage the capabilities that we have in-house today in the different health plans. So a great deal of what we do today, with respect to particularly paying claims, member-facing, provider-facing kind of services that we do for our Medicaid members, we will be duplicating for our exchange members. But otherwise, particularly with interfacing with the exchanges and obviously, designing, building out the products, being able to administer the products, being able to enroll build members, we're well down the road of the building out those capabilities and feel good about where we stand with respect to that kind of infrastructure for 2014. Just a comment on the 9 states. Again, our strategy has been to be selective and targeted with where we participate in 2014. So we looked at pretty much, as you mentioned, focusing entirely in the states where we have health plans today, where we have strong health plans that have the capability and capacity to take this on for this year. And then looking at where we're able to contract with high-quality providers that can deliver an affordable product for our target membership, which is the subsidized membership. And that's largely guided -- where we've been able to accomplish that is largely guided where we're participating in 2014 in terms of the states, but also in terms of the select service areas that we're participating in, in each of those dates. As you mentioned, Arkansas is a slight exception to that. We have had a presence in Arkansas through our NovaSys subsidiary which has been administering -- doing many of the administrative functions for our individual block of business. So they have some strong capabilities there to leverage. And particularly given the Medicaid expansion opportunity that exists in Arkansas through the exchanges, it was something that rose to the list to try to file and try to get -- build-out our capabilities to enter for 2014 and that's why Arkansas is on the list of the 9 areas we're targeting for 2014.","Michael F. Neidorff","I might also comment that some of you would recall through the acquisition in Arkansas and Celtic, we did some of those things for the individual capability. The building [ph],, the enrollment, the whole design type aspect of it. So that capability was there. It's a matter of marrying that with the medical management and the network that we have in the existing states. So it makes a manageable controlled process for us in those states.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And Mike, any sense as to when you'll be a -- I know you talked about the visibility into the 15% top line growth next year, excluding reform. When do you think you'll be able to give some guidance around the expansion of Medicaid and the impact of exchanges?","Michael F. Neidorff","We'll -- if something's really known, we'll bring it out on future calls like this. But we typically do that on our December 13 Investor Day, where we give full guidance on 2014.","Operator","The next question is from Justin Lake, JPMorgan.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Mike Newshel in for Justin. Can you just clarify on the SG&A cost for new business, the $0.60 to $0.65 you mentioned for the full year? How much of that is going to fall on the second half?","William N. Scheffel","I think in the first half, we've said that we've had roughly $0.26, I would say, something like that, in the first half. So we'll have about $0.34 to $0.38 to $0.39 in the second half.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And on prior period reserve development on a 12-month basis, it was up to more normalized $42 million versus the low-level you had called out in the first quarter. Can you just clarify what impact reserve development had in the second quarter?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I think what we're -- we don't get into the specifics in any one quarter. But we did say at the end of the call last quarter that the reserve development that we showed, really which was on the March 31, 2012, reserves, was abnormally low for us, of only $2 million positive, maybe a little bit more, when we added in Kentucky retros. And that was the period right as -- right after the Texas expansion was occurring. And we had written some new business in Celtic on individual health business and some of the Kentucky issues. So what we saw was that did not develop as positively as we normally see. And I also said was as we look forward to that point in time for the June 30, 2012, the September 30, 2012 and the December 31, 2012 numbers, those were all developing more similar to what we historically see. And I think all of those were in excess of $40 million at that point in time, and still at this point in time also.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So basically, the second quarter sort of developed in line with like maybe the past 3 quarters?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I would say, the June 30, 2012, reserves which was -- which is what is shown as the roll forward in the press release, is a typical quarter that we would normally see. And we would expect that to continue going forward based on our analysis of the 3, 6 and 9 months roll-forwards that we have for each of those other additional periods.","Operator","Our next question is from Ralph Giacobbe, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just looking at the MLR on existing business, the 88.4% was flat sequentially. I know last quarter, you had some incremental flu cost that may have bumped that number up a little bit. So anything this quarter, I guess, specifically to point out? And then the second piece of that question. Ultimately, I know you've talked about net margin, but where do you think you could drive MLR in the existing business down to? What's sort of the target range that you think about? Should we think about in that kind of 88% range? Or just parameters around that would be helpful.","William N. Scheffel","I'm going to start with the second part of your question first and hope to remember the first part then. I think, if you recall back to our Investor Day, Rob Hitchcock went through some of our products and what the individual products are rated in terms of an actuarial HBR. And so typically, we would see a ten [ph] of product in the 86%, 87%, somewhere in that ballpark, of a targeted HBR. But our higher acuity products in ABD and long-term care tend to be 88% to 90%, even in low 90%s, and those are much higher-premium products. So I think what we've seen overall is our HBR climb, as we indicated, through a mixed shift, as we've added fewer members, because there's less members in the long-term care ADB membership, usually, but at much higher premiums. So I think I would expect that our overall HBR would be in the range that we're currently talking, which is 88% to 89% for this year. And a lot of that has to do with the mix. We're adding a lot of revenue going forward here in the long-term care product, for example, in Florida. And so that's going to continue, I think, to be rated at the higher HBRs rather than the lower ten [ph] of HBR. And then I think in the second quarter, we switched the Texas expansion business from the first quarter, so from new to existing. So the 88.4% is the same for Q1 and Q2, but there are some pieces to it. Texas moved in as a little higher than the average of 88.4% but we have other businesses that are performing below the 88.4%. So overall, it stayed the same from the first quarter to the second quarter.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just a follow-up question. The California rural Medi-Cal expansion sort of expected to begin in 4Q. I guess, just give us a sense of how you're approaching the business just given the experience in the Texas service -- rural service area where you had kind of a higher utilization trend. So I guess from our perspective, as we think about the business, would you expect MLRs to track kind of at the levels of new business that we saw this quarter in that kind of 91% range? Or should we expect initially higher, just given the rural region?","Michael F. Neidorff","Jesse, you want to take this?","Jesse N. Hunter","Sure. Yes, Ralph, thank you. So I mean obviously, as we go into all of our new markets, we try to take an on appropriate view of that. The product mix, to Bill's last comments, and the market-specific dynamics. And we always are going to start higher and I would fully expect that to be the case. It wouldn't get into the commentary right now on how the California rural compares to the Texas rural. But I think we'll take an expectation that the California business will start at a higher level. That business is converting from fee-for-service into a managed care environment. And that, just as we've seen in the overall shift from kind of new market or new business, HBR [ph] , down to existing business, we would expect that trend to continue for California.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Windley, Jefferies.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","My first question is around your business expansion cost. You have a pretty substantial bolus of business coming on line for which you're spending $0.60 to $0.65, as you've said. Some of that business is being pushed out, but your guidance really didn't change. I guess I'm wondering how you expect business expansion cost to trend into 2014? Will we see that tail off or are you going to continue to have a run rate at this level given the bolus of business that's coming on in 2014?","William N. Scheffel","Well, let me first start in the 2013 and say that in the second half, we certainly have the startup in California, New Hampshire, and the exchanges, which would start January 1, '14. So that -- those 3 items in particular are driving a lot of our cost in the second half of this year. And looking at 2014, exchanges will, I think, continue to grow. And so I would expect the cost that we see in 2013 will continue in 2014 as additional states are looked at, expansion of areas, et cetera. And I think there's also the duals which will continue to develop and we've got that programmed in the 2014, so we'll have some additional cost for the dual expansion. So the overall answer is, we're seeing, as our business grows and our revenue grows, the opportunities are -- continue to be there, as Michael indicated in his comments. So I would expect the business expansion cost to continue to be at the level we're operating, potentially grow as we see more new business.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then my follow-up on the industry fee, Michael, you mentioned the company's view that Congress will step in and act to exempt Medicaid. I guess I'm wondering where that fee would get reallocated to? And in an action like that, who would pick up the additional percentage? And then the second part of that question would be, we've heard that if it were to be cover -- if Medicaid were to be responsible for industry fee, that, that could be paid either through rates or perhaps, through lump sum payments, at the end of the state fiscal year. And if you could comment on how you would expect to be paid the industry fee, what would be the mechanism, if Medicaid has to pay for it?","Michael F. Neidorff","We've been talking to the state, primarily, about including it in the rates. So at this point, if you want me to -- you'll hear all kinds of ideas surface as it unwinds, as it comes out. So I would say we'll be negotiating, and it's our point of view that it should be built into the rates. If a state, for cash flow purposes suddenly [ph] ends up coming back and saying, we're going to pay you a lump-sum out of surplus at the end of the year, now that's something we would talk about, but we need certainty because of the actuarial soundness aspect of the rates.","David H. Windley - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the congressional action, what gives you confidence there?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, we've had a lot of conversations. Well first, we've talked to the DGA and RGA and the governors are fully onboard to understand the cost impact to them if it does not happen. They're working with their congressional delegations on it. We have a very active Washington office that's working with the Congress and effectively. I mean, the DRE's a good example when we helped to move that onto both sides of the House and Senate bill of ACA. So we will -- I could you give you a name, rank and serial number, but I'm not sure that serves the purpose. There are bills circulating. We're getting more and more people signing on it. People understand the cost impact of it. [indiscernible] understand that it will possibly cost the federal government more to have that because of the circular nature of refunding state cost. So it's going to take a while to play out. And the Congress we live with today will not do something before it has to. I mean, that's just the environment in which we live and the way things are happening. And I'm not passing judgment on it, it's just a fact.","Operator","Our next question is from Sarah James, Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I was hoping that you could walk us through a free cash roadmap, where you think you'll be at year-end, and what you see as how much you would have to put up in reserves in '14. Specifically because at Investor Day, you mentioned that some of that was based on trailing 12-month revenue. So I thought at this point in 2013, you may have good visibility on what you see in the reserve?","William N. Scheffel","Okay, at this point, I think in our 10-Q, we included commentary that we would expect to provide additional capital contributions for statutory capital into our subsidiaries of approximately $100 million for the second half of 2013. I think we've put in over $300 million for the first half of 2013. And if you look at our current balance sheet, you can see that we've had $30 million borrowed on our revolver, and that's all we've had to produce. So we have been able to use internally-generated funds to cover most of the funding requirements for statutory capital and the $100 million in the second half is a little lighter than we've experienced in some more recent quarters. So, and in effect, even with the borrowing of $30 million on our revolver, our debt-to-capital ratio came down to 29.8% excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note. So our general view is that we are able to fund our needs through internally-generated funds, plus the use of our revolver to the extent necessary. We do expect that we will be borrowing on the revolver through the remainder of the year. But again, that's all within our current capacity and don't really foresee anything unusual going into 2014 that would change that position.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. So when you look at the revenue growth in '13 and think about the reserves that you would have to post in '14, it looks like to you guys that the cash you generate through the year and your existing debt would get you to where you need to be.","William N. Scheffel","That's exactly right. That excludes any potential acquisitions that might occur, which would probably be separately funded. But as you can see, when we did the Acaria acquisition, we actually issued, I think it was 60% stock, for that and 40% cash, and that had a minimal impact on our debt-to-capital ratio when we did that. So all those are considered as we look at the acquisitions.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And at Investor Day, you guys talked about looking into additional reinsurance for exchange products. So I was just curious to what extent you're looking to reinsure. In other words, could you completely derisk the 2014 exchanges? Is that even feasible from a cost standpoint? And are there any metrics that you can help us with, whether it's exchange business or your traditional Medicaid book that help us understand the relationship between additional reinsurance versus what you would have to put up in reserves?","William N. Scheffel","I'll start with it and Rone can jump in. I think that as Rone indicated at the second -- at our Investor Day that is something we're looking at. We have not made a decision on whether we would go down the path of buying external reinsurance for the exchange product. It's just something that's being considered. And as we go through the rest of this year, we'll be evaluating our position in those individual markets and where things stand and make that call somewhere in the second half of the year. Rone, I don't know if you have anything else you want to add?","K. Rone Baldwin","Well, just again, the government is providing risk mitigation programs through reinsurance and risk adjustment and through risk corridors. And we look at the private reinsurance market as another way to mitigate potentially some of the risk for the exchange product. But I would say that I don't think it's -- I doubt if the reinsurance markets at all are going to allow for the ability to lay off the entire risk or a significant portion of it. It's going to be a way -- another mitigant in terms of it, and that's how we're looking at it and that's kind of our expectation for the role it might play.","Michael F. Neidorff","If you could, sir, there wouldn't be a lot left for the company at the end of the day. So I mean, there's a balance of risk reinsurance, risk reward. And the team here, I think, has demonstrated an ability to manage those factors.","Operator","Our next question is from Ana Gupte, Dowling & Partners.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","The question is about 2014. If you can give us just a high-level perspective on the headwinds and tailwinds to your overall margin as you're considering mix shift to duals and exchanges, some continuing onetime costs. And then for your existing business, what the likely outlook is for the rates and continued reversion to normalized margins?","Michael F. Neidorff","Bill, you want to [indiscernible]?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I think at this point, we're not prepared, obviously, to give 2014 guidance. We'll do that in December, as Michael indicated. I think in general, we continue to see strong revenue growth for 2014, as both Jesse and Michael indicated in the last couple of public appearances, where, excluding the health care reform, I think we see revenue growth in excess of 15% already for 2014. That continues and are continuing to be our chief [ph] opportunities. And I think from an expense control, HBR and G&A, I think we continue to benefit from growth and scale on the G&A front, so we'd expect that to continue. And the HBR, a lot of that will depend on the mix of new and existing businesses as we go forward. The second half of the year will have a lower percentage than we've been running the last year or so. In other words, we've been running in the 30%, as we said now, we're down into the teens. And so we expect to be between 10% and 20% in the second half of the year. I don't really know that number yet for 2014, so I can't give you that. But it would be more -- it'd be unlikely that it would in the 35% range again given that we have a stronger base running into 2014. Jesse, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything else that you see?","Jesse N. Hunter","No, I think that covers it well. I mean, we certainly have a lot of opportunities ahead of it and cost management will be part of the factor that's going to determine our ability to make all these things come together as expected and get to the margin improvement that Michael talked about over the long-term.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, I think if you look at it, we were able to leverage the growth very nicely over the past 12 to 18 months on the G&A side. We're showing you the new and existing business breakout over the first 12 months and show you what you can really judge and expect how that's going to move going forward. So we try to give you some transparency on that. And so it's a matter of timing. And when some of the new business come on, I can give you a date. It's going to be Q1 of next year, but it could slide into second and third quarter. So that also makes it harder to try and give you something that you can truly model and react to.","Ana Gupte - Dowling & Partners Securities, LLC","Okay. That's helpful. On the dual for the existing awards that you've already got, do you have any update on the startup timing? You said just now that you don't know. And then on South Carolina and Rhode Island, any update on the award claimings? And then finally, any [indiscernible] for the new contracts, where do you see yourself the best -- well-positioned for new business?","Jesse N. Hunter","Sure. So with respect to the previously announced awards on the dual demonstrations in Ohio and in Illinois, both of those are, as referenced in the comments, are expected to now start up in the first quarter of 2014. And that the expectation in those programs is that there will be an initial start with voluntary enrollment and then kind of a phase into passive enrollment within a couple of months after those initial start dates. So obviously, we're -- I continue work with the states and CMS on the launch of those programs. And obviously, we're not in a position to comment broadly about the other opportunities, but as you've seen so far, we are focused on the dual opportunities in existing markets where we can leverage our strength on the Medicaid health plan side.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Fidel, Deutsche.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just on CapEx. It looks like in the Q, you said you have plans to spend around $40 million in additional CapEx on systems enhancements and market expansions in the back half. Just wondering if that's $40 million overall in CapEx or whether that's $40 million on top of the first half run rate?","William N. Scheffel","I think those are second half numbers that we disclosed in the 10-Q footnote there. And normally, those capital expenditures that we have are for new offices, for expansion into new states or new geographical areas. And I think we've also -- IT software is included in a lot of there -- and new computers. And then in the second half, we will move into a facility in Texas for our -- as additional claims processing center that's under construction. It should open up late in the third quarter, I think. So normal operating items, which I think, are nothing there of any unusual nature.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then just wanted to just shift back over to the exchanges and just ask specifically a question on Mississippi. It looks like there's going to be around 46 counties where Centene may be the only carrier operating in those counties. So just there were some question already in terms of risk mitigation efforts and reinsurance. And just interested in some strategies you think you may be able to deploy there because not sure how the risk adjustment component within the 3 Rs [ph] will work if you're the only carrier actually operating in that market.","Michael F. Neidorff","Joe [ph]? Rone?","K. Rone Baldwin","Yes, one thing, just to make sure everyone's aware of, is on Friday, it was announced that Humana had been in -- had already filed to be in 4 or 5 of the countries in Mississippi, and they announced that they expanded their filing to be in an additional 36 counties. And so at this point, there are 2 competitors in Mississippi exchange, ourselves and Humana. Just with respect to the specific question on risk adjustment. The risk adjustment program is for the entire individual market, both on and off exchange. So given that, there is a fairly meaningful off exchange individual market that exists in Mississippi and they're -- fully expect that there'll be a number of competitors continuing to compete in that off exchange market. So there will be ample opportunity, so to speak, for a viable risk adjustment program in Mississippi. Just in terms of Mississippi, we look at Mississippi similar to how we have every other state to look for where we have strong health plans, opportunities to build a contract with high-quality providers at attractive rates, deliver affordable product for the subsidized low-income population. That's what guided our service areas in Mississippi and has -- we have approached it from that same consistent basis that we have all the other states and feel that we have price to reflect the competitive situation that exists in Mississippi as well.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one last question. Just interested if you could give us an update just in Texas in the rural markets, and then in Hidalgo. How utilization was trending in the second quarter? Have you seen those markets pretty much settle down, or are they still pretty active but now you're getting the rate relief which is helping to stabilize the margins?","Michael F. Neidorff","Rob, if you want to take that please?","Robert T. Hitchcock","Sure. With respect to the rural service areas in Texas, we have seen our HBRs decrease slightly. And that's been helped by not only our medical management efforts, our recontracting efforts, but also that 2.9% rate increase that we received in June, specific to the rural service areas. Specific to Texas, I would say that Texas, in general, we continue to improve our operations and improve our results in Texas on a state-wide basis. So we've been in Texas for a long time, it's one of our marquee markets and we continue to improve there on a daily basis.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, we have a strong medical management team, strong general management and critical mass, to say the least, in terms of being the largest player down there. So you combine all those things, and it creates a powerful franchise.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Rigg, Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up actually on Scott's question there with regards to Texas. Can you -- I know the RSA rate increase was assumed in full year guidance. But how did that impact the medical cost ratio in the second quarter, at least the retro portion?","William N. Scheffel","I think that the Texas rate increase, the amendment we received, as we said earlier, was -- will be recorded in June, July and August, so as for the remaining fiscal year of the state because their fiscal year starts on September 1. So what we received in second quarter was 1\/3 of that. So that would cover 4 months of a year, you were seeing [ph] and there was a 3-month quarter. But when you look at it on a year-to-date basis, it was still short in terms of the whole year for 2013. So in overall, it helped improve the HBR in Texas for the quarter. And in the second quarter, we'll continue to see that benefit. I think what we do still see in Texas is disparities in terms of utilization levels between regions and those -- and some of those are accounted for in rate differences in terms of what the state's doing. And so we continue to work on the medical management front to improve utilization in some of the higher utilizing areas.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Right. Is it possible to quantify the impact? I'm just trying to get a sense for how the company's overall medical benefits ratio trended from Q1 to Q2.","William N. Scheffel","I think it had a minimal effect. The amount that we received in -- that we recorded in June for that rate adjustment was -- it had a minimal impact on the overall HBR and HBR trends.","Michael F. Neidorff","And when you look at the total size there in the company now, it takes a lot to move the needle.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just wanted -- and maybe it might be a long question, but a yes or no answer. But when you think about the overall cost trends you guys are seeing, seasonally, normally, Q2 is a little bit better than Q1. You had sort of abnormally high flu in the first quarter of this year. Texas rate increase for the RSA, a little bit of a retro there. Another quarter of Kansas. I guess I just want to make sure, I would've thought those factors would have led to slightly greater decline in the MBR sequentially, but it sounds like you guys are saying it's really a function of the mix, and utilization is actually trending somewhat below where you guys would've expected?","William N. Scheffel","Well, certainly, utilization has been lower in Q2 than Q1. And Michael gave a couple of comments on that in his script. I think overall, Q2, when you factor in both the fact -- particularly look at the existing business HBR, with Texas converting into there, they're going to be slightly higher and we have other markets that are lower. And so that we said it kept at the 88.4% level. Going forward into the second half, we continue to think that the HBR should be normalized, running at more normal margins because we have the additional 2\/3 of that Texas rate increase coming in the second half, plus the regular September 1 rate increase that occurs in Texas every year. So overall, we continue to believe that it will be in the range that we talked about at the beginning of the year, 88% to 89% for the HBR. And the fact that, that's a little higher maybe than what some people are expecting, is due to the acuity shift where, as we add particularly long-term care in Florida, for example, the higher acuity products in several of our markets.","Michael F. Neidorff","And then you'll see that, that moderation that does take place is a function of somewhat smaller, really, rates, but also the medical management programs. We have a really strong medical management team that is able to, across various markets, impact the outcomes.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Costa, Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Couple of questions on the quarter, just help us out a little bit. Regarding the rural service area in Texas, what were your revenues in the rural service area in Texas, specifically, for the quarter?","Michael F. Neidorff","I don't know that we've got into that level of detail at this point.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Can you help us out with how much it was over the last year roughly, so we can kind of gauge what the EPS impact was or the rate increase was?","William N. Scheffel","We haven't really got into that level of detail.","Michael F. Neidorff","I'm not sure we even have it here in the room with us.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Then can you talk about the decline in membership in Louisiana for a minute? And do expect that to continue or what happened there?","Michael F. Neidorff","Rob?","Robert T. Hitchcock","Yes. The decline in membership in Louisiana has really been because of an erosion of membership to the shared savings programs that exist in Louisiana. So we anticipate that, that will continue to -- in the future until Louisiana decides on whether or not they're going to continue out that shared savings program or not. The good news on that is that some of the membership that we see migrate to the shared savings program are people that really want more choice in their physician network. And so that's something that we're going to continue to work with the state of Louisiana on to work with them on how we can better serve those members going forward in the future.","Michael F. Neidorff","I think -- we've seen this in other markets. It will bounce around for a while back and forth. But still, we still have a lot of critical mass there. It's still a strong market for us. It's a contributing market. So it's a -- that deterioration, if you try to say -- if we try to call it that, is somewhat expected. And there will be new members coming in, and the states are aware of it, and how much will it save them versus shared savings model. So kind of stay tuned over the next 2, 4 quarters on that one.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then going out to 2014, you talked about 15% growth minimum from your sort of your existing business without the impact of reform. How much of that is from the Florida LTC contract and the California contract?","William N. Scheffel","We haven't broken that up into pieces at this point in time. What we said is we've seen at least 15% growth for 2014 coming from known contract wins and membership additions, et cetera. And we're not -- we haven't given out specific pieces.","Michael F. Neidorff","We typically, after the enrollment in the following quarter, we'll give you the membership by state, by plan. And I want to stick pretty much to that principle because there's so much shifting around that can take place that I don't want to mislead either.","Operator","Our next question is Kevin Fischbeck, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I wanted to go into the guidance and just understand a little bit the moving pieces in here versus where you were last quarter. You raised the low-end of the guidance by $0.05. It sound to me like also in there, you've got maybe an additional $0.12 drag from Kentucky, $0.04 in Q2, 3 and 4. I guess you'd have the impact of Centurion, Tennessee and Imperial, California. I guess, Q2 probably came in early bit better. Is there anything else that we would think about as far as impacting the guidance from -- in Q1 to where you are now?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think you've hit most of the things. I would say that the startups, that we've talked about, was probably included in our business expansion cost number that we quoted all year long. The only real difference there might be the addition of the Acaria transaction costs from where we started the year at. And just for -- that's a total of $0.08 for the year. I think we had $0.01 in Q1 and $0.07 in Q2, in case that comes out somewhere. But other items, I think, that you picked up are generally correct.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then I think you mentioned that Ohio was coming in a little bit slower than you thought. I think last quarter, you talked about having about 200,000 members by year end. Is that 200,000 member number still a good number? Just is it going to be sometime during 2014? Or does that -- or does the rollout make you think differently about that?","Michael F. Neidorff","Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter","Yes, Kevin. So I think what we referenced is you've always got the starting point and then the ending point with as these new programs rollout. And I think what we're seeing is we're starting out a little less than we were anticipating, but we still see an opportunity to ramp that, both on the state-wide expansion of the existing program and then duals when those come in. So I think without commenting on the specific numbers and you will get into that when we get into 2014 guidance, et cetera, but we definitely see significant opportunity to ramp our membership through the combination of those things in Ohio as we go onto next year. So it's, I'd say, largely a timing shift more than anything else.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And as far as Kansas goes, I think last quarter, you talked about running in the high 90s MLRs, is that still a good number to think about or has that changed at all?","Michael F. Neidorff","[indiscernible]","William N. Scheffel","Yes, that's a good number to use at this point in time. We are -- we have 6 months under our belt in Kansas and looking at that situation overall. But we're continuing to run in the high 90s.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe just a big picture question. There's a lot of thought that Health Care Reform, just the talk around it and the individual mandate, is going to spur people who today qualify for Medicaid, and just for whatever reason aren't signed up. That they're going to start looking at their options next year and then sign up for the core Medicaid program. So that could help you, even in states that are not actually expanding the Medicaid program. Have you done any work around what that might mean or what the potential pool of people are in your states?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think we probably just kind of thought about it in terms of there's some upside there in that people become aware there's insurance and starts questioning it. And how it's promoted, by what state. And what they're doing to encourage that is yet to be seen. So I view what you said, an upside from a conservative planning standpoint.","Operator","Our next question is Carl McDonald, Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just had a question on the SG&A guidance. When I tack on the incremental startup cost that you're expecting in the second of the year to what you reported in the second quarter, that gets me to a little bit below the low end of the full year guidance. So anything else that you would call out that will impact the second half G&A, other than the start-up expenses?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think that the expansion costs are clearly a big piece of it. I think even our performance-based compensation varies by quarter. And as the revenues grow, obviously, we'll lose the Kentucky revenue in the second half of the year. And I think that there's -- in general, there's 2 things on a new plan, you have start up costs before you start generating revenues, and those costs are included in our business expansion cost. You also then have, once they start running, the first 6 months, let's say, of a new plan [ph]. You're going to be adding margin, you've got continuity care provisions, other things like that which also can cause increased cost. So a lot of that's in the HBR line, not in the G&A, but there's also -- you tend to have a lot more temps and things like that when you just start up a new plan [ph] to deal with the conversion of the membership at one day and you make sure you have to cover that for a period of time.","Operator","Our next question is Michael Baker, Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could provide updated thoughts on dual rates. How they're shaping up relative to expectations, particularly in light of a publicly-traded player when they're finalized in Massachusetts decided and pull out. I understand each state's different, but figured you could provide some thoughts on that?","Michael F. Neidorff","Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter","Sure, thanks, Michael. So I mean, we talked a little bit, Investor Day, of looking to Massachusetts as obviously one of the early markets for dual demo and I think a few data points that we have there, both on the positive side and in terms of some increase in the rates and some risk protections that kind of were added over the course of that kind of rate development process. And then as you referenced, some people deciding not to participate. So I would say, broadly that the rate discussions on duals are still very much in process. And we're working in both of the states where we have been awarded a contract in Ohio and in Illinois, both in the states side, and then to the extent that we can on the Medicare side as well. Ultimately, our expectation is we will get to rates that allow for a successful and sustainable program.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael F. Neidorff","I just want to thank you, all. And it was a great quarter. We look forward to our third quarter review with you in a few months. So everybody have a good day. Thank you.","Operator","The conference is now concluded.

Michael?","Michael Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 financial results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. We will also bring you up-to-date on the integration of Fidelis and the regulatory and legislative environment.","First, let me provide commentary on healthcare legislation, legal and regulatory environment. We're hopeful that the divided government leads to a greater constructive dialogue from both parties when it comes to healthcare policy. It is clear Medicaid and the services we provide are needed more than ever. Clearly, numerous governors from both parties strongly supported Medicaid managed care during the repeal and replace debate.","We also have seen Utah, Nebraska and Idaho, by ballot initiative recently passing Medicaid expansion. It also appears from the most recent marketplace enrollment figures there continues to be consistent demand for affordable, high quality healthcare coverage.","As stated in the 2020 proposed payment notice, we support CMS's goal of maintaining a stable regulatory environment allowing for greater product predictability. The payment notices CMS is annual regulatory and financial guidance for the marketplace. Importantly, we support the administration's continued efforts to give states greater flexibility by a 13.32, 11.15 waivers.","This works well with our local operating model where we have strong relationships with providers and regulators. We look forward to working with the states who are on the frontlines in making sure all of their citizens have access to affordable high-quality healthcare.","Next, I'd like to recap Centene's highlights of 2018. 2018 was another year of strong growth and accomplishment for Centene, capped off by the robust fourth-quarter results we reported this morning. In 2018, we added 1.8 million members, surpassing the 14 million mark. We grew revenues by 24% to $60.1 billion and adjusted EPS by 41% to $7.08.","The HBR improved 140 basis points year-over-year to 85.9%. The adjusted net income margin improved 50 basis points to 2.5%. Cash flows from operations remain strong at 1.4x net earnings. During the year, we stuck to our business as usual approach. We have not been distracted by ACA legal headlines. As we agree with all the legal experts, it will be reverse. While there has been chatter about possible disruption to the exchanges, individuals like to have an insurance card with comprehensive coverage.","We remain the leader in the AC marketplace. In 2018, Centene successfully entered three new exchange markets and expanded in six existing Ambetter markets. I remind you, in 2018 year-over-year, our exchange membership increased by approximately 500,000 members or 52% to 1.5 million. Please note, this is ahead of our initial expectations.","In Medicaid, we successfully reprocured contracts in Arizona, Florida, Washington and Kansas and won two new Medicaid contracts in New Mexico and Iowa. Overall, our win rate in Medicaid RFPs remains an industry-leading 80%. Also our medical management efforts and network initiatives continue to gain traction and help drive the improved HBR I previously noted.","In addition, it is our strong organic growth, we engaged in strategic M&A and investments throughout the year. In 2018, we closed the acquisition of Fidelis, the only statewide health plan in all 62 counties of New York. During the year, we began integrating Fidelis, now our New York health plan, into our enterprise. We're very pleased with how the integration is going. For example, on January 1, we moved all Fidelis employees to Centene's HR systems without incident. Fidelis has also been on our general ledger since the day we close the transaction.","We remain on track to achieve the accretion in synergy targets. We anticipate high single-digit percentage accretion to adjusted EPS in the first 12 months following the close and low to mid-teens percentage accretion to adjusted EPS in the second full-year following the close.","We are also anticipating generally approximately $25 million in pre-tax net synergies in the first 12 months, following the close and $100 million in total pre-tax net synergies in year two. On a run rate basis, we expect Fidelis to add approximately $12 billion in revenue and over $550 million in adjusted EBITDA, including net synergies.","In addition to Fidelis, we completed the acquisition of MHS Services a National Provider in Healthcare and Staffing to correctional systems and other government agencies. MHM was previously our joint venture partner in Centurion. We are now providing correctional services in 15 states with 32 contracts. We also completed the acquisition of Community Group -- Community Medical Group, CMG, a leading at risk for the primary care provider in Miami-Dade, Florida.","CMG has 15 clinics that focus on low income beneficiaries with an expertise in social determinants. We increased our ownership in Interpreta, a technology company focused on clinical and genomic data as well as real-time analytics. Our total ownership is now 80%. We made an investment in RxAdvance technology-based pharmacy benefits management platform.","We support a shift towards a more transparent PBM model, that is sustainable with higher quality and lower costs for consumers. Over the past year, we have been advocating for net pricing versus rebate. Last -- lastly, Centene purchased a controlling stake in University Hospital of Torreon, in Madrid. This is an important addition to our Ribera Salud model, which sets the standard for successful public-private partnerships in healthcare.","As a final point, we introduced Centene Forward, a transformative program to enhance key parts of our enterprise. We expect Centene Forward to realize up to $500 million in savings over a multiyear period. It is important to note that this is not a short-term effort to have savings immediately go to the bottom line in 2019. Rather it is a self generating effort to reinvest capital into additional capabilities and technologies that better position Centene for long-term growth, increased margin and profitability.","Moving on to market product updates. First, we will discuss Medicaid activity. Florida. In, December as part of a successful reprocurement, we continue providing physical and behavioral healthcare services to the state's Medicaid program. We're now statewide in all 11 regions. Importantly, this large geographic footprint results in additional membership and revenue that our previous -- from our previous contracts.","Kansas. On January 1, our Kansas health plan renewed its contract to continue providing managed care services for the state's Medicaid program. This was a successful reprocurement of an existing contract. We currently serve approximately 130,000 recipients in the state.","New Mexico. Last month Centene began serving recipients enrolled in New Mexico's Medicaid managed care program. We currently have approximately 65,000 members, while still early in the process. The launch is progressing as expected.","Pennsylvania. In January, we began serving over 30,000 beneficiaries enrolled in Pennsylvania's long-term care program in the Southeast zone. We launched a Southwest zone in January of 2018. We now serve over 50,000 long-term members in the state. The third and final zone will be implemented by January of 2020. Our participation in this measure program reinforces our national leadership position in long-term care.","North Carolina. We are pleased to be selected in two regions in the North Carolina Medicaid managed care program. These two regions are among the largest in the state. Our joint venture Carolina Complete Health is the only provider sponsored winner [ph] in the RFP. This will result in better health outcomes for members at a lower cost for the state. The contract is set to commence February 1, 2020. As this was only awarded yesterday, we will provide more details on our first quarter earnings call.","I do want to highlight, however, that we believe that the state did not fully understand our innovative approach with providers in North Carolina. However, we believe our partnership with the North Carolina Medical Society and the FQHCs, will we proving to be the right model for success in that market. We are a believer in the provider led entity approach for growth and quality, and we expect to be the best partner the state has in its Medicaid program. We are currently considering an appeal in helping them to understand what this innovative model means, and how we can help manage costs and improve quality.","Next, Centurion. Florida in December -- in December, Centurion began operating under an additional new contract, provide a comprehensive healthcare services. This new contract covers an average of 1,425 detainees in Volusia County Detention facilities. With the addition of this new contract, Centurion is now statewide in Florida.","New Mexico. In February, Centurion began providing comprehensive healthcare services to detainees in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Albuquerque. Centurion is providing a wider range of healthcare services to an average detainee population of 1,550.","Arizona. In late January Centurion was notified by the State of Arizona of its intent to award a contract to provide healthcare services to inmates housed in the state's prison system. The contract is expected to begin in July of 2019. Under the agreement, Centurion will provide healthcare services to an average daily population of approximately 34,000.","Now health insurance marketplace. Our marketplace business continue to perform well in the fourth quarter. At year-end 2018, we served approximately 1.5 million exchange members in 16 states. For 2019, our continued focus on providing high quality affordable healthcare led to a very successful open enrollment.","In the national market that shrunk almost 3%. Ambetter grew approximately 15% and now has approximately 20% national market share. We achieved this while maintaining our pricing discipline. We began offering exchange products in four new states in 2019. We also expanded our footprint in six of our existing Ambetter state.","In January, we had almost 2 million paid members across 20 states. This represents a year-over-year increase of 250,000 legacy Ambetter members as well as 80,000 Fidelis members. The 250,000 increase is well ahead of our most recent estimate of 150,000 to 200,000. As you recall, the initial estimate we provided on December Investor Day was 50,000 to 150, 000.","The key demographics of these members remain consistent with the comments we made on our December Investor Day. Excluding Fidelis, approximately 90% are eligible for subsidiaries. Middle tier and other demographics are consistent with prior years. Our retention rate is maintained at 80%. We expect to have another strong year of operations in our industry leading marketplace business.","On the Medicare. At year-end, we served approximately 417,000 Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. This represents year-over-year growth of approximately 83,000 or 25%. Consistent with our growth strategy, we have expanded our geographic footprint and are in 21 states in 2019. We continue to take targeted approach to growing our Medicare Advantage business.","As we commented on December Investor Day, we price for margin stability in 2019, recognizing headwinds that came with the lowest ROE. As a reminder, we expect first quarter 2019 MA membership to decrease by approximately 20,000 members. This is due to a repositioning of Fidelis to get back its four star rating. We continue to expect 2019 MA revenue and membership grew flat compared to 2018.","We will return to a four star MA parent rating for the 2020 plan year. We expect this will have a positive impact on multiple new plans, including the joint venture we announced with Ascension Healthcare. This should allow us along with other product enhancement efforts to accelerate growth in MA in 2020 and beyond. I remind you, it is not how fast, but how well one grows.","Shifting gears to our rate outlook. For 2018, our composite Medicaid rate increase was 1%. We are expecting a composite Medicaid rate increase of 1.5% in 2019. Separately, CMS issued the 2020 advance notice last week. And preliminary Medicare advantage rates appear to be in line with our expectations. We continue to see as well as anticipate overall stable medical cost trends, including flu consistent with our expectations in the low single digits.","In conclusion, 2018 was another successful year for Centene. Our strong 2018 results reaffirmed our growth momentum for 2019 and beyond. Our pipeline of growth opportunities is robust and we remain focused on margin expansion. We are raising our 2019 guidance to reflect a higher than expected open enrollment for marketplace, with Centurion win in Arizona and the win in Madrid -- the acquisition of the Madrid Hospital.","Before I turn the call over to Jeff, I would like to remind you that the approval -- approved two-for-one stock split will be distributed tomorrow, February 6, as split stock enhances liquidity for shareholders in line with Centene's market cap growth. Importantly, it moves our float to a level appropriate for enterprise of our size.","Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide you further details on fourth quarter and full-year 2018 financial results as well as our increased 2019 guidance. Jeff?","Jeff Schwaneke","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. This morning we reported strong fourth-quarter and full-year 2018 results. Fourth quarter revenues were $16.6 billion, an increase of 29% over the fourth quarter of 2017, and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.38 this quarter compared to $0.97 last year. Both the fourth quarter and full-year results include additional costs associated with the marketplace open enrollment period.","During the fourth quarter, we invested an additional $0.04 per diluted share into growth related initiatives, including member outreach efforts associated with the marketplace business. This was above our forecast and previous business expansion costs guidance range.","The strong fourth-quarter caps off a very successful year for the company. Total revenues grew 24% in 2018 to $60.1 billion, driven by the acquisition of Fidelis Care, continued growth in the health insurance marketplace business, product and market expansions, and the return of the health insurer fee in 2018. This growth led to record adjusted earnings in 2018 with adjusted diluted earnings per share of $7.08, an increase of 41% over 2017. The growth and earnings year-over-year was driven by the Fidelis acquisition and the growth in the marketplace business.","Before I get into the details, I want to remind everyone of the upcoming stock split. The split was declared by the Board of Directors on December 12, 2018 to be distributed on February 6, 2019 to stockholders of record as of December 24, 2018. The split is not reflected in this morning's earnings release unless otherwise noted.","Now let me provide some more details for the fourth quarter. Total revenues grew by approximately $3.8 billion year-over-year, primarily as a result of the acquisition of Fidelis Care, growth in the health insurance marketplace business, the expansions and new programs in many of our states in 2018, including the Illinois contract expansion and the Pennsylvania LTSS program, other acquisitions including MHM and CMG, and the return of the health insurer fee in 2018.","This growth was partially offset by lower revenues in California associated with a reduction in pass through payments and the impact of the removal of the in-home support services program for managed care, which took effect in January 2018.","Moving on to HBR. Our health benefits ratio was 86.8% in the fourth quarter this year compared to 87.3% in last year's fourth quarter and 86.3% in the third quarter of 2018. The decrease year-over-year is primarily driven by growth in the health insurance marketplace business and the reinstatement of the health insurer fee in 2018. These decreases were partially offset by the acquisition of Fidelis Care, which operates at a higher HBR.","Sequentially, the 50 basis point increase in HBR from the third quarter of 2018 is primarily attributable to the impact of the IHSS reconciliation in the third quarter of 2018 and normal seasonality in the health insurance marketplace business. These HBR increases were partially offset by improved Medicaid performance over the third quarter of 2018. The marketplace business continues to perform well and membership remain strong as we ended the year with 1.5 million members.","We had a successful open enrollment season adding approximately 250,000 members from our peak enrollment last year, excluding Fidelis. This growth with the addition of the Fidelis membership is expected to give us almost 2 million members for 2019 peak membership. The demographics of our membership remain consistent and we ended 2018 with approximately $930 million of risk adjustment payable and over $260 million associated with minimum MLR rebates.","Now on to SG&A. Our adjusted selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 9.9% in the fourth quarter this year compared to 10.5% last year, and 10% in the third quarter of 2018. The year-over-year decrease was primarily due to the acquisition of Fidelis Care, which operates at a lower SG&A expense ratio. This decrease was partially offset by growth in the health insurance marketplace business, which operates at a higher SG&A expense ratio and the impact of the removal of the IHSS program from California's Medicaid contract.","The sequential decrease is primarily due to the costs associated with the end of our contract with the U.S Department of Veterans Affairs and the contribution to our Charitable Foundation recognized in the third quarter of 2018. Additionally, as commented on earlier, we spent $0.20 per diluted share on business expansion costs during the fourth quarter, which was $0.04 higher than our previous expectations.","For the full-year of 2018, we spent $0.38 per diluted share on business expansion costs compared to our previous guidance range of $0.30 to $0.34 per diluted share. Invested income was $67 million during the fourth quarter compared to $53 million last year and $80 million last quarter.","The increase year-over-year is due to higher investment balances mainly associated with Fidelis acquisition, as well as higher interest rates on short-term investments. Sequentially, investment income decreased due to lower investable balances associated with the payment of the health insurer fee, risk adjustment and the California Medicaid expansion minimum MLR rebate payments.","Interest expense was $98 million in the fourth quarter 2018 compared to $66 million last year and $97 million last quarter. The increase year-over-year was driven by additional debt to fund the Fidelis acquisition and higher interest rates on our debt associated with our interest rate swaps.","Our effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 32.5% and in line with our expectations. The fourth quarter tax rate is lower than the full-year driven by the vesting of our employee stock awards, which lowers the rate in the fourth quarter.","Now on to the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled $13.5 billion at quarter end, including $478 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.","Debt at quarter end was $6.7 billion, which includes $284 million of borrowings on a revolving credit facility. Our debt to capital ratio was 37.4% excluding our nonrecourse mortgage note and construction loan compared to 40.3% at fourth quarter last year and 36.9% at the third quarter of 2018.","Our medical claims liability totaled $6.8 billion at quarter end and represents 48 days in claims payable compared to 51 days for the third quarter of 2018. As expected and highlighted on our third quarter earnings call and Investor Day in December, the DCP decreased during the quarter associated with timing items and the Fidelis acquisition from the third quarter. We continue to expect days in claims payable to be in the mid-40s range on a long-term basis.","Cash flow used in operations was $634 million in the fourth quarter and cash flow provided by operations was $1.2 billion for the full-year 2018 or 1.4x net earnings. Cash flow for the quarter was negatively impacted by the payment of the 2018 health insurer fee of approximately $700 million and the repayment of approximately $370 million of Medicaid expansion MLR rebate payments in California, which was previously accrued.","Before we discuss 2019 guidance, let me provide an update on the Fidelis acquisition. Through the first six months, Fidelis has performed in line with expectations, including the realization of anticipated synergies. The integration continues to go well and we expect to achieve our previously communicated synergy targets for the first and second years post-acquisition.","Now on to our 2019 annual guidance. Our updated 2019 annual guidance is included in our press release issued this morning. We have provided our earnings per share guidance on a split-adjusted basis for convenience. In summary, we have increased both our 2019 total revenues guidance at the midpoint by $600 million and adjusted earnings per share by $0.04 at the midpoint on a split-adjusted basis to reflect the additional membership growth in the marketplace business, which came in above our expectations, the acquisition of Torreon in Spain, and the new contract win for Centurion in Arizona.","In summary, our full-year 2019 guidance on a split-adjusted basis is as follows: total revenues of $70.3 billion to $71.1 billion. GAAP diluted earnings per share of $3.65 to $3.83. Adjusted diluted earnings per share of $4.11 to $4.31 and HBR of 86.5% to 87% and SG&A ratio of 9.3% to 9.8%, and adjusted SG&A ratio of 9.3% to 9.8%, and effective tax rate of 25% to 27% and diluted shares outstanding of 421.5 million to 422.5 million shares split-adjusted.","In conclusion, 2018 was a successful year for the company, led by strong top and bottom-line growth. The performance in the fourth quarter and continued growth in the marketplace business provide tailwinds heading into 2019 where we expect to continue to drive long-term growth and margin expansion.","That concludes my remarks and operator you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] The first question today comes from Kevin Fischbeck with Bank Of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Fischbeck","Great. Thanks. I wanted to focus on the exchanges. I guess, the first question there is you mentioned retention similar and the demographic is similar. Any markets in particular that you would highlight as kind of faster growing than average?","Michael Neidorff","I think we have a very balanced approach to our markets. It's good. Different markets have different sizes, so different penetration. But it's very balanced across our markets. And the demographics across markets are the same. The middle tiers, everything about it, Kevin, is just consistent with what we have historically seen.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay.","Michael Neidorff","Do you want to add to that?","Jeff Schwaneke","No.","Kevin Fischbeck","I was going to ask also, Jeff, your comment there where you said, at the very end you said the growth in the marketplace business provides tailwinds for 2019 and you expect to drive long-term growth and margin expansion. I wasn\u2019t sure of you were saying that you expect additional margin expansion in the exchanges or whether that was a broader comment about the overall business in margin expansion?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, that was an overall broader comment. I mean, I think the tailwinds comment is evidenced by obviously -- we haven't even closed the books for January and we\u2019re raising guidance, right? So membership came in higher than we expected and we have obviously the new win in Centurion, in Arizona and the acquisition and we're updating guidance for those items.","Kevin Fischbeck","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Raskin with Nephron. Please go ahead.","Josh Raskin","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. I want to stick with \u2026","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Josh Raskin","\u2026 the exchanges as well. Good morning, Michael. Two questions, I guess, related to the exchanges. One is can we get an updated revenue contribution, in terms of your total top on to [indiscernible] that 70 billion-ish or so. How much of that is actually exchanges? And then, is there any assumed margin reset? It doesn\u2019t sound like there's any reason to think that. I know you talked about conservatism in the past and certain year, so curious on that. And then, just on new competition, I don\u2019t know are you seeing any traction from the Oscars or even new competitors in any of your markets? Sorry for a bunch of questions on exchanges, but that's it.","Michael Neidorff","Go ahead, Jeff.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. So, Josh, a couple of things. I think you could probably bridge our Investor Day slide to get there. But for 2019, I would say around the $10 billion mark would be for the exchange product. As far as margins, I think what we mentioned in our Investor Day, in December, was kind of the -- what we're projecting margins for 2019 to be similar to '17, '16, '15, which was between the 5% and 10% range. And I think that's exactly what we're expecting for 2019.","Michael Neidorff","And from a competitor standpoint, we are not seeing activity that in any way affects us.","Josh Raskin","Okay. You\u2019re not seeing any pockets of growth from some new entrants or anything like that in any of the specific markets?","Michael Neidorff","No. If anything, I mean, we would like to see more people out there because it creates more noise and more activity and in a competitive environment, we tend to do very well.","Josh Raskin","Got you. And then, just one last one. Just wanted to ask on North Carolina. Could you size sort of the startup in development cost? I know you guys have been in the stage, you guys were one of the earliest in there. I know you\u2019ve entered the exchanges well. Any way to size what that total cost of kind of market entry was in North Carolina?","Michael Neidorff","We recognize that we just got the information yesterday. Our license suggests that we delay that comment to the next quarter -- to the first quarter call, if I may, Josh. I mean, we\u2019ve some ballpark numbers, but we would like to -- on something like that, we want to be very specific. We are talking about an appeal on this. So I don't want to put anything out there that can, in anyway mislead. Do you agree, Jeff?","Josh Raskin","That\u2019s fair.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I would agree on the specific number. I would say that included in our guidance that we gave today are our costs. We are refining those estimates obviously based on what we learn yesterday.","Josh Raskin","Got you. That\u2019s fair. Thank you.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes some Scott Fidel with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Scott Fidel","I just wanted to follow-up on North Carolina and just as you continue to do the postmortem today on the results yesterday. Just interested in as you evaluate the awards, what do you think were the key reasons, why the state didn\u2019t award Centene, a statewide contract? And then, Michael, as you mentioned, you\u2019re considering the appeal. Maybe help us think about some of the key sort of substantive points that you think that Centene can raise around the appeal?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, I think -- one, I want to back off. I mean, we are not unhappy. When you win the largest service region and the third largest, it's meaningful numbers and I have it in here somewhere I could quote, so it's not a -- I don't see this as a loss, I see it as a win. I think as I said in my comments that the state did not fully understand the innovative approach we had working with providers who have previously done it before. And I think as they understand that and this was something that was in the legislation that they wanted. And we've worked very hard and we do believe that the partnership when they understand, it with the FQAC, the Medical Society and others, will prove to be a very successful model in North Carolina when you look at the history of what their models have looked like. So I think we are going to be a strong provider in those two regions. We are going to take them through what happened, and we are going to understand their decision-making, because you win two, you say if it works there, this model. Maybe they're trying to standard it more and they don\u2019t want to go too far with it until they do. I can see lots of reasons, but -- so we will work with them, we will appeal it and -- but regardless of what happens, we believe in being a strong partner with states and work with them. And I think it's going to have a short and longer-term very positive outlook for quality and cost-effectiveness in the state.","Scott Fidel","Got it. If I could just ask a related follow-up to just on -- I know you\u2019re not ready to size the revenue impact from North Carolina, but I think from all of our end we are trying to sort of sort out just what the margin profile of the North Carolina business can look like, because you've got some different dynamics in terms of the JV with providers and the minimum MLRs in North Carolina and some other factors. Just sort of, I guess conceptually, how do you guys think about sort of the margin profile of North Carolina more broadly relative to, let's say, sort of the more broader normalized margins that you target in the Medicaid book?","Michael Neidorff","I expect our margin over time, because as you know, we have always taken conservatism and said that for the first 3, 4 quarters as an investment period. In the MLR we booked high until we see that the system is understanding what's involved in the managed care profile and system that we use. And so, I mean, I don\u2019t expect great, great margins in the first 3, 4 quarters. But I do believe that these margins will be consistent to better. And I think working with the providers effectively and just to give you a model we have some pretty good systems with Interpreta and Casenet and other things that will help make these providers particularly successful. And so, I see an opportunity for in '20, because, I mean, we are not going to start immediately. I do see over as the year unfolds, some opportunity for some upside on it. So I think we are going to be putting together a model here that others will when they emulate over time.","Scott Fidel","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Newshel with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel","Thanks. Michael, can you address the contract extension disclosed last night? And it means for succession planning? And did the Board asked you to stay longer or did the impetus come from you?","Michael Neidorff","I would say, once succession planning continues as originally planned with the Board, we continue to work through that. And we were -- as we were talking about succession planning, the Board asked me if I will be willing to extend it. And I said that I would, I mean, we\u2019re having fun, we are having success. I don't want to jinx it, but we are blessed with good health. And so -- and we have a great team here that it's fun to lead. Its taking on more and more of the load. So I can continue what I\u2019m doing and maybe we can add a couple rounds of golf.","Michael Newshel","So succession planning is still like you want to continue in the meantime or [indiscernible]?","Michael Neidorff","No, the succession planning -- one, succession planning can be a point in time, but it can also be a process that could be implemented anytime one feels it's appropriate to do so. So, I\u2019d rather take that approach. And it's business as usual and they -- it was their idea to extend it, so -- because I have a lot of questions about it and to give a sense to all of you and everyone and the people in the company there's -- there will be continuity and will continue down the line.","Michael Newshel","Got it. I mean, if I can just squeeze one more. Can you just also confirm whether you're buying the QualChoice Health plan in Arkansas from CHI, and what the financial impact and timing would be?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, we have the terms decided. We've not closed on it yet. And now we have to close, Jeff what, later this month, next month?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, so we have executed the contract on that, Mike, so we'd expect to close in the second quarter. And I would just say, I mean, this is an end market transaction, so we tend to like those and look for those. So not material in the macro scheme. but certainly Arkansas has been good market, and we're excited to expand our presence there.","Michael Newshel","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead.","Peter Costa","Thanks and congratulations on the quarter.","Michael Neidorff","Thanks, Peter.","Peter Costa","I wanted to ask about going forward, first off in North Carolina, what do you expect the startup costs will be in 2019 and 2020? And then -- because your business doesn\u2019t start until 2020. And then, also on 2020, can you talk about what\u2019s going to happen with silver overloading and the cost-sharing subsidies and what might change there?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. So, Pete, this is Jeff. I will handle the first question on the cost. I think what we said was we have some cost in for our 2019 guidance, but since we just got this information yesterday, it's a little early and we are reevaluating those costs. And I guess this is what I would say. So early for us to give a pinpoint number on that, given the information that came out yesterday. And on the second, I mean, we're not talking about 2020 guidance here today. So I don\u2019t know if [multiple speakers]","Peter Costa","Curious if you want to talk about [technical difficulty] might happen in Washington this year regarding the cost-sharing subsidies and way silver loading works. And if that may change for 2020 relative to -- HHS is allowing it for 2019, but it seems to be more up in the air for 2020.","Kevin Counihan","Hey, Peter, it's Kevin. Yes, you\u2019re right. If you look at the '19 payment notice, they make illusion to that. I think, again, it's premature to think about what that might actually look like into 2020. We are going to be prepared to pivot irrespective of what the policy decides. And again as you know, within CMS a year is a long time. So we'll see what happens.","Michael Neidorff","Yes, I think also we do have two sides to the government now looking at these issues and our feeling is that can be positive and if we get some good constructive discussion going. And so -- and try -- we are going to play every part we can to move it to policy versus politics. There may be some real opportunities there for you.","Peter Costa","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Sarah James with Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Sarah James","In North Carolina did Centene submit a bid as a health plan also or only a PLE? And I\u2019m wondering since the provider led entities could be awarded regions and health plan statewide. Can you speak a little bit to the strategy around deciding to submit a bid as a PLE?","Michael Neidorff","Well, we actually did submit both sides of it, but we emphasize the PLE. You have to go back and look at the historic programs they\u2019ve had in the state and the role providers have had. And I think working with the State Medical Society and they were -- they've been great constructive partners and they really want to deliver high-quality care, they understand the cost issues, and they wanted to work with us because of our systems and how we can support them doing a better job and everybody doing well. We decided that's a good place to be and I still believe that, Sarah. And I think over time it's going to prove to be a very effective model in markets like North Carolina with the history we had. So this was one of those things that I think time will prove to be on our side. And so it's going to be business as usual. We did do both, but we found a real need to emphasize this side of it. And I think the state just -- I think they understood some value and that's why they did give us the largest and third largest regions as opposed to, say, we are going to do any of these provider led organizations, but we are going to go back and talk to them and see if that can be expanded some through the appeal process. If not, well, it will still be a program no matter how it comes out with. So it's going to be a sizable business, it was full size for you on the Q1 call.","Sarah James","Got it. That makes a lot of sense. And one more question, if I can. If I look back at 2018, there where points of 2Q were consensus didn't really get seasonality right on a couple of different lines and that caused some confusion. So I'm wondering if there's any commentary you can offer around 2019 seasonality or cadence and how you see that different from 2018?","Michael Neidorff","I\u2019m going to make an opening comment and let, Jeff, take that. Of course, we are not -- we don\u2019t look at consensus. We look at the business and how it's developing. But Jeff, do you want to talk about seasonality?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes. I think what we said in our December Investor Day. we kind of gave -- we've been trying to give more insight I guess to the seasonality of the business, giving a first half, second half view as far as how earnings progression goes. And I would say that the comment we made there, I think were consistent. So over 60% in the first half of the year. And again, as we continue to grow the marketplace business that shift continues to happen. I mean, the real driver of our change in seasonality is really the product mix. It's the diversification of the product mix. And so to the extent you have a higher mix of exchange, then you will pull more earnings forward to the first half of the year, because of the: number one, that's when we have the highest level of membership. And number two, that's when we have the lowest HBR as a result of deductibles.","Sarah James","Okay. So even though you guys are doing much better on exchange growth that you thought at Investor Day, you still think the 60-40 net is a appropriate way to think about the year?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes. I would think that's a good place to start.","Sarah James","Thank you.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from A. J. Rice with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","A. J. Rice","Thanks. Hi, everyone.","Michael Neidorff","Hi.","A. J. Rice","First of all, just to ask about Fidelis a little more. It sounds like, generally, on a broad sense, everything is tracking. Are there any pockets as you drill down where you see new opportunities, now that you have it for a while or are there any areas where you\u2019re seeing challenges or that weren't anticipated?","Michael Neidorff","I will start off and others can add as they feel it. I think it's incredibly well run company. We are pleased with what we\u2019ve had and will continue to work with us in social responsibility. For some obvious legal reasons it was important that he appoints a new CEO, that we get him. Great continuity there. The whole teams in place. But he commented to me the other -- not too long when he was in it, the turnover rate since we announced the acquisition has been the lowest they've seen historically. So people are very pleased with it. I think the opportunities -- there are opportunities to continue to grow. There's opportunities to help them with the medical loss ratio using our systems. So it's -- but it's -- they\u2019re hitting all the numbers. They\u2019re functioning on all 8 of 12 cylinders, depending how many you have in your automobile. And so, I think from every aspect of it we're -- I made the comment one day that if we could find more businesses like that, I want to do one in the morning and one in the afternoon. They\u2019re really a well run company.","A. J. Rice","Okay. I was going to also ask about Mississippi in the press release you highlight that you completed the implementation of the new PBM model. Can you update us on your thought about rolling it out to other markets and will you wait for sort of proof-of-concept? In Mississippi, you play out for a little while or how should we think about that?","Michael Neidorff","No, it's -- we are actively rolling it out now and I'd like to roll it as best we can. But once again I want to make sure it's well -- proof-of-concept is make sure there. It is working incredibly well in Mississippi. And we are confident and we\u2019re going to roll it out into additional markets. We are right now as we speak. And by the end of 2020, we will be in all the markets and if I can [indiscernible] we will, but once again I\u2019m not going to overload it. And -- but it's a great system, it's going to prove to be, I think where pharmacy benefit should be headed.","A. J. Rice","Okay. What\u2019s this most significant economic benefit of making that transition that you\u2019re seeing in Mississippi?","Michael Neidorff","Well, there is administrative expenses, its cloud-based. We can reduce the admin cost significantly. And we are working with -- I mean, I mean, John Sculley, Ravi and the people there are really innovative creative. And I'm working with them now that, because I have a commitment to speak about is there some way to move to net pricing as opposed to rebate. And I think they have the system, skills and capabilities that we can start talking about those kind. We are talking about those kinds of things with them. It's not going to be instant. But -- so there is a lot of significance to what you\u2019re doing. It's very innovative and as we are able to demonstrate more and more that you will see it.","A. J. Rice","Okay. All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Wilkes","Yes. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about in the Medicaid book, medical cost trend and management, in particular, if could just kind of hit up on some color on what's doing better-than-expected, what\u2019s doing worse? How important the original restrictive networks are, and what's going on with risk profile at the state level with some of the reenrollment efforts that are taking place at those levels?","Michael Neidorff","Jeff, you want to comment on that?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes. Couple of things. We did see the Medicaid improvement over the third quarter, really it's a combination of many things. Combination of the med management network initiatives, premium -- premium rate adjustments combined with I think what we saw was stable cost trends in the fourth quarter. So your comment about risk profile, I mean you really have to go on a state -- state-by-state basis. So if you aggregate the business, I mean, that\u2019s one of the benefits of diversification. If you aggregate the business, I would say that the risk profile has remained relatively consistent.","Michael Neidorff","I would like to add that if you look at the scale and size we have in most, I mean, albeit in the newest markets, it's 65,000 in Mexico and global [ph], but when you have the size we do, you get a balanced book of business. And we were expecting to have some that are [indiscernible] and some that are healthier, and we look across the whole book, and we\u2019re seeing that. And that\u2019s really the large numbers as much with anything else coming into play. So thus far the benefit of our size, being the largest Medicaid provider. But also as, Jeff highlighted, you have 31 states. It puts you in a strong position, because as I tell investors, there's no different in their portfolio. At any given time they might have one stock that\u2019s not performing well or two. Well, we are going to have -- we are going to have a market that has a couple of issues, but we\u2019ve others doing well and they offset, while we correct the one has an issue. So it's a balance that gives us certain comfort.","Lance Wilkes","And can you just talk to the or just clarify on the behavioral membership for the quarter? What was the decrease in that? Does it go into an integrated medical offering?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, it's moving and we're moving more and more to the integrated medical. And I want to do that as quickly as we can. I really believe that's an important place to be. I have to use publicly the example that someone is diagnosed a new -- as a new diabetic, I sure want them to talk to a behavioral person as quickly as they can because it gives you more control of the total medical condition.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, the membership decreased. We previewed this at our Investor Day. It was really a behavioral health only program in Arizona that was integrated with the traditional Medicaid program. And so while the membership decreased quite a bit, the revenues are up on a consolidated basis. So lower membership, higher revenue because it's been integrated with the physical health.","Lance Wilkes","Got you. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Tanal of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Steve Tanal","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Steve Tanal","Just one quick one on the marketplace. I missed the minimum MLR accrual number. If you can just give us that once more and then maybe just let us know where 2018 margins ended for the business?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. So, I think 260, approximately $260 million. And as I said, in our December Investor Day, we are not going to give it. It's a competitively priced product, we are not going to give a specific margin number.","Steve Tanal","Okay. All right. Fair enough. And then the other question I had, we are hearing a little bit more sort of anecdotally around the eligibility redeterminations in Medicaid, potentially affecting risk pools and making for a bit of a short-term blip as some of the MCOs go back to the states for better rates. What are your views on whether or not that's happening? And if it is, maybe it's just part of sort of the uptick in Medicaid rates where you\u2019re looking for 1.5 composite increase in '19 or just one in '18 or how should we think about that if that's not really behind that?","Jeff Schwaneke","Again, I think you have to go on a state-by-state basis. We have seen where redeterminations have changed the risk pool and states been relatively quick to react. I wouldn't necessarily call that meaningful. It's certainly helpful, but it's not a meaningful driver of the medical cost if you look at the actual volume of redeterminations. But we actually have had states do adjustments, I would say relatively quickly after the redeterminations. And when you look at acuity mix, its different by state. Some of the -- some states have had redeterminations that had no effect on acuity.","Michael Neidorff","Yes. So it's once again -- it's the law of large numbers. Large number of states in the mix.","Steve Tanal","That\u2019s helpful. And then the acceleration and the rate, is there anything specifically we can sort of think about is driving that?","Jeff Schwaneke","The acceleration in what rate? The composite.","Steve Tanal","The composite. Yes, the composite rate, 1.5 versus 1 in '18.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I mean, I think I mentioned it in our December Investor Day. We do have a state -- certain states, which are performing at the long-term margin. Some of that is rating issues, so we have seen and are projecting some improvement in rates into 2019.","Steve Tanal","Perfect. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Windley with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Windley","Hi. Good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","David Styblo","Its Dave Styblo on for Dave Windley. First question I have was just on the Medicaid business. It seems like that\u2019s driving the MLR move into the bottom end of your 2018 guidance range. I would be curious just to get a better sense of where the margins are at this point and we're hearing peers, obviously, talk about net margins getting close to 3% over the next couple of years. Do you think that's something possible for Centene or is there some business mix or other structural considerations that might make it hard for you guys to replicate that type of profile?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I commented on this in our December Investor Day where we've also grown faster than anybody else in the industry on the Medicaid side. And as Michael mentioned before, when you're starting of these new markets, you have compressed margins versus what you would say is your long-term margin target. So I think from our standpoint we still think 3% to 5% is a good margin target. And just because of the mix and the growth that we've had, it's probably different than our competitors.","Michael Neidorff","And I would add something else. If you look at it, we showed in the net margin of 50 basis points what the -- with what we gave you today. It's easy to say what do you think is going to happen in the future. We prefer to say, we have a continued focus on margin expansion at growing the business. And we tend to deliver against it versus saying, I'm going to get it to X number, because that's easy to do. I used to learn that -- they used to say in [indiscernible] Brazil and others that [indiscernible] that people will accept anything. I\u2019m going to simply say that we're going to continue to grow this business and its dramatic in my opinion. And we're going to work hard at margin expansion using systems and other capabilities, we have to improve outcomes and reduce costs.","David Styblo","Sure. And Jeff, I think I heard you mention that the risk adjustment payables was that $930 million at the fourth quarter. I think that\u2019s up about 37% year-over-year compared to exchange enrollment that\u2019s up a little bit over 50%. Can you just help us understand maybe the delta there why those number look a little bit more comparable in terms of growth?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I mean, you have to look at number of months I think is one of the first things so in total. But, I mean, it wasn't out of line with our expectations. So -- and I did give you, it's $930 million and the reason I'm giving those is because typically we file -- in the quarters we file the 10-Q and you can pull those from the 10-Q. Obviously, here the annual report comes later. So I\u2019m just giving this to you now.","David Styblo","Sure. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Matt Borsch with BMO. Please go ahead.","Matt Borsch","Thanks for fitting me in.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Matt Borsch","So the question -- a question about if you look out with your the various providers that you're working with, do you anticipate shortages as you look ahead the next five years or maybe even beyond that? And I will ask a question in the context of a hypothetical that if you had one of the big drug retailers, let's say, with sort of ancillary personnel providing primary care services, would that be something that would be an attractive model for Centene to contract with?","Michael Neidorff","I think, we tend to kind of march our own drum. And we work well with primary care, we work well with specialists. And sometime, when some of you have a chance to come to the office, we will take you through our Casenet and our Intrepreta, we\u2019ve shown some of it in the Investor Day. But there are systems that help physicians become very successful in treating their patients. And given the data and given real time heated [ph] scores and things that they can get on, we are moving to where they can get on their iPhone. And so, I believe that there are effective contracts in equity or you can have equity in contracts is what I\u2019m trying to say.","Matt Borsch","Yes.","Michael Neidorff","And that\u2019s kind -- that tends to be the direction. If we see -- and I said this in Investor Day, if we saw an area where there is not enough positions for access or work with some governmental agencies, in just that issue while we have CMG now, that has a capability to open up very successful clinics that deal with this population, social determinants, etcetera. And we would ask Luis, who runs it, to move into region x and put together a little multispecialty clinic. So we think we have the capability to meet our members' needs. And once again, I mean, we all know who you are thinking of. That\u2019s a big -- it's a big operation, but they also have a lot of commercial and other membership. And we are very focused in the government services area.","Matt Borsch","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ana Gupte with SVB Leerink. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Hi.","Ana Gupte","Thanks for fitting me in. Just wanted some color as you go into 2020 on a couple of drivers, good drivers. Firstly, on exchanges. Can you talk about what your growth profile might be there as you look at the demand, and then the under penetration, the moves to short-term plans and anything else in the competitive environment as you go into the selling season.","Michael Neidorff","I will start and Jeff, you can pick up. But the short-term plans, I mean, short-term plans who manufacture association have been around forever. The benefits of maturity is less. The majority of our membership has subsidies. So why jump out if something else gives you a lot less benefits to go into it and those things still have to be proven, Ana. And they are just at the short-term.",". And I think over time, costs and short plans go up because you have such a turnover that you have different disease states. And they have -- they\u2019ve tried to overcome that by being able to underwrite health risks. And that itself I think is going to long-term be a problem, not for us, but just for health states in general. So I think this is a long way. It's an attempt to be disruptive, but I'm not sure how disruptive we -- our particular model. So I think that it's. So looking forward, I mean, I will just remind Ana, not you, but others has talked about our growth rate as we have got bigger wallets. We are still maintaining a significant growth rate. They talk about the exchanges and all the disruption and how it is and were up 15% this year while the market is declining. So we are just going to continue to business as usual and deal with the facts, as we have now and the fact says it's a good business, it's a strong business and we know how to manage it. We\u2019ve assistance to manage it. Does that help?","Ana Gupte","Yes, that\u2019s helpful. Yes, thanks, Mike. On the MA side then for 2020, and I think it's really thought leading on the Ascension JV, but you do have the four star contract at this point. Are you planning to do two different products, one that\u2019s cobranded, and then one that\u2019s with Ascension, and then one Centene or how are you thinking about 2020 as an opportunity for growth?","Michael Neidorff","I think that\u2019s going to depend by market. It depends on the size the market really are, our network. We are going to work -- we are going to first work effectively with our partners at Ascension. And they -- we are not doing any help and they work with. So, I mean, it's always -- it will be a mix and depending on the size of market scale, and what makes sense. I mean we\u2019ve some markets we\u2019ve had historically more than one product. So that\u2019s -- it's not a bad thing. I can go back to my consumer packaged goods space. So there was a time in Canada, we had two different soap [indiscernible] and it worked very well.","Ana Gupte","Makes sense. Yes.","Michael Neidorff","[Indiscernible] healthcare. Pardon me.","Ana Gupte","No, I think that makes sense. They're not customized just -- I mean, you will be more customized by local market and depending.","Michael Neidorff","Right. I think what the key is -- I think what\u2019s key, Ana, is you have the -- you have to have the systems. And the overall capability to manage that multiplicity of opportunities. And that\u2019s where we are focused and I made comments, we are going to continue invest in technology. And I think we\u2019ve demonstrated that we\u2019ve the wherewithal to do it in a very meaningful way. It goes back to the $500 million we are going to generate internally so as to be able to invest in new technologies, new opportunities. With that effect in margins, and the overall growth of the business.","Ana Gupte","Yes, truly. That\u2019s a competitive advantage. That makes a lot of sense on the systems.","Michael Neidorff","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Steven Valiquette with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Steven Valiquette","Great. Thanks. Good morning, everybody.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Steven Valiquette","So there were some moving parts in Medicaid costs throughout 2018 for really Centene and really a lot of companies in the overall MCO sector. But just given on the drivers you mentioned earlier, that led to your sequential improvement in Medicaid cost trend in 4Q '18 and also just exiting the year, I guess when you add it all up, is if there's any extra color you can provide just on your expected Medicaid MLR assumptions for 2019 overall versus 2018 overall just when comparing on an apples to apples basis. Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I commented on this sort of Investor Day, I mean, we do expect Medicaid margins to improve in 2019 over 2018. And a lot of that\u2019s driven by a lot of actions that we've taken this year, which will have a full-year run heading into 2019. The we do -- we do anticipate improvement in the Medicaid margins in '19.","Michael Neidorff","Yes, and bottom line is that the trends in 4Q '18, I assume, are very suggestive that you\u2019re on track to achieve that. So that\u2019s, I guess the key takeaway at least from my perspective.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, it was a good quarter.","Steven Valiquette","Yes. Got it. Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Taylor with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Gary Taylor","Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions left. The first is on the 2019 exchange enrollment, have you guys disclosed or be willing to help us with, on the four new states, how much does that contribute to the 250,000 increase at Fidelis?","Michael Neidorff","Jeff?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes. I guess, what I would say is, consistent with what we've done historically, it's not the largest driver of membership growth. Typically, when we go into new markets, it's a test and learn approach. And I think we followed that for the new markets this year. So it's not the majority of the driver of the membership growth. It really is coming from existing markets that we\u2019ve had.","Gary Taylor","Okay. And then my second question is cash from ops for 2018 was weighed by about $1 billion, I think, with some of these California accruals that you ended up paying this year. If you normalize that, free cash flow looks quite good compared to earnings. As we head into 2019, just remind us -- I don\u2019t recall from Investor Day you called out anything, but versus kind of your long-term guidance of 1.5x to 2x cash from ops versus earnings, are there any material variances that for 2019?","Jeff Schwaneke","No, I mean, I think the 1.5x to 2x would apply. There's always timing issues, right? They can always be a timing of the State payment that you don\u2019t get at the end of the quarter, the end of the end of the year that is subsequently paid within the next few days. And so -- and given our size in some states those can be meaningful. So you always have timing items that come up, but nothing that I can think of similar to what we experienced in the $1 billion of MLR payables in California.","Gary Taylor","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Ralph Giacobbe with Citi. Please go ahead.","Ralph Giacobbe","Thanks, good morning. So you ended with a 1.46 million fixed numbers. You mentioned the $2 million which I understand is sort of the peak number. And I think you also said, 250,000 year-over-year, so just wanted to clarify that. Sort of year-end membership on the hicks, somewhere in that kind of 1.7 to 1.8, is that the right way to think about it?","Jeff Schwaneke","We don\u2019t actually provide the year-end. Obviously, there was attrition from the peak membership. So what we\u2019re talking about is if you go back to our Investor Day slides, we would have said 2018 peak was $1.650 million. You are growing $250 million on top of that plus the addition of 80,000 with Fidelis, gets you close to the $2 million. But we don\u2019t -- we are not providing at year-end 2019 number.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. Is there any reason to think that it wouldn\u2019t just be similar to prior years in terms of ending versus peak?","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, I would expect to normal attrition rate. That\u2019s certainly what we\u2019ve forecasted.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then, just real quick, effective tax rate, we should use for 2019? It's in the guidance, I provided that in the guidance this morning.","Jeff Schwaneke","Yes, yes. It's in the press release.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. And one more, if I could. Can you just remind us the level of incremental, maybe strategic investment that you call out and just framing on sort of the ongoing expense or if you see that pace flow. Thanks.","Jeff Schwaneke","Strategic investment for which year 2018 or '19, what specifically are you [indiscernible]?","Ralph Giacobbe","Yes. I think we should start what we call business expansion -- business expansion costs. And I think what we said, now this is on a split adjusted basis, obviously, 12 to 14 cents.","Ralph Giacobbe","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Michael Neidorff, for any closing remarks.","Michael Neidorff","Well, I just wanted to thank everybody for the questions, the time and we look forward to continuing the record of -- year-after-year. So have a good first quarter. We will talk to you soon.","Operator","This company is now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation.

Please go ahead, sir.","Edmund E. Kroll","Thank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us on today's call. Michael Neidorff, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bill Scheffel, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Centene, will host this morning's call.","The call is expected to last about 45 minutes, and may also be accessed through our website at centene.com. A replay of the call will be available shortly after the completion of the call, also at our website, at centene.com or by dialing (877) 344-7529 in the U.S. and Canada or in other countries by dialing (412) 317-0088.

While the company may elect to update these forward-looking statements at some point in the future, we specifically disclaim any obligation to do so. As a reminder, our next Investor Day is Monday, June 17, 2013, in New York City. Please mark your calendars for that. And also, later this morning, at 10:00 a.m. Central Time, we'll have a webcast of Centene's annual shareholders meeting available, and you can access that link at centene.com in the Investors section of our website. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael F. Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's first quarter 2013 earnings call. During the course of today's call, we will discuss our strong first quarter results, our growth opportunities, including the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, ACA, and Centene's business environment. I will then turn the call over to Bill Scheffel, who will provide further detail on the quarter's financial results.","First, a few comments on the quarter's results. Premium and Service revenues increased 53% year-over-year to $2.5 billion. The health benefits ratio improved 90 basis points sequentially to 90.4%. Please note the new business HBR improved 260 basis points sequentially to 94.1%.  Flu cost in the first quarter of 2013 were $0.20 higher than in the first quarter of 2012. This was consistent with our expectations. Flu cost moderated in February and March after peaking in January.","During the quarter, we experienced a slight reduction in medical trends across our existing business. This included inpatient, premature births and certain outpatient costs. The HBR in Hidalgo showed some limited improvement sequentially, as our medical management efforts gained traction.  At the same time, we feel it is too early to conclude that the lower utilization experienced in the first quarter will continue throughout the balance of the year. Thus, we are maintaining our full year 2013 medical trend estimates at the previous level.  The G&A ratio improved 150 basis points year-over-year and 10 basis points sequentially to 8.3%. Importantly, the 8.3% includes a normal level of performance-based compensation. Membership increased 25% year-over-year to 2.7 million lives. Finally, cash flow from operations was just under 2x net earnings.","We believe we are well-positioned to meet expectations for the balance of the year. In addition, we feel that we can achieve increased profitability in 2014 upon the commencement of the ACA. Our future pipeline remains extremely robust at roughly $250 billion through 2016. Approximately $100 billion of this is within our existing geographic footprint. We view the Medicaid expansion component of the ACA as a natural extension of our core business. While not every state will go through with the expansion, we estimate that there is approximately $20 billion opportunity across our existing markets. Centene's experience with high-acuity populations support our ability to compete for the $30 billion dual eligible opportunity within our existing markets.","The exchange market represents the largest growth opportunity for Centene over the next several years, estimated at $52 billion in our existing markets. Our unique experience with hybrid gives us a competitive advantage. Centene will be selective when executing the initial exchange strategy. We will focus on providing coverage at the low-income level in a subset of the existing states.","Now onto the industry tax. We continue to believe appropriate congressional action will exempt Medicaid from this tax plan. However, we are engaged in constructive discussions with our state customers to include the tax in our rates, should Congress fail to intervene.","Now on for state updates. Kentucky. We still anticipate exiting Kentucky in July. Our best judgment is that the premium deficiency reserve currently on our balance sheet is adequate to cover our remaining tenure in Kentucky. In March, we exhausted our administrative appeals, clearing the way for us to pursue our legal actions. These include the declaratory judgment action on the issues of our right to terminate the contract and the measure of liquidated damages, if any. The court has issued a scheduling order, setting a hearing in May. We recently filed a separate lawsuit in Franklin County Court, seeking damages against the Commonwealth for the losses we sustained. Please note that given these matters on litigation, we will comment no further on them.","Texas. The Texas Legislature has completed the necessary steps for supplemental funding of the Medicaid program. The funding is under review by regulatory bodies, including CMS. The amounts are consistent with the assumptions in our previous guidance. The appropriate contract amendment should be finalized in the second quarter.  The rate relief currently being processed is intended for deficiencies in the Rural Service Area. We also continue to work with the state in evaluating overall rate adequacy for the regular September 1 rate adjustment.","Kansas. We commenced operations in Kansas on January 1. We ended the quarter with just under 134,000 members. We anticipate membership to moderate by 5% to 10% over the course of the second quarter. We also expected to remain at that level going forward.","New Hampshire. We continue to work with the state on initiating the managed care program. The timing will depend on the status of the ongoing regulatory approvals and resolution of litigation between the states and hospitals.","I would now like to discuss upcoming contract commencements. Ohio. Our success of the procurement in statewide expansion in Ohio takes effect July of 2013. In addition, the Ohio dual eligible program is set to commence in September, and we will operate in 3 regions. We anticipate ending the year with just over 200,000 total lives in Ohio.","Illinois. We are -- we were selected to serve dual eligible members in the Greater Chicago area. We are still engaged in discussions with the state on implementation activities, including the start date.","California. We were recently notified by the state of its intent to award Centene a Medi-Cal contract for recipients in California's rural expansion program. We expect this program to begin in the second half of 2013. This is an important win for Centene, as it positions us for future opportunities in the largest Medicaid program in the country.","Massachusetts. Last month, Centurion was notified that it had been awarded a contract to provide correctional health care services in the state. Centurion is a joint venture between Centene and MHM Services, a national leader in providing health care services to correctional systems. Operations are expected to commence in the third quarter of 2013.","Florida. Centene was recommended for a contract in 10 out of the 11 regions in Florida's Medicaid long-term care program. Enrollment is set to roll out by region, beginning in August of 2013 to March of 2014.","Switching to the M&A front. We closed our acquisition of AcariaHealth, a comprehensive specialty pharma company on April 1. The acquisition is consistent with Centene's strategy of expanding the breadth of our specialty company offerings. Specialty pharmacy is an important and growing category within overall health care spending. It is especially important to Centene, given the growth of our high acuity membership.","In closing, our view of 2013 remains positive and we are maintaining our full year 2013 earnings guidance. As Bill will discuss, we have updated our guidance to reflect new contract wins and the closing of the Acaria acquisition. The new guidance also includes costs associated with each of these items, which were not reflected in our prior guidance.","We look forward to updating you on our June 17 Investor Meeting in New York. I will now turn the call over to Bill.","William N. Scheffel","Thank you Michael, and good morning. For the first quarter of 2013, Premium and Service revenues were $2.5 billion, representing a 53% increase over last year's level of almost $1.7 billion. This increase of approximately $880 million results from the addition of 3 new states: Missouri, Washington and Kansas, and from a full 3 months of revenue related to the 2012 expansions in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. As noted in our press release, our revenue from new business, with less than a full 12 months of operations, amounted to 35% of Premium and Service revenues in 2013 compared to 20% in 2012.","Our consolidated health benefits ratio for 2013 was 90.4% compared to 88.2% in 2012. The increase in our health benefits ratio between years is primarily caused by the higher level of new business, which has a higher HBR than our existing business. For Q1 this year, our HBR for new business was 94.1% compared to 88.4% for our existing business. Last year, our HBR for new business was 90.7% and 87.6% for our existing business. Our 2013 results include the pharmacy carve-ins in Louisiana, beginning November 2012, and in Texas, beginning March 2012. It is important to remember that pharmacy has a higher HBR than our overall HBR, causing the consolidated loss ratio to increase when we add additional pharmacy business.","Also, during the first quarter this year, we incurred approximately $27 million of flu cost versus $8 million in the first quarter of 2012. Over half of the quarter's flu cost were incurred in January, and as anticipated, significant declines were seen in February and March. We estimate that higher flu cost this year accounted for a 60 basis point increase in our consolidated HBR compared to last year and decreased earnings per share by $0.20.","Sequentially, the consolidated HBR decreased from 91.3% to 90.4%. The decrease is due to the additional cost recognized in Q4 related to the Kentucky premium deficiency reserve and lower medical cost in Q1 across several of our markets. Both the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of 2013 had a high level of flu cost.  Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.3% in Q1 this year compared to 9.8% last year and 8.4% in Q4. We continue to benefit from the increased leverage resulting from our revenue growth. We spent approximately $0.09 in business expansion cost in Q1 of this year compared to $0.15 last year, and incurred additional performance-based compensation cost this year, including both cash and equity-based awards of $0.14 per share compared to last year.","Investment income decreased from $5.3 million to $4.5 million between years, reflecting the lower level of returns on new investments and reinvestments. Interest expense increased from $4.8 million last year to $6.6 million this year as a result of the $175 million of senior notes issued in the fourth quarter last year. Excluding the amounts attributable to noncontrolling interest, our income tax rate was 39.5% in 2013 compared to 33.5% in 2012. The 2012 rate was favorably impacted by lower state taxes and the favorable tax impact from the exercise of incentive stock options. Our diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.42 compared to $0.45 last year. Diluted shares outstanding were $54.3 million this year versus $53.5 million in 2012.  At quarter end, we had cash, investments and restricted deposits of $1.7 billion, including $45 million held by unregulated entities.  We continue to maintain our risk-based capital in excess of 350% of the authorized control level, excluding our Kentucky Health Plan, where we are maintaining the state's minimum level.","At quarter end, our total debt was $533 million and our debt-to-capital ratio, excluding our $75 million nonrecourse mortgage note, was 31.9%, which is a decrease from 32.7% at year end. We had no borrowings on our $350 million revolver at March 31.","And last month, Standard & Poor's affirmed their rating on Centene of BB and revised the outlook to stable from negative.","Our medical claims liability totaled almost $1.1 billion at March 31 and represented 42.4 days in claims payable, which is an increase of 1.3 days from year end.  In the press release, we presented the roll forward of our medical claims liability for the last 12 months. That analysis shows positive prior period development related to the March 31, 2012 reserve balance of $2 million, $14 million, excluding the impact of the Kentucky retroactive claims. This is lower than we normally experienced, and is impacted by additional claims incurred in the Texas expansion areas and for Celtic.  This was a unique situation in our prior period reserve development for the June 30, 2012, September 30, 2012, and December 31, 2012 periods, have all developed more consistent with historical amounts and each are in excess of $40 million of positive development at this point.","First quarter cash flow from operations was $43 million, which is 1.9x net earnings for the quarter. And on the 1st of April, we closed on the purchase of AcariaHealth. The cost of the acquisition was approximately $146 million, and was funded by cash on hand of $55 million and the issuance of approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock. Excluding transaction cost of approximately $0.06 a share, we anticipate the acquisition will be neutral to 2013 earnings.  Our 2013 guidance numbers have been updated to include the Acaria acquisition and the RFP awards thus far in 2013, including Florida long-term care, California, Arizona acute care, and Centurion in Massachusetts.","We expect Premium and Service revenues of $10.1 billion to $10.4 billion, diluted earnings per share of $2.60 to $2.90, our consolidated HBR of 88.0% to 89.0%, and a G&A ratio of 8.8% to 9.3%, our effective tax rate, 40% to 41%, and the diluted shares outstanding increase to 56.0 to 56.5 million shares. These numbers are our GAAP estimates and include the Acaria transaction cost. Our current estimate of business expansion cost for 2013, which includes startup cost for Florida, California and Massachusetts and also the Acaria transaction cost, is $0.58 to $0.65 per share.  Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Josh Raskin of Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Question on the Texas rate increases that you guys talked about, it sounded like you got legislative approval, et cetera, and  just looking for CMS sign off. Should I assume, therefore, that they were not, in your opinion, completely finalized and therefore there was no retroactive impact? It looked like in your 10-Q, the exhibits pointed to a March 1 retroactive date, but did you include any of that in the quarter?","Michael F. Neidorff","Bill, go ahead.","William N. Scheffel","In Texas, it's still going through the process for the rate approval, and so we expect that to be finalized in May. The amendment that was filed, really, was related to other items in the contract, nothing really to do with rates, and so there was no rate impact, no rate increase included in the first quarter from what is being considered today. We received the rate increase September 1, and that's been in there for fully -- for the fourth quarter and the first quarter.","Michael F. Neidorff","And Josh, as I was going through this whole process, it's prudent just to not talk a lot about it.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And you guys will have an update in May, it sounds like?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, we will.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And I assume you guys have in your guidance that the preliminary rates that you've seen are going to be trended forward, right? I mean, I assume that's at least baked in.","William N. Scheffel","I think it's fair to say that our guidance numbers all along that we provided in December and February and today have all assumed certain rate adjustments in Texas, and that's proceeding consistent with the guidance that we've previously provided.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just on Acaria, I'm just curious, how is that going to flow through from an income statement perspective? Is that considered fee revenue or were some of that in premiums? Or how should we think about that? And then just a slight nip, but the share count's up 1.2 million to 1.3 million even if I adjust the 2 million shares for an April close. I would have assumed that would have been up a little bit more. Were there some buyback or some change in share count other than that?","William N. Scheffel","Well, with Acaria, there's no results of operations for that until starting in the second quarter, right, beginning April 1, and that will be considered primarily service revenue, not premium revenue, when it is recorded. So the shares were not issued at March 31, were not outstanding and were not included in our numbers at March 31 or any of the reported results. They are included, the estimated impact of having those shares outstanding for 3 quarters of the year, in our guidance number for the use of shares outstanding for purposes of calculating earnings per share.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Yes, I know. That's what I was talking about. I would assume 2 million shares at 9 months is 1.5 million shares. It seems like the share count what not as much so was there some buybacks or something else in there that...","Michael F. Neidorff","No buybacks.","William N. Scheffel","There are certain share activity that occurs primarily from the exercise of options or from the vesting of stock awards that occur, and so that's -- we don't have any unusual activity other than the stock award activity.","Michael F. Neidorff","And I'll remind you, 40% of the purchase price was cash, with 60% -- approximately 60% in stock.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. And I guess, more importantly, it sounds like revenues are a little bit higher; MLR, unchanged; G&A, a little bit better, and then the offset from the share count, I guess, with Acaria. I think you mentioned the startup cost around Acaria making it sort of neutral. So would you say in terms of the actual guidance, that $2.60 to $2.90, would you think that within the range, you'd be trending a little bit better than you were previously just based on the components of guidance?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I guess, what we said is we saw some improvement in trend, modest small improvement in Q1, but it's probably really prudent to not anticipate that continuing, and so we're going to stay pretty much with that guidance of $2.60 to $2.90, Josh, and let it play out another quarter or so.","Operator","Our next question will come from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Question on the -- just first, could you clarify a little bit more about the prior period unfavorable development for Celtic in Texas, exactly what caused that, and expand that a little bit better for me, if you would?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think what I said, Peter, was that we gave in our press release the roll forward of the claims liability reserve as of March 31, 2012. At that point in time, the Texas expansion only had 1 month of results in there. And so what we've seen since that point in time is that the prior period development, let's say, excluding the retroactive claims in Kentucky, which kind of changes things a little bit, was only $14 million. Normally, we would see $40 million, $50 million that would occur a year later. So the positive development that we have is less than what we normally incur and see. And so -- but as you recall, in June of last year, we did record additional reserves for a number of things and pulled down our guidance for all of 2012. And what we're saying is when we now look at the hindsight analysis with respect to the reserves for June, September and December, they're all developing normally compared to our experience that we've historically seen, and the amount of positive development is in excess of $40 million for each of those 3 periods.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Got it. Okay, and then can you talk about how your contracting is going for the exchange membership that you're expecting to get? You laid that out as one of the bigger opportunities, going forward, at $52 billion in your markets. Can you talk about how your contracting is going on with the hospitals there in terms of rate?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think it's going well. Maybe, Rone, you want to make a comment on it?","K. Rone Baldwin","Yes, as Michael mentioned, we do expect to be on the exchanges in a subset of the places where we have Health Plans today. And we're entering into contracts with hospitals in line with the kind of the expectations that we set in terms of reimbursement rates, and I don't think it's appropriate to go into a lot of details about the specifics of it, but we're pleased with where we're landing in line with our expectations in terms of the contracts.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And so are those rates relatively close to your Medicaid rates with these hospitals or are they closer to where commercial rates would normally be?","K. Rone Baldwin","Well, again, I don't think it's appropriate to go into a lot of detail, but we're landing at what we think is good rates with respect to where we're ending up on reimbursement rates with -- and it's certainly not exactly at Medicaid rates, but I wouldn't say it's exactly commercial rates either. So I think we're pleased with where we're ending up.","Operator","The next question will come from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","I just wanted to come back to the G&A ratio in the quarter. It was about 8.3%, and then for the rest of the year, it looks like you're expecting a big step-up. Can you just sort of help us understand what's driving the big step-up in the latter 3 quarters of the year? And was there anything that was delayed in the first quarter that you had been expecting and that's causing the sort of seasonal shift?","Michael F. Neidorff","No, there was nothing delayed. We have the new businesses that are being brought up in the second, third quarter. Bill, you want to add something there?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think the primary changes you're going to see, beginning April 1, is the addition of Acaria, and so they will have a different level of G&A cost in that business than we have for the rest of our mix, so that's certainly one aspect that causes that. And then with respect to business expansion cost, I think we said we had $0.09 in Q1, but 58 to 65 in the rest of the year. So that will cause there to be a higher level of that in the remaining 3 quarters of the year. So I think those are the primary drivers of the increase in our G&A ratio for the whole year versus where we were for Q1.","Michael F. Neidorff","And closing cost.","William N. Scheffel","And closing cost for Acaria of $0.06 also get recorded in second quarter, which is the remainder of the year.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay, and then just to follow-up on Peter's question a little bit on the reserve development. I know you gave the roll forward. I just to make sure I -- can you help us understand what the development was in the first quarter if we just sort of isolated it to one period?","William N. Scheffel","We don't really try to do that on a quarter-by-quarter analysis in the current period. I think what we're saying is that the reserves were lower in terms of the amount of prior period development in March 31, 2012. But the actions that we're taking in the second quarter of 2012 seem to have taken effect so that we're already showing positive development on the June 30 numbers of over $40 million. So I think that issue related back to that period of time when we were just starting up in Texas and a few issues in Celtic, which hadn't risen to the surface, really, at that point either.","Michael F. Neidorff","I think, what's important in the technique gives you a good view of what occurred at that period of 12 months before in that quarter, and it said that we're adequately reserved, but we did not have the excess. It also shows that the action we took in the second quarter was appropriate, and it's built up and it's where it should be. So it's really just a way that we test ourselves, and you need to look at and say, \"Yes, they were -- they continue to be adequately reserved historically, and it becomes a pretty good metric for you to take a look at in that regard.\"","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Okay. And then just one last question, and I'm not sure what you think [ph] about it, but when I look at the latest disclosures on Kentucky in the 10-Q compared to what's there in the fourth quarter with the 10-K, I guess I just want to -- what if the declaratory relief is not granted next month? [indiscernible] to operate the contract through the end?","Michael F. Neidorff","Let's recognize with litigation, there's nothing to be gained by saying what we'll do or not do. We will be in front of the judge. We'll see what he says. We'll see what he's reasoning, and we'll work on it from there, but to say we're going to do this and that before -- I think if I was a judge, I wouldn't want to hear somebody standing in front of my bench saying that.","Operator","Our next question will come from Matt Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Could you just elaborate a bit on the discussions that you're having with states on the industry fee and their willingness to include that in rates in the event that Congress does not take action?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, I think we saw Florida is going to add a line for it. Other states recognize the actuarial soundness. There's been a lot of press, watching it elsewhere, that it's going to cost the government about $15 billion because it's going to have to come back in the rates, and then the states will be billing that back to the federal government again. So it becomes very circular, and we anticipate that the states understand that if it's not changed that there's going to be that cost to the state, and hence, to the federal government when they bill it back. The states then goes -- all of them have written letters to their delegations in Congress and elsewhere, stating their stand with this issue, and we'll just continue to let it play out. Those have been in commercial, and we'll -- well, we are still cautiously optimistic that it will be resolved. And I guess I'll characterize we've not seen where -- legislatively, people tend to do things way ahead of when they have to. That's not a snide remark. That's just a realistic look at what to expect. They rather do the things right now that they can.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, the real world. And on a different topic, the softer utilization trend that you alluded to in March, is there any further granularity you can give us on that? Did you see a decline in the hospital days year-over-year or births or outpatient visits? How did it manifest itself and is there anything you might attribute it to?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, I just think, as Bill had said, we saw some slight declines in inpatients. We saw the premature birth rate decline, but we also have healthy start for new baby, a lot of programs that may be taking hold, and we -- but I can't say it's going to continue in that, but some outpatient services were down. It was -- there were a lot of bits and pieces across the entire market in the various states, and that's about as granular as it will be safe to give without misleading, but I think there's a trend there that yet has to prove itself in another quarter or 2.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, got it. Last question, the Arizona contract loss, is -- have you done any back analysis to figure out where -- if there were metrics on which you could have done better or was it price rate based?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I think, anytime you're in that situation, even when you win, you always look back and say, \"I could still have done even better.\" That's part of the mindset of the company. I mean, in rates, there are a lot of different factors. Arizona is clearly recognized for making a lot of changes, and you've seen them across even bigger changes than this. The fact that this went that direction, I could have found a lot of different little things and we're just -- we're doing that analysis. Our internal audit department has individuals who are charged with reviewing all our peer responses, and see where we could still further improve. So that's an ongoing process, Matt. .","Operator","The next question will come from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I wanted to get a better understanding of what was impacting your new versus existing business MLR? So on the existing, I'm trying to come to a run rate. It's been pretty consistent, the last 6 months, 88.4, 88.5, but then that has excess flu cost, some positive development, and I'm not clear if you're putting Kentucky in the existing bucket by now, but maybe there'll be a step down when that contract ends. So can you talk a little bit about where run rate on existing business should be?","Michael F. Neidorff","Do you have some detail there?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I think that the Kentucky business has been in more than 12 months so it's in the existing business at this point. But Kentucky, because of the premium deficiency reserve amortization or whatever, it really has minimal impact on our overall numbers. I think as I said, we had about $41 million, I think, of premium deficiency reserve at 12\/31 on our balance sheet to cover the remaining 6-month period. About $23 million of that was used in the first quarter, leaving $18 million for the second quarter. So that's all performing to our expectations at this point. With regard to an HBR run rate for our existing business, I think it has been -- there's always ups and downs in terms of seasonality, the level of flu that's included in there versus the new business. So I wouldn't say anything unusual there. I will say that Texas will move into the existing business column for the second quarter, and we're not anticipating to see a significant -- we're expecting to see a slight decline in our HBR in the second quarter, even with Texas moving into that bucket.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And are you referring to the Hidalgo STAR+PLUS contract there?","William N. Scheffel","That's part of it. Well, we have a large expansion in Texas, which was included in the new business until -- again, until the second quarter, but it's been in there for a full 12 months.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And on the Hidalgo contract, was that the primary driver of the decrease in the new business MLR coming down or was there another state? And are there any kind of ongoing negotiations with the state around rates for that specific contract?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I'll deal with the rates and turn it over to Bill. We said -- I think, in my comments, I said that we will continue to work with Texas in evaluating the rate adequacy and so that's -- this is sitting here in April. The next increase is due in September. We have these real-time dashboards and things, so as time goes along, as we are close to September, we'll be able to look and demonstrate what our trends are in a realtime basis, and work very constructive with the states. So that's the time we'll really talk about that. Bill, do you want to pick up the driver of the new business in Hidalgo Star?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I think Hidalgo was just one part of the overall Texas expansion and we did get a rate increase in Hidalgo in September 1. So I think as the state's gone through their rate analysis in Texas, there was virtually no rate change in the Rural Service Area on September 1. That's what's currently being considered. Much of what has been in the new bill is for the Rural Service Area. So I think that in the fourth quarter, just on our overall HBR versus the first quarter, we said we added, I think, around $10 million of additional premium deficiency reserve for Kentucky in the fourth quarter, which we didn't do in the first quarter, so that causes some of the decline from quarter-to-quarter.","Michael F. Neidorff","And I wouldn't want you to, through the call, thinking things have fully normalized in Hidalgo. I mean, we -- it's still a work in progress. And as we've said many times, it's a matter of doing things on a sustainable basis and balancing our efforts to manage to care in a quality cost effective way, and then work with the states where additional rates are still needed.","Operator","The next question will come from Dave Windley of Jefferies.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","It's David Styblo, filling in for Windley. I had a kind of a follow-up on the utilization, the soft utilization trends you guys spoke about earlier. Can you talk a little bit more about when you start to see those? Were those consistent throughout the quarter? Did those [indiscernible] soften even as we were heading out?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I think what we said is, across the quarter, we saw some consistency in it. Now we had the flu cost in January. It was still high. Then we saw some mitigation of that as the quarter unfolded, and our experience tended to mirror the -- or follow that, what the CDC was seeing across the country. There's a lot of consistency there. Things like premature birth rates and that, that you get peaks and valleys in any quarter. So to say that versus other inpatient versus other outpatient services, it's hard to pinpoint and say if there was a fixed trend we're headed down and was continuing into April. That's why we're saying that that's the cause, not the cause, but the reason for some of the experience we're seeing in the HBR, but it's too early to say that, that will continue. And so therefore, we think it's prudent and appropriate to maintain the -- it's our expectation of our previous utilization levels.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. As a follow-up, if that softer trend that you're seeing continues, is that enough to get you to the upper end of the guidance range or exceed it? Or how do we think about that in comparison to the other pivotal points that might push you to the lower end or the higher end of guidance? I suspect those would be in the new business.","Michael F. Neidorff","I want to be as helpful and as transparent as we can, but I would say, right now, our experience and how we look at it, going forward, keeps us about where we are in that range. And that if we see continued improvement or maintain a lower level in Q2 or Q3, that would be the time to talk to you about where in the range we would fall or tighten the range. As I think I said in my comments, it's just too early to declare that based on the Q1 data. Even though we're looking at some real-time data through our dashboard, it's still just a little bit early.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's fair. And then finally, on lowering the SG&A outlook by about 20 basis points, is that more of a function of leveraging the new business now that all the transactions are in and new awards are in? Or is that more a function of Centene kind of being ahead of plan in terms of just their operating expense run rate?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I think, really, we've said all along, our goal is to leverage our incremental volume and we maintained cost reduction programs on an ongoing basis. And as you're expanding and growing, that's the time to focus on what your expenses are, not just adding more and saying more of the same. So what we're really doing is we're -- we continue to have everybody focused. And just because we've always done something doesn't mean you should continue to, and we're using systems and other things to never sit where we're at across the plans, especially companies, everywhere you look.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I may have missed it. Did you guys -- did you give what Texas MLR was in the quarter?","William N. Scheffel","No, we haven't given the specific HBRs by state at this point.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then, I guess, second question, if exchanges sort of do shakeout higher than Medicaid rates with providers, can you talk about your protection from getting charged that amount on your current book of business? I guess, will you have a separate carve out exchange product? And are you concerned at all around and how do you protect yourself in terms of future negotiations?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I mean, the exchange product is very different -- not very different, but the rate setting is different for the Medicaid versus the exchange, and Rone and his team has been -- with the help of Rob and others, are renegotiating effective rates for the book of business we're anticipating, which we told you was at the lower end of the spectrum. And so it's just a matter of working on it and dealing with it and working with the ACA rules and regulations, and figure out the size and what's an appropriate range. And I think with our actuaries, both internal and with our external actuaries, we'll be in business, very responsible. And of course, as we've always said, we want to always return to it's not how big you are, but we'd rather be a little smaller and profitable so we are willing to do that. But we believe we're well positioned. Rone's done a lot of work in the analysis work with everybody to get us where we need to be in the ranges.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, and then have you actually locked in contracts with providers at this point in terms of exchange?","William N. Scheffel","Yes.","Ralph Giacobbe - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then just my last one, can you help us maybe parse out the revenue components maybe by contract, if at all possible, for the increase in that full year premium guidance? So obviously, the premium guidance went up. So I'm just trying to get a sense of the components of what potentially has shaken out better or incremental to what you knew sort of last quarter?","Michael F. Neidorff","Go ahead, Bill?","William N. Scheffel","I think the primary item that's new is the Acaria revenue for 3 quarters of the year, and then we're making estimates with respect to the start dates in the membership levels and premium levels for some of the newer business coming on in the second half of the year, including in Ohio and in California, and so -- and the Florida long-term care, which will start in August, I think it is. But we'll come in region by region for over a period of, I think, 8 or 9 months. So I think that it's our normal estimate -- estimation process of what we think those numbers will be and membership levels will be, which is included in our revised revenue guidance that we've given.","Operator","The next question will come from Justin Lake of JPMorgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","First question, I just wanted to get some clarity on Texas. Specifically, can you give us the level of those rates? I apologize if you mentioned it before and I missed it.","William N. Scheffel","I'm sorry, the level of the rate?","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","What was the rate increase that we should expect you to get in Texas?","William N. Scheffel","Well, we haven't really given a specific number at this point in time. The state's still working through their process. I mean, we have our own estimate as to what that's going to be, which is factored into our guidance numbers. But I think that until the process is completed, we don't have a rate amendment, for example, yet from the state. That won't occur until May. So we've done our own analysis on what they've been talking about, but until that point in time, I think, we're not quoting a specific percentage.","Michael F. Neidorff","It's not wise to front-run anything, and future rates or rates people work on, that's doubly true. There's a whole process that goes through our actuaries, their actuaries. It's very constructive process in Texas. They want to ensure that it's adequate, and I think they know that we ask for what's really needed, and not trying to see how high we can push it, and we've demonstrated that to them over many years. And they've demonstrated to us that they're -- they've acted in a very responsible way over all the years, so that's why we have a good relationship down there. We have a lot of respect for the director of Medicaid and others down there who work hard to get it right, and it's not always the easiest political environment they have to work in, but they worry about the quality of care for the recipients and that those who are providing get adequately reimbursed.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And what you've said is that you -- the rates, the way you understand them, are in line with what you had built into the original guidance. Is that correct?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, that is correct.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, and the retroactivity, how far retroactive are they going to go back? So when they come out...","Michael F. Neidorff","We were talking to them. They understand the issues. They understand where we've had rate issues versus utilization. And Bill wants to add something?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I think what they're doing is looking at a particular fiscal year and then making a budget decision on paying additional rates for a certain period of time. i.e., the time of June, July and August to make payments, which apply to a greater period. But without any details of a rate amendment or anything, right now, we're just assuming that that's going to be part of the June, July and August revenue that we received.","Michael F. Neidorff","And the safest thing is they don't go through their process. They're responsible. They do a good job, and as quickly as we know and can responsibly report it, we'll try and let you know. We will be meeting again early June, which seems a long way off, but we all know it's really tomorrow. So hopefully -- I would hope and it's our hope that we have some resolution at that time.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. Then last question on Texas. Just the -- as you think ahead, I think you mentioned that their -- the typical rate cycle starts in September. So you're negotiating, not only this retroactive look back, but also the forward rates for September. Is there any -- is there an expectation that you're -- the more they give you early on or what they're giving you was fixed was going to lower...","Michael F. Neidorff","No, I think they all look to us for some real-time utilization information off our dashboard and other things, and to talk now today about what we're looking for in September, I think we need to let the other adjustments come and settle in, look at what that does to the total cost picture and revenue picture. And then as we get into the late July, August period, that's the time to be sitting down and getting very serious about what the data looks like because there will be enough in there to tell, to try and go now. I think with our real-time systems, we have an advantage so we don't have to take 3, 6 months old data and trend it as much as you would if you didn't have it. So I think we're in a position, the actuaries and ours, to use that real-time data to be more realistic at the time they set in the rates.","William N. Scheffel","The state, obviously, will look at the rates for the entire state, and all the managed care organizations and in their process. We're one piece of that. We provide our input and work with their actuaries to give them the data that we're seeing from trends and everything to make sure that's taken into account, but it would really be the state, obviously, working through their normal process.","Michael F. Neidorff","And as we've said historically, the state works constructively, and I think the activity you've seen since last September continues to demonstrate that.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Absolutely. One last question, your commentary on exchanges, specifically, your commentary around your product set that's going to look to address in lower income population or targeted for that population. Is there -- I mean, I'm just not aware of any way to specifically target lower income population. I mean, I understand that you can offer certainly a very narrow network product. But beyond that, is there a way to target, let's say, 250% or less of the MPL? Or is that just who you're going to market to? Or is that where the hospitals are going to be around in places where there's a lot of that population? Can you explain that to me?","K. Rone Baldwin","Well, I think as we have covered in the December Investor Day and introduced a little bit of our exchange strategy, we view this as an extension of our focus on uninsured people, particularly with the Medicaid base. So there are people that do churn out of Medicaid in terms of losing eligibility and then are looking for a private market solution. So there's a natural affinity in terms of our strategy for exchanges and the type of people that we've historically served and will come out and be looking for potential exchange solutions out of our Medicaid base. That's one lever. Certainly, network is a second one. We are building our network on the same set of providers that are providing people with care to our Medicaid members. So that is another way that basically, again, you tend to attract our target population with respect to things. We will be initiating certain marketing efforts and certain sales efforts that will again be built upon the types of people that have traditionally provided support and guidance to people that are looking for Medicaid solutions that will again be weighted more towards the lower end of the income continuum.  And with respect to how we're looking at our product design, we're looking at a product that is going to provide a comfortable transition from what people have historically had their care through Medicaid in terms of not being used to copays, not being used -- or large copays, not being large, used to large deductibles and co-insurance levels. Again, try to offer a product that offers people a comfortable transition from that type of care or reimbursement to what will be offered on our exchange products. So through a series of those sort of levers, we feel that we are going to pull in and attract that lower income population that's eligible for subsidies on the exchanges.","Michael F. Neidorff","And I think also, I would remind you, we have some practical experience with the hybrid product in 3 or 4 states so that we have understanding how some things -- kind of what works in that area. So I won't say anything more than that from a competitive standpoint.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, so you don't want to share with us what the maybe a reasonable target? I mean, the bids are due, I know, in a couple of weeks. You don't want to share with us a reasonable target [indiscernible]?","Michael F. Neidorff","Let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's something [indiscernible] after the years we were doing this, in some things, there's no advantage to get ahead of yourself. But thank you for your questions, thanks.","Operator","The next question will come from Kevin Fishbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. I wanted to go to flu for a second. The -- it sounded like you said that flu was -- there's no real difference between flu in the new market and existing markets, is that correct?","Michael F. Neidorff","Bill?","William N. Scheffel","I think that we incurred that across the country. Texas was our largest market, and the largest market where we saw flu. So I think that we haven't attempted, really, to split the flu out between the 2 that much [indiscernible] overall...","Michael F. Neidorff","Anything you'd add, Mary?","Mary V. Mason","I would agree. I would agree with what you said earlier, Michael, that, really, our experience mirrored the CDC.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Was there anything as far as the product design, as far as ABD? Because the ABD Medicare MLR improved pretty significantly, certainly, compared to the TANF increase in MLR. I want to see if there's some thought about flu disproportionately impacting the TANF versus the ABD and Medicare.","Michael F. Neidorff","I don\u2019t think you could make that. I don\u2019t think that's the case.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then moving over the Illinois duals. Last quarter, I think when you gave the update on Illinois, you kind of gave Q4 as the implementation date. And then this quarter, you said that the date was still kind of under review. Do you feel like that might flip into Q1 next year?","Michael F. Neidorff","When you're working with states, it's very difficult to pinpoint it, and I think the approach we took in getting that information was really where it needs to be.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just following up on the exchanges, can you give a little bit more color on the states that you're targeting? And then since you're talking about your experience and the hybrid program is giving you a leg up, I mean, the hybrid program membership has been declining. Can you just remind me -- is that just the repricing that you've started last year...","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, it's a combination of things. We've been using that as kind of a test market so to speak, and you're trying different things, which can move the membership up, down, as you try. I mean, the -- it would never be great, big significant membership. We knew that so it gave us that opportunity. And let's just say that in terms of what states, we're working through those, and when we file, it's going to be a subset loan of the current state. It won't be all 18, but there is a subset. And I think in some Investor Days, you've seen, we've talked about where the intensity and membership is, and the largest shares of market that would be there. Well, that's probably a good point to start, look at which states have the largest potential market and go from there.","Operator","Our next question will come from Anna Gupta [ph] of Dowling & Partners.","Unknown Analyst","So just continuing on the medium term growth drivers, the number of your states have expressed ambivalence about doing the Medicaid expansion. So as you are planning or doing scenario planning so you can operational-ize some of this and it's not that far ahead, can you give us some color on how you see the potential addressable market, assuming they do go for Medicaid expansion, assuming they do nothing or they opt for the hybrid and to what extent is your [indiscernible]","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, let me -- I think part of it is we know there's those states who've announced they're going to do it, and when we're in that market, so be it. We know that other states are still looking at innovative approaches. And the innovative approaches require CMS approval. But in some cases, we'll talk to the states on how our system do that, if that's what they want to do, but it's -- there's a lot of political and other business issues that states are dealing with that will determine which states do it, and when they do it, we'll be there if it's one of our states.","Unknown Analyst","And do you think the Celtic-type offering, is it portable? And that if you ended up doing based on the Arkansas model to close, for example, would your profitability be in line with what you'd like it to be and how would that compare?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think that we are very capable of doing the Arkansas-type model. I think, if we're going to be in exchanges, we're going to be at the low end of exchanges, and that's really what you're talking about. That's something we -- will be a sweet spot for us.","Unknown Analyst","Okay, great. And then on the duals, there's been some talk on the baseline rate in California and some actuarial concerns around what that might be. Can you comment on that at all? What sort of margins are being targeted in Ohio and Illinois? Is that likely to have any impact?","Michael F. Neidorff","Do you want to say anything or add on that?","William N. Scheffel","I think it's fair to say there's a lot of discussions going on around the country with respect to rates for duals. So those conversations are starting obviously between CMS and their respective states and then extending into the plans in certain markets. So I think it's premature to kind of comment on those as it works through. But I think that our understanding and expectation is there will be a balanced discussion on rate adequacy amongst those 3 parties, CMS, the states and the plans.","Unknown Analyst","And that goes also with the forward expected trajectory of savings? Do you think that's going to go in line with what you all think is achievable?","William N. Scheffel","I think, obviously, it's going to depend on what -- we need to get more visibility on expectations, both in kind of the initial year and in the out years. But yes, I think everybody has an interest in achievable savings and a sustainable program.","Operator","The next question will come from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question, just if you can maybe give us some thoughts on the trajectory of the MLR in the 2Q relative to the back half? And specifically, are you thinking the MLR can get back to within the guidance range in the second quarter as the Texas rate increase starts to materialize or do you think that's more of a 3Q event?","Michael F. Neidorff","Bill?","William N. Scheffel","I think that we -- from a seasonality standpoint, Q2 is usually one of our better quarters. And so I think as we're looking at this -- our overall HBR that we're looking at for the remaining 3 quarters falls more into the guidance range that we have indicated, and that we'll obviously benefit from certain rate increases that we have assumed that will occur, starting in the second, third quarter in Texas, but overall, we do think it will be -- the remainder of the year will fall within the range.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then just a follow-up question, just wanted to just get some more color on the disclosure that you included in the Q on contributions to the subs relative to capital. And it looks like you're forecasting you've going to have around $270 million of capital contributions over the remainder of the year to the subs. Maybe if you can just give us some color on -- are there any particular subs where you're expecting to direct most of that capital? And then just in terms of financing that, it looks like highlighted using the revolver to fund a portion of that. So just interested in maybe the mix of the financing of that between the revolver and from unregulated cash flows.","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, we have strong cash flows, and we have more than adequate capacity within the revolver. And again, as far as stating our current forecast, Bill, do not show us drawing the whole revolver, anything close to it?","William N. Scheffel","Right, we've been fortunate in our internally generated funds. It really covered most of the increase that we funded over the last 1.5 years or so in terms of the increase in revenues from 2012 of almost 60% and 25% or so, we're looking for this year. So we will put in over $1 billion in capital in that period, most of which we've put in $220 million, I think, in this first quarter already and the revolver balance is 0. So I think we've shown the ability to self-fund most of that, and we do have the revolver out there to fund the remaining. We did issue the $175 million in notes in the fourth quarter of last year, but that's really been the only issuance that we've had. We're very comfortable with our debt-to-cap ratio at this point in time, given the low-cost of debt, so we would expect to continue down that path.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, and then just one last question. Just on Kentucky, can you remind us whether you did end up getting a rate increase? I think some local media had said that all the plans did get rate increases when some of your peers decided that, but I'm not sure if you guys have publicly talked about that yet, so just interested if...","Michael F. Neidorff","We really have not talked publicly beyond saying where we are in the course and the administrative reviews, Scott. It's just...","William N. Scheffel","We did not get a rate increase in 2013 in Kentucky. Those were separate contract amendments for the other 2 plans, and we do not have a contract amendment.","Operator","The next question will come from Tom Carroll of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So just a couple of quick ones. Could you update us on how much remains in the PDR that was established? And Bill, I think you said it was $41 million at year end. Kind of where is that today? And then secondly, with the visibility on all the new business, I mean, my question was going to be do you anticipate having to raise more capital, but based on your answer to the last one, it sounds like that's no, but maybe just some clarification on that.","William N. Scheffel","Sure, the remaining premium deficiency reserve at March 31 is about $18 million, which is consistent with our expectations that we had at the end of the year when we revised our numbers in 5 or 10-K. So that's proceeding according to plan at this point in time. The other question with respect to the new business, we -- it takes about 12 months of revenue to -- for that to run out before all of the capital that you need for a new area is -- needs to be fully deployed. So our current projections are, as we add this new business, particularly in the -- we added Kansas on January 1, and we'll add some other states in the second half of the year and programs, that gets factored in quarter-by-quarter, and our current projections certainly allow us to cover that through internally generated funds and the use of our revolver.","Michael F. Neidorff","I'll also remind you that we have said at several different occasions that acquisitions for stock would be a way of adding equity to the balance sheet. And Acaria is probably a good example where we started that, and obviously, any acquisition we do won't be for that purpose. It has to be something that strategically we want to move into, but that's another way to add the equity without being dilutive to earnings.","Operator","The next question will come from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Specialty margin looked like it was 26% this quarter, which seems unsustainably high. So could you just talk about what drove the specialty results this quarter and where you think a sustainable margin would be for specialty? How do you factor in the Acaria deal as well as the new Massachusetts contract?","William N. Scheffel","Let me try to address that. I saw your note early. I think with regard to our income statement, if you're looking just at service revenue and cost of services, that's a fairly small number, $33 million in revenues for the quarter. And I think that the improvement in our margin with respect to services really comes from a number of our separate Specialty Companies, including Nurtur and Sympatico and OptiCare, and so I think it's actually a $3 million difference so I don't -- percentages are not necessarily indicative of the whole trend. In our segment, footnote in the 10-Q, when you look at earnings from operations divided by our revenues, I think we improved our margin from 4.4-something percent to 4.7% year-over-year. So I think that's more indicative of the additional volume that we've received from the membership gains over the year and increasing the revenue from the health plans where we serve those same customers at the specialty side.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","And so would you view the current earnings stream as being a good run rate for go forward?","William N. Scheffel","I think that the current run rate that we have shown, particularly in the segment footnote, is reasonable and appropriate for going forward.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Wright of Monness, Crespi, Hardt.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions. Can you give us the SG&A ratio for Acaria specifically?","William N. Scheffel","We don't give the specific ratios, but let's just say it's higher obviously, than our average of 8% or 9%.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","In the 20s range?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, we don't give that, Brian.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Well it's just that it's a whole new business for us so it's kind of just...","Michael F. Neidorff","I know. Let it settle down as our business falls in, and what we see now and where it is, as the revenue grows, will be different. So let's give it some time before we start to maybe jump into this, and I want to be careful. You can mislead by giving too much granularity too soon, and that's something I want to stay away from.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just as far as Kansas, that's a new market. Is that kind of in your new typical 90% kind of range for new market?","William N. Scheffel","I think each market is different, and the 90% that we talked about in the past with regard to within reserves, the 90% in the first period of operations, probably it's closer to 92% today when you consider our re-class of medical management cost that we did a couple of years ago. Having said that, Kansas, in the first 6 months of operations, where we have some continuity of care provisions and have margin build, we're running in the high-90s.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, and that's just for 6 months?","William N. Scheffel","Well, it's only been up for 3 months so...","Brian Wright","Expect that for the first 6 months?","William N. Scheffel","The first quarter was there.","Brian Wright - Monness, Crespi, Hardt & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then -- okay, and then just lastly on Kentucky, you ended the last year with a 255, I think, RBC ratio there. I would think with the premium deficiency reserve kind of buckets, is it reasonable to think that you're still in the same range then, for Kentucky?","William N. Scheffel","I think we'll probably be in excess of 200%. How much above that, I don\u2019t really know.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Centene Corporation's Chairman and CEO, Mr. Michael Neidorff for his closing comments.","Michael F.

Michael?","Michael F. Neidorff","Thank you, Ed. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's first quarter 2014 earnings call. During the course of today's call, we will discuss our strong first quarter results, market and product updates, and bring you up to date on how we are dealing with issues associated with the ACA and hepatitis C in the normal course of our business.","I will begin with highlights of our first quarter financial results. We reported first quarter diluted earnings per share of $0.57 or $0.79 when excluding $0.06 of USMM transaction costs and $0.16 of net costs for the ACA health insurer fee. We expect to recoup the $0.16 during the course of this year.","First quarter membership increased 13% year-over-year to 2.9 million covered lives. Premium and Service revenues grew 38% year-over-year to $3.4 billion. The faster premium growth relative to membership growth was driven by the continued growth in higher acuity beneficiaries. Our average premium per member per month increased 17% year-over-year to $355. The HBR improved 90 basis points year-over-year to 89.3%. This reflects a lower level of flu costs compared to the first quarter of 2013, as well as reduced utilization associated with the severe weather. We continue to see underlying 2014 medical cost trends as consistent with our expectations, similar to 2013.","Now on to market and product updates. First, we'll discuss recent Medicaid activity.","Florida. We completed the rollout of the long-term care program during Q1. The phase-in of this program was successfully orchestrated by the state, resulting in a smooth transition of our expanded membership. Centene is now the largest long-term care MCO in Florida. We ended the quarter with 29,700 long-term care lives. Separately, we continue to expect the MMA program to begin phasing in by region during the second quarter of 2014. We anticipate an equally smooth transition for this program [ph].","California. In November of 2013, we commenced operations in California under 2 separate contracts. Both contracts are performing in line with our expectations. Membership at March 31 was 118,100 lives. This represents a 22% sequential increase. We continue to see future growth opportunities in that state.","New Hampshire. We launched our health plan in December of 2013. Thus far, the performance is consistent with expectations. Membership at quarter end was 37,100 lives.","Massachusetts. In January, we began operating under Massachusetts -- or MassHealth CarePlus program in all 5 regions. Membership at March 31 was 33,400, which excludes our Centurion and exchange membership in the state.","Moving into dual eligibles. We continue to view dual eligibles as a significant growth opportunity. We have successfully completed readiness reviews in Illinois and Ohio, and expect a ramp-up of members during the remainder of 2014.","South Carolina and Michigan are expected to go live in late 2014 or early 2015.","Next some comments on Centurion. We successfully launched our third state correctional contract in January in Minnesota. Our joint venture with MHM provides a compelling alternative for state governments to address their correctional health needs. At March 31, we covered 41,000 inmates.","Shifting gears to the M&A front. We closed on our 68% investment in U.S. Medical Management in early January. This allows Centene to move from influencing health care costs to managing them. USMM is a critical tool in serving the complex needs and costs of Centene's high-acuity populations.","Next, I will discuss our proposed investment in Ribera Salud. We recently signed a definitive agreement to purchase a noncontrolling interest in Ribera Salud S.A., a Spanish health management group located in Valencia. Ribera Salud is highly regarded for its ACO-like, public-private partnership health care model known as the Alzira Model. This transaction is a good strategic fit as it closely aligns with our core competencies, including systems and medical management through Spain's government-sponsored health care programs. Diversification has always been a key element of Centene's growth strategy. This transaction represents an opportunistic entry into Europe. Our initial investment for the 50% interest is less than $20 million. This excludes letters of credit that will be issued at closing.","We clearly have the bandwidth to deal with this opportunity. It will not impede our ability to continue to pursue the ample growth opportunities in the U.S. The management team of Ribera Salud is extremely capable, and our equity partner, Banco Sabadell, is a financially strong and well-respected institution. We expect this transaction to close in the second quarter.","I will now comment on the ACA. First, the ACA health insurer. As of March 31, Centene has received signed agreements from 13 of our applicable states, which provide for the reimbursement of the ACA health insurance fee on a grossed-up basis. This represents 60% of the total. Ongoing discussions with our 4 remaining states are positive, and we continue to believe that the fee will be covered in a similar manner. CMS has been supportive in working with states on this matter. We remain confident that we will receive 100% grossed-up reimbursement for the ACA health insurer fee in 2014. This is fully reflected in our guidance. Bill will go into further detail on this topic.","Next, Health Insurance Marketplaces. We continue to expect the Health Insurance Marketplaces to have a minimal impact on our 2014 financial performance. In January, we began operating in a subset of counties in 9 states. We have approximately 39,700 enrolled and paid exchange members at March 31. We continue to expect marketplace enrollment to be in the vicinity of 70,000 lives by the end of the second quarter. The demographics of our enrollees are generally in line with our pricing expectations. The average age is 43 years. Members are predominantly lower income, over 80% are eligible for premium subsidies. It is still too early to comment on the acuity levels of our marketplace membership. While we continue to take a measured approach towards our participation in exchanges, we believe our early participation will give us valuable experience for longer-term marketplace opportunities.","Now Medicaid expansion. We ended the quarter with approximately 100,000 expansion lives in 4 states, which was above our 65,000 expectation. As we have previously noted, the majority of our states are not participating in Medicaid expansion in 2014. Longer term, we view this as a growth opportunity as more states adopt expansion.","Now I will comment on the new hepatitis C drugs. We are pleased that new curative therapies have been approved for the treatment of hepatitis C. We will manage the utilization of these drugs in a responsible way on behalf of our state customers. The high cost of these drugs has raised investor concerns about a potential adverse effect on our HBR. Let's look at factors that determine when drugs are appropriate, as well as the benefit of our specialty pharma capabilities, which is part of our integrated strategy. Acaria has experienced that we have leverage to develop guidelines for patient compliance. Some states, including Texas, do not yet have new drugs on their preferred drug list. It is anticipated that when the new drugs are added, we will be compensated for the additional cost. Additionally, Centene has limited risk in our correctional business through contractual protections. The oral medications are FDA-approved for 16% of the total hep C population, represented by genotypes 2 and 3. They are also recommended in cases where progressive cirrhosis and advanced liver disease are factors, as suggested by the World Health Organization. We have implemented medical management practices to ensure compliance with appropriate and recognized guidelines. The cost impact to Centene in the first quarter of 2014 is $7.3 million. This compares to $4.7 million in the first quarter of 2013. The incremental $2.6 million is on a higher membership base. As with all cost categories, our guidance includes an updated estimate of the incremental cost of the new hep C drugs. Our experience to date has been consistent with our estimates. We're working with our states on an ongoing basis to ensure the cost of new therapies is properly reflected in our reimbursement. It is important to note these new therapies are curative, thus it is possible that longer-term savings will be realized from reducing other medical costs associated with hepatitis C. It is still too early to quantify these possible savings.","A quick comment on rates. We continue to expect a composite rate adjustment of 0 to 2% in 2014. This is exclusive of any appropriate reimbursement for the ACA health insurer fee and hepatitis C, which are being negotiated separately.","In conclusion, our solid first quarter results have 2014 off to a strong start. When evaluating our progress on a year-over-year basis, one can really see the impact of our growth and diversification strategies. Centene became the health plan with the largest long-term care membership in Florida. In addition, we won 9 out of 11 regions in Florida's MMA program. We added 2 important specialty companies: Acaria and U.S. Medical Management. We added 2 new states: California and New Hampshire. We now manage medical costs in correctional facilities in 3 states: Tennessee, Massachusetts and Minnesota. Centene began operating in Health Insurance Marketplaces in 9 states, and we have multiple dual-eligible contracts. We remain confident in our strategic approach and look forward to the remainder of 2014 and beyond.","I'll now turn the call over to Bill.","William N. Scheffel","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. As a recap of our first quarter results released this morning, we reported significant increases in both revenues and earnings. Premium and Service revenues increased 38% over last year's first quarter, and diluted earnings per share was $0.57; $0.79 if you add back $0.06 in U.S. Medical Management transaction costs and $0.16 impact from the ACA health insurer fee for the first quarter, which we expect to recoup later in the year. At a more detailed level, our Premium and Service revenues were $3.4 billion this quarter compared to $2.4 billion in the first quarter last year. The 38% increase between years is a result of new operations for California, New Hampshire, Centurion and Health Insurer Marketplace; expansions in Florida and Ohio; and the addition of AcariaHealth and U.S. Medical Management.","Service revenue increased by $248 million year-over-year to $281 million. This primarily reflects the addition of the AcariaHealth business acquired on April 1, 2013.","The consolidated health benefits ratio for 2014 was 89.3% compared to 90.2% in the first quarter of 2013 and 88.1% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Compared to last year's first quarter, this -- the first quarter this year benefited from lower flu costs and lower utilization due to the effect of the inclement weather in many of our markets. In addition, the effect of the ACA parity payments increased our HBR by 20 basis points this quarter, due to recording approximately $68 million of revenue and medical expense for amounts received from the states.","Sequentially, our HBR rose by 120 basis points, primarily due to the impact of recording a higher HBR in the initial periods of operations for California and New Hampshire, the Medicaid expansion membership in 4 states and the Florida long-term care business.","For the first quarter, approximately 20% of our revenues were from new business compared to 37% in last year's first quarter. The HBR for new business was 93.1% compared to 88.3% for existing business. For last year's first quarter, the HBR for new business was 93.7% and 88.2% for existing business. Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.8% this year compared to 8.4% in last year's fourth quarter -- first quarter, I'm sorry, and 8.9% in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Business expansion costs in the first quarter were approximately $0.13 a share this year, including the $0.06 of U.S. Medical Management transaction costs compared to $0.09 last year. The additional business expansion cost had the impact of raising our G&A ratio in the first quarter by approximately 20 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2013.","In the first quarter this year, we recorded approximately $30 million of revenue related to the reimbursement of the ACA health insurer fee. We received signed agreements from 13 of 17 applicable states covering the reimbursements on a grossed-up basis for income taxes, and we recorded revenue representing approximately 60% of the total expected reimbursement amount. The 60% is slightly higher than we disclosed in our Form 8-K earlier this month as a result of additional clarification received from certain states regarding the amount of Premium revenue defined as long-term care revenue.","Long-term care revenue is excluded from the calculation of the health insurer fee. And of the remaining amount of revenue to be recognized, the Texas operations represent approximately 38% of the 40%.","As we previously indicated, we believe that we will receive reimbursement for the full year from our ongoing state customers for the ACA health insurer fee on a grossed-up basis. Importantly, during the first quarter, CMS has been providing assistance to the states in structuring appropriate reimbursement arrangements.","Moving on. Investment income increased from $4.3 million last year to $4.7 million this year, reflecting higher investment balances. Interest expense increased from $6.6 million to $7 million between years. The increase in interest expense is due to higher balances on our revolving credit line during the first quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 50.5%, excluding the effects of noncontrolling interest. Without the impact of the ACA health insurer fee, our tax rate would have been 40.9% compared to 39.4% in the first quarter of 2013. And our diluted earnings per share for the first quarter this year was $0.57 compared to $0.41 last year. Diluted shares outstanding were 59.4 million shares for the first quarter compared to 57.1 million shares for the fourth quarter of 2013. The increase is primarily due to the 2.2 million shares issued for the U.S. Medical Management investment in January.","On March 31, we had cash, investments and restricted deposits of $2.2 billion, including $49 million held by unregulated entities. Our risk-based capital continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level, excluding any temporary statutory impact related to the ACA health insurer fee during the year. Our total debt was $817 million at March 31 this year, including $295 million of borrowings under our revolving credit agreement.","Our debt-to-capital ratio, excluding our $72 million nonrecourse mortgage note, was 34.4% compared to 32.4% at December 31.","Medical claims liability totaled $1.3 billion at quarter end and represented 42.6 days in claims payable compared to 42.4 days at December 31. Cash flow from operations was $252 million for the first quarter, which is almost 8x net earnings for the quarter. We continue to expect cash flow from operations to be in the 1.5x to 2x net earnings range for all of 2014.","In early January, we closed on our investment of a 68% interest in U.S. Medical Management. U.S. Medical Management's operations are included in the consolidated financial statements since January 6. The cost of the investment was $215 million, which was financed through the issuance of 2.2 million shares of Centene stock and $82 million of cash.","Our 2014 guidance numbers have been updated to reflect our first quarter results. We expect Premium and Service revenues, $14.2 billion to $14.8 billion; diluted earnings per share, $3.60 to $3.90; consolidated health benefits ratio, 88.7% to 89.2%; general and administrative expense ratio, 8.5% to 9%; effective income tax rate, 50% to 51%; and diluted shares outstanding, 59.7 million to 60.2 million shares. We have increased our revenue guidance by $400 million as a result of additional revenue from dual-eligible membership, Medicaid expansion membership and AcariaHealth.","Our EPS guidance has increased by $0.10, reflecting our favorable first quarter performance. Our guidance numbers are GAAP numbers and include the $0.06 of U.S. Medical Management transaction costs.","Retroactive to January 1, we expect to be reimbursed on a grossed-up basis for the impact of the ACA health insurer fee for all of our ongoing states. We've also included an updated amount for hepatitis C-related costs for the remainder of the year in the 2014 guidance. Lastly, our business expansion costs for 2014 are estimated to be $0.55 to $0.60, including the U.S. Medical Management transaction costs.","Operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just first, clarification on the hepatitis C cost. So what do you do in a state like Texas, where it's theoretically not on the formulary and you're not getting paid for it at this point?","Michael F. Neidorff","When the state doesn't include it in the formulary, it's not a covered expense, Josh. Now in discussions, the states know that, and at the same time, we're having discussions that when they do decide to exclude it, if they have their own guidelines for use of something, they're paying the cost.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So if a patient -- if a Centene member is -- has hepatitis C and is prescribed Sovaldi and incurs $84,000 in costs and then you receive the claim, what happens there?","Michael F. Neidorff","One, it's just not paid. It's a denied benefit. It's not a covered benefit in the state of Texas. The state of Texas knows it's not on the formulary and we are obligated to follow state guidelines.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right, okay, that's fair. And then the doctor has to figure it out from there? Is that the idea?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, I mean, they work it out. And they -- I'm sure the state is working through it. We'll follow the state guidelines and then we'll manage it consistent with appropriate guidelines, as we've done everywhere else. I think we also have to keep in mind that if you think about the number of requests they probably get, take the 16% of the total population of all hepatitis may be qualified. But it's exclusive to those that are severely ill. And then you take those at a level where they need it, so the numbers may not be quite as large as it might seem in our population. That's to be proven.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Second question. State of Washington, obviously, the growth was way above what we were looking for. I know it's an expansion state. I know you guys have done well there historically. But I'm just curious, is there anything specific to Washington that -- just from a sequential membership perspective?","Michael F. Neidorff","We're doing our normal process, and Rone, would you like to add something?","K. Rone Baldwin","I think Washington is one state where the impact of Medicaid expansion has been very significant. But also, it is -- I would say, broadly, if you look at our membership statistics, we can't see broadly the impact of the woodwork effect that's been talked about. But I do think that in Washington, there is some clear signs that the woodwork effect has had an impact there as well. And the third piece of it is that there has been some meaningful enrollment in the exchange product in Washington also. So all 3 of those have contributed to the sequential increase of membership in Washington.","Joshua R. Raskin - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So there's sustainable growth there. And then just a last question, I guess, if you take a step back, your net margin was just under 1%, maybe 1.25% if you exclude the impact of the fee. As we think about sort of longer term, getting into that 1.5% to 2% or maybe even 2% to 2.5% range on a net margin basis, how should we think about the timing of that? I mean, I understand when you're growing the top line at 30% plus, it's going to be difficult to see that. But is that -- is 2015 a possibility? Or do we think this is 2016 and beyond once the growth normalizes?","Michael F. Neidorff","Well, I think we'll see more normalization this year. But Bill, you may want to comment on that.","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I think the first quarter is usually a little tighter quarter on the margins. And I think as the year goes on, we'll see continued expansion of the margins and -- because we've got a lot of new business in areas like long-term care and we're recording at higher levels of HBR in the initial period of operation. So as the year progresses, I think that -- we'll put some of that behind us.","Michael F. Neidorff","It's about 2% pretax this quarter, and we're looking for -- to move it to a 3% level and that's still our goal, to continue to improve margin. As Bill said, Q1 tends to be an unusual quarter.","William N. Scheffel","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Peter Costa of Wells Fargo.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, on the ACA fee, you talked about that being $150 million, and a little less than that this quarter on the run rate. So do you expect that to continue to grow through the year? That's the first question.","William N. Scheffel","Okay, so the health insurer fee, as what we've said, is we recorded approximately $30 million of revenue related to the reimbursement for the health insurer fee and we also expensed about $30 million. Right now, what we said is we've -- originally, I think I had said we expected the year to be around $135 million of total cost for 2014. And I think based on some of the refinement of the -- splitting out the long-term care revenue in a couple of our markets, that number has come down to a little below $130 million for the year. And so again, we continue to feel that we're required to expense the fee on a quarterly basis and record the revenue. We have the signed agreements, and we expect this is a timing issue within the year when this will take care of itself.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And the Service revenues look considerably higher than I expected them to be, some of that is USMM, but what else is driving that?","William N. Scheffel","No, I said that was primarily AcariaHealth that was driving that.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So it's primarily AcariaHealth in that number? Okay.","William N. Scheffel","Correct, year-over-year.","Peter Heinz Costa - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then the Sovaldi cost, when you said that, that would be in line with expectations -- with your expectations, but Texas, you're not paying any scripts there, so it's like 40% of your revenues where you're not paying for those scripts. So are you saying in line overall or you're saying in line even with that being excluded?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think we are forecasting what we expect we'll see from Texas and all our states throughout the course of the year. And in case of Texas, for example, we're in discussions now on the coverage of it and the reimbursement of it. So all the things that we know today to be factors in it, we've put in our revised guidance.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. I just want to go back, I guess, to the -- one of the prior questions there about the Service revenue. You said Acaria had a year-over-year increase, but sequentially it was up pretty dramatically and I think that the U.S. Medical was only supposed to do about $240 million annually, so that doesn't seem to explain the sequential increase.","Michael F. Neidorff","No. I mean, Acaria, of course, is one of the largest providers of the hepatitis C drug and other specialty pharmas and so we're seeing some of the benefit of that. But it's a mix of specialty pharma. You may recall that when we entered that business as a strategic entry, we saw, with specialty pharma, it would be moving to 40% of the pharmacy spend and growing from there. So Kevin, it's really all a case of just anticipating that and seeing it come through across a mix, including the hepatitis C drugs.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess, when you mentioned the revenue increase, you mentioned the Services revenue, you mentioned duals, I forget there was one more. Is it Medicaid expansion? Was that the third reason?","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes.","William N. Scheffel","The increase in our guidance on revenue was due to all of those factors.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And I think you mentioned the duals first. Is that, from order of magnitude, the biggest driver?","William N. Scheffel","I think that's probably true. I think what we said -- remember, when we started the year in our early discussions in December, we didn't have a lot in there for duals. And as we've got further into 2014, those start dates have crystallized a little better and so we've been adding that revenue in, particularly in the second half of the year.","Michael F. Neidorff","In long-term care, we've talked around Florida expansion. There's been a lot of appropriately positive results.","William N. Scheffel","And we have more Medicaid expansion membership than we originally anticipated. A few things like that, that have driven the increase in the revenue guidance for the year.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question, the MLR, I guess, first, our model anyway, it was definitely better and you mentioned that you got a benefit from weather disruption, flu being down year-over-year, but the guidance for MLR didn't change for the year. Do you -- are you forecasting either the ACV costs go up or that weather pushes volume into Q2? It sounded like you thought you might start to see some improvement on some of the new business as the year goes on, so it doesn't feel like that's going to be the pressure.","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think there is improvement in stuff that's already on. But we have -- in Florida, we have a pretty significant expansion coming in, in the Medicaid business. And so again, we'll probably have additional reserves in the initial period of operation for that as one of the drivers in the next couple of quarters.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So a better Q1, it just wasn't big enough to impact the annual guidance?","William N. Scheffel","Right.","Kevin M. Fischbeck - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","There's nothing to offset?","William N. Scheffel","Well, no. And I think also the new revenue we're talking about putting on, the increase in our revenue guidance, on the duals, we're pretty conservative on what the HBR is going to be on that in the initial period also.","Michael F. Neidorff","I think, we -- Kevin, we've used the words abundance of conservatism. We want to be reasonably conservative as you look at some of these new businesses.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Just to clarify on the hep C again. So if the drug is not on the formulary or approved drug list, one would assume if it gets on the list, then you would be remunerated for that. So is there essentially very little risk here? Or am I thinking about that incorrectly?","Michael F. Neidorff","No, I think what we've said is that we expect that if Texas includes it, the discussions we're in, we expect that there'll be some incremental compensation to cover it, and that's based on discussions we're having. And in other states, is the business starts to grow, we're watching it, we're talking to them, but we're also taking a very responsible approach to it because as we also alluded to, there are some savings we think that can occur because the hep C patient does accrue medical costs, inpatient and others, throughout the course of the year. So we're working very carefully with the medical management people, the health economics, to look at the total effect, and we're talking with the states about it in a very responsible way. And we're really taking advantage of the data warehouse and information we have real-time to show them the overall impact, and so we expect that to be compensated appropriately. Historically, it always has.","Christian Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","Understood. And then on the new ACA expansion membership, the 100,000 or so, is there anything to highlight on the utilization front? I guess people have been concerned there would be some pent-up demand from these types of new members. Anything that you could talk about there? Or is it pretty much relatively in line with what you see today?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think there's 2 factors. One, we said that some of the acuity is kind of hard with the limited amount of time to say absolutely, but this population is -- 80% is subsidized population and so we have to look at it -- I'm sorry. I was confusing the Medicaid...","William N. Scheffel","Yes, the Medicaid expansion population is still early, but those rates were generally separately calculated and so -- and usually higher than the normal rates that we receive. So there's nothing that we've seen at this point in time on Medicaid expansion membership, the 100,000 members, to say that those -- the HBR there would be out of line at this point.","Michael F. Neidorff","So I was mixing it with the exchange members. Thank you, Bill.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Carter of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Christopher R. Carter - Credit Suisse (Deutschland) Aktiengesellschaft","I guess, just the first one, can you just give us some color update on the progress in Texas and your discussions there on getting reimbursed for the industry fee?","Michael F. Neidorff","We have had the ongoing -- we've had the ongoing discussions with them and they're engaged, their actuaries are engaged with our actuaries. Everybody is looking at it. We've stated historically that one of the things they're looking at is a reimbursement of what that tax is, once it's known at the end of their fiscal year, which is September 30. September 1, the new year starts, obviously. And so we're working with them on that alternative, and we have no reason to believe that it'll be anything but approved. If you think about it, when you have the number of states that have already done it because it's logical, appropriate and necessary to maintain actuarially sound rates, it would be pretty difficult for any one state at this point to say, \"No, our state can do it and still be actuarially sound.\" We're working with them in a very responsible way. Texas has always, as we talked about historically, always worked with us based on the kind of data we've had and we're not -- we see no reason to think it will be different this time.","Christopher R. Carter - Credit Suisse (Deutschland) Aktiengesellschaft","Okay. And then just -- I know we talked about the Service revenue a few times, but is the $280 million number in the quarter, is that a good run rate for the rest of the year?","William N. Scheffel","I think that that's a good run rate for the year at this point in time. I think it includes both the acquisition of Acaria and U.S. Medical Management in that line item now, and a few other things. But I think, if anything, it probably will increase over the rest of the year.","Operator","Our next question is from A.J. Rice of UBS.","Albert J. Rice - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe a couple of quick things here. On the public exchange commentary, so you have 39,700, which you think you could be at 70,000 members by the end of the second quarter. I guess, is that 39,700 not as of March 31? And why would you have that incremental growth like that? And then second, as you start to think about 2015 on the public exchanges, any early read? I know you've got to put -- you don't have that long to think about your bids, but do you think you'll be more active on the exchanges as a result of what you're seeing this year and so forth?","Michael F. Neidorff","Rone?","K. Rone Baldwin","Just to comment on the exchange membership growth. The 39,700 as of March 31, again, that's paid membership, just to clarify on it. But basically, to be effectuated by that date, you had to select a plan by February 15. So -- the way the deadlines work. We, along with a number of others, I think you saw a fairly significant surge of enrollment ahead of the March 15 date and then that continued up to the April 1, and then there's been some kind of people that have been in line that have continued to enroll after that April 1 date as well. So basically, the view on the second quarter reflects that significant surge of enrollment that we've seen since the February 15 date, which is the cutoff date to have effectuated membership for the March 31 number. And we've seen that already with respect to our April 1 membership, and we expect to see that with the May 1 numbers, and we think that we'll be reporting something in that vicinity when it comes time for the second quarter earnings call that we have. In terms of the 2015, we are looking to continue to be in the states and the service areas that we're in today, and we're looking for -- looking at what I would characterize as a modest level of expansion in some of the states that we're in today. And we may or may not expand the number of states that we're in, but it would be -- if we do it, it's going to be very modest in terms of what we look to expand in at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Sarah James of Wedbush.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","I appreciate all the detail on Texas, especially because it's your largest market, but I wanted to take a more holistic view. So could you tell us what percentage of your book is in states where Sovaldi is not currently on the PDL?","Michael F. Neidorff","Mary?","Mary V. Mason","We have, right now, Texas and Kansas. However, most states have placed this on the PDLs. There's others that are in the process through state P&T committees that are reviewing these agents for their ultimate positioning.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","So for the states that are on the PDL, have you had any conversations with them where there's an indication that you will get reimbursed retroactively for the states where it currently is on the PDL?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think those conversations are ongoing in all of our states, so obviously we're not the only ones impacted by this. And when you have high-cost items, there's always going to be discussions on how to include that in the rates for actuarial soundness purposes or whether it's going to be carved out and covered separately by the state. So each state looks at their own program to figure out how to handle that and those discussions are ongoing, and I think everybody recognizes that this is a little different situation in terms of the magnitude of the cost, and so I think it will be worked out. I think over the long run, it will be included in the rates. How it goes through 2014 is still to be determined on some of these, but as we indicated, Michael's comments gave you the amount of the hep C drug costs for Q1 this year and last year, and I think you got to remember that we had hep C costs in the past, too, so it's incremental impact that has to be considered.","Mary V. Mason","Right. And we have the right for prior authorization, working with the states. And you can see now how, especially the states of California, Ohio, Indiana, now are putting in initiation of therapy for only -- for advanced liver disease. So -- and we continue to have very active discussions with the state on the development of those PA policies.","Michael F. Neidorff","And I think it's very important to get it right because, I mean, this is not the last time we're going to be looking at hep C and other drugs where this principle may apply. So you work very hard establishing the database with the state that you use, doing it in a responsible way, and it really will smooth the way for future negotiations as well. So we're taking a very kind of a holistic -- we're taking not only a holistic, we're taking a very long-term look, Sarah.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","Got it. And just to clarify, did you say that California was only going to pay for advanced liver disease? Or that's what their hurdle was?","Mary V. Mason","Yes, actually, if you start looking through the prior authorizations, many states now are now following the new World Health Organization guidelines that really calls for the initiation of treatment-only members with advanced liver disease such as cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease.","Sarah James - Wedbush Securities Inc., Research Division","And then last question here, if you could just update us on California, some of the new membership coming online, if there's been any woodwork effect. Just any update on that market would be great.","Michael F. Neidorff","Bill?","William N. Scheffel","I think in California, it's going well. We've been -- we're in 2 areas of the state, in Imperial County in the south and 17 counties, I think, in the north. We've gotten just good membership growth since we've come in there. It's been a good state for us. Nothing, I think, of any consequence that -- nothing out of line with our expectations.","Michael F. Neidorff","And Imperial has been very strong.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You raised expansion cost estimates back up again by $0.05 there. Maybe you could just walk us through the kind of quarterly progression on the $0.55 to $0.60, and also how we should think about maybe some of the leverage in the system as duals and others enter the market and how that's going to maybe be an offsetting pressure on SG&A as the year progress.","William N. Scheffel","Sure. I think, right now, the business expansion costs tend to go up a little bit in the second quarter as we add Florida in, and then a little lesser in the second half. But still, because we're adding duals in other places, it will continue to be there. I think the increase, the $0.05 increase that we added is primarily due to the additional revenue that we've added coming on. We expect the duals to have an impact in the second half and so we've added some expansion costs, start-up costs related to that.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then is there any offsetting benefit from the leverage of the extra revenue earnings as the year progresses that we should be contemplating in the ratio?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think over the year, I think we will continue to have a lower G&A ratio as we get some of the start-up costs behind us and we -- once the revenue starts, it obviously helps us quite a bit. So I think we've seen quite a bit of leverage on our G&A ratio over the last couple of years based on our revenue growth. So we expect that to continue although, obviously, the larger it gets, the harder it is to make those dramatic increases, but we continue to see that benefit coming forward in 2014.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears here to the HBR CRC, you included the exchanges in your kind of TANF HBR there of 86.9%. Is there any way you can maybe break out the exchange impact in there? Is it still your assumption throughout the year that it's going to be lower than the historical Medicaid ratio?","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I think that's true. Right now, we don't have a lot of experience to really zero in on what the run rate's going to be for that, as we're adding a lot of membership in the months of March, April and May, as Rone went over. So we're still probably in the mid-80s in terms of our estimate for the exchange HBR.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, specialty services HBR, is that 87.7% a good run rate for that business, similar with the kind of increased revenue there?","William N. Scheffel","I think some of that differential comes from adding in the additional service lines in the correctional business.","Andrew Schenker - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But that's a good run rate going forward or...","William N. Scheffel","Yes, it may be a little lower for the whole year, but it's close.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Lake of JPMorgan.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","This is Mike Newshel in for Justin. My first question, I just wanted to clarify on what's in Sovaldi for your guidance. Is there -- are there any states where the drug is on the formulary, you're currently covering it, that you're assuming that you're going to get some retroactive rate adjustments or carve-out?","William N. Scheffel","Our numbers and guidance numbers, we have not presumed any retroactive adjustment at this point in time. As we indicated, the incremental cost in the first quarter of that was $2.5 million on a $3-plus billion of revenue in the first quarter, so it wasn't particularly significant. That can grow as additional members are added to this drug, but I think that, as we talked about, the discussions with the state are to be able to include that in the rates in some fashion going forward.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And my next question is just on the MLR seasonality. So the full year range is below the first quarter. You talked about all the duals business coming on. What is the duals' MLR relative to the combined business, what you are assuming?","William N. Scheffel","Well, I think -- yes, in the duals, I think we're in the high 90s right now in terms of our estimates for the initial periods of operations, usually the first 6 months, and so...","Michael F. Neidorff","It's in the new business category. So we bifurcated new business, and now which we've had on the books for the year, so it will fall into the new business, and that tends to be in the 90s, high 90s in some cases. But -- then it starts to normalize over the course of the year and by the time we consider that, they're no longer new.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So the improvement in the consolidated MLR in guidance in the remaining 3 quarters, is that just seasonality or improvement in the underlying same-store business?","William N. Scheffel","I would say it's primarily seasonality. It's not unusual for us to have a higher HBR in the first quarter and then lower in particularly the second and third quarters due to the seasonality.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And my last question is on pricing for exchanges for 2015. Given the new policy on risk corridors and CMS wanting to hold it budget neutral, I mean, how are you thinking about it in terms of the impact of 3Rs and how you're accounting for that and how you're going to price 2015?","Michael F. Neidorff","Rone?","K. Rone Baldwin","Well, we're certainly going to reflect what the changes are in the reinsurance program, what we think about the scenarios for the risk corridor program in terms of how we price for 2015, and we're in the thick of that kind of right now leading up to the filing dates, which are basically pretty much around the end of May. So we'll have to see how all that plays out in terms of looking at how our rates land for 2015. It's really kind of too early for me to judge at this point.","Michael A. Newshel - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And for 2014, for exchanges, are you accruing any benefit from either risk adjustment or risk corridors in exchanges?","William N. Scheffel","I think what we're doing is not accruing anything on risk adjustment because that's still unknown, but we're applying the other 2Ps -- the other 2Rs in terms of the reinsurance and the risk corridor to follow those guidelines. But again, it's very early in Q1 to have any idea on where the overall HBR is going to end up for the year because we're still going to add this membership.","Michael F. Neidorff","It's important, we're gaining experience from it. We had experience in the original Celtic business, where we -- the priority [ph] here, we're gaining more experience. But I'll remind you it's under 40,000 lives of a business that has close to 3 million lives in it, so it would take a lot to move the needle.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just wanted to follow up to clarify the question before on which states don't have hep C Sovaldi on the PDL yet. I think you mentioned Texas and Kansas that did not have it, but there were a few other states that are in process of adding it, but that sounds like it wouldn't have been there yet in the first quarter. So can you just update us on which of those states are in process, didn't have it in the 1Q, but are adding it now?","Mary V. Mason","I mean, as I said, Texas is probably the one that everybody is focused on. All the states are looking at this and everybody's in different stages of looking at this. I think the key thing, too, is just working with the states on the prior authorization, making sure that it's strong clinical policy when we are evaluating this drug.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So it sounds like the majority of states were actually still in process, right? That there are only a few states that had finalized...","Michael F. Neidorff","No, no, no.","Mary V. Mason","Oh, no, we're paying for these. Texas is the only one where it's not on the PDL where we're not paying claims. There's other states that are still having them go through it. It's not on the PDL, and I think Kansas is a good thing. We are paying claims, but it's really the prior authorization piece that we're working with that state on.","Michael F. Neidorff","Right.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's what I want to clarify. Second question, just on -- any -- can you give us an update on any states where you still have to have your rate updates for 2014 established? It looks like in the Q, you mentioned that the composite rates were down around 0.1% in 1Q. You're guiding for 0 to plus 2%. So it sounds like you're expecting in some of the remaining states that you might see some rate increases?","Michael F. Neidorff","We have Texas that comes due end of the year. We have Georgia, I think, this July. We have Florida in October....","William N. Scheffel","September 1, I think.","Michael F. Neidorff","September 1. Florida, it is a big portion of our membership, comes due in...","William N. Scheffel","Second half.","Michael F. Neidorff","Second half of the year.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then just had a question just on...","Michael F. Neidorff","I might also add, these are all states that have good actuaries, that work with our actuaries, so it's not an unknown negotiation to us.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Then just had a question just on the specialty earnings relative to the Medicaid earnings, the segment earnings. Looks like the Medicaid earnings were up quite substantially year-over-year, but the Q showed the specialty earnings were down year-over-year and cited lower margins in the pharmacy business. Is that a function of the changes in mix as all the revenues from the hep -- the specialty drugs ramp up? Or is that essentially a lower-margin business? Or just talk a little bit about the pharmacy margins year-over-year.","William N. Scheffel","I think it's all of the above. I think what we've done is we've tightened our margins with some of our internal business. And we've added in the AcariaHealth specialty pharmacy business, which has a lower margin in general. It's just the higher volume that we have, quite frankly, given this lower margin.","Scott J. Fidel - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. If I can just sneak one last question into -- just on the exchanges. I know that the claims data is still very limited, but we've had a couple of the PBMs have put out some releases, highlighting some of the initial claims, the activity they're seeing and seeing much higher specialty drug utilization amongst the public exchange members. I'm just interested if that's what you're seeing as well in your exchange business or if you're seeing different type of pharmacy claims trends.","Michael F. Neidorff","We have that here.","K. Rone Baldwin","Well, on -- as Bill mentioned, I mean, it's still early to give kind of an overall judgment about what we're seeing in terms of claims on the exchange members. But on the pharmacy claims data, we're not seeing anything unduly concerning at this point in time.","Michael F. Neidorff","But it's real time.","K. Rone Baldwin","It is more real time.","William N. Scheffel","We're seeing basically below the level of costs for pharmacy than we might have originally anticipated from this membership. Again, a lot of this membership is just coming on so...","K. Rone Baldwin","Just one thing I will point out. I think that some of the comparisons have been against a commercial population that you've seen. I mean, we did not anticipate that the acuity of this population would be in line with commercial populations. We priced for something that was a higher morbidity than that. So in some ways, what we're seeing is not out of line with what our expectations are or -- and certainly not -- nothing concerning at this point.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Not to beat a dead horse here, but just on -- back on Sovaldi for a second. Can you quantify how much that benefited your specialty pharma operations in some way and maybe give us a sense, to the extent Acaria has visibility on where the drug is being used, is it turning out to be more of a -- more usage on the commercial side of the business as opposed to Medicaid from what you're seeing?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think -- I want to be very careful. I understand the question, but I think it's up to Acaria and its client companies to talk about that utilization versus us. Notably, I want to be respectful of that because we have a very strong Chinese wall between the specialty companies and our health plans.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Right. Okay, got it. Maybe if I could ask this -- 2 questions. One, can you give us, and I know you have in the past, give us an update on how many members you have taking that drug regimen and maybe some have already completed it, so how many since the beginning of this year? And just overall, do you expect that hep C will impact -- is it impacting the guidance in any material way for the whole year?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think we said -- as we said in the comments, that our anticipated utilization of those drugs has been updated and built into our guidance, so we have taken a look at what we expect. We gave you the numbers on the beginning and we've moved away from the number of patients as opposed to the dollar cost because of the shifts and how states are going at it. And I want to be very careful, we want to be careful because one could easily start to mislead if we're not careful, and so we've been careful on that. But it's not a material issue.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And maybe last one, if I could slip this in. There was some attrition in the Medicaid enrollment in a couple of states, Louisiana and Texas. Can you just talk to that?","William N. Scheffel","Sure. I mean, particularly in Texas, I think we've seen an overall decline in the market, but our market share has stayed the same. So each state goes through their own enrollment process, and sometimes, the employment levels -- increases in unemployment and decreases in unemployment could have an impact on the overall statewide membership. And so in Texas at this point in time, we don't see anything unusual because, as I said, we kept our same market share. In Louisiana, I think it's a question of just going through some open enrollment processes and members have shifted a little bit to some shared risk plans.","Operator","Our next question is from Ana Gupte of Leerink.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Wanted to follow up on the Spanish acquisition that you just did. You said that it doesn't impact your ability to invest elsewhere and it's $20 million up -- for the 50% interest. I'm just trying to get a sense for, is this purely about diversification? Is it something around capabilities as well? And as you go forward and you have a framework for how you evaluate various opportunities, how are you thinking about it?","Michael F. Neidorff","We're only thinking about it that, one, as we said, it has a very strong management, well respected in that marketplace. It's giving us some early experience in working in an international market, using our capabilities to supplement their capabilities from a system standpoint, and it is an ACO-type product. They have a fully integrated system. So it's really a case of gaining some of that experience. And as it grows, there may be opportunities to expand it there. But that's going to be really managed at the local level, and we're in a joint venture with a very valuable partner, a strong partner and well respected. So it just was the right opportunity to gain experience in that particular market. In my own background in prior lives, I was in international with Alka-Seltzer, One A Day, [indiscernible], so a lot of consumer products, and knew Spain to be a strong, responsible market. They have not had the same issues as others with sovereign debt. It's been more an overbuilding in the construction area. So it just was the right opportunity, Ana.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So Mike, is this more about that you're looking to build out a presence in Spain? Or is this kind of a one-off thing and you're primarily going to be focused domestically?","Michael F. Neidorff","I don't -- our focus domestically does not change. I mean, this is a large market. There is no absence of opportunities, which we continue to take advantage of. It has opportunities to continue to build on Spain and start to develop some of that, I think that's important. I've come to the conclusion that I think it's important, if you're going to be a leader in your field, to have some kind of global perspective. And we, as a management team, have come together on that and said, that's essential to really developing a true leadership role in anything you do in the world we're in today. Rone, anything you want to add? No? Okay.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Okay. So switching gears on to exchanges. From my understanding, I think from a question that was asked earlier, you're expecting mid-80s MLR. So that would translate to assuming you're not changing your outlook for the rest of the year on exchange margins just given where you're guiding on your HBR and you haven't changed that. Does that now mean that you're looking at this as a, given where you've priced, sort of a low-positive single-digit margin opportunity? It sounded like at your Investor Day and 4Q '13, you were guiding to something more of breakeven to negative, if I wasn't mistaken.","William N. Scheffel","I don't think that's changed. I think we're saying that the HBR is the mid-80s for this population right now. And with the -- the G&A costs are higher for the managing the exchange population and different aspects of it. So we haven't changed our overall view on the exchange results for the year at this point and continue to believe it would be breakeven to a small loss.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","So the SG&A would be substantially higher then, given the mid-80s MLR projection?","William N. Scheffel","It's much larger than our overall G&A ratio.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","Got it. And then finally, on the -- not again beating a dead horse, on Sovaldi, is it about 54 cases or so still? I think you had mentioned a number like that in March and is it the same? And in correctional care, is that excluding or including correctional care? You did say you have contractual protection on that.","Michael F. Neidorff","Yes, in the correctional care, obviously, there's the feeling that there's a higher propensity for hep C in that environment. But we are protected on that. We saw that kind of thing and that's going in the rates. Regards to the total numbers, obviously, as the population grows, the numbers grow up, but our ability to manage has been changed and improving so I'm just getting away from the numbers. What we've given you I think is important, this $2.6 million increase year-over-year on a larger membership base. So that said, it's well within our guidance and is being well managed.","Ana Gupte - Leerink Swann LLC, Research Division","That is helpful. It's impressive because when I've done the estimate, I came up with something like 300 cases for you, assuming IMS script data was right, just allocating. With United, it was exactly in line roughly with their $100 million, so you're definitely doing a tighter job of managing the treatment, that looks like it.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Sure. It's Dave Styblo filling in. A couple of questions. First one is let's come back to the rates for this year. How much of this year's premium do you already know for rates?","Michael F. Neidorff","About 40% or less.","William N. Scheffel","I think we're probably in excess of 70% at this point in time. I don't know if we have that particular calculation at our fingertips, but the second-half rate increases are the ones that are still open and, obviously, Texas is large. For the 4 months of the year, that's still to be determined. Florida, the rates -- I think the initial rates are known for the Medicaid expansion, so not as much of an issue.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. On SG&A, you guys are already at your -- basically at your midpoint of your full year guidance, and I think the way we think about this is probably expecting that to improve over time as you gain some scale. I know you flagged out a couple of items that may make it be a little bit higher as you have some new business rollouts. But is it fair to think about your SG&A guidance actually biased at the lower end of that range?","Michael F. Neidorff","I think what's important is, it's a range. The new business has cost us money. What Bill said earlier I think is critical. We have seen significant improvement over the last couple of years as we've had the revenue growth. And of course now, when you're pushing for -- to between, call it, $14 billion up from $10 billion, it's harder to leverage. You continue to leverage it, but it doesn't -- you don't realize the same kind of percentage improvement. So we're going to continue to leverage where we can, but the kind of -- 1 year from year-to-year, we had a percent-plus improvement. However, we'll not look for that kind of improvement. It's a range. It's going to be a function of start-up time. If things start up on schedule, we know that states do delay these things, it's a history of it, that's all going to impact it. Bill, do you have anything to add?","William N. Scheffel","No, I think what we expect to see is as we gain scale and add revenues, that our G&A ratio will continue to come down. We expect it to come down quarter-by-quarter throughout 2014, and we'll update every quarter as to where we think our guidance is for the year as we learn more.","David A. Styblo - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, understood. And the last one here was just if you can help us understand what's happening in the new and existing business HBRs, more specifically as we look sequentially. I know there's some seasonality there. But the new business HBR, improved over 200 basis points as you added revenue. And then your existing business HBR was actually up 170 basis points. And so I'm just struggling to understand and reconcile what's going on in those 2 lines as we split those apart?","William N. Scheffel","I think the primary shift is that Kansas, which started January '13, moved into the existing business for the first quarter of this year. And so when you add in the ratios, the HBR for Kansas, that's what the primary change is between the 2.","Operator","Our next question is from Michael Baker of Raymond James.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just on the incremental cost that you saw on the hep C side, does that factor in any potential Acaria benefit?","William N. Scheffel","No.","Michael F. Neidorff","Acaria is a separate...","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then on Acaria, as we think about the margin profile of that business, which you kind of spoke to, generally speaking, as we see more hep C flow through that business, should we expect the margin to stay steady or be pressured?","Michael F. Neidorff","It's going to -- I would say, Bill, actually it's fairly steady at this point.","William N. Scheffel","Yes, I think that that's -- we're not sure if there's major changes coming from anything.","Michael F. Neidorff","I think what's really important and I think the differentiator is that having Acaria gives us a clear insight and understanding as any of their clients would get, the impact of some of the specialty drugs and what's happened, what the appropriate use is, working with the clinical people. It's a nice place to be.","Operator","Our next question is from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl R. McDonald - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","So was wondering if you could quantify the benefit that you saw from weather in the first quarter and also give us a sense of how much visibility you have into the underlying claims data for the quarter at this point.","William N. Scheffel","I don't think we can quantify the impact -- any dollar impact to the weather. Obviously, there were quite a few markets that were impacted. In Georgia, there was almost a week at one point where they were shut down to a great extent, and so you have lower utilization during those periods. Some of that will come back later on, but not all of it. And so we're net ahead in that regard. And then I think that the second part was -- of the Q1, it's the same as every other quarter. We've got our methodologies applying for the HBR, which have stayed the same. You could see the amount of development we recorded for the first quarter of last year and our roll forward in the press release, and I'd say it's normal. Clearly, what we have is we have real-time pharmacy data, so we know those numbers. We have an inventory method for in-patient claims or we keep track of who's been authorized and who's been admitted, an estimate of what the cost of that's going to be, and then there's more of a lag then in the other categories, physicians, specialists, things like that, outpatient.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Carroll of Stifel.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Just one last quick one here. What -- if you could just tell us the number of Sovaldi claims you received in the quarter and then the total number that you actually paid as clinically appropriate? Just to get a sense of the -- what demand may look like as claims mature throughout the rest of the year.","Michael F. Neidorff","I really don't have those numbers at hand, Tom, and the numbers that -- we really moved to disclosing dollars because the next thing some of you -- you get so detailed that then -- by state, how many -- and it's just cumbersome to try and get into that level of detail.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I'm trying to get a sense of what the demand is like from the Medicaid population earlier on. Is it...","Michael F. Neidorff","I said we told -- I think we've said that it moved on the -- some of you might say it's almost relatively flat year-over-year, the expense, because of the increased membership. Now we said we're up $2.6 million and that's a -- I think that's an important number because you have $2.6 million to $7.3 million, was it? Okay. So I think that says something. I think you start looking what the increased membership was. It says it's really relatively flat, and we'll just continue to manage it. What we have emphasized -- everybody is worried about Sovaldi. It's 16% of the total hep C population that -- we're talking about that's appropriate for genotype 2 and 3. There are some in genotype 1 that have some very severe cirrhosis, where the World Health Organization might say it's appropriate with interferon and a lot of other things. But our job is that -- my job is not to become a medical expert, when it's done and when it's not, but just look at the overall criteria. We're glad the drug exists for those people that need it. We see it as a curative thing. We see it having some real long-term benefit. We've talked to our states, the states understand the cost. We're sharing with them the data that we need, not just the cost of the drug, but what we think over time as we get the data will be the savings because hep C patients are expensive to begin with. You had a hospitalization, it becomes very expensive. So if you're now cured in 3 months' period of time versus -- that's a nice offset because there's so much data out there that we could be misleading. We say it's this number, the next time it's down. Was it something you denied more? No, it just means we have a different population applied.","Thomas A. Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","So it's fair to say you didn't see a huge demand for the drug in the first quarter that you then whittled down based on your clinical guidelines?","Michael F. Neidorff","I would say that we saw a reasonable demand. We saw a demand that we relatively expected to see based on responsible outside guidelines and not just our guidelines, World Health Organization, other groups, the FDA, other guidelines that are out there that we use. These are not just internally developed guidelines. We're using national and internationally recognized guidelines. And that's really what the states expect us to do.","Operator","And this concludes our question-and-answer session.

And thank you for joining Centene\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2012 earnings call. In general, fourth quarter results were consistent with our guidance provided at the December 14\u2019s investor day when excluding higher than expected flu costs. ","I will provide more color on the flu epidemic shortly. My comments today will include an update on the key issues and other topics discussed at our investor day. I will also talk about our recently announced acquisition Acaria, a strategically important specialty pharmacy organization. I will then turn the call over to Bill for details on our fourth quarter and full year 2012 financial results. ","At our December investor day, we noted higher than expected medical costs associated with a much earlier than normal and more intense flu season particularly in Texas, which is our largest market. At that time we took down our 2012 guidance by approximately $0.15 to $0.18 per share to account for additional flu costs. However the flu hit even harder in the fourth quarter than originally anticipated. The fourth quarter included an incremental $0.30 flu costs compared to the fourth quarter of 2011. That was $0.11 above our expectations. ","Our initial read of January indicates a flu costs are similar to the levels experienced in December 2012. Our original planning anticipated higher flu costs in the first quarter of 2013 compared to the fourth quarter of 2012. Flu related costs are just one component of our total medical costs. Additionally, the most recent CDC data suggests that the flu season peaked in mid-January. Recognizing this we have not changed our annual guidance. ","Next Kentucky, we believe the state\u2019s Medicaid program is not sustainable in its current form due to structural and policy flaws. The Kentucky loss was $1.71 per share in 2012. In October of 2012, Centene notified the Kentucky cabinet for health and family services that it was exercising a contractual right that it believes allows the company to terminate its Medicaid managed care contract effective July 5 2013. ","Centene has also filed a formal dispute with the cabinet for damages incurred under the contract. That dispute is currently on appeal to the finance and administration cabinet. In addition, Centene has filed a lawsuit in Franklin Circuit Court against the Commonwealth of Kentucky seeking declaratory relief. On January 23, 2013 the Franklin Circuit Court denied the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to dismiss the case and retain jurisdiction of the lawsuit. The court stayed proceeds pending a formal written determination by the finance and administration cabinet, which is expected in late March. Recognizing that this case an administrative appeal and litigation we will make no further comments. ","On the Texas, as we discussed at our December investor day, we experienced higher than expected medical costs in the fourth quarter in Texas. This was related to the off-cycle transfer of high acuity members in Hidalgo service area from (inaudible). In addition, we experienced higher than anticipated utilization in in the in-patient category in the rural service area. The 4% state-wide rating increase effective September 1 did not reflect the impact of these two issues. The Texas legislature is currently in session and supplemental funding for the Medicaid program is expected to be passed in the first quarter. We continue to work with the state to obtain and ensure premium adequacy. ","I will now discuss Centene\u2019s new business and growth efforts (ph). The Mississippi managed care program expanded from approximately 50,000 members to 150,000 members effective December 1, 2012. Centene is one of two managed care vendors in the state. At year end, we increased our membership to 77,200. The state also notified us that we will be sole-source vendor for a foster care program that will commence during 2013. ","On January 1, our Kansas health plan began operation under a state-wide contract covering TANF , ABD duals and non-duals, foster care, long-term care and CHIP beneficiaries. The state has indicated they are pleased with the initial development of the program. Our membership is currently at 119,000 lives and reflects approximately 33% share of market. ","In Illinois, we expected to commence and expanded managed care service area during the second quarter. In addition, we were selected to serve dual eligible members in the Greater Chicago area. This program is expected to begin in the fourth quarter of 2013. We\u2019re also exploring further expansion opportunities in Illinois. We currently expect to commence operations in New Hampshire in mid-2013. New Hampshire will represent Centene\u2019s 18th state with health plan operation. ","Our successful re-procurement and expansion in Ohio takes effect July of 2013. We were also selected to serve members in the state dual eligible demonstration program in three regions. This program is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2013. ","Our Florida subsidiary was notified last month that it has been recommended for a contract award in 10 of the 11 regions of The state's Medicaid long-term care program. Enrollments will be rolled out by region beginning in August of 2013 and continuing through March of 2014. ","On the M&A front, we recently announced a definitive agreement to acquire AcariaHealth, a comprehensive specialty pharmacy organization for $152 million. The Acaria acquisition is consistent with Centene\u2019s strategy of expanding the breadth of our in-house specialty company offerings. Acaria\u2019s experience with high cost specialty drugs will allow us to better serve the needs of high acuity members. It will also enable our PBM to offer integrated pharmacy solutions to our customers. Acaria provides a national platform and experienced management team which brings strong relationships with pharmaceutical companies as well as expanded access to limited distribution high cost drugs. ","Specialty pharmacy is a very important cost category for Centene. We expect to increase specialty pharmacy spend to approximately $300 million in 2013 and believe this will continue to increase going forward. We anticipate that this transaction will close in the fourth quarter of 2013. Excluding one-time transaction costs, we expect this deal to be neutral to EPS for the first 12 months of operation. ","Now let's discuss the growth opportunities for 2014 and above. Our future pipeline remains extremely robust at more than $250 billion through 2016, approximately $100 billion of this is within our existing geographic footprint. We view the Medicaid expansion as a natural extension of our core business. While not every state will go through the expansion, we estimate that there is approximately $20 billion opportunity across our existing markets. ","Centene\u2019s experience with specialty needs brand (ph) and other high acuity populations supports the company\u2019s ability to compete for the $30 billion dual eligible opportunity within our existing markets. As I previously mentioned, we have already won two dual eligible contracts. Our advanced medical management and predictive modeling tools are key advantages for us in lowering costs with this high acuity population. ","The exchange market represents the largest growth opportunity for Centene over the next several years, estimated at $52 billion in our existing markets. Our experience with the exchange market gives Centene a very competitive advantage. We\u2019re already participating in high grade programs in Indiana and Texas as well as the Massachusetts connector. This allows us to move beyond traditional Medicaid and serve the uninsured and uninsured populations ","In summary, while 2012 represented challenges in certain markets, we believe we have the necessary steps taken to put us in a strong position (inaudible) in 2013 and beyond. And with that, I will turn the call over to Bill.","William Scheffel","Thank you, Michael and good morning. For the fourth quarter of 2012, premium and service revenues were $2.3 billion, an increase of 58% over the last year\u2019s fourth quarter. For the year ended December 31st -- December 2012 premium and service revenues were over $8.2 billion, an increase of 59% year-over-year. The increase in premium and service revenues in 2012 is driven by several factors. ","First, the addition of five new states during the last two years, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri and Washington. Second, expansions in three states during the last two years, in Texas effective February 2011 and March 2012, and Arizona long-term care effective October 2011 and the Ohio pharmacy (inaudible) effective October 2011. And then also in the fourth quarter of this year, pharmacy benefits were carved in Louisiana effective November 1 and the Mississippi managed care program was expanded to cover additional membership categories December 1. Premium ","Premium taxes grew significantly to $429 million in 2012 from $160 million in 2011. This is the result of certain states significantly expanding their hospital and provider tax assessments. We are paid these amounts and then immediately passed through the payments to specified providers. ","Our health benefits ratio was 91.3% for the fourth quarter compared to 85.9% in the fourth quarter of 2011. As we previewed during our guidance meeting on December 14, we have experienced a high level of flu related costs, particularly in Texas during the fourth quarter. Flu costs more than doubled in December over November and the increase will flu costs between years is estimated at $0.30 per share fourth quarter over fourth quarter. ","During the third quarter we recorded a premium deficiency reserve related to our Kentucky health plan. And in the fourth quarter we experienced a higher level of claims receipts for all their days (ph) of service and recorded an additional expense of approximately $10 million related to Kentucky. We believe the increased level of claims receipts was due to the one-year timely filing period starting to take effect and due to our announcement that we have initiated actions to exit the Kentucky market. Excluding the Kentucky health plan operations, the fourth quarter HBR was 90.7%. ","In Texas, as Michael indicated, we continue to work with the state to obtain appropriate rate adjustments for certain products or geographic areas. We expect this process to be finalized in the first quarter. ","For the year ended December 31, 2012 our consolidated HBR was 91.6% compared to 85.2% in 2011. Excluding the Kentucky operation, our HBR for 2012 was 89.6%. As we discussed at our investor day in December, we have presented the impact of new business and existing business in our press release today. ","For the fourth quarter approximately 35% of our revenues come from new business, those in operations less than a full 12 months. And our HBR for new business was 96.7% in Q4 compared to 88.5% for the existing business. And based on existing known business, we expect the percentage of revenue road for new business to decline in the third and fourth quarter. ","Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.4% for the fourth quarter compared to 11.0% in the fourth quarter of 2011. The decrease in the G&A ratio reflects the benefit of our additional scale and a lower level of performance based compensation expense, which lowered our ratio by 60 basis points. And we incurred approximately $0.11 in business expansion costs in Q4. ","For similar reasons, our full year 2012 G&A ratio decreased to 8.6% compared to 11.3% in 2011. Investment and other income was $3.4 million in the fourth quarter this year compared to $4.0 million in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, reflecting the continued low level of interest rates. For the year investment and other income was $36 million in 2012 compared to $13.4 million in 2011. The increase between years primarily relates to the $19 million in gains recorded in the third quarter of this year. ","Interest expense was $6.1 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $4.8 million last year. During the fourth quarter we issued an additional $175 million of senior notes priced to yield 4.29%. For all of 2012 our interest expense was $20.5 million compared to $20.3 million in 2011. ","Our income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2012 represented an effective tax rate, excluding non-controlling interest of 38.8% compared to 36.5% in 2011. Given the consolidated pre-tax loss from operations, the effective rate for the whole year is not meaningful. ","Diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $0.17 compared to $0.57 for the prior year. For the full year, earnings per diluted share were $0.03 per share versus $2.12 in 2011. I\u2019ll call your attention to the table in the press release detailing certain of the 2012 unusual items.","At December 31, we had cash and investments of $1.6 billion, including $37 million held by unregulated entities. We have estimated our risk based capital percentage, excluding Kentucky, to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. For Kentucky, we expect to maintain a minimum required capital level through our July 5 exit date. ","Our total debt at year end was $539 million reflecting the additional $175 million in senior notes issued in the fourth quarter. There were no borrowings under our revolver at December 31. Our debt to capital ratio at December 31 was 32.7%, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note. The medical claims liability totaled $926 million at year end. Our days in claims payable was 41.1 days, a decrease of 1.7 days from September 30 and a reflection of a lower inventory level at December 31. Our cash flow from operations was negative $29 million for the fourth quarter with total $279 million for all of 2012. ","For 2013 annual guidance, we have maintained the guidance numbers provided on December 14. Premium and service revenues $9.7 billion to $10 billion, diluted earnings per share $2.60 to $2.90, consolidated health benefits ratio 88% to 89%, general and administrative expense ratio 9.0% to 9.5% and diluted shares outstanding of 54.8 million to 55.2 million shares. ","Now there are number of moving parts for 2013 which have not yet been incorporated into our guidance numbers. We expect to close on the Acaria acquisition late in Q1 and we have not included any of their business in these numbers. We currently expect to issue approximately 60% stock in consideration for the acquisition. In addition, we would expect to incur about $0.06 in transaction costs upon closing of the transaction. ","The state of Florida has recently announced their recommendations for the long-term care program. This program will roll out from August of 2013 to March of 2014 and we have not as yet included the revenue and medical costs related to this program. However, we have included the start-up costs for this program in our estimate of total business expansion costs for 2013 which total $0.50 to $0.60. ","Flu costs have continued to be high in January, similar to December levels. Depending on how this plays out for the full quarter, we could certainly see an impact of this in our first-quarter earnings. But as noted, we are not changing our annual guidance. ","With that, operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","(Operator Instructions) The first question will come from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna Financial Group .","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","Just want to come back to the guidance for the year. When we think about sort of a fully baked outlook for 2013, including Florida long-term care, including Acaria, do you think that the $2.60 to $2.90 directionally is flat, up or down?","William Scheffel","At this point I would say it\u2019s flat. I think we said we didn\u2019t expect to have any particular level of accretion for Acaria in the first 12 months. There will be, we said, $0.06 for transaction costs and Florida long term care, the business expansion costs have already included the startup costs for that, we would expect that the amount of revenue and medical costs we would have particularly in the fourth quarter would not be a meaningful adjustment. ","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","And then I may have missed it, but did you disclose the Kentucky loss ratio in the quarter?","Michael Neidorff","We have not specifically talked about what that is. I think that it continues to be high as we said we booked the additional $10 million, so it\u2019s well into the hundreds. ","Chris Rigg - Susquehanna Financial Group","And then last question, more of a big picture question. We all can kind of agree that the industry tax on the Medicaid side doesn't make a lot of sense. But as of right now it's still scheduled to roll in the next year and you have a rate -- rate cycles obviously -- Georgia, Texas, Florida all come on in the second half of the year. I guess is it your expectation that in the absence of adjustment that the rates that you will see will have some sort of pro rata adjustment to sort of make you whole on the industry tax? Or do you actually think there is some margin erosion potential over the short-term as rates will not reflect the industry tax that begins January 1 of next year?","Michael Neidorff","I think that is a couple of factors. One, we continue to work that issue in the House and Senate. Obviously when the passed the bill, there was no reconciliation between the two bills, and everybody we talked to are well aware of it and the fact that it\u2019s one thing commercially, it\u2019s something else in government services, which have to be actuarially sound. So I believe that we will be able to work the states at appropriate rates to keep them actuarially sound vis-\u00e0-vis that particular task because we have no choice. But we also have the states working with us and agreeing by and large that \u2013 something we have to change on it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Josh Raskin of Barclays.","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","Just wanted to make sure I understood, Bill, did you say -- I'm just curious what you said about the flu costs embedded in the first quarter. Did you say you\u2019re anticipating a similar impact as you saw in the fourth quarter, meaning maybe an incremental $0.30? Or were you saying you have a normal season and then the flu could be an issue again? I just want to make sure I heard that right.","William Scheffel","So what we have seen so far is the month of January flu costs have been similar to the level you have seen in December. And as I said, in the fourth quarter December\u2019s costs were twice as higher \u2013 more than twice as high as November. So we\u2019re coming into this year with an elevated level to start with but we have seen in more recent weeks we started to decline. So we had built in a larger amount for Q1 and based on what we see right now, we believe that this level of flu will be higher than we originally anticipated. But given our current estimates we believe that will be absorbed within our current range of our guidance estimate $2.60, $2.90. But it doesn\u2019t mean that first quarter results in and of themselves will not be slightly impacted by higher level of flu costs. ","Michael Neidorff","Josh, it appears that the flu peaked earlier this year because of the earlier stride in the fourth quarter of last year. And our medical department, Mary Mason and others say we\u2019ve not seen twin peaks in the flu historically. And so as we said we saw it starting to dissipate, the CDC did the second week in January. Their experience is tracking with what we are seeing in our markets, Texas being the large one. So at this point, as Bill said, it may have some \u2013 it may have us (inaudible)","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","And would you be surprised if your earnings were up year over year in the first quarter? Should we interpret that to mean you would expect your earnings in the first quarter to be down on a year over year basis?","William Scheffel","I think that\u2019s a reasonable assumption right now. ","Michael Neidorff","It doesn\u2019t mean that \u2013 the flu is so episodic. That it becomes a little more difficult to project than other costs where you have more history, or a different former history. ","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","And then just second question. I am a big fan of this new existing market, same store versus new store metrics you guys are giving. As I look at the metric in the fourth quarter, it looks like what I will call same-store MVR was up 390 basis points, but the new business was up 360. And I certainly understand the new business is still at a higher level. But I am just curious what drove the same store? Was that flu costs in Texas? I am just trying to figure out what exactly is in new store.","William Scheffel","Well, I think in new stores, you also get pharmacy carve-ins which is occurred in Texas and some other things which has a higher HBR effect for that element of the costs. And so I think that what we see is for the existing stores, you\u2019re going to have an increase because we have higher mix and acuity levels in terms of the SSI tact numbers we\u2019ve added over time. In the new stores you\u2019re obviously impacted significantly by Texas and Kentucky.","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","I guess I was just surprised, I thought Texas and Kentucky would have -- the new store numbers would have been up more significantly year over year than the existing. Or I'm just trying to figure out what drove the 390 basis point existing same-store number up.","William Scheffel","You\u2019re talking about for the existing or for the new?","Josh Raskin \u2013 Barclays Capital","For existing. So the 88.5%?","William Scheffel","Right, again I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that the type of members that we have been adding, and that you have rated it as a higher HBR for example on ABD book of business, it would be a TANF book. We\u2019ve added a lot of higher acuity membership over time and that\u2019s what caused the existing HBR to be higher.","Operator","Our next question will come from Ralph Giacobbe of Credit Suisse.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","Just wanted to go to Texas. You\u2019d previously talked about getting back to a normalized margin in 2013. I guess is that still the goal? Can you help us with sort of the timeline for resolution and whether it would be retro and maybe what guidance assumes?","Michael Neidorff","I think we still anticipate the state, its membership normalizing during the course of the year. We know the state recognizes the issue, they gave us the letter which we shared in a conference in December. How they handle, whether on a going forward basis, or actual basis that should be determined. It\u2019s in the legislation now, they\u2019re working through it. And as soon as we know something we will be glad to share.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","In terms of the guidance assumptions for rate, have you guys talked about that?","Michael Neidorff","The guidance we\u2019ve given annually anticipates appropriate action on the part of the state.","Ralph Giacobbe \u2013 Credit Suisse","And then maybe can you provide some color on the Florida long-term care RFP? I think one of your competitors noted that they felt that underwriting was tight in certain counties and that the target loss ratio was kind of 93% to 95% or something like that along those percentages. Obviously you were awarded kind of 10 to 11 regions in the state. Can you maybe talk about your comfort around underwriting in the state and your ability to sort of run these contracts profitably?","Michael Neidorff","I think historically we have always said that we\u2019re not \u2013 numbers that we don\u2019t believe are consistent with the well managed business and appropriate medical loss ratio, we see it that way. We went after the service areas we believed we could manage, we had to (inaudible) with the state. We also think they had a very thorough process they went through. So having went through that process we feel good about it. Jesse, anything you want to add about the \u2013 how we look at it actuarially?","Jesse Hunter","Just maybe a couple of thoughts, Ralph, one is as you look \u2013 similar to point that Bill just made, with respect to ABD and some of the other populations, you\u2019ve got much higher premiums associated with affordable term care business. So as a result the allocation between medical costs and administrative costs is different but that doesn't necessarily mean that long term margin expectations would be different. So I think that it\u2019s fair to say that HBRs will be higher for long-term care product, that doesn't necessarily mean that the margins would be lower over time.","Operator","Our next question will come from Justin Lake of JP Morgan.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","First, in terms of the MLR guidance for the year, can you guys break out, given that you are going to be reporting this new store same store number, can you give us what your guidance implies in terms of the new store, same store MLR?","William Scheffel","At this point, we\u2019ve not decided to give guidance numbers on the same-store existing new business MLRs, I think our plan is to report that each quarter but not necessarily to give look -- forward-looking information on that. I think what we have said is that as a percentage of business, we know that some of the new business will roll into the old business during 2013 such that we get to the end of 2013 second half, closer to 15% to 20% of the revenues coming from new business versus 35% that we saw in Q4.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","Is there any way to even just share with us then what you think the same-store MLR would be on a reasonable basis, let's say for the year, even if you don't want to comment on the new store?","William Scheffel","I think we said on investor day that there was about 500 to 700 basis point differential in the MLRs between new and existing, I think that relationship has been there for several years. We would expect that to continue going forward. And this is about as much as I can say on it.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","And then on the acquisition, I apologize if I missed this. But net of all of the transaction costs and the stock issuance can you give us an idea of what you think the accretion is going to be on the deal?","Michael Neidorff","The initial year it\u2019s breakeven, neutral to earnings in the first 12 months. ","William Scheffel","Excluding the $0.06 of transaction costs that we would expect to record upon closing.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","So that\u2019s ex the transaction costs, will actually be dilutive to $0.05 to $0.06 for the year?","William Scheffel","Yes.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","And then just lastly on the flu, can you tell us what your flu number was last year in the first quarter?","William Scheffel","I think that last year was a very low season for flu, and so that\u2019s now we baked into our guidance. So I think it was less than $10 million in Q1 last year for actual flue costs.","Justin Lake - JP Morgan","And what\u2019s baked in -- remind me what's baked into the guidance this year?","William Scheffel","Well I think our original guidance had a much higher level than that for Q1, and we\u2019ve bumped that up even more given that \u2013 so we\u2019ve seen for January. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Carl McDonald of Citigroup.","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup","Just wanted to run through the premium deficiency reserve in Kentucky. So if you ended third quarter with $63 million, you added $10 million in the fourth quarter that you had already disclosed, so that got you to $73 million, ended the year with $41.5 million. It looks like you've applied $31.5 million in 4Q, is that the right interpretation? ","William Scheffel","I would agree with that math. Yeah I think we added additional $10 million in the fourth quarter, as we talked about for additional claims costs that we had come in and we ended up at December 31 with $41 million which really covers our estimate of the premium deficiency reserve from January 1 to July 5. ","Michael Neidorff","And they did change a few of the policies as well as \u2013 they\u2019ve eliminated or the retroactive assignment for SSI numbers, for example, won\u2019t change in the program.","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup","So I guess I mean, that gets to my second question which is if the out-patient was over $30 million in 4Q alone and you only have $41 million left on the premium deficiency reserve. Are those changes that have been made big enough that $41 million will cover those losses or would you anticipate that we may see that the premium deficiency reserves have to be increased again?","William Scheffel","I think right now that\u2019s our best estimate for 2013 and I think particularly when you compare 2012 to 2013, we would expect that Kentucky would have a minimal impact on 2013 after consideration that we got to 41 million of premium deficiency reserve, there could be $3 million or $4 million of exit costs and other things that prop up during the course of year which we've estimated in our costs \u2013 in our original guidance. But if we\u2019re off we wouldn\u2019t expect it to be up a whole lot compared to as Michael said I think our loss in Kentucky operations for 2012 was $1.71. ","Michael Neidorff","Now there if you remember, and Carl, when we see something that could impact the guidance or we had some information, we've never been bashful about it, putting it out there and making the appropriate adjustment as we see. ","Carl McDonald \u2013 Citigroup","But in terms of the Kentucky exit timeline, I know you\u2019re not going to opine on likelihood, but just \u2013 I\u2019d just be interested in the milestones on some of the timeline. Basically just want to understand if it\u2019s possible that you can get out by July? And so if the decision in late March is an example where to go against you can maybe just walk through next steps in terms of that timeline.","Michael Neidorff","At that point, we\u2019re back in quarter and we\u2019ll work through it quite expeditiously. I won\u2019t say any more except I would emphasize that the court did retain the jurisdiction. They stayed any action on us versus dismissing it to start over. So I think we have a judge who understands the issue in terms of timing and the impacts, so it\u2019s hard to say any more beyond that.","Operator","Our next question will come from Peter Costa with Wells Fargo Securities.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Can you go through sort of the capital requirements that you are expecting over the next year and a half or so as we get into 2014 and the premiums start to grow? Do you think your capital position is good enough for that? We have just taken a little hit to capital here this quarter; can we talk a little more about that.","Michael Neidorff","I will start off and Bill can pick it from there. As we have indicated that we believe that we have adequate capital through our cash flows, positive cash flows and our revolver to cover our capital needs for the balance of the year. ","William Scheffel","I think that as we've seen over the last year and a half the growth that we put on the books obviously requires funding at the subsidiary level for statutory capital. That will continue in 2013 and as we said our cash flow for all of 2012 I think was $279 million, something like that, we would expect that in 2013 it will be even greater than that given the operations that we have. So a lot of the capital requirements are met through internally generated funds and as we said the revolver that we have is unused at 12\/31 and it\u2019s a $350 million revolver expandable to $400 million. So the acquisition that we talked about is funded quite a bit with stock which will not really dilute our capital ratio very much and other acquisitions that we talked about we also look to include a meaningful portion of equity as part of those.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Do you foresee your internal cash flows generating all the capital requirements for the next year and a half? Is that accurate?","William Scheffel","We\u2019re particularly looking at 2013. 2014 is little less clear given Medicaid expansion and exchanges and how things fall out there in terms of what the requirements are. And so I think we can probably be in a position to better update 2014 once we get into the second half of the year and have a better look at how things are going to progress in 2014.","Michael Neidorff","And then you also have some high acuity, long-term care things coming in which will have \u2013 should have significant cash flow associated with that.","Peter Costa \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","You didn't talk very much about Louisiana. Can you give us a little update on the performance there?","William Scheffel","I think Louisiana has rolled out in three phases beginning in February through June and then it added the pharmacy carve-in effective November 1, so at this point in time it's been up and running for a reasonable period of operations and seems to be performing within our expectations. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","Thanks. First question just if you can talk about how discussions are progressing on the primary care provider parity rules and it looks like WellCare gave an update that they had been negotiating a bit on that in Florida. So maybe if you can update on Florida specifically and then more broadly how those discussions are proceeding. And then whether you expect that the capitation rates that you'll receive for that will fully cover the costs of moving the provider rates up to in parity Medicare.","Michael Neidorff","I think the best comments, it\u2019s a good question, as we are in active discussions and working through those issues. And it\u2019s best not to front run those situations. ","William Scheffel","Other than \u2013 we expect those to be neutral to us at the end of the day and we will accommodate whatever needs they happen from an individual state\u2019s perspective but we really don\u2019t expect it to have a net impact to us.","Michael Neidorff","We\u2019re very conscious of it, it\u2019s all considered everything we are doing. And the panels are working through us very appropriately, methodically.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then just a second question just taking together some of the comments that you have made so far on the flu costs in 1Q and what\u2019s incorporated into the outlook. Is it fair to say that it sounds like you are still comfortable with your range of guidance, but that does have a pretty wide range to it? So if the flu kept up with the level that we have seen a bit in January that you\u2019re comfortable with guidance but likely more towards the lower end of that $2.60 to $2.90 range?","Michael Neidorff","I think what we said is that we saw earlier more intense start in Q4 with the flu. We saw it continuing in January but we\u2019ve also seen it start to tail off in the second, third week of January which is in earlier tail off than we have historically seen. And that \u2013 so we feel that we are appropriately refunded on the year and I'm not commenting or giving any consideration to the ranges, within the full range, I am not saying it\u2019s at bottom end, or higher end of it. It\u2019s within the range and all the facts we have not seen a double peak historically, the twin peak in flu development, Mary Mason, our Chief Medical Officer will tell you. And so we\u2019re comfortable with the guidance we had to this point and if we thought something else, we\u2019d tell you that.","William Scheffel","To date there are number of moving parts within the year for the whole year\u2019s guidance. And at this point in time based on everything we see we\u2019re comfortable maintain that guidance at this point.","Michael Neidorff","As Bill commented, you see the same-store new store, the new store has gone from 35% as we sit here today and tailing off towards the end of the year at 15% with improvement in the MLR. We gave some guidance 500 basis point swings in MLR between old and new. So all these things have been considered and we put the range out there to reflect the moving parts.","Scott Fidel \u2013 Deutsche Bank","And then just had a follow-up question on the Florida long-term care contracts. And just first, what are the initial length of the initial contracts that you are in discussions regarding Florida LTC? And then if the pricing does not prove to be sufficient, and just given some of the commentary that we have heard from your peers on this front, what would be the process through which potentially you would then have an opportunity to sort of renegotiate pricing? So basically how long is the initial term for the pricing and then how long is the overall initial term for the contracts?","Jesse Hunter","So we\u2019ve got \u2013 as you expected in a lot of these contracts, the duration of the contract is multi-year and there is some flexibility on that front. But the pricing is annual pricing. So unlike what we have seen in Kentucky for example this will be an annual pricing kind of process that would be reflective and going through the actuarial assessment and determining actuarial soundness based on the performance of the program, and that could be both at the aggregate level and at the individual company level.","William Scheffel","We are in this product already in Florida and so other states. So we have some comfort level with it and we have been operating in Florida for several years working with the rate environment. And the issue of moving members to stay at home and community setting versus in a facility is the objective in these types of programs. And so we\u2019re comfortable that particularly given that we participate in 10 regions, we have scale of this program within the state of Florida which allows us a little more room to maneuvre.","Michael Neidorff","I will also just add, going back to when we first won \u2013 the first bidding on RFP on Georgia and when (inaudible) they did it on price, they came through well on us. And there are other instances in the connector where they said all \u2013 it\u2019s so low and we\u2019re not giving the state back money, because of the surprise that was there. So there is a certain pattern when people don\u2019t win they talk about the ones that won did it on price. And there is enough history there to say that we are conservative and reasonable and experienced when it comes to that. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian Wright of Monnes Crespi & Hardt.","Brian Wright \u2013 Monnes Crespi & Hardt","Could you give us a little more details on the process of the -- I guess supplemental rate increase discussion at the state legislature in Texas?","Michael Neidorff","Once again Brian, we\u2019ve had good \u2013 we\u2019ve had very constructive discussion, it was back to them realizing what occurred in Q4, how it occurred and they have insurance about it. They have worked with us, they have put the numbers forward to the state and it is a wise man that stays out of the middle of those discussions. And I would not want to say we\u2019re not being wise about it. And I appreciate what you\u2019re trying to do and I respect that but when legislation involves especially I can do is sit back and let the state who needs the funding deal with legislatures and not trying to express opinions on it. I am sure you understand that.","Brian Wright \u2013 Monnes Crespi & Hardt","I just wanted to make sure -- does the guidance assume any supplemental increase in Hidalgo?","Michael Neidorff","Yes, yes, we have confidence that the state recognizes it and it does assume appropriate supplemental funding to Hidalgo and appropriate action in the rural market as well.","Brian Wright \u2013 Monnes Crespi & Hardt","And just one last one if I can. When does the legislature finish the -- like when do they normally adjourn for this act (ph)","Michael Neidorff","It\u2019s the last week in March. I\u2019d just remind you if they passed it, then the state has to work through and through by service area, by sales and we would hope that they are able to get that information, and the amendments to the contracts with any stores, toward the end of the quarter. What\u2019s important is that they will have dealt with it in an appropriate fashion. It all starts there.","Operator","Our next question will come from Scott Green of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","First, just a follow-up on Florida. Looking at the RFP scores it looked like the technical scores for Centene were about average, but then you kind of leapfrogged some of your competitors during the invitation to negotiate process, which potentially implied that you were pricing lower. So I know in other markets you have explicitly talked about some utilization savings that were assumed. So is there any number like that you could give us for what utilization savings you assumed in Florida or how you might have been able to use your incumbent claims data to underwrite there just to get us more comfortable with the process?","Jesse Hunter","Yeah, I think one of the things that\u2019s important here obviously we are still relatively early with respect to the announcement and there is a lot of activity. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s total visibility on the technical scores on that the why. But we will continue to evaluate those things as we go through, as everybody else along the shore. But really the process that the state went through I think is important here and Michael referenced to the diligence that ACA went through, the state of Florida went through in this process. So there was the technical response. But there is also on a region specific basis oral presentations and that is candidly the best for us to represent our experience in serving this population, and I think that was ultimately reflective in the outcome of the scoring process. So there is both technical and then there is oral presentations where we think we did quite well. And then there is a pricing component and I think just to reinforce what you already know Scott that there was \u2013 this was not bid rates, there was a range that the state had provided. And so the state had set the actuarial range and there is really questions of where people came out within that range that was set by the state.","Michael Neidorff","You have also said upfront in asking the question, we have experienced in the market that we will be able to demonstrate to state what we can do in that market specifically. I think they have an appreciation of our systems and the capacity we have. We are managing higher acuity members and so all those things came into play and I think we had the \u2013 the large reception (ph) was the right outcome.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And separately, could you tell us what the status is of the Georgia Medicaid contract? I thought the state might have been working to add a couple optional extension years, but I'm not sure. How long is that supposed to -- goes to the Georgia Medicaid contract?","Michael Neidorff","I don\u2019t know that they had to disclose anything to us specifically in terms of any extensions and the people, Rob and others who manage the existing market health plans figured they have not disclosed anything beyond what we know now. ","William Scheffel","It appears to be another year out still. That\u2019s been that way for a couple of years.","Michael Neidorff","There is a fundamental that all states don\u2019t like to do (inaudible), they don\u2019t have to. Particularly have four months, working saving the money again part of the outcomes they want all those things that they tend to not want to do unless there is some procurement law that makes \u2013 there are some states that recognize the savings and have decided to expand it. As we see very aggressively Texas and others we\u2019re glad to participate in that. So as it relates to Georgia it\u2019s kind of stay tuned and you will probably know the same time as we do.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So for now you are not expecting an RFP there in the area near term?","Michael Neidorff","The honest answer is I am not expecting one -- but I am not expecting one. I expect that the state to change its mind and do something based on its budget area issue and their fiscal year starts in July. So as they look at it they can make appropriate decisions. We will encourage them every chance we get to expand what they cover.","Scott Green \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Lastly, looking at the fourth quarter MLR if you exclude flu in Kentucky it looks like it would be a little bit above your 2013 guidance range. So maybe you could just walk us through the main drivers to get you from where you are in the fourth quarter \u201812 to the midpoint of your guidance, which is 88.5% for \u201813.","William Scheffel","I think the primary thing is that the rates in 2013 should be improved in Texas, it is our largest market, they have some pretty big impact, and just in general we\u2019ve had rate increases will be applicable into the second half 2012, going into 2013 the whole year. And the fact that some of the older \u2013 the newer markets will start to mature and where we\u2019ve had original margin built up and other things like that will no longer to be necessary. So we expect those to be more normalized margins.","Michael Neidorff","Yeah we were starting to see some normalization until 6000 plus members move from another plan to us off \u2013 9000 excuse me. And the state is well aware of that as we told you and they are evaluating appropriate rates and responses to it. So there were some moving parts that rolled into that Scott that made it little more difficult to get a straight comparison.","Operator","Our next question will come from Melissa McGinnis of Morgan Stanley.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley","I know we spent a lot of time on the Texas rates today, but maybe just to ask the question a different way. Help us get comfortable with your guidance range, which is a range. How many months could you sustain receiving the current rate you are receiving and not put at risk your current guidance range?","Michael Neidorff","Did you say how many months would it be without any adjustment?","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley","Could you go through March with nothing, because you go through July with no update. In what way would it become a true risk to your guidance if there is not a typical lay (ph) on the legislature?","Michael Neidorff","Melissa, we\u2019re in the middle of negotiating rates with the state and legislation. I could say anything other than we need them as soon as possible. I would not want to go beyond that. I mean we\u2019ve asked to the states what we need and they\u2019re responsible for timing and way. So we obviously will always work to minimize expense with the state, save them as money as we can do all the things they expect us to do. But well, no, you don\u2019t worry about it if you don\u2019t give us rates until June or July, that\u2019s not the case. We obviously are working with the state because we need the rate approved now. ","By the way, they also recognize that and we fully expect them and the legislature to provide that rate adjustment. There is no reason to believe it won\u2019t happen.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley","And then maybe a longer-term question. We are 11 months out now from the implementation of health reform. And Michael, from your perspective or your conversations with the state, do you think that on 1\/1\/14 there is going to be an orderly enough process whereby new Medicaid eligibles are all enrolled or enrolled in a very short period of time? Or is this something that\u2019s going to be more like an eight quarter or 12 quarter rollout to full implementation across like the newly eligible lag (ph)","Michael Neidorff","I think that \u2013 and our people managing this process have to presume that it will be ready to go 1\/1\/14. I don\u2019t think \u2013 they may delay some of the steps along the way, when we\u2019ve had our internal discussion. But we expect that and have to work against and plan to be there for 1\/1\/. I think to not do that will be foolhardy. So we expect a 1\/1\/ implementation, we\u2019re working very hard against it with the states, and the states are anticipating their reduced savings that they will get to the funding from the federal government 100% for that membership. So they have every reason to push it as fast and hard as they can. And the states we\u2019re in absent one understand what's sound policy and what's a sustainable program and we think that those states will continue as they have, historically they have worked with us in a very responsible way.","Melissa McGinnis - Morgan Stanley","Sorry, I might have been a little bit unclear in what I was asking. Setting aside the risk that all of reform is delayed in some way out of state, what I really meant is like inside of Medicaid programs sometimes people who are eligible don't realize they are eligible sometimes until there is a medical event or something and they are in the ER and they get signed up for Medicaid. Do you think there is going to be enough public outreach to get the majority of eligibles enrolled assuming we have a 1\/1\/14 go live that they are in day one? Or is this going to be something that like seeing the enrollment as they realize it over a period of two to three years?","Michael Neidorff","I will let Jesse and others add to it but obviously the last time I saw was 12 million or more eligibles that are not enrolled in this country. So there will always be an element of that. But Jesse, what do you want to add in terms of ---","Jesse Hunter","No, I\u2019d say it\u2019s a fair question and obviously (inaudible) great visibility on it at the moment. But I think it\u2019s a reasonable expectation that given the amount of awareness and got more focused communications that will happen between now and 1\/1\/14 on a state specific basis I think there would be a higher kind of take up rate if you will out of the gate. But as Michael said, it\u2019s certainly not going to be 100% out of the gate. Those things will continue to take hold over time as people become more aware of the programs and the moving parts associated with the programs and how it affects them personally. ","Operator","Our next question will come from David Sagalov of Jefferies.","David Sagalov - Jefferies","Thanks for taking my questions; I am just filling in for Windley while he is traveling. I had a follow-up kind of in terms of the guidance. It sounds like your updated guidance reflects incremental costs for both the flu and of course the Florida long-term care business expansion costs. So, I'm curious about what that suggests for the underlying guidance? Are you suggesting that the core business is improving enough to absorb those costs, or is it more of a factor that that guidance might be a little bit more biased to the low end of that range?","William Scheffel","I think that when we talk about guidance on December 14, there were questions about what \u2013 how much conservatism was built into our guidance numbers, and I think that\u2019s part of the issue here that we have a range for guidance and we\u2019ve allowed for an estimate of $0.50 to $0.60 for example for business expansion costs and the long-term care program expansion costs included into that number now. And we do believe that the basic underlying businesses are sound and performing well. Flu, we\u2019ve got some visibility to that right now for Q1 and feel comfortable with maintain our guidance given what we know at this point in time.","And we feel for the whole year that the guidance numbers we gave are still the appropriate amounts to retain and the level of conservatism that we have built in I think allows us to retain that guidance. ","Michael Neidorff","I think just kind of answer the same thing in a slightly different way. On the flu, we\u2019ve given you the substantiation of why we believe it\u2019s adequately planned to this point in time because of the fact that it has peaked in these states that we\u2019re going to look at. We did anticipate in December winning some of the long-term care where we currently operate, have a current operation and we plan the $0.60 expense to bring it up because long-term care does have more nurses, more case managers, I think we have the experience to know what that is when we plan for. So I would say the guidance as is out there reflects what we thought then and we see no reason to change it at this point in time.","David Sagalov - Jefferies","So you are saying -- when you gave your mid-December guidance that you had contemplated some potential buildout for the Florida long-term care even though it wasn't announced at that point?","Michael Neidorff","Right. You have to make certain assumptions and we were much more comfortable doing that than coming in.","William Scheffel","As we just said the $0.50 to $0.60 that we had for business expansion costs included a number of known things, it also included placeholders for a other things that were in process and little bit of the unknown to be determined.","David Sagalov - Jefferies","If we could just circle back to the quarterly progressions, especially kind of looking at the first quarter and thinking obviously higher flu costs this year. But is there some easing in some way on Kentucky or are there other factors to help offset that or just to help directionally? Are we certainly looking at something that should be down year over year? Are there any other offsets that would help get that closer to perhaps being flat year over year?","Michael Neidorff","Of course, it\u2019s our policy to give annual guidance as opposed to quarterly and so our help (ph) \u2013 Bill, I think you can add to it but I am going to say we\u2019ve said that we are maintain annual guidance, we are saying that there are some \u2013 there were some incremental expenses in Q1 that we believe will be offset during the course of the year. And I think that summarized what we already said.","William Scheffel","I think that Q1 has a number of open factors with respect when tax rates are going to be impacted, so that\u2019s part of the biggest question of just timing. We believe it will be in there for the full year but how much is required in Q1 and it will depend on the actions taken and how everything tied up there.","Michael Neidorff","It goes back to that issue of are they going to approve everything else but when -- it has to be signed, sealed and delivered for revenue recognition purposes. And we anticipate the state understands that would do all they can to do to achieve it but in the interest of candor, you can see something swinging from quarter to quarter but on the full year we expect it will be there.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen that will conclude our question and question session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Michael Neidorff for closing remarks.","Michael Neidorff","Well, I thank you and as I have said \u2013 as I said at the investor day \u201912 is behind us, it was from a growth standpoint and positioning us for \u201913 will prove to be a very good year from that perspective and we are really looking forward to reporting and believe we\u2019re well-positioned for \u201913.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining Centene's fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings call.","During the course of this morning's call, we will review our strong 2014 performance and provide updates on Centene's markets and products, and recent M&A activity.","I will begin with highlights of Centene's 2014 achievement. Our 2014 financial performance was very strong, capped off by the fourth quarter results we reported this morning.","In 2014, we added 1.2 million members surpassing the 4 million mark. We grew revenues by almost 50% to $15.7 billion, and diluted EPS by 55% to $4.45. This compares favorably to our initial 2014 revenue guidance of $13.8 billion, and EPS guidance of $3.65 at the midpoint. Note that these 2014 growth rates exceed Centene's 5-year CAGR of 32% for revenue and 18% for EPS.","Our shareholders benefitted from this strong financial performance, as Centene's stock increased 76% and our return on equity was 18% in 2014.","Our expanding market cap placed us into the mid-cap equity category as evidenced by Centene's inclusion in the S&P 400 MidCap and Russell 1000 indices. We successfully navigated the first year of the key provision of the ACA. Centene selectively participated in Health Insurance Marketplaces in nine states.","Consistent with our forecast, we secured reimbursement for 99% of the health insurer fee in 2014.","We also enhanced our diversification by product and geography, including our initial entry in international markets. Centene continues to create jobs across its enterprise, the number of our employees increased by over 50% to 13,400 in 2014 alone. Over 85% of these employees are outside Centene's headquarters. This is consistent with our local approach.","Next I would turn to market and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity. Louisiana. On February 1, we began our new statewide contract. Under this program, Centene is covering all its members on a full risk basis. We expect to be at the high-end of our prior guidance of 320,000 lives to 350,000 lives and anticipate more than doubling our revenues in Louisiana, approaching a $1 billion annual run rate.","Mississippi. During the fourth quarter, we began providing services under the MississippiCAN program to TANF children. While our initial group of members were enrolled in December, most will be enrolled during the second and third quarter of 2015. Separately, we began operating under a new contract serving CHIP beneficiaries in Mississippi during January, 2015.","Texas. The state will begin carving a nursing home services with STAR+PLUS programs on March 1. This will be in addition to the home and community based services Centene currently provides its STAR+PLUS beneficiaries.","Indiana. In December, Centene was selected by the state to begin contract negotiations to serve ABD Medicaid beneficiaries under Indiana's new Hoosier Care Connect Program. This additional program would serve a total of 84,000 enrollees and will commence in the second quarter.","Last week, Indiana received CMS approval for an alternative Medicaid expansion plan HIP 2.0. This membership ramp will begin in February and continue throughout 2015. We had previously included this in our 2015 guidance.","Arizona. Also in December, our Behavioral Health subsidiary was selected to provide services under an expanded contract for the state's newly formed southern region. Cenpatico Integrated Care, in partnership between Cenpatico and the University of Arizona Health plan, will bring the integrated care model to members in this region. This contract is expected to commence in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Moving into dual-eligible. At the end of December, we had over 16,000 members in Illinois and Ohio dual demonstration program. Passive enrollment in the Medicare coverage began in January for Ohio Medicaid members participating in the state's dual program.","On February, we began our dual demonstration program in South Carolina. While initial membership is modest, we will continue to ramp up over the course of 2015. We are scheduled to begin additional dual contracts in Texas in the first quarter and Michigan in the second quarter of 2015.","Now Health Insurance Marketplace. At December 31, Centene had 75,000 exchange lives. The demographics remain in line with our pricing. The financial performance of our exchange business was slightly ahead of our projections for 2014. We began participating in the Illinois and Wisconsin Health Insurance Marketplace on January 1.","Early enrollment indicate we are tracking to meet our 2015 membership projections across our original nine states and two new states.","Next, Centurion. We continue to successfully expand our correctional health business. On February 1, Centurion commenced its fourth contract providing medical and behavioral services in Vermont.","Switching gears to recent M&A activity. Last week Centene signed a definitive agreement to acquire Agate Resources, which serves 87,000 Medicaid and 3500 Medicare advantage beneficiaries in Oregon. This transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2015 and be accretive in the first 12 months. Our entry into Oregon will mark Centene's 23rd state of operation.","During the fourth quarter, Centene further expanded its reach in international markets. We made a small investment in the UK Health management company, The Practice. This company provides primary care to community-based and utilization management services for the National Health Service.","Next, I'll provide a brief update on flu. Centene's most recent data suggest that the flu season peaked in late December. This is consistent with the CDC's finding. It is, however, too early to draw an absolute conclusion. By example, we still saw flu activity in January. While it will not impact our annual guidance, it could have a mitigating effect on the first quarter.","Our Fluvention program continues to stress flu vaccination and early treatment. Besides from flu, we anticipate stable medical cost trends in 2015.","Now on the Hep C or hepatitis C therapies. Our hepatitis C cost experienced in 2014 was consistent with our expectation. The net cost halved in the fourth quarter increased sequentially. This was expected as new therapies were approved. We remain engaged in constructive discussions with our states to ensure that new treatment are properly managed and are fully reflected in our reimbursements.","A quick comment on rates. The 2014 composite rate adjustment was 1%, slightly better than our expectation. We continue to project a 2015 composite rate adjustment of flat to 1%.","In conclusion, 2014 was a better year of profitable growth and diversification percentage. We expect to maintain positive momentum in 2015 and beyond. Centene continues to benefit from its robust pipeline of growth opportunities, while remaining focused on margin expansion.","Before I turn the call over to Bill, I would like to draw your attention to the two-for-one stock split we announced this morning. This will be distributed February 19; the stock spit enhances liquidity for our shareholders in line with Centene's market cap growth.","Thank you for your interest in Centene. Bill, will now provide further details on our fourth quarter and full year 2014 financial results. Bill?","Bill Scheffel","Thank you, Michel, and good morning. This morning I will cover both our fourth quarter and full year 2014 results. On the top-line for 2014, our Premium and Service revenues totaled $15.7 billion, an increase of 49% over 2013. Our fourth quarter Premium and Service revenues were $4.4 billion, a 54% increase over the fourth quarter of 2013.","And on the bottom-line diluted earnings per share for 2014 was $4.45 per share compared to $2.87 for 2013, representing a 55% increase between years. And for the fourth quarter diluted earnings per share was $1.74 compared to $0.84 last year.","The fourth quarter EPS this year benefited significantly from recording the full year accrual for the revenue from the Texas health insurer fee that we announced on January 2, in a separate Form 8-K.","In more detail our Premium and Service revenue grew by approximately $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year as a result of expansions in a numbers of our states between years. Full quarter revenues from California and New Hampshire, which began operations in Q4 of 2013, Health Insurance Marketplace revenue which was new in 2014, growth in the carrier health business, and revenue from U.S. Medical Management acquired at the beginning of 2014.","In 2014, we benefited from approximately 201,000 members added in Medicaid expansion programs as of December 31. In addition, we experienced membership growth in traditional TANF programs of almost 200,000 members, part of which might be considered as woodwork effect related.","For the full year, we recognized $195 million in health insurer fee revenue which represents 99% of the total reimbursement amount for the year. California is still in the process of providing a binding agreement for the reimbursement of the health insurer fee. And we paid $126 million for the health insurer fee in the third quarter.","Our health benefits ratio was 89.3% in the fourth quarter, compared to 88.1% in last year's fourth quarter, and 89.7% in the third quarter this year. The increase of 120 basis points from last year is primarily the result of the higher level of complex care revenue which carries a higher health benefits ratio along with the higher level of flu cost incurred this year.","Sequentially our health benefits ratio decreased by 40 basis points from the third to the fourth quarter. The decrease reflects favorable amounts recorded in the fourth quarter related to retroactive rate increases and revenue related to performance measures received in several states, offset by the impact of the start of flu season.","For the fourth quarter, 30% of our Premium and Service revenues came from new business compared to 17% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The health benefits ratio for our new business was 89.4% and 89.2% for our existing business in the fourth quarter. The lower HBR in the fourth quarter this year for our new business is primarily the result of favorable year-to-date adjustments recorded in the fourth quarter related to our Florida long-term care business.","Our general and administrative expense ratio was 8.2% in Q4 this year. This compares to 8.9% in last year's fourth quarter, and 8.0% in the third quarter. The 70 basis point decrease year-over-year is a result of additional leverage achieved related to the significant revenue growth. Sequentially, our G&A ratio increased by 20 basis points resulting from additional costs incurred in preparation for new business expansions. Business expansion costs of $0.19 were incurred in the fourth quarter and $0.59 for all of 2014.","Investment and other income was $10 million in the fourth quarter compared to $5 million in the fourth quarter last year, reflecting a higher level of investment balances in our statutory insurance entities.","Interest expense was $10 million in Q4 this year versus $6 million last year. The increase reflects the expense related to the $300 million of senior notes issued in the second quarter of 2014.","Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was 46.4% and 42.9% for all of 2014. The fourth quarter rate is consistent with our third quarter comments and reflects the non-deductible nature of the health insurer fee.","The full year rate includes the benefits of approximately $0.24 per share from the reversal of amounts recorded in prior years related to the IRS rules issued in September.","Diluted earnings per share was $1.74 for the fourth quarter and $4.45 for the year. This compares to $0.84 for the fourth quarter of 2013 and $2.87 for full year 2013.","Our cash and investments totaled $3.1 billion, including $85 million held by unregulated entities at year-end.","Our risk-based capital percentage continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level.","Debt at December 31 was $893 million, including $75 million of borrowings on our revolver. Our debt-to-capital ratio, excluding our non-recourse mortgage note was 32.1% at year-end compared to 32.4% at December 31, 2013.","Our Medical claim liabilities totaled $1.7 billion at year-end and represented 44 days in claims payable.","Our DCP number has been higher this year than normal due to the significant growth in new business. And I expect the DCP number to be more in the 39 to 43 day range in 2015, subject to the new same business impact.","Cash flow from operations was $369 million in the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion for the full year. The full year amount represents 4.6 times net earnings.","Our 2015 guidance numbers are the same as we presented at our Investor Day in December. Premium and Service Revenues $20.3 billion to $20.8 billion; diluted earnings per share of $5.05 to $5.35; our HBR 89.2% to 89.6%; G&A percentage of 8.0% to 8.4%; effective tax rate 48% to 50%; and diluted shares outstanding 61.5 million to 62.0 million shares. We continue to expect to be reimbursed for the health insurer fee on a grossed up basis in 2015, and business expansion costs are estimated to be between $0.45 and $0.50 for 2015.","As noted in our press release the Board declared a two-for-one stock split to be distributed on February 19, to holders of record on February 12. Our Form 10-K which will be filed later this month will present all share and per share information on a split adjusted basis.","With that, operator, you may now open up the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question is from Joshua Raskin of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin","Hi. Thanks. Good morning.","Michael Neidorff","Good morning.","Joshua Raskin","Good morning, Michael. First question just on the retroactive Florida payments. Could you quantify that just so we can get an estimate what the impact was in the fourth quarter?","Bill Scheffel","I don't think I ever gave a specific number. I think we've been working with the State of Florida for some time to try to deal with some of the long-term care rate issues, and we anticipated that we would get that concluded in the fourth quarter in our guidance numbers, and that effect in fact did occur.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. And then, I guess looking at the same store versus the new store MLR, those numbers are actually very similar this quarter, which is little bit surprising in light of the fact that the new membership I would assume is coming in, it's much higher levels of acuity and as you call it, complex care. So my guess is Florida has something to do with that. Is that impacted by the Texas reimbursement as well? I guess I'm just curious as you think about going forward, you guys had a ton of new starts in January, would you expect those MLRs to be similar going forward or would you expect divergence in 2015?","Bill Scheffel","I think that's a good question, Josh. For the fourth quarter, there is no question, for the quarter the new business HBR was much better than we would normally expect it to be because of the Florida retroactive rate increases, which went back for a whole year. So I think that going forward into 2015, we would expect to see a more normal spread between new business and existing business and which we say to be particularly 300 basis points to 500 basis points, so I would expect that to occur going-forward.","Michael Neidorff","And going forward, there will be some impact as the increasing denominator as well. So there will be that to consider.","Joshua Raskin","Okay. Then just lastly, on hep C, with some of the new therapies coming in, I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about formulary management. Are you seeing any discounts from the manufacturers? Are you guys thinking about one drug over the other?","Michael Neidorff","No, we -- we have a -- our distributor of course, the company has exclusive one of the exclusive distributors Acaria, works with all the manufactures, and so we'll take advantage of that based on what our providers are looking for. And this is a good time to remind everybody right now 90%, 90% plus of those costs we have agreements with the state for reimbursement. And so, we work with them on guidelines and we supply some knowledge and information we\u2019ve gleaned from having Acaria as part of us, and we\u2019ll provide that background to states as they develop their guidelines.","Joshua Raskin","That's perfect. Thanks, Michael.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Carter of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Chris Carter","Thanks, good morning. Just on the flu, could you give us any color around how much that impacted the 4Q and then maybe what you are assuming in guidance for the first quarter?","Bill Scheffel","Without giving specific numbers, I think flu in the fourth quarter was at a higher level than we saw in the 2013\/2014 season, and that season was a relatively normal to below normal year for flu. So, we saw a bounce back up particularly in December, and also in January we've seen that through. But we think it's fairly well decreased at this point in time but it could have small impact on Q1 versus other periods. But I think there\u2019s nothing to impact our overall guidance for the year.","Michael Neidorff","I think the key thing is the guidance for the year is intact. But we're anticipating it could mitigate Q1, depending on how it's spiked. Flu often can spike again and that's the kind of the thing we're considering when we look at Q1.","Chris Carter","Okay. And then may be just on that point, I know there's a lot of moving parts this year with the industry fee. I guess how should we be thinking about the EPS progression for 2015, or may be directionally how we should think about 1Q?","Bill Scheffel","I think as we look at that -- the way, if you take the health insurer fee and sort of flatten that out in 2014, I think the relationship of the earnings by quarter and -- by quarter in 2014, will be similar in 2015.","Chris Carter","Got it. Okay. Then just last question. The Oregon acquisition, am I right that that's somewhere in the range of $400 million in annualized revenues?","Michael Neidorff","Jesse?","Jesse Hunter","Yes, that's right. So for 2014, it will be a little bit in excess of $400 million in annual revenues based on a combination of their Medicaid and Medicare government business.","Chris Carter","Okay. And any thoughts on purchase price there?","Jesse Hunter","We didn't disclose anything on purchase price, and we didn't do in the release and so we're not going to change that position.","Michael Neidorff","No, it was always fair to us and to them.","Chris Carter","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Sarah James of Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead.","Michael Ha","Hi. This is Michael Ha talking for Sarah James. Thank you for having us. My question I know you talked about the flu, but how much did the flu actually contribute to the increase in existing business MLR, and was that the only driver for the increase?","Bill Scheffel","In Q4?","Michael Ha","Yes, yes.","Bill Scheffel","It's sort of hard to hear the question.","Michael Neidorff","Yes.","Bill Scheffel","If you could repeat may be.","Michael Ha","Yes, sorry. Let me repeat that. How much did the flu actually contribute to the increase in existing business MLR? And was that the only driver of the increase in Q4?","Bill Scheffel","I think what we said for Q4 was we benefited from certain retroactive rate increases and also performance measure adjustments that we received from some on the states offset by the higher level of flu costs. So I think net it sort of offset each other, but certainly it was there.","Michael Neidorff","We had some transaction cost in there, too, in Q4.","Michael Ha","Okay, thank you. Just one more question. Is there any update you can provide on when the Florida formulary can be changed? Initially it looked like it could be done at the beginning of the year; but comments by the Medicaid Director indicated that they thought a delay was being considered.","Michael Neidorff","Well, our people in Florida continue to work with them on what's the appropriate and effective formulary. Growing that like it's \u2013","Rone Baldwin","It's certainly a topic of ongoing discussion with the state. But there is no specific date that we can point to at this point when there might be a change to managed care plan formularies versus the state formulary. So that's the current situation.","Michael Neidorff","And as we did last year I mean we anticipated and we placed that into our guidance.","Michael Ha","Okay great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Rigg of Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.","Chris Rigg","Hi, good morning. Thanks. Just on premiums for the Medicaid expansion membership, do you guys have any sense for how they are tracking year-to-year? Has there been -- did the states have enough information to adjust rates for 2015 at this point, or is it still too early to tell?","Bill Scheffel","I think that our experience in 2014 was generally very favorable which would indicate that the rates that were originally set for Medicaid expansion business were at the high-end. And so we would expect overtime those rates will be adjusted.","Most of those books have been say of minimum HBR calculations that we have to pay back to the state anything below that and we have several states where that in fact did occur. So I think most of the rate adjustments we see in 2015 will probably just be to true-up to where the regular -- the normal run rates would be and would basically offset what we set up as a payback under the minimum HBR calculations.","Chris Rigg","Okay. And then just with regard to Indiana, the new program there, the new Healthy Indiana -- and this is more of a big-picture question. But what do you guys -- how do you guys think about membership when there's premiums and co-pays? How does that impact utilization in the Medicaid population? And then, do you know if hospitals or sort of other third parties are allowed to pay premiums in the new program? Thanks.","Michael Neidorff","Well, there are two parts to the program, one where there is more cost sharing, one where there is not cost sharing. So it depends a little bit on how the ultimate mix of membership plays out in terms of that. But I think that we don't expect that we're going to see a significant impact on expected utilization one way or the other with respect to how that plays out. So I think that we expect that this pop we have experienced another Medicaid expansion populations around here and we think that that will be a good indicator of what we expect for the Healthy Indiana program as well.","I don't think with respect to third parties paying premiums for members, I don't think that that's something that's really contemplated and I haven't heard of that as being anything that's been put in place. That has not -- that was something that was an issue that came up with respect to exchange enrollment and it's really not played out as a significant factor at all in the exchange market.","Chris Rigg","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from Andy Schenker of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Andy Schenker","Thanks. Good morning. So just may be on the exchange business here, it sounds like you said it's running -- 2014 ended slightly better on performance than you expected. May be if you could talk about how that may be could carry over into your 2015 expectations for that book of business. And then may be just related to that, any updates about growth in that business as it relates to the de minimis rule for taxes? Thanks.","Rone Baldwin","Well, we do expect that with respect to 2015 our performance on exchanges, we priced to be able to achieve our 3% to 5% kind of pricing margins. So we do think that we're going to see that emerge in 2015. We will have some additional scale which will help us spread some of fixed cost that we think is going to improve our margins a little bit versus 2014 in the product line. And we are -- we do feel that we can manage the growth of this product line and we do intend and stay below the de minimis rule with respect to the tax issue.","Andy Schenker","Okay, great. And then just a little one here on the favorable reserve development. Just looking at the roll-forward table, it looks like on the trailing 12-month basis it actually declined about $6 million sequentially. Anything just worth mentioning there or driving that change? Thank you.","Bill Scheffel","I wouldn't say there's anything specific. Those are numbers, 12-month development for the reserves and I think they're pretty healthy in general and $6 million swing is nothing of any consequence.","Andy Schenker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Justin Lake of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Mike Newshel","Hi. This is Mike Newshel in for Justin. You said the potential drag from flu in the first quarter doesn't change your full-year guidance. Is that because the impact is small enough to fit within the original range? Or is there something, some new incremental offsetting factors that weren't in guidance before?","Michael Neidorff","I think we anticipated the flu in our annual guidance and we anticipated that while it was sign of peak in Q4 we still anticipate that we could see another spike in Q1 and which could have an impact but not impact the overall annual guidance as we build that in for the year.","Mike Newshel","So if flu continues to trend down, then you'd -- then it will end up more aligned with your expectations? It wouldn't be a drag in Q1?","Michael Neidorff","Well, as you know, we would still the flu could potentially be what you call a drag where I call anticipated, higher levels it spikes. But it -- what I we can look at it from an annual standpoint and our annual guidance is intact.","Mike Newshel","Got you. And is the specific timing of Indiana's Medicaid expansion in line with what you assumed in guidance? Or given that it launched so quickly on February 1, is there incremental there?","Bill Scheffel","Are you talking about Indiana or --?","Mike Newshel","Yes, Indiana, yes.","Bill Scheffel","That we consider that in our original guidance I think that was the plan and they were able to successfully achieve that as they announced recently.","Mike Newshel","Yes. So the timing is no different from what you assumed?","Bill Scheffel","Correct.","Mike Newshel","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Bo Brandt","Thank you. This is Bo Brandt on for Matt. Just following up on Indiana, can you provide any details on assumptions for market share? Are you assuming that you are going to maintain market share into the Medicaid expansion population?","Rone Baldwin","We're one of three players in the program so that's roughly correct that we would expect roughly the same kind of market share, as we have in the Medicaid program.","Bo Brandt","Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up. Commentary on the Medicaid rate-setting process. Going into 2015 and beyond into 2016, are the rates going to be continued to be separated regarding the rate negotiations? Or will they eventually combine and you'll start looking at more of a composite rate-negotiation process?","Rone Baldwin","Are you speaking about Medicaid expansion versus the other Medicaid rates that's your question.","Bo Brandt","Yes, exactly.","Rone Baldwin","Yes. I mean we don't see any signs at this point that there is a movement towards consolidation across Medicaid expansion and the other rates. The populations and the experience I think people will want to track separately and that's our expectation going forward.","Bill Scheffel","The states are reimbursed differently for that book of business so they have to be kept separate for those calculations.","Bo Brandt","Okay. So that will continue into 2016\/2017?","Rone Baldwin","Yes.","Bill Scheffel","Generally, so.","Bo Brandt","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Dave Styblo","Sure, thanks. It's Dave Styblo in for Dave Windley. First question was just coming back to the MLRs. Just to make sure I understand all the comments called here, the MLR was close, at the higher end of your guidance range. I heard you say there was an impact of higher flu, and then there's an offsetting factor from rate increase adjustments. Can you reconcile those two a little bit with a finer-tooth pencil there?","Bill Scheffel","Well, I think with respect to the fourth quarter, which I think is what you were referring to, our HBR was 89.3%. And I think when you look at that we benefitted in the fourth quarter from some retroactive rate increases and performance measures that were recognized in several of our states but it was mitigated somewhat by higher flu cost in the fourth quarter. So overall, I don't think the HBR was that far out of our range where our expectations were because those two things offset each other.","Dave Styblo","Okay. So the net, though, we're just pushing a little bit towards the higher end of your previous full-year guidance range, so --?","Bill Scheffel","Yes. Again, directionally we talked about the complex care revenue and the growth of that part of our business which has a higher health benefits ratio to begin with and certainly you see that over time increasing our consolidated HBR, which is as predicted, and as talked on our Investor Day is a combination of having a higher HBR but a lower G&A ratio.","Dave Styblo","Okay, that's helpful. And then looking forward on a couple of new businesses coming online, for your acquisition of Agate there, can you talk a little bit more about the rationale? I don't think there is an RFP in the pipeline and expansion has already happened, so is it more of a situation of you improving upon an asset or just trying to expand your geographic scope? And then similarly, on the Arizona contract win, is there any new networks that you're going to have to work through? Or just walk us through the preparation in anticipation of -- I think that's something like $500 million to $600 million of revenue coming online.","Michael Neidorff","Jesse.","Jesse Hunter","We'll talk about that. Thanks for the question. We'll talk about Oregon first. I think first of all, we're not generally in the business of buying in the turnaround situation so that continues to be the case here. Agate is a well performing business and it really is about giving both geographic expansion but it's a large Medicaid market but it's fragmented and it's got a unique model. So when we do or kind of tours, if you will around the country, the Oregon model is something that comes up all the time. And so participating directly in that model will give us some unique credibility to speak to what makes sense and what doesn't make sense in terms of best practices or the best fit with Medicaid programs for other states and other products around the country.","So on Arizona, we have been in the behavioral health of the Reeboks in Arizona for a number of years. So you will call it 10 years. And so we have got a lot of experience there. The State has kind or re-architected that program in a couple of ways. One is geographically into the different regions and we've obviously been successful in the southern region, but also in terms of the program design integrating some of the physical health coverage into the program. So the changes that we're working on, there is some geographic expansion opportunity and we will be working with as we indicated our joint venture partner with the University of Arizona and we will also be working to expand services to integrate the physical and behavioral health for the people who need it most.","Bill Scheffel","Yes. And the other thing I would add is incrementally we have about $250 million of behavioral health business already in Arizona. So it would be the $300 plus or minus million increase starting in the fourth quarter.","Dave Styblo","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Scott Fidel of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Shawn Bevec","Hi, thanks. This is Shawn Bevec on for Scott. Do your state agreements to cover the industry fee carry over into 2015? Or is this a process that will need to be repeated for this year?","Bill Scheffel","We believe that all of our state agreements are -- we have covered 2015 also.","Shawn Bevec","So the revenue recognition should be more linear in 2015 as opposed being as lumpy as it was in 2014?","Bill Scheffel","Correct. The only thing we have outstanding at this point still is California.","Shawn Bevec","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Steve Baxter","Hi. This is Steve Baxter on for Kevin. I have a question about operating cash flow. For the full year it was 4.6 times net earnings; historically, it hasn't been anywhere near as high. So I guess, can you provide a little color on why it was so high this year, and what you think a more sustainable ratio is going forward?","Bill Scheffel","I think that the biggest impact this year is increase in our just general business to revenue. So we have a large increase in our medical claims payable amount and some of the other payables that were associated with the minimum HBR that we have to pay back as return premium so that was the growth really drove that as much as anything else.","I think over a long haul, we don't really expect to be at the 4.6 times net earnings level. We said 1.5 times to 2 times is our target but actually we've been beating that for the last several years. And I think a lot of that has to do with the growth. So we have a heavy growth year, we'll probably be in excess of two. And if we had 15% growth, it might be 1.5 times to 2 times but we haven't seen 15% growth in a long time.","Steve Baxter","Okay, thanks. Then just another question on USMM. When you guys were joined through the deal you talked about it being $0.20 to $0.25 accretive in 2015. I guess, how is that tracking versus your expectations?","Bill Scheffel","I think that the objective in buying USMM to direct those activity there are Medicate businesses in process. And we expect within 2015 they will perform as we anticipated, basically when we went through our analysis on buying the company and how it would perform.","Steve Baxter","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana Gupte","Yes, thanks. Good morning. First question, I was just curious on the G&A guidance for 2015. You did see about a 70 bp year-over-year improvement with the OpEx leverage, and I get that you had the business expansion costs. But is there any conservatism there, or something unique about 2015 that you might not see that with the kind of revenue growth you are projecting?","Bill Scheffel","I think we continue to see that we'll have the benefits of leverage from the revenue growth there. Two things that went the other direction were obviously the acquisition of USMM, which has a higher G&A ratio because it -- does not help benefits ratio. And then also from the impact of the exchange business which has a higher G&A ratio. So those two items increased our G&A ratio versus the benefits of scale and leveraging and as we go forward into 2015, I would think that we'll have growth in the other -- in all of those areas so we expect to still see benefits but they just may not be as significant.","Michael Neidorff","I mean the higher acuity populations we've said before also impacts the G&A.","Ana Gupte","Got it. Got it. Okay. So there is not as much upside --","Bill Scheffel","Well there is a floor at some point too, yes.","Michael Neidorff","Pardon me.","Ana Gupte","So should one interpret this as there is upside but not as much expansion or improvement as 2014?","Michael Neidorff","No, the denominator keeps getting larger so that's going to impact it.","Bill Scheffel","Right, yes, they have a 70 basis point improvement is a little more difficult going forward because there is a minimum level you'll still have.","Ana Gupte","And on Agate, just follow up on someone else's question earlier. Was this opportunistic that there was Medicare Advantage in there? Or is there something in there around the potential ability of a plan that MA and Medicaid to have better dual margins?","Michael Neidorff","Well, we have probably expressed our interest in MA. So the fact that they had MA was a positive and that is something we continue to look at it and find the appropriate entry point.","Ana Gupte","Okay. So this end will may be more targeted from a geographic perspective and you look -- does that seem to have been your strategy? Not turnaround assets, more local within the state, private?","Michael Neidorff","Exactly.","Ana Gupte","Okay. Got it. Then finally, are there any update on the Georgia rebid? The ABD population does not look to have been included there. I was just wondering what you think might happen on the existing contract as far as the bidders that have been qualified. Will there be one or two? And how will that transition occur? And then any timing on ABD?","Michael Neidorff","Well, it was supposed to have been out and they have delayed it. And I'd rather not speculate what their plans are and how they're going about it, regardless of what they do we'll be ready for it.","Ana Gupte","Okay, all right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Wright of Sterne Agee. Please go ahead.","Brian Wright","Thanks. Good morning. In the press release announcing the Agate acquisition, it seemed to indicate there were some other businesses that weren't Medicaid and Medicare. Just wanted to understand if there was anything of significant size in that, and exactly what those other businesses may be.","Jesse Hunter","Yes, Brian, it's Jesse. I think our target is really a holding company for a couple of different pieces and I'd say that for purposes of kind of the analysis and the go-forward really we're thinking about this as primarily a health plan opportunity. There are a couple of other pieces that are more kind of historical in nature than perspective in nature. So former kind of IPAs tied into the provider community and the like. But most of the go-forward opportunity is going to be centered around their government health plan business.","Brian Wright","And then could you just give us a -- how was the transaction structured? How is that going to be financed?","Bill Scheffel","I think we expect it to be closed in the third quarter. And we're looking at specifically how we want to finance those payments.","Michael Neidorff","We have debt capacity, as we decide to use it.","Bill Scheffel","Yes, that's right. We have $75 million drawn on our revolver at year-end on our $500 million line so. We have flexibility.","Brian Wright","So it's solely debt and nothing -- no stock on to the Agate shareholders, then?","Bill Scheffel","I think that's some we will continue to look at and determine over the next six months before we close how we optimize the consideration.","Brian Wright","Okay, okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Carroll of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Tom Carroll","Hey, good morning. Just a quick question on seasonality. With all the new growth that you've had in chronic population, duals, and the like, the adjustment to taxes, et cetera. I wonder if -- how would you expect quarterly EPS to progress in 2015? Should we expect any changes? May be you could provide some details in terms of how much is coming in first half, back half, or whatever, however you'd like to characterize it. Thanks.","Bill Scheffel","Sure, Tom. I think the basic, what I would do is take 2014 actual adjust it for the health insurer fee and normalize that. Once you do that that percentage of our earnings in each quarter in 2014 is an amount that I would think would be reasonable to look at it for 2015.","Michael Neidorff","It's a good starting template.","Tom Carroll","Okay. And so nothing -- I just wonder if there is any saying in future quarters that you've kind of already on your radar screen right now that just could help us build out the year?","Bill Scheffel","Again normally what we would see is more rate increases in the second half of the year. So we get some lift in the second half versus say the first half. You have flu in the first quarter, which you really don't have again until a little bit in the fourth quarter, which we did see this past year. So the second and third quarter benefit from better seasonality in that regard. So I don't think there's anything new that I would throw in a mix for the quarterly calculations.","Michael Neidorff","I mean it's fair to say when we constantly are looking at things and as soon as something is consummated we'd announce it and what the impact is. And it's not to say we're not looking at things but nothing in yet we have announced that should be included in the quarters.","Tom Carroll","Great, thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Michael Neidorff","Well, if there is no further questions, we thank everybody for participating in this call and look forward to talking you in April and reviewing the first quarter. Thank you.","Operator","The conference is now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect."],"4220":["Centene Corp.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our Chairman and CEO, Michael Neidorff. Michael?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Thank you, Ed. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining Centene's fourth quarter and full year 2016 earnings call. During the course of this morning's call, we will discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2016 financial results and provide updates on Centene's markets and products. Additionally, we will bring you up to date on the Health Net integration and discuss the changing healthcare regulatory landscape.","Let me begin with fourth quarter and full year 2016 financials. We were pleased to conclude the year with a strong fourth quarter, marked by solid top and bottom line growth. Membership at quarter end was 11.4 million recipients, representing an increase of 6.3 million beneficiaries over the fourth quarter of 2015.","Fourth quarter results increased 89% year-over-year at the revenue level to $11.9 billion. 2016 revenues grew 78% year-over-year to $40.6 billion, ahead of our guided range. The revenue increases were primarily attributable to the Health Net acquisition.","The fourth quarter HBR improved 320 basis points year-over-year and 220 basis points sequentially to 84.8%. The 2016 HBR improved 240 basis points year-over-year to 86.5%. These improvements were primarily related to the product mix shift from the addition of Health Net and a California minimum MLR change.","We reported adjusted fourth quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.19 compared to $0.97 in the same prior period of last year, representing growth of 23%. Adjusted 2016 diluted earnings per share were $4.43 compared to $3.14 reported in 2015, representing an increase of 41%. Lastly, 2016 operating cash flows came in very strong at $1.9 billion or 3.3 times net earnings. Please note, there are several moving parts related to the adjusted numbers, including the California minimum MLR change I just mentioned. Jeff will provide further details on these during his prepared remarks.","A quick comment on medical costs including flu. The latest data indicate the flu season is peaking higher and earlier than last year's season. Please note last year's flu season was more moderate than usual. Importantly, we continue to see as well as anticipate overall stable medical cost trends consistent with our expectations in the low single digits.","Next, the Health Net integration. 2016 was a transitional year and period for Centene as we began integrating Health Net into our enterprise. Health Net, which is now our California plan, is fully integrated from a cultural, leadership, human resource, and financial systems standpoint. The operational systems are on track to be fully converted within our anticipated timeframe, and we continue to expect to reach or exceed our synergy targets. We are confident all of the components of the PDR booked in the second quarter of 2016 have been successfully resolved and did not record any PDRs in the fourth quarter of 2016 for 2017.","We are already seeing improvements in the operating performances of the markets and products in 2017, the most significant being the California PPO product, which was the largest component of the PDR. We are monitoring changes to the PPO membership and are finding the benefit design changes, price increases, and network enhancements, which became effective in 2017, have created a more balanced book of business. In addition, we have made equally significant progress in addressing the substance abuse issues related to this product in 2017. We anticipate the California PPO product will be at least breakeven in 2017, in line with our expectations.","I would now like to make a few comments on the changing healthcare regulatory landscape. In the healthcare industry, especially the government services sector, change is nothing new. What remains constant though is the need for high quality, affordable healthcare. This is regardless of what party is in office or the status of the economy. Centene has over three decades of experience spanning five presidents from both sides of aisle.","During this time, we have proven our ability to provide high quality, cost effective healthcare to state beneficiaries while saving states money and delivering strong returns to our shareholders. In addition, we have demonstrated our agility as well as our capacity and capability to successfully navigate industry changes. This is evidenced by our success with the ACA while others have struggled. You will recall, we maintained a business as usual approaches when it came to exchanges.","Early indications suggest, if the ACA is completely repealed and replaced, the process may take several years and include a transition plan designed to minimize if any disruption to states or subsidized populations. As an example of this, the new administration recently submitted a proposed rule to the OMB aimed at stabilizing the exchanges.","Currently, there are no specific agenda regarding the administration's approach to Medicaid. We believe it is likely they will give additional flexibility to states for managing this population, which aligns nicely with Centene's local approach to healthcare. In addition, the administration has to determine its plan for dealing with those states that have expanded Medicaid versus those that have not.","In the meantime, we are taking our business as usual approach from an execution standpoint. We believe we can work on any basis, whether it is block grants or per capita caps. I will note that per capita caps is a fair approach for states that have a growing Medicaid population.","Centene provides healthcare services to the largest number of Medicaid recipients. We have an experienced team on hand and are confident our scale, systems, and expertise will allow us to be ready as the new healthcare agenda unfolds.","Moving on to markets and product updates. First, we will discuss recent Medicaid activity, Nebraska. In January 2017, we commenced operations under Nebraska's new Heritage Health program covering TANF, CHIP, ABD, Foster Care and Long Term Care beneficiaries. Results are currently trending in line with expectations and we anticipate serving between 75,000 and 80,000 members under this contract. Indiana, also in January 2017, we began a new contract serving beneficiaries enrolled in Indiana's Hoosier Healthwise, and Healthy Indiana Plans. These contracts represent a re-procurement. In a state, Centene has been successfully operating into over 20 years.","North Carolina. In September 2015, North Carolina's General Assembly passed reform legislation to privatize the state's Medicaid program. At a proactive approach, Centene signed an agreement last month with the North Carolina Medical Society to collaborate on a statewide member focused approach to Medicaid managed care.","As part of this agreement, a joint venture known as Carolina Complete Health was formed. This JV was established, organized and operate a physician-led health plan to provide Medicaid managed care services in the state. A key feature of the JV will be the active participation of physicians in the ownership and governance of the health plan. Centene will manage the financial and daily operations.","Carolina Complete Health will seek to participate in the privatization process as a bidder for a likely North Carolina Medicaid RFP in the near future. This joint venture serves as another example of Centene's ability to provide innovative solutions to meet local market needs. Pennsylvania, last month Centene was selected to serve Medicaid recipients enrolled in the state's HealthChoices program in three zones.","I would like to remind you this award was in response to a reissue of the state's initial RFP and we're pleased to have retained the three zones first awarded to Centene in April of 2016. Implementation is well underway and we will be ready to hit the ground running on the anticipated start date of June 1, 2017. Georgia, in November of 2016, Centene was awarded a statewide contract to continue serving Medicaid members in Georgia. Under the new contract, Centene will be one of four plans providing medical, behavioral, dental and vision health benefits to the state's Medicaid beneficiaries.","Centene has been providing healthcare services to Georgia's Medicaid recipients for over a decade, and we look forward to continuing our partnership with the state. The new contract is expected to begin on July 1 of 2017. Nevada, also in November of 2016, Centene was selected to serve Medicaid recipients in two counties in Nevada. This contract is expected to be in on July 1 of 2107, and we anticipate membership of 35,000 to 50,000.","In addition, we expect to offer a Health Insurance Marketplace product in these two counties beginning in 2018. Nevada marks Centene's 29th state of operation.","Next, Medicare. At year-end, we served over 334,000 Medicare beneficiaries. On January 1, we began offering Medicare Advantage plans in four new states, Texas, Georgia, Mississippi and Florida under our four-star parent rating.","We are applying a test-and-learn approach to our first year of MA operations, similar to Centene's initial launch of our exchange product in 2014. Also, similar to our exchange approach, we will be focused on providing high-quality, affordable MA products to low income beneficiaries.","We do not anticipate meaningful MA membership in these four new markets in 2017. We will be applying the insights we gained this year with respect to network, plan design and benefits to Centene's 2018 MA plans. Overall, we expect our Medicare Advantage business to be profitable in 2017.","Now, health insurance marketplace. 2016 marked another year of Centene's successful operating on the exchanges. At December 31, we served roughly 540,000 exchange members, in line with our expectations. Over 90% of these members were subsidy eligible.","In 2017, open enrollment period included last week and we have just over 1 million paid members. The key demographics of these members including age, gender, financial assistance and metal tier are consistent with our experience over the past three years. Over 90% are subsidy eligible and almost 90% enrolled in silver tier plans. This includes those members enrolled in Maricopa County, Arizona, which Centene is a sole exchange provider.","In addition, over 90% of our total paid enrollees are a combination of members renewing their Ambetter plans and shoppers who are new to the exchanges. This is important for two reasons. We have historical data on our renewing members including medical history and utilization patterns, and the new shoppers are actively selecting our Ambetter exchange products based on price network and benefit design. This is the same purchase criteria reflected in our risk pool since we began offering exchange products in 2014.","We are closely monitoring emerging claims experience specifically membership profile and claims utilization pattern. Thus far in 2017, we have seen no evidence of unanticipated utilization levels. As it is early in the year, we feel it is prudent to include the extra level of conservatism in our 2017 guidance related to this business to allow for uncertainty regarding membership behavior post election. We continue to expect our marketplace offering to be profitable this year.","Lastly, Federal Services. The 2017 TRICARE contract appeal process was completed in November, and we were pleased to have sustained our West Region award. This represents return to Health Net's region when the TRICARE program was initially launched in 1988 and aligns nicely with Centene's growing business in the western U.S. This new contract is expected to commence on October 1, 2017.","Separately, our current VA Choice contract runs through the summer of 2017. We are actively reviewing the Community Choice Network RFP that was released in late 2016, and we remain committed to providing high quality services to our nation's veterans.","Shifting gears to our rate outlook. For 2016, our composite Medicaid rate adjustment was an increase of approximately 1%. We continue to expect the 2017 composite Medicaid rate adjustment of 0% to 1%, consistent with the past few years. Separately, CMS issued the 2018 advanced notice last week and preliminary Medicare Advantage rates appear to be in line with our expectations.","In summary, 2016 was another successful year for Centene. We are now realizing the full benefits of the Health Net acquisition, particularly those products due to Centene, which will drive further growth and greater scale in 2017 and beyond.","Over time, we believe the critical mass achieved with the addition of Health Net will prove to be invaluable.","We remain committed to long-term margin expansion and continue to make the necessary investments in systems and infrastructure to successfully execute our strategy. We are optimistic about our ability to extend Centene's leadership position in government sponsored healthcare.","Thank you for your interest in Centene. Jeff will now provide further details on our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 financial results.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Thank you, Michael, and good morning. Earlier today, we've reported our fourth quarter and full-year 2016 results. For the full year, total revenues were $40.6 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share were $4.43. The increase in the top and bottom lines compared to 2015 was the result of the acquisition of Health Net, growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business and the full year effect of product and market expansions in 2015 and 2016.","Membership grew to 11.4 million members, an increase of 124% between years. For the fourth quarter, total revenues were $11.9 billion, an increase of 89% over Q4 of 2015, and diluted earnings per share were $1.45, compared to $0.91 last year and adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.19, compared to $0.97 last year.","As highlighted in our press release issued this morning, adjusted diluted EPS for the fourth quarter and full year excludes the following items: the acquisition costs associated with the Health Net transaction, amortization of acquired intangible assets, the favorable pre-tax effect of $195 million of additional revenue associated with the retroactive contract amendment received in the fourth quarter that changed the minimum MLR calculation under California's Medicaid expansion program.","This amount relates to periods prior to the acquisition date for legacy Health Net business, and periods prior to 2016 for the legacy Centene business. A charitable contribution to the company's foundation of $50 million in connection with the additional revenue from a change in the California minimum MLR previously noted, and debt extinguishment costs of $11 million, associated with the early redemption of the Centene and Health Net senior notes that were scheduled to mature in the first half of 2017.","Additionally, the fourth quarter and full year results also include a net benefit of $0.03 and $0.05 per diluted share, respectively, due to the early adoption of the stock-based compensation accounting standard and the incorporation of retirement provisions in our stock-based compensation agreements.","In more detail, total revenues grew by $5.6 billion in the fourth quarter year-over-year, primarily as a result of the Health Net acquisition, which closed on March 24, 2016, the start-up of the Texas STAR Kids program in November 2016, the July start-up of the Louisiana Medicaid expansion business, and growth in the Health Insurance Marketplace business. Sequentially, total revenues grew by $1.1 billion from the third quarter of 2016, driven by the $195 million of additional revenue associated with the change in California minimum MLR definition, and $500 million of additional revenue received in the fourth quarter associated with pass through payments from the State of California that were recorded in premium tax revenue and premium tax expense.","Moving on to the HBR. Our health benefits ratio was 84.8% in the fourth quarter this year, compared to 88% in last year's fourth quarter and 87% in the third quarter. The 320 basis point decrease in the fourth quarter year-over-year is a result of the higher mix of commercial business associated with the Health Net acquisition and the effect of the retroactive revenue recorded in California associated with the change in the minimum MLR definition. Sequentially, the variance is driven by the California minimum MLR change, which decreased the fourth quarter HBR by 170 basis points.","Our selling, general and administrative expense ratio was 9.9% in Q4 this year, excluding the Health Net merger costs compared to 8.6% last year and 9.1% in the third quarter, also excluding Health Net merger costs. The increase in the ratio as compared to the prior year is primarily due to several items.","First, the acquisition of Health Net, which operates at a higher SG&A ratio due to the higher mix of commercial and Medicare business. Second, the fourth quarter of 2016 includes a higher level of seasonal costs related to the open enrollment period for the Health Insurance Marketplace business due to the expected growth in 2017. And third, the fourth quarter of 2016 includes the $50 million charitable contribution to our foundation as a result of the additional revenue recorded related to the California minimum MLR change. The charitable contribution increased our SG&A ratio in the fourth quarter by approximately 50 basis points. The increase sequentially is a result of the higher enrollment costs on the Health Insurance Marketplace and the charitable contribution previously mentioned.","Excluding Health Net merger costs, business expansion costs of $0.11 were incurred in the fourth quarter and $0.25 for all of 2016. Investment and other income was $34 million in the fourth quarter compared to $8 million last year and $33 million in the third quarter. Interest expense was $217 million this year compared to $43 million last year.","Sequentially, interest expense increased from $57 million in the third quarter to $75 million in the fourth quarter. The increase year-over-year is primarily due to the financing associated with the Health Net transaction. Sequentially, the increase is due to the early redemption of the Centene and legacy Health Net senior notes that were scheduled to mature in the middle of 2017. This increased interest expense by $11 million pre-tax for the fourth quarter and full year.","Our effective income tax rate was 47.3% in the fourth quarter of 2016. The lower than projected tax rate in the fourth quarter is due to the additional earnings associated with the revised minimum MLR definition in California and the stock-based compensation adoption. The increased earnings and lower tax rate associated with the California minimum MLR definition lowered our effective tax.","For the full year 2016, our effective tax rate was 51.8% compared to 48.6% in the prior year. The increase in our effective tax rate year-over-year is due to the acquisition of Health Net, partially offset by the California minimum MLR change and the adoption of the new stock-based compensation standard previously discussed. The California minimum MLR change and the stock-based compensation adoption decreased our effective tax rate for the full year by over 400 basis points.","Before I get into details regarding the balance sheet, first, let me provide an update on the fair valuation exercise associated with the Health Net acquisition. During the fourth quarter, we finalized the fair valuation associated with the transaction including our fair valuation estimates of intangible assets and substance abuse treatment center costs. Total intangible assets have been revised to $1.530 billion amortized over a weighted useful life of 12 years.","In addition, we finalized the liability associated with the substance abuse treatment center cost and increased our estimated liability by approximately $30 million during the fourth quarter. This adjustment primarily relates to periods prior to the acquisition date and did not go through earnings. As of December 31, 2016, we maintained appropriately $125 million in medical claims liability associated with the substance abuse treatment center costs primarily related to periods prior to the acquisition date.","Now on to the balance sheet. Cash and investments totaled almost $9.1 billion at year-end, including $264 million held by unregulated subsidiaries. Our risk-based capital percentage for NAIC filers continues to be in excess of 350% of the authorized control level. Debt on December 31 was $4.7 billion, including $100 million of borrowings on our revolving credit facility.","Our debt to capital ratio was 43.7% excluding our non-recourse mortgage note, compared to 34.7% at last year-end. We have reduced our debt to capital ratio by approximately 60 basis points since the Health Net acquisition.","Our medical claims liability totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, and represents 42 days in claims payable compared to 41 days last quarter. Cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter and $1.9 billion for the full year. Operating cash flows for the fourth quarter and full year were impacted by the finalization of the opening balance sheet associated with the Health Net transaction. As a result, operating cash flows benefited by approximately $445 million in the fourth quarter.","Now, for 2017 guidance. Our total revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance remains unchanged from our December Investor Day. We have adjusted our GAAP diluted earnings per share guidance to reflect the finalization of the purchase price allocation with respect to intangible assets. This increased our GAAP diluted earnings per share by $0.04 on the bottom and top end of the ranges. The updated amounts are reflected in the revised guidance included in our press release today.","Additionally, as previously stated at our December Investor Day, we took numerous actions in 2016 to resolve the issues associated with the products that were included in the PDR. As a result, we did not record any premium deficiency reserves in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to 2017. Overall, 2016 was a transformative year and we are pleased with the operating momentum heading into 2017.","That concludes my remarks, and operator, you may now open the line for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Sarah James of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you. I wanted to follow up on some comments you made for 2017 guidance. So initially, you had talked about flu peaking earlier and maybe a little higher, so how does that compare to what you have in guidance? And then, it sounded like you said that you built in some conservatism on health insurance exchange expectations to 2017. So, if you could help us understand what that means.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Sure.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Seems I might have some question there.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I'd be happy to. Yeah. I'll start off and Jeff and others can add to it. There's been reports out on the flu, so I wanted to ensure that you all understood we've been tracking it. Last year was a very low base, so it's higher than last year. It is peaking earlier. It's all contained within the guidance that we've given you. And so, it's not a surprise. I was only really trying to just clarify it to avoid any confusion later, Sarah.","As it relates to the second part of your question, we took an approach of being conservative in looking at the exchanges and the costs. Why? Because everybody was doing it anyway and we said, let's just build it in to people who are comfortable that we've done, it's that the, we could still achieve our range that we originally talked about the high end. And it's just being extremely conservative. It's still a great year with lot of upside, and we said everybody is so concerned about this now.","As I said, early indications and it's one month, so it's \u2013 but it's importantly \u2013 you look at the demographics of the population that is very consistent with what we've had success within the past. So, it was just the case of saying, let's be conservative. It's much better to meet and beat than later on saying that it didn't quite come out as we expect. So it's just the comfort zone, I think for investors and ourselves.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Got it. And other aspects of your health insurance product maybe either in the benefit design or in the provider contracts such as risk sharing, that give you comfort around markets like Arizona on the health insurance exchange and being able to control costs in advance where you're just the only one or one of two?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Right. So I think, first of all, in Arizona, there were two issues going back. We had the Health Net PPO product which went away December 31. We then went back in and we entered with our design product that we have used everywhere and contrary to what people think, I mean, in the insurance business an ideal world is where you do a carry or replace. It ensures you get the full balanced book of business and that's something we've learned a long time ago.","So as it relates to Arizona and going in by example in any of the new markets, we've used our same design \u2013 product design, we've used our same network approach to it and we've been very consistent. And when we took that any experience we had in Arizona through the old business and look at it through our lens, it said, it should perform consistent with our expectations of any of our businesses. And 90% plus of it is in the silver tiers we said, which is the area we have the most success and with the subsidized members. So it's very consistent.","Sarah E. James - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Newshel of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Can you quantify?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning. Can you quantify any benefit from the California minimum MLR adjustment that was related to the first three quarters of 2016 that may have been included in the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yes. So, just a quick thing on that. If you recall the minimum MLR in California actually ended on July 1, actually June 30. So, the minimum MLR rebate provisions, I think, they began in January 2014 and then went all the way up through June 30 of 2016. And in the third quarter, we had mentioned that we had roughly $0.09, I think in the guidance for the full year which really represented the current year effect for our California Health & Wellness plan, and then subsequent to the acquisition date for the Health Net plan. So, in total, it was around 200 \u2013 a little over $220 million of benefit for us for the full year, so that's little over $25 million of its effectively in the adjusted diluted earnings per share number, pre-tax.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","We recognize only that portion in the areas affected at or impacted...","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","In 2016.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","2016.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Right. And just one more clarification on the revenue guidance given that it was unchanged. Can you just clarify whether that includes the Pennsylvania HealthChoices contract win?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Yeah. Obviously, we have \u2013 it does and obviously we have an $800 million range on that, so it's early in the year contracts start dates, et cetera, et cetera. We just thought it prudent to just keep the same guidance range with $800 million spread we have on the range.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Got it. And can you give us a any view on like what the sort of full annualized run rate of revenue would be in that contract? Do you have any visibility from state and how they are going to allocate lives?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","No. We do not have visibility at this time. I can give you a range of membership. I'd say we're looking at maybe 75,000 to 100,000 members, so hopefully that's helpful, but more to come obviously when the state finalizes its allocation methodology.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And it's still a period when always period was taking place, you are not really having discussions about it, so.","Michael Newshel - Evercore Group LLC","Yeah, understood. All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Raskin of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Michael, just wanted to follow-up on the North Carolina JV that you guys created. I certainly understand with the potential RFP coming out, why you guys would be so active early here. But could you just walk us through the economics? Is that kind of look any different than your typical awards? I know you said that the physicians have some ownership stake in it as well. So, is there some sort of non-controlling interest that you guys have to disburse distributor, how does that work?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","So, it's going to be \u2013 it's an 80\/20 joint venture with us having the 80. It's certainly \u2013 typically we've done in other markets very successfully. We work with the physicians on the medical policies and practices. The financial side of things we manage. And it will \u2013 in the end, ensure their involvement on how medicine is practiced, which is something we've always subscribed to in all markets. So there's no change there. But, yes, we think it's particularly important with the state that as large as that and as new as it is to really I've called it out and we want to doctors understanding that they will have every opportunity to view the medical policies and practices. And then \u2013 but from a financial standpoint, we will be managing that for.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Is there an exclusivity with the providers or I assume they'll be able to participate with other plans when the RFP is live.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, I think history has shown true if they wish to provide with others, that's fine. But doctors tend to prefer or like the brands that that involve with. So we'll wait and see how that unfolds.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That makes sense. And then just lastly on the health insurance in the marketplace, you mentioned 90%, I think, were sort of known. The other, call it, 100,000 or so lives that came from other plans, do you have color on the demographics for those individuals at all? Did they come from plans that exited or did you just take share from plans that remained? Is there any color on that 100,000?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think we have some of it. Jesse, you want add to it, you have the more detail?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah, Josh. This is Jesse. So, we have some visibility on those. Obviously, we don't get into the specificity of which carrier in terms of exits and the like. And I think when we look at the pieces here, the most relevant data point is what Michael mentioned before that in aggregate, our key demographics, subsidy levels, metal tier, age, gender, up and down the line are almost entirely in line with our prior experience.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. And that's inclusive of that extra hundred?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","That includes \u2013 that represents 100% of the members that we have for 2017.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","We did not see anything so far that says, we're getting \u2013 we attracted any different members that we typically have, and other people in the room here are shaking their head yes.","Joshua Raskin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","The next question comes A.J. Rice of UBS. Please go ahead.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Hi, everybody.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Hi.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","First of all, let me ask you about the Health Net synergies. I know you guys said you're generally tracking your expectations and presumably a lot of what you'll realize in 2017 is the result of actions already taken into 2016. I wonder when you think about 2017 and actions still to be done to capture more synergies. What's still left to be done with respect to Health Net integration and so forth?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, we're still working through the operational systems, the claims payment, some of the medical management things being put in place. And Mark Brooks is doing an outstanding job for us in that area and working through very methodically. Some of them will be bringing back from offshore, some of the claims payment. That something is nothing to do with the current political environment.","We announced that we will be doing that with the acquisition almost two years ago now. So that's consistent with our approach. So, those kinds of things and actually when we look at it, we're more efficient in our automated claims payment here in the U.S. and when it is offshore. So, we see all those things still to come to bear. But I keep encouraging and I think the senior management encourage everybody that's involved with the execution, it's not how fast, it's how well, it's on target.","I think what was important to us and what I highlighted before, the things that have been integrated, the cultural thing, the HR, the general ledger where we're moving the IBNR system to ours running parallel in the first quarter, and then we'll be putting in our system, those kinds of things. It's really work the way one would expect it to and then some, and I'll gratuitously take advantage of your questions rolling one other thing. It gives us a great deal of confidence in our ability to take on a fairly large acquisition, one that was not simple and had some issues and integrated effectively, and so it's all worked on schedule.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","That's great. And let me just ask on \u2013 some of the other companies are talking about how they're going to think about 2018 for the health insurance exchanges, given the moving parts in Washington, you're in the unique position, if you're still actually making money on the exchanges, a lot of the others are not. Any early thoughts about 2018 and the changing landscape, and how you're going to think about exchange participation, I know you've got to start thinking about it in the spring pretty seriously?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I had \u2013 we had our board meeting yesterday. And as you know, we have a couple of very knowledgeable board members. In our discussions, everybody is of one mind, you maintain business as usual and as I try to say in my prepared remarks, this is a population that I think everybody is going to work very hard to minimize the transition, the impact on the states and on the recipients.","And our approach is going to be what it was this past year, continue to move ahead very effectively and \u2013 I'll go back and say that in 2008 when President Obama was elected, there were lot of concerns of what was going to happen? We said, business as usual. And we're just going to adapt to where it has to be and we're just going to continue down on 2018. We'll have this current exchange program or wherever we move to and we're comfortable we have the capability just to continue to do it. I'm not backing off at all in other words.","A.J. Rice - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from Gary Taylor of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a couple of questions. First on the donation to the California Foundation, I presume that's just part of your corporate responsibility commitment to the state of California and there wasn't any contractual obligation to do that.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. That's actually not. It's just to the Centene Foundation. That's not specific to California.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah, we've done this in the past. I think if you go back last year, anytime we usually have these kind of one-time benefits, we usually do some of the charitable contribution to our foundation.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","We don't expect much credit for one-time gains and so that's an opportunity to build up a foundation that over time will help to ensure our ability to the earnings up. We're not there yet to maintain our commitment to all our communities across the country.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. And then my second one was just, of the roughly 1 million exchange enrollment, would you be willing to give us the total for California and Arizona at this point?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","We said Arizona just to about 100,000, and I don't know that we've specified in California.","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think the way to I think \u2013 yeah, excuse me, Gary. The way to think about kind of those two markets on the legacy Health Net side as we \u2013 Michael touched on Maricopa previously. So we have 100% of that market. It was directionally 100,000 members last year, so that's consistent with what we're seeing for 2017. And then on the California front, I'd say pretty \u2013 it's relatively consistent with what Health Net had seen historically, so I think kind of mid 100,000 range.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","But I think what...","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Meaning \u2013 between 100,000 and 200,000.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","What's really significant, how will this work, because I've been carefully following that with the our California people, that the \u2013 on the PPO, there was a shift in the population, that some of the \u2013 the book of business has really become balanced and we have about the same number this year as we did last year. We have \u2013 it achieved what it should. We expect our high utilizes, but we expect to balance, so it's a nice \u2013 every indication is it's a nice balanced book of business which is why we said we fully expected to be breakeven or less. Chris, anything you would add to that?","Christopher R. Isaak - Centene Corp.","No, Michael. I think you hit it right on the head. I think we're really happy with the way the benefit changes have moved the product.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And I want to call out the state and everyone else that understood the issues and helped us to do it. And we were able to effect the pricing and just create the right environment the way it should be. We took a much smaller price increase than what you originally heard about.","Gary P. Taylor - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Lance Wilkes of Sanford C. Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I wanted to ask a little bit about the long-term care business and if you could comment a little bit on both pipeline, if you're expecting any sorts of delays with respect to risk, or repeal and replace. And also, what sort of MLR trends are you seeing in that business?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I'll just comment that there's been a couple of states that we're in force now that have talked about delaying the re-procurement for a year. I think Kansas and there was one other one, which is five. I mean we're in force there and, some say it's business as usual. They want to do that, we can live, either way it's fine with us. Though the MLR, I don't know how it's...","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. As far as the MLR \u2013 this is Jeff. Hey, Lance. So, I think we've historically said that usually long-term care products are underwritten close to the mid-90s, it's a little bit below the mid-90s range because of the size of the premium. So we're seeing, I mean that's consistent with our experience, relatively close to where the state's underwriting the program.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And the SG&A is lower because once again the size of the.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Premium. Yeah.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That totally makes sense. And then, in North Carolina and in the other places where you've taken kind of a similar approach in partnering with physicians, understand the 80\/20 sort of split on the overall economics. Do you enter into a capitation or is there some sort of an upside and downside arrangement with the physicians as far as medical costs in those instances?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well, there have been, or ways to do some of that risk. We are moving to risk type contracting. And those are things yet to be worked out. We're in the early stages of those discussions, but it will be done in a way that's very balanced and fair to both sides and we've had great success with that. We have a shared risk where the physicians are taking on the ambulatory risk and we share in the inpatient\/outpatient services. So, we have some model that I don't want to, for competitive reasons at this point, get too specific. But we have the systems capability we're developing, and continue to look at risk sharing with providers, but not at the global cap level. We've seen too many people have issues with that.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from Kevin Fischbeck of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to ask on the individual business. I think previously you talked about having about $300 million of kind of making a net payable position on the risk adjusters, risk corridor, minimum MLR.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Right.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is that where you kind of ended the year or did anything changed around that?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Jeff?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Total around the year-end is going to be around $425 million of risk adjustment payable. You'll see that in our 10-K.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I guess the number I think that I remember hearing is kind of all of those things combined. Is that all combined or just the risk adjusted payables of $425 million?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","That's just risk adjustment payable. So obviously, we'll have a receivable on the reinsurance, right, kind of goes the other way. Yeah.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. And risk corridor and MLR, you'll be in a payable position as well?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Those are relatively inconsequential as far as you look at the whole year. I mean, the majority of it's going to be in the risk adjustment payable and the reinsurance receivable.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then as far the MA rollout, it wasn't clear to me, you're saying that the MA business was going to be profitable. Was that related to the four new states were going to be profitable or is that including the existing California business?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well we were kind of in the totality of it, in totality. We said from the beginning, we're going to go very cautious in the new states. I mean it's just the way we do it. We did that with the exchange, get the experience, understand it. It's as much we have \u2013 we think we have a lot of capabilities at headquarters, but you really need to get your state employees. Those that are executing day-in day-out, get them very comfortable, train on just how they're doing it and then you end up with a much more successful longer term growing business. So it's just really taking that approach, Kevin.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. No, that makes sense. And I guess maybe just a last question then. As far as, I know you said there's not a lot of membership in those four new states, but any color on the demographics of how that's shaking out?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Kevin, this is Jesse. So, not a lot that we would be \u2013 that was kind of worth sharing it at this point. As Michael mentioned in his other comments, we've talked about consistently our focus is on making sure that we have a product that is attractive for the lower income seniors. So that will continue to be the focus as we apply the test-and-learn approach that we've talked about.","Kevin Mark Fischbeck - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right, great. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Matthew Borsch of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, I was hoping you could a little bit about the outlook for the commercial group business. Maybe give us a sense of how enrollment fared coming into Jan 1 and whether you think profitability will be stable 2017 versus 2016 or up or down?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. As I said, we say commercial there's two aspects to it, there's what California is doing in small and large group and then there's the exchange. We kind of say that's all commercial. So, the exchange business, I think we've talked about and you have the sense. We're still very committed to the commercial business in California, large and small group, and Jeff probably has a few numbers on it, he can share and help us.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. So, a couple of things. If you recall, we took a lot actions in 2016 to improve the performance on the small group business. So I think our expectation is, is that that's going to be more profitable heading into 2017. Large groups have been very consistent. It's been a profit contributor in 2016, and we have the same expectations for 2017.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And how about the enrollment change going into the new year? What does that look like, large group and small group?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","I think if you just look at our press release and you look at the fourth quarter commercial, you'll notice membership's down. Some of that's just a normal attrition of the exchange members, but the other component of that is lower membership in the small group and a little bit lower membership in the large group. And you have to remember, a bulk of those blocks renew for January 1. A large part of that business renews in December for January 1. So I think what you've seen is our actions around pricing and other network actions take effect. And so, the membership will be a little bit lower as we jump off the year. It's still in line with our forecast we projected this, but more profitable.","Matthew Borsch - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question...","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","We're still very committed to that business. Don't misread that.","Operator","The next question comes from Dave Windley of Jefferies. Please go ahead.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for getting me in. Couple questions around pricing. First, is there any health insurer fee holiday benefit to 2017 earnings and kind of what was your strategy about the holiday, how did you apply that money? And then, what dialogue, what information are you getting from your Washington lobby, your contacts, in terms of prospects for having that holiday extended or the health insurer fee permanently removed as you think about pricing for 2018?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. So, this is Jeff. I mean, specifically, for the largest part of our business, there is no effect, right, on the Medicaid side. Those are predominantly pass through with the gross up et cetera, et cetera. I mean \u2013 I think we've talked about the Medicare before and I mean we just took that into totality in our pricing, right. So I don't see it as any benefit as far as that is concerned. And then on the \u2013 Michael, if you want to...","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. We're talking \u2013 we're very active in D.C., talking about all aspects of this business, and we think that the tax \u2013 call the taxes as the fees, are on the table for discussion. And particularly in the Medicaid business, we've been demonstrating that it's very circular. If we pay $1 in, because the actuarial soundness of rates by the time the state has to gross it up to keep our rates and they get reimbursed, it's costing them money. So we're showing them that. And we're also explaining that as they look at all these things, somewhere in the commercial, in other words, it finds its way into the pricing and they're talking about reducing the price of insurance, so that's on the table. At this point, there's no fixed or set anchoring on any particular point. It's all up in the air. So I'm not going to commit one way the other. I'll just say that we continue to work on it and I want to be cautiously optimistic we'll get a positive solution.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","And Michael, the kind of similar vein but different book of business. On your marketplace business, you talked about business as usual. Do you have any sense of whether \u2013 what the administration is going to do with co-pay assistance, the cost of \u2013 the out-of-pocket cost assistance for members and whether that will stay? Do you have confidence that that's going to be a stable environment for you to continue in the marketplace?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yes I do. I think \u2013 nobody \u2013 if you eliminate that support, that's the same as doing away with the product. I don't know if anybody wants to see that large number of people are back out on the street so to speak without insurance. And I think they will be \u2013 we believe strongly that that will be maintained.","David Howard Windley - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","In some point.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Lake of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks. Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Just couple of questions. First the 900,000 that you talked about in terms of the individual membership, can you breakdown \u2013 we know 100,000 came from other plans. Out of the 900,000, how many are the members that were with Centene last year and how many are completely new to the company?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Well we had 500,000 last year, like.","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","I don't want to get too specific in terms of retention rates and other things on that, Justin. But I would say, as Michael is referencing, we had \u2013 with over 0.5 million lives last year and our retention rate was actually, I think it was the highest year that we have had of any of the subsequent years. Our retention rate was higher from 2016 to 2017 than we've had in the past. So I'd say, at least in line and I'd say a little bit better than what we've seen historically.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Can you give me a historical ballpark? I just don't remember on top of my head.","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","So, well over 80%.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Got it. And then just on the pipeline broadly. Can you give us some color in terms of what you're seeing out there or what you focused on that you expect either is kind of out there in the market or expected to come to market in 2017 that will fuel 2018 and 2019 growth? Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And we have this in common, but we know that Oklahoma has an RFP out there, we're looking at. We know that North Carolina is working, we've talked about that. Cindy, anything else you want to add?","Cynthia J. Brinkley - Centene Corp.","No, that's right. I mean we still remain optimistic about the pipeline and what out there and we'll continue to evaluate these opportunities as they arise.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah.","Justin Lake - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. Thank you.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah, that works. Jesse, you made a very important point.","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think one thing just in general that we've seen over the last approaching a decade now, states have moved, the higher acuity more complicated populations in the advantage care and there's has been a lot of demonstrated success around that. So if you think about this environment where there's going to be more flexibility at the state level and more focused on cost containment while improving quality. I think you would look at long-term care, other complex populations being a real catalyst for more opportunity at the state level.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","And we really prefer \u2013 I mean we planned on that. We have the systems and the capability to manage that population and we can safe to say there's a lot of money there while improving outcomes.","Operator","The next question comes from Scott Fidel of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. I just had one question. Just related to, there was an interesting proposal in the Florida Governor's budget to allow Medicaid MCOs to potentially shift the range at which they contract with hospitals to a lower range relative to FFS. I think it had been in 100% to 120% previously, and they're proposing it, shifting that down to 90% to 110%. Just interested if you have any more details on that, and whether you see an opportunity for that in terms of lowering your rates with the hospitals, and then also how that may actually work through the Medicaid rates. Thanks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Chris?","Christopher R. Isaak - Centene Corp.","Thanks, Michael. Yeah, we've had an opportunity to take a little bit of a look at this at this point in time. But I think right now, it's just, as you mentioned, it's in the Governor's budget. We're talking with the health plan to see what we think the impacts and something like this would be. But from our particular standpoint, we don't see a really big impact in this particular proposal at this point in time.","Scott Fidel - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.

As we look at the high end of your guidance, what does that assume about the California PPO performance?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","It assumes break even. I mean, what we've said is we expect it to be roughly breakeven. We said that at December Investor Day, and that's still our message today.","Thomas Carroll - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you for that.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Which is a huge improvement.","Jeffrey A.

Good morning.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Good morning.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just wanted to ask about margin profile of the company at this point. It's been lifted a bit partially due to the Health Net deal. But as you look ahead, I mean, do you still see opportunity for margin expansion? How do you view a range kind of target margins? And just maybe talk about the impact of higher acuity populations coming on as we look to the out years?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","So I think we're on record of saying that margin expansion is still a short and longer term objective of ours. And the higher acuity populations, as we said, we had the systems and capability, and I think that would \u2013 the more of that we have we can enhance it. Jeff, you want anything to add?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think what we've always held this long-term pre-tax margin of between 3% and 5%. I think, obviously, there's a lot of opportunity of margin. We've talked about synergies and the run rate synergies and executing on those. I think we still have room to go as far as systems and the operational systems that Michael mentioned before. Additionally, there's always investment income. Right now, interest rates are relatively low. So there's a lot of thing, I think, out there for the opportunity to expand margins in the future.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just last one here. As you sort of expand presence on the exchange, have you expanded your provider networks, have providers started to come to you to want to sort of be included in your networks? And then, I guess, have you seen any pressure on provider rates sort of as a result of having to expand?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I think our mindset is \u2013 our population is 400% of the federal poverty level and below, and we're very focused. We're not trying to continue to grow beyond that except in California where we have the large group business and they have historically the relationships to support that. But if any of the providers that fit within our traditional provider group want to join, we'll be happy talk to, but we refined that the network we have is very adequate for the population we're attracting and serving.","Ralph Giacobbe - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Christine Arnold of Cowen. Please go ahead.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company LLC","Thank you very much. Two questions. We added about 500,000 public exchange members entering this year. It looks like you've got 200,000 plus with California and Arizona. Were there other big areas of growth that you'd like to call out as areas where you've increased your presence? And then the retroactive minimum MLR, does that change your view of how the Health Net business was doing when you acquire it? Are you not looking at the Health Net business and saying, gee, we thought they were losing X, but after this retroactive adjustment, it looks like it's doing better. And how do we think about that in terms of the Health Net run rate?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Okay. Jesse, you want to take the population?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah. Christine, in terms of the markets where we've had stronger presence on the marketplace in 2017, so not surprisingly that matches up with where we have just a stronger presence generally at the local level. So states like Texas, in addition to the California and Arizona markets, so Texas, Florida, Georgia, those are all markets where we have a meaningful marketplace presence in 2017.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Yeah. And this is Jeff. I'll answer your second question. It doesn't change our views because ultimately, the minimum MLR ended in June 30 and they were accruing to that level. And in July 1, there was a rate reduction in the Medicaid expansion rates, sizable rate reduction, really in combination with eliminating the minimum MLR. So it doesn't change our views on the profitability of that product going forward.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company LLC","So, those two things were a wash.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah.","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Close.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Close. Yeah. More or less.","Christine Arnold - Cowen and Company LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Ana Gupte of Leerink Partners. Please go ahead.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks. Good morning \u2013 for squeezing me in. On the guidance, so, you talked about flu. I was wondering if you had the leap year tailwinds in the guidance as well across your \u2013 I mean, Medicaid and commercial book?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I think we talked about that at our December Investor Day. So, yes, I mean we mentioned that. So that was in \u2013 I mean, nothing's changed since our December Investor Day.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. So, it is in there then? Because I'd offset the flu meds then, correct, more or less?","Jeffrey A. Schwaneke - Centene Corp.","Predominantly. I mean, last year was a moderate level of flu. So, there's a lots of puts and takes. Obviously, we're managing over 300 products, 29 states, so I mean it's a $46 billion business this year.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. It's huge, agreed. That's impressive. The second question on the rate notice on MA. Can you give us any thoughts on what this means for Health Net and your expansion states, Florida and Georgia and the others for 2018? What are you lobbying for from here on?","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Right. Jesse?","Jesse N. Hunter - Centene Corp.","Yeah. I'm not sure we'd comment a lot on that, Ana. Just other than to say that the preliminary view is in line with expectations. Our analysis is pretty consistent with lot of the reports that we've seen that have come out over the course of last week. So, there are some variability from state-to-state. So we're not in a position to get into that, just yet. But I think it's a good starting point, it's how I would characterize it.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And the final one is on the Trump Executive Order that the news that came out last night and this morning, how do you see impacting? Is that going to impact your 2017 margins favorably and then what does it look like for 2018 on the...","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I've been up early rehearsing for you Ana. Can you tell what Trump said last night?","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","I believe he is expanding the age underwriting bands to some degree and there's has been an Executive Order, I think, there's more flexibility on consumer cost sharing provider networks. I think that kind of covers it. There's no state...","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","We've been talking about the band, so he is showing us. So, I mean any of these things he does that improves it, there's going to be a lot of discussion about it. So it's all good. I mean, I'm just comfortable that we have our proposals into the decision makers. They understand it. They understand how big we are in this business, so it carries some weight. They're soliciting some of our opinions. We have a very active Washington office. So, any of these things that expand that correct some of the things, that needed corrected will only help us.","Ana A. Gupte - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for fitting me in.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to conference back over to Michael Neidorff for any closing remarks.","Michael F. Neidorff - Centene Corp.","I want to thank you all for participating and I will tell you, I look forward to, for you to have more this kinds of calls with the kind of the results we delivered this past quarters. So, off to 2017 we go. Have a great year, everybody.","Operator","The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines. Have a great day."]}}
