At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Third Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Denise M. Merle - Senior Vice President-Human Resources & Investor Relations","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2015 earnings. On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings material on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Denise, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $180 million, or $0.35 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion.","I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance as each of our businesses capitalized on operational excellence improvements to deliver strong results despite some market and global macroeconomic headwinds.","In addition, we continued to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We have completed the $700 million share repurchase program authorized in 2014. In August, our board supplemented this program with an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization and also increased our quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.31 per share. This illustrates our confidence in our ability to continue to execute our operational excellence initiatives and capitalize on market improvements going forward.","I'll begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about the housing market. The U.S. housing market continued to advance in the third quarter following choppy activity in the first half of the year. Total housing starts as of September, has improved 18% compared with 2014, and single-family starts are up 12%. We continue to anticipate just over 1.1 million starts for 2015.","Our customers tell us they expect strong year-in activity for as long as weather conditions remain favorable. With rising employment, strong consumer confidence, historically low mortgage rates and builder sentiment reaching all-time highs, we continue to anticipate steady improvement in the U.S. housing market.","Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, charts two to four. Timberlands contributed $126 million to third quarter earnings, comparable to the second quarter. Strong cost controls and operational excellence initiatives offset the effect of reduced Western fee harvest volumes and lower average sales realizations for Western logs.","As expected, Western fee harvest volumes declined by 5% compared with the second quarter due to buyer season logging constraints. This year's buyer season was exceptionally severe due to record breaking temperatures and unusually low rainfall.","Our employees did an exceptional job of protecting our Timberlands and flexing harvest settings to adjust the changing logging constraints and market conditions. Our tree farms experienced virtually no fire damage with only about 150 of our 7 million acres affected, less than 100 of 1%.","Average realizations for Western domestic logs improved slightly in the third quarter as fire season restrictions resulted in tighter log supplies, especially in Southern Oregon and we benefited from an improved mix.","Turning to the export markets, Japanese demand remained strong and pricing for our Japanese logs was up slightly in the quarter. After peaking in August, log inventories at Chinese ports have declined as supply has fallen in response to lower pricing. However, Chinese demand in pricing remained challenging due to continued slow construction activity and we flexed volume into more profitable domestic markets. Overall, average realizations for our Western logs declined compared with the second quarter, primarily due to the higher proportion of domestic log sales. In the South, fee harvest volume increased and average log sales realizations improved slightly.","Third quarter included earnings of $13 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, an increase of $8 million compared with the second quarter. Operational excellence initiatives contributed to Timberlands' third quarter results as efforts to optimize harvest settings and road and silviculture expenditures resulted in continued cost improvements. The business remained on track to meet or exceed its OpEx target for 2015.","Wood Products, charts five and six. Wood Products contributed $85 million to third quarter earnings, an improvement of $14 million compared with the second quarter. EBITDA increased to $111 million as improved sales volumes and lower operating costs enabled the business to overcome the drag of lower average lumber realization.","In Lumber, EBITDA declined $4 million compared with the second quarter. A 3% decrease in average sales realizations was mostly offset by seasonally higher sales volumes and improvements in logs and other costs.","In OSB, EBITDA improved by $12 million, due to a 2% increase in average sales realizations and reduced manufacturing and log cost.","Engineered Wood Products reported third quarter EBITDA of $36 million, compared with $38 million in the second quarter. Slightly improved sales volumes and realizations for several products were offset by higher manufacturing cost due to planned maintenance downtime. EBITDA for the distribution business increased by $7 million compared with the second quarter due to improved sales volumes and lower overhead cost.","Our Wood Products business remains relentlessly focused on operational excellence. Lumber and OSB are on track to achieve their 2015 targets. Engineered Wood Products is tracking significantly above its EBITDA improvement target. Year-to-date, the business has generated EBITDA of $100 million, a $35 million improvement compared with a target of $15 million to $20 million.","We made significant progress in our distribution toward our OpEx target in the third quarter as EBITDA improved to $9 million and we expect continued progress in the fourth quarter. At this point, however, we're unlikely to reach our full $20 million target for the year. With that said, I'm encouraged by our level of improvement in the third quarter and this business is highly focused on continuing to improve bottom line performance going forward.","Cellulose Fibers, charts seven and chart eight. Cellulose Fibers contributed $79 million to third quarter earnings, compared with $27 million in the second quarter. Pulp market softened in the third quarter due to rising global inventories and the continuing challenge of a strong U.S. dollar. Average pulp realizations declined slightly compared with second quarter.","Earnings for this segment increased significantly as maintenance expense declined and pulp production improved due to fewer scheduled maintenance outage days. The third quarter included only four days of scheduled maintenance outages, compared with a 46-day extended outage completed in the second quarter.","The Cellulose Fibers business continues to make good progress on operational excellence initiatives as well. Third quarter results benefited from initiatives to reduce energy costs, and chemical costs, and usage. Cellulose Fibers business remained on track to achieve its 2015 operational excellence target.","I will now turn it over to Patty, to discuss our fourth quarter outlook.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the fourth quarter is summarized on chart 12, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.","In the West, export log volumes to Japan is expected to increase during the fourth quarter as a result of an active Japanese housing market, and we anticipate a slight improvement in prices. Although construction activity in China is still slow, inventories at Chinese ports started to decline during Q3 and are expected to decrease further this quarter. As a result, we see fourth quarter prices stabilizing.","Average sales realizations and volumes for Western domestic logs are expected to be comparable to Q3.","Fee timber harvest in the West is anticipated to increase slightly, as fire-related logging constraints have been lifted. In the South, fee harvest volume is expected to be in line with the third quarter and we anticipate roughly similar average sales realizations. Silviculture and logging costs will likely increase seasonally. Overall, fourth quarter earnings in our Timberlands segment are expected to be comparable to Q3.","In our Wood Products segment, the fourth quarter is typically the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. Because of the seasonal slowdown, we expect lower sales volumes. Although we have seen an increase in lumber prices thus far in the fourth quarter, average sales realizations for Q4 are expected to be lower than the average of Q3. We expect higher average sales realizations for oriented strand board in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and we anticipate that Engineered Wood Products' average sales realizations will be relatively flat.","Production volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to decline, due to the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. This downtime will result in higher per-unit manufacturing costs.","Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, we expect fourth quarter earnings in our Wood Products segment to be lower than the third quarter and slightly lower than the earnings of Q4 of last year, which had much higher pricing.","Our Cellulose Fibers business is continuing to experience currency headwinds due to the strong U.S. dollar. Worldwide inventories for softwood pulp stood at 30 days at the end of the third quarter. Typically, industry supply increases during the fourth quarter as there is seasonally not as much maintenance downtime in the colder winter months. As a result, we expect weaker average sales realizations for pulp in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.","Our final planned maintenance outage for this year was completed earlier this month. The mill is back up and running well. Due to this outage, we will have more planned maintenance phase this quarter, as a result expect that overall maintenance expense will be approximately $10 million higher than Q3. In addition, we expect seasonally higher fiber costs. We anticipate that overall earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will be approximately $20 million to $25 million lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter.","Chart nine summarizes the results of unallocated items. Unallocated items moved from a positive earnings impact of $20 million in Q2 to a negative $27 million in Q3. The largest change was the result of a non-cash charge for the weakening of the Canadian dollar. As we've said in the past, every $0.01 change in the exchange rate is roughly $3 million to $4 million on a pre-tax basis. The other large variance was a lower positive effect for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO.","Now, I'll wrap with some overall financial comments. Income taxes for the quarter resulted in a tax benefit of $16 million. This was due to a true-up of the effective tax rate for the year, which is now estimated to be lower based on the higher mix of REIT income relative to the taxable REIT subsidiary. In addition, there were discrete items booked in the quarter of approximately $9 million; the largest item being a positive resolution of uncertain tax positions.","Now, I'll refer you to chart 10. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $282 million, or a reduction of $84 million compared to Q2. The change was primarily the result of a large working capital reduction in Q2 and normal timing of interest payments. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $112 million, bringing our total expenditures for the first three quarters of the year to just over $300 million. We still anticipate total expenditures for the year to approximate $500 million. There was no change to our scheduled debt maturities and, as you can see from the chart, the first maturity isn't until 2017.","Chart 11 details our share repurchase activity, and we have now completed our $700 million 2014 share repurchase authorization. And as mentioned earlier, in August, the board authorized an additional share repurchase program for $500 million.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Patty. We are encouraged by the positive trend in housing and the optimistic tone we are hearing from our customers. Going forward, we remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation. By relentlessly driving operational excellence in each of our businesses, we are laying a foundation that enables us to take full advantage of market opportunities. Our recently announced dividend increase and share repurchase program illustrate our confidence that we will continue to grow shareholder value by capitalizing on these activities going forward.","And with that, we'd like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Maybe a little bit of a detail question, but on the tax rate, well, maybe the easiest way to ask, what type of tax rate should we be anticipating for the fourth quarter? Kind of looks like you're 5% to 10% even after making all the adjustments for the first three quarters. Is that what we should expect for the fourth quarter?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Mark, that's our outlook for the full year and, of course, the fourth quarter will be the last one. As you mentioned, we had a number of things in the third quarter just to true up the rate for the full year, but we'll be over 5% for the fourth quarter.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, great. And also, maybe a little bit of help, if we look at lumber pricing, which has started to move quite positively of late, one could certainly see scenarios where at least the random length average would be higher in the fourth quarter than it would be in the third quarter. Maybe a little bit more color of \u2013 your comments on why you'd expect it to be lower, recognizing maybe you sell more in October and things like that, but if you could give us a little bit of help in understanding how to think through fourth quarter lumber realization, that would be great.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. And Mark, we agree with you. There is a scenario where lumber prices could in fact be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But let me kind of give you the facts of where we are currently. If you take fourth quarter-to-date average, it's still about $15 below the third quarter average. Now if you take current prices today for lumber, it's basically in line with the third quarter average. So to your point, it's all dependent on what happens from this point going forward. We may be being conservative in terms of what we're assuming for lumber prices, but we all know that, as Patty mentioned, the fourth quarter is typically a slower seasonal period and we'll just have to see what happens in the month of November and December. So that's the way we see it at this point and we'll just watch together because our \u2013 it's nothing but a guess as to what we think's going to happen in the fourth quarter and we'll just have to see how it plays out as we move through the next couple of months.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Understood and totally fair enough. And just any color though in terms of why you think lumber has come back as nicely as it has in the last several weeks?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I think there's a number of things that have played into that. I think what we understand in talking to our customers and buyers, I think there were very, very low inventories in the system, partially waiting to see what happens when the Softwood Lumber Agreement expired. When that did happen, there was not a lot of lumber that came on. So I think part of it has been a building back of inventories in light of that. I think there have been some slight improvements in the Chinese markets. And our take is, as long as the weather holds, as I said in my comments, we're hearing very positive commentary from our customers in terms of demand in building season. So that's I think what's happened to drive the lumber prices up over the past few weeks.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks so much.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","A number of producers seem to have adjusted their production schedules in 3Q given weaker Wood Products prices. I was wondering what your operating rates were in the quarter across lumber, OSB, and Engineered Wood Products? And if you took any kind of market downtime or cut shifts in 3Q or expect anything like that in 4Q?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, in terms of operating rates, lumber was right at 90%, OSB mid-90%s and ELP in the mid-70%s in terms of operating rates. And I'll let Patty, because she alluded to it in her comments, talk about the fourth quarter and some of the maintenance downtime we have planned for the fourth quarter.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. As you think about the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter is typically when we do our maintenance as well as install capital projects and most of that will happen in the Wood Products business. And it's really across the board. As you think about OSB, for example, we're installing some \u2013 not huge capital but we will take advantage of putting in things across the system. ELP will have some as well, lumber has some capital projects and also we have holiday downtime that happens in the fourth quarter.","So if I think \u2013 as we think about our operating rates for OSB, in particular, I think as Doyle said we were in the mid-90s for the third quarter, we would expect below 90% for the fourth quarter.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just switching to the dividend, I mean, historically, you've targeted 75% of FAD over the cycle. And this year, you raised the dividend while your earnings should be down year-over-year, maybe double digits on a percentage basis. I'm just wondering if you could talk about dividend coverage and prospects for continued dividend growth and maybe the confidence that you have going into 2016 that you're going to see earnings growth next year, given we've got a strong dollar and some of these headwinds in Asia that you called out earlier as well?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Anthony, as you alluded to, our guideline, and it is a guideline is 75% of FAD over the cycle. I think the \"over the cycle\" is an important component. To your point, we feel like we are still early in the housing recovery cycle and as mentioned in my comments, we're optimistic that housing will continue to recover and will be 1% to 1.25% in 2016. As a result of that, we think we have a lot of opportunity to continue to grow earnings and cash flow going forward and are confident that we will continue to do that as housing continues to improve going forward.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And just in terms of next year, is your view not only that you're going to see a volume recovery with starts going higher, but that will be a accompanied by price recovery as well or price improvement year-over-year in 2016?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Pricing, as we all know, is difficult to predict. But following up on the conversation we had earlier on lumber, we are encouraged that lumber prices are improving in a slower seasonal period. And our take is, as we move into the strong building season next year, again, assuming housing's at the 1.2% to 1.25% range, we think that will be very constructive for Wood Products, and frankly Timberland prices moving into 2016.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Good morning. Thanks.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I think just with the domestic West Coast prices, I think, Patty, you mentioned that the fires were a little bit beneficial for prices this quarter. Could you quantify that a little bit? I don't know, is there any risk that with the fire season going away, that prices could slip a little bit this quarter, or do you think they should be sort of pretty stable?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Tyler, we did talk about the fact that we expected to have a little more fee harvest volume in the West, but it's not a huge amount, and even in the third quarter, we didn't see as much benefit from the fire restriction as probably many expected, because of the fact that many of the mills had already, seeing the fact that the fire season was going to be so severe, had done some additional things as far as their own log supply.","So, I don't see a huge risk related to that but the increase that I mentioned in our fee timber harvest in the West is not a huge increase. I don't think it will have that significant of an impact.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great, thanks. And then just, switching to Wood Products. Could you quantify, and I think you said the lower earnings in the fourth quarter was coming from sort of lower sale volumes, reduced operating rates and some of the maintenance in OSB. Could you kind of roughly break out how much each of one of those would contribute to the decline?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In terms of the overall impact, I would say that there, the biggest impact of third Q compared to fourth quarter really does come from sales volumes. As we talked about, seasonally, the fourth quarter is a lower quarter for volume, and that's really a statement across most of our product lines, lumber, OSB and ELP. And certainly in distribution as well, we were very pleased with the improvement in distribution for the third quarter, but they will likely be impacted as well from the seasonal volume fall off.","Now, having said all that, as Doyle talked about, we are pleased to see that prices in lumber especially and OSB have been coming up in the quarter. Its pricing can be very volatile, and we'll just have to see how it all plays out. But I would say across the board, the biggest negative compared to the third quarter is in sales volume. And actually, we're very pleased, when you think about quarter-over-quarter, last year in the fourth quarter, we had much better pricing than what we're anticipating for this fourth quarter, and earnings are roughly \u2013 maybe a little lower or could be even comparable depending upon where prices are. So I think you start to see the impact of our operational excellence initiative kicking into that.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And just final question with the distribution, you mentioned a nice increase in earnings. Can you just provide a little bit more detail about sort of what drove that, and sort of how sustainable it is going forward?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, what I would tell you is that it's \u2013 what we've been working on is the basic blocking and tackling of running a distribution. It's making sure we have the right warehouse and cost in places, making sure we're growing profitable sales.","So, as Patty said, we were very encouraged by the progress we made in the third quarter, but more work to do. But we are pleased that we \u2013 on the trajectory that we saw in the third quarter and the changes that we're making in that business to position it for success in the future. So, progress, more work to do, but are confident in the plan that we have in place will get us to where we need to be in that business.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Gail.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Well, can you just offer some broader perspective on the Softwood Lumber Agreement? I guess, we obviously haven't seen much impact in October but just how you see it playing out, I guess, over the next year while the standstill is in place?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, as we all know, the Softwood Lumber Agreement expired on October 12. Just in terms of what's happening on that, there are ongoing discussions between participants on both sides of the border regarding renewing the agreement. As well as you all know, this is ultimately a government-to-government negotiation, and election season has hampered the ability to have those discussions. But we are looking forward to both governments having an opportunity to engage and it's my take, our take that there is a possibility of reaching an agreement prior to the one year standstill playing out.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And in terms of flows, do you think recent activity is a pretty good indicator that that probably won't have a major impact in terms of flows in the market?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah. I think that's exactly right. I think what's happened over the past two weeks or three weeks was in line with what we anticipated but you never know, but I do think that does show that there wasn't a significant impact in terms of flows when that agreement expired.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","All right. And just in terms of the current market, you talked about customers having pretty low inventories and reporting the recent rally. Do you have any view has buying activity over the last couple of weeks been enough or do you think inventories are still light?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. What we think is inventories continue to be lean especially in lumber and OSB. So, yes, there has been increased buying activity, as you alluded to, and we stated, but it's our stance that inventories continue to be on the lean side.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","All right. And you guys have a lot of \u2013 I mean, Patty alluded to some smaller stuff going on on the capital side. But you guys do have a few larger capital projects going on at at least a couple of your sawmills. I was just wondering can you give some \u2013 just kind of walk through what you're doing and actually there is $190 million going on at one project. Can you just walk through some of your bigger projects whether they're fourth quarter 2016 event?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Fourth quarter 2016, I mean...","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I am just saying just walk through some of the bigger projects that you have going on...","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Okay.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","And what are the OpEx program?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Yeah. You're exactly right. We are, as we have been talking about for a period of time now, spending capital specifically in our lumber operation to support our OpEx initiatives, and to drive down our overall cost structure. So, that's happening at a number of mills, each of our mills has a specific roadmap, that's what's needed to get them to be in lowest cost quartile, and we have specific projects going on.","One of the projects, to give you can example, is our Dierks sawmill. Our Dierks sawmill has been a very good sawmill for us for a long time. It's located in a fantastic wood basket. It's close to very good end market, but is a very old mill with an odd configuration. We are basically rebuilding that mill. We are rebuilding that mill on site. As we looked at all the different opportunities to make that mill more cost efficient that was the one that made the most sense. But to your question, Gail, every project that we're doing, the whole focus is to drive down our overall cost structures and that we will have low cost sawmill operation, and we'll be able to deliver on our OpEx initiatives.","As we said, we're going to spend roughly total company-wide $500 million in capital, that's inclusive of what we're spending in lumber, and would anticipate the capital spend, as Patty said on the last call, will be in that range for next year as well as we continue on these projects.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Gail, the only other thing that I would add is, as you look at the fourth quarter spend, it will be our highest spend for the year, and as Doyle mentioned, the biggest piece of that will be in the lumber business in addition to the things that he talked about, there are projects that many of the mills really focused on lowering their cost structure. One piece, for example, is in our CDKs that we're putting in the continuous drive kilns at a couple of locations, both to address boiler MACT as well as bringing down drying cost, which is a significant cost. We've got some edger projects, those types of things that really will improve recovery but they really are focused on lowering the overall cost structure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Doyle, you've really made some impressive progress in all these Wood Products businesses, I wondered just if you looked at the engineered wood business that's had particularly nice gains, will there be kind of two or three key issues you'd point to that have driven that?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, thank you for your commentary and our employees have done a nice job of making improvements and more work to do. In terms of EWP specifically it's really boils down to three things. One is reducing manufacturing cost and specifically controllable manufacturing costs, and that's something we're focused on every day. We've also driven down our overall SG&A cost in EWP business. And then finally we're really focused on growing not only just sales, but growing profitable sales. So those are the three key levers that we've been focused on in EWP, and have been encouraged about the progress that we've made there, and we're focused on continuing to improve that operation going forward.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And over in the OSB business are there any debottlenecking opportunities there similar to sort of some of the capital that you're putting in the lumber to improve the lumber operations?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark I would say in OSB the projects that we're doing, some of it involves debottlenecking, but more than that it's just figuring out a way to continue to improve reliability and drive down cost. As we've talked about, we've got a couple of mills that are world-class and we've got opportunities to improve some of our OSB mills to those same type of levels in terms of reliability and cost structure and that's what our capital expenditures are focused on.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Fine. Last question, I had Doyle, back in September, we had one of your peers announce kind of an interesting transaction with a group of institutional timber investors. Can you just talk about sort of the applicability or non-applicability of that kind of structure at Weyerhaeuser and maybe tie that in with how you're thinking about sort of growth in your Timberlands business over the next few years?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So, we thought that it will increase transaction that you're referring to was a very creative transaction and especially did a nice job of highlighting the underlying value of high quality Southern Timberlands. If we were at some point to conclude this type of transaction in the best interest of our shareholders, it's something we would consider. In terms of growth overall markets, we said we are interested in growing our company. Primary opportunity, we think will probably be in Timberlands, but we'll continue to be very disciplined in looking at acquisitions, opportunities as we move forward.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Good enough. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Doyle, good luck next year.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks, everyone. Good morning. I appreciate the details and congratulations again on all the progress on the costs and OE. Maybe, piggybacking off the last two questions from Mark and Gail \u2013 Doyle, I think, what you'd have left in terms of projects, and OE benefit s we head into 2016 is something north of $100 million. I know you'll probably want to talk a little bit about this in December at your Analyst Day, but is there a way to at least catch us upon maybe the opportunity for more OE benefit and is there a way to talk to what you achieved in OE in the third quarter across the segments? If you had it, I'd missed it in the deck or in your comments.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, George, to your point, we will be updating exactly our progress in 2015 later this year and giving more specific guidance on the opportunities that are still in front of us, but to your point, we have made good progress. What I'm most encouraged about is, this is now becoming bottom up driven in our organization as people are really understanding what we're doing in OpEx, and finding additional opportunities. So we will be giving further update on that going forward.","In terms of quarter-to-quarter, clearly, if you looked at price and volume and what that would result in terms of earnings, that's one number in our earnings and each of the businesses are higher than that. That delta is primarily due to OpEx.","Looking at it, I'll just give you an example, if you look at this morning I actually looked at some numbers and I looked year-to-date 2015 versus year-to-date 2014 because I think it's hard and things move around a lot on a quarterly basis but just looking at Timberland, for example, year-to-date 2014 our earnings in 2014 were $470 million. You look at lower price, lower volume that would have \u2013 you would have thought just backing in those two things, our earnings would have been $370 million year-to-date 2015 and in fact they're $415 million.","So that delta, not all of its OpEx, but a big portion of that is OpEx. Similar type numbers for lumber, OSB, ELP. So that's the way we think about it, just taking out the thing, the volume, the price components of it and that's how we know it's showing up in the bottom-line.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, could you remind us as you look out and do the buckets for OE change, the deeper we go into this decade or will it be pretty continuous or pretty equal contribution across the various categories for the various businesses? And that's a broad question but if you give us a bit of a feel there.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I wouldn't say changes substantially, George. We will identify broader opportunities as we move forward. As I said, the encouraging part about this is it's becoming part of our culture, it is being bottom up-driven. So things that, frankly, I would have never thought of as opportunities, our employees are bringing up as opportunities to continue to drive down our cost structure, improve our profitability. So again, we'll get more clarity on that as we move forward. But it really does boil down, as I mentioned earlier, to the basic blocking and tackling of running these businesses, but we are encouraged by the opportunities that we continue to unearth to drive our OpEx initiatives.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning, Doyle and Patty.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Morning, Chip.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Morning, Chip.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. First question, we haven't talked about Cellulose today, and I was just wondering what you're seeing in that marketplace in terms of, there's a very small player that's kind of working hard to fill up their mills because things haven't turned out the way they planned. And then you've got obviously two competitors who are involved in conversion projects next year. And could you just give me a feel for how that may or may not impact you in terms of your contracts and what you see for the marketplace?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You might imagine, Chip, we're right in the middle of that process. So let me just give you a little bit of color. I would say that we are very pleased with the demand that we're seeing for our products from our customers. We've got, as you know, very long customer relationships. So on the volume side, feeling good about \u2013 it's still just the fourth quarter, we're not into 2016 until next year and we'll give you more color as we get a little closer.","Having said that, I do expect that there will continue to be some price pressure as we \u2013 moving forward into 2016 as you see supply and demand. But I would say, at this point, we are very pleased with where we are on that front, but more to come.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And regardless of the supply side, would you still characterize the market globally as still a low to mid, maybe even a mid single-digit growth, are you seeing that kind of growth rate? And I know it's very early days, but what do you think this change in policy in China can mean for demand, on going from one child to two children?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, more babies mean more diapers, which means more fluff pulp. So hard to factor that into the cash flow stream, but I know what the direction would be. So I think from that perspective, we feel good about that piece, but I don't know how to quite model that at this point.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then just on a separate note, I noticed the \u2013 and this would be on I guess page eight of the financial package, but the other unallocated expense, which isn't tied to FX or LIFO, was a pretty high number, $23 million. And maybe I missed it, but what was that? And I know it jumps around, but what should we expect that to do from third quarter to fourth quarter?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. We did true up some of our environmental reserves, which is probably the biggest piece of that, it's not all of that by any matter of means, we have a number of things that you saw in the second quarter. The number was I think about $13 million, went to $23 million. The biggest difference really was for a true-up of some environmental reserves that are old reserves and it's just a function of \u2013 this is kind of the time that we go through that process. There are probably some other small reserve true-ups, but that's the biggest number. Going forward into the fourth quarter, I wouldn't expect that that number would be as large as you see it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions on EWP, first of all. Have you seen any significant pressure from the decline in solid wood, because it seems like your prices were holding in pretty well?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Steve. And good morning, Steve. As you would expect, we have seen a little bit of pricing pressure as the saw log prices have come off. We anticipate, as we mentioned earlier, as saw log prices go up, some of that pressure will abate. So to answer your question, I would say, yes, we've seen a little bit of pressure, nothing significant and not something we're concerned about in the long term.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And do any of the Trus Joist facilities have the ability to participate in this cross-laminated timber market that seems to be emerging?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We are really encouraged by the cross-laminated timber emerging market. And more and more buildings, as we all know, are using wood. And yes, we are positioned to participate in that as we move forward and there are some big initiatives, as you know, to continue to encourage those efforts going forward.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah, I think it's a great opportunity. And then I have one question on Cellulose. A couple of years ago, when viscose was really, really strong, you introduced your Pearl product that I believe was marketed as an extender, but I don't think you've spoken about it recently. So I was just wondering, is it growing, is it lucrative and are prices moving one way or another?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Steve, it's Patty. It is a smaller part of the overall portfolio, but we are producing the Pearl product, primarily in our Port Wentworth facility, and that does help the overall supply that comes into the fluff market. So it is still a meaningful part for Port Wentworth, still a small part as it relates to the overall pulp manufacturing and supply.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","But your expertise in any future growth would be more in fluff than in the extenders, is that correct?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, the biggest impact for sure would be in fluff just based upon the size of both that market and our capacity, but I wouldn't discount the importance of the Pearl product, especially as a result, as I said, to both the price as well as additional capacity for Port Wentworth.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, everyone. This is Scott Lehmann (47:01) in for Mark Connelly. Good morning. Just two quick questions. The first one is, if you guys see these FX conditions persist for the next year, how would you expect that that would affect the mix of wood that you guys are shipping?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let's talk just a minute about what we're seeing in the export market. As we mentioned, we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in Japan. Housing continues to improve there. And as a result, we expect improved shipments into Japan in the fourth quarter and would expect that trend to continue next year.","In terms of Chinese markets, as we referred to earlier, inventories are returning, trending back toward normalized levels. And we think, as a result, prices are stabilizing and getting inventories back toward more normalized levels by the end of this year we think positions China to be a improving market as we move into next year, 2016.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then just the second and last question. It looks like your price realizations for Engineered Wood Products were both up in the quarter. Do you think that those markets are tight enough to allow you to pass along higher OSB prices, if OSB prices do continue to move higher over the next six months?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We'll have to see how that all figures out. As we said, for the fourth quarter, which is really on a pricing guidance what we give, think that realization will be basically flat into the third quarter.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, Doyle and Patty.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Alex.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A couple of ones for you. So, you and others or U.S. based pulp producers have talked about the potential impact of a strong dollar on pulp pricing, assuming the dollar does stay strong. How do you sort of handicap the potential impact to margins in pulp from that?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I think as Doyle talked about in his comments on the FX, a strong dollar is not a positive business. But I think as we look at the euro right now, if you look year-over-year, it has weakened considerably compared to the U.S. dollar. So, I wouldn't necessarily see that it will be significantly weaker from where it is today.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks a lot, Patty. And then just thinking about the manufacturing portfolio. So a few years back we were talking about engineered wood distribution is businesses that you would potentially exit unless there was material improvement in the profitability which we've absolutely seen. So is there any interest in growing those segments through M&A now that we have seen a very nice improvement in the profitability there?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you for your comment regarding the improved profitability and as I mentioned earlier, a lot of good work from our employees. With that said, in both of those businesses we still got more work to do. In terms of growth generally, we said we would like to grow our company. We'll be very disciplined about how we do that. We think our largest opportunities will be in Timberlands. But if we can find bolt-on type acquisitions and our other businesses that makes sense and drive value for shareholders, that's something we would consider. But our primary focus especially in the two businesses that you just highlighted continue to improve our existing operations.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Collin.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning, Collin.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Just first on the capital allocation front. Going back to \u2013 when you announced your $700 million buyback, I think you guys made it pretty clear that you fully intend to utilize that in context of the TRI Pointe deal. How should we be thinking about really this latest share repurchase announcement? Just given where your cash balance is now, should we view that as you're going to fully execute that or is it just kind of a tool you want at your disposal?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think when we announced the share repurchase our intent when we announced it is to fully execute it. So, we'll continue to update everybody on exactly where we are on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but our intention would be to execute the share repurchase over time.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Yeah, no, it just looked like you had \u2013 there was a little bit of a pause if you completed the full $90 million in the third quarter, and there wasn't really anything incremental for the remainder of the quarter. So that was kind of the \u2013 where the question was coming from...","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, there was nothing to be read into that Collin.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just I'm curious if you can talk a little bit more about \u2013 there have been a few lumber production curtailments announced in the U.S. South recently and obviously in response to where lumber pricing was in the third quarter. And just maybe what have you seen in terms of your Timberlands business as it relates to that? Have you had to get back at pricing at all, have you lost a little bit of volume to a couple mills, just maybe update us in context of some of the announcements in the third quarter?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. In terms of our Southern Timberlands, I would say are \u2013 whether all these \u2013 are these one off. Our demand has been continued to be fairly consistent and pricing in the third quarter was up slightly versus the second quarter. And for 2015 versus 2014, our best guess is prices will be up somewhere in the 2% to 3% range as we had indicated earlier this year. So, yeah, was there some impact from those announcements? Yes. But, it had any significant impact on our Timberlands, either volume or pricing? No.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just bigger picture, I know you've mentioned a couple of times on this call again, Doyle, just the focus on looking at growing potentially that Timberland platform, maybe more opportunities in the U.S. South. But can you just talk about given that we've now seen two of the larger deals that were out there this year either cleared or are in the process of clearing the market, just what you're even seeing in terms of opportunities right now?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's not a lot out there right now, Collin. I would tell you, especially for higher quality Timberlands when something does come, become available, there's a lot of interest, a lot of competition and still a lot of money out there interested in investing in this asset class. But, in terms of specific opportunities other than the two that you just mentioned, not seeing a lot of activity in terms of availability.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just one last one and then just kind of piggybacking off of couple of the other questions. Just \u2013 again, congratulations on all the progress, particularly on the Engineered Wood Products business. Should we think about just given that, there still sounds like some other opportunities you want to explore there on cost savings over time. Do you think about this as now being kind of a minimum of $140 million to $150 million a year in terms of EBITDA business? I mean just maybe speak to the sustainability of the improvement that we've seen here, particularly over the last couple of quarters?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We do think the improvements that we've seen are sustainable. I do believe that we have, as I alluded to earlier, additional opportunities to improve that business going forward. So, to your point very encouraged about the progress, very encouraged about the work of our employees in that business. And there is no reason to the things that we've done aren't sustainable and that there aren't additional opportunities to improve that business going forward.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Collin.","Operator","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] I would now like to the call over to Ms. Kathy McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ma'am, you may begin your conference.","Kathryn F. McAuley","Thank you, Marlee. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Third Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides for this call can be found at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.","Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","As summarized on Chart 1, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter 2012 net earnings of $117 million or $0.22 per diluted share. That was our net sale of $1.8 billion. There were no special items in this quarter.","Turning to our business segments. My comments reviewing the third quarter of 2012 refer to changes from the second quarter of 2012. Beginning with Timberlands, Charts 3 and 4. Timberlands contributed $80 million to pretax earnings, $3 million more than in Q2. Revenues from Timberlands exchanges were $24 million in the quarter, an increase of $17 million. In the West, log prices declined approximately $5 per cubic meter. Domestic log prices decreased due to an abundant supply of farmer wood. Export log prices were up slightly due to mix.","Dry conditions and fire danger in the West resulted in a 3% reduction in fee harvest volumes. Road costs in the West were seasonally higher. In the South, log prices increased 2%, third-party log volumes rose 6% and the fee harvest was slightly higher. Silviculture costs in the South were slightly lower as planting was deferred into dry weather conditions.","Wood Products, Charts 5 and 6. Wood Products contributed $59 million to pretax earnings in Q3, $29 million more than in Q2. Price realizations increased across nearly all product lines, as product supply channels remained lean. OSB prices increased $54 per thousand square feet or 25%, and lumber prices rose $9 per thousand board feet or 3%. Sales volumes for engineered wood products increased 8%. Sales volumes for lumber declined slightly as southern lumber mills took downtime in response to slightly weaker market conditions around the 4th of July holiday. Lumber mills operated at over an 80% rate in the quarter. OSB mills took downtime for scheduled maintenance resulting in lower sales volumes. The operating rate for OSB was 85%.","Cellulose Fibers, Charts 7 and 8. Sale of fibers contributed $78 million to pretax earnings, $42 million more than in Q2. During the third quarter, this segment had a strong performance. Pulp production increased 9% and maintenance costs were lower. In Q3, there was only one scheduled maintenance outage of 13 days. In Q2, there were 2 annual maintenance outages resulting in 27 days of mill downtime. Pulp sales volumes increased 2%. Pulp price realizations were flat.","Real Estate, Charts 9 and 10. Real Estate contributed $17 million to pretax earnings and had no significant income from land and lot sales. Second quarter pretax earnings of $15 million included $12 million of land and lot sales. In Q3, single-family home closings increased 21% to 615 homes from 508 homes in Q2. Home closings were up 21% of the same quarter last year. Although the average home closing price was $372,000, this was nearly flat with 2 -- with second quarter. Margins went up in most geographies, with the largest increase in San Diego. Gross margins in Q3 were 24.3%, up from 19.5% in the previous quarter. The backlog at the end of the quarter was 1,055 homes.","Real Estate controls approximately 27,000 lots in our primary markets. In addition, we control 67,000 lots, mostly under options in a large master plan community in Nevada, where development and construction is on hold pending improvement in the local market.","Unallocated Items, Chart 11. The foreign exchange gain of $11 million in Q3 was due to the strengthening of the Canadian dollar. The swing from Q2 was $19 million. Offsetting this was a charge of $10 million for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. As we discussed last quarter, this item was formerly reported at the segment level and is now recorded in unallocated items. The charge for share-based compensation increased in Q3 as the price of Weyerhaeuser stock appreciated. The increase in share-based compensation largely accounts for the increase in SG&A.","Now I will turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I'll start by saying that I'm pleased with our strong quarterly performance. As Kathy noted, we earned $117 million during the quarter. Comparing this quarter's earnings with our second quarter earnings before special items, we had a quarter-over-quarter increase of $70 million, with each of our core business segments showing gains. The rise in our earnings was a result of ongoing business improvement initiatives, coupled with increasing strength of U.S. housing, which allowed us to capitalize on the full value of the company.","Before I offer some brief comments on the performance of each of our business segments, I'll provide a macroeconomic context for our quarter. First, the housing market. On last quarter's call, I noted that the long-awaited housing recovery looks and feels real. After another solid quarter, all indicators point to continued steady improvement. Recent September housing starts data shows a seasonally adjusted level of 745,000 for the year, confirming what we're seeing on the ground in the marketplace. In addition to increased construction activity, we now have the latest release of the widely reported Case Schiller numbers, which are a bit of a lagging indicator. These numbers show broad modest increases in pricing across most major markets. Price increases helped build consumer confidence, which then begins to move more potential homebuyers off the sidelines.","While today's construction levels are still low by historic standards, all forecasts point to continued recovery in 2013 as we begin to return the long-term trend levels that are needed to house a growing number of U.S. households.","Since World War II, housing has normally led the way out of our cyclical recessions, but as economist Rogoff and Reinhart suggest, this time is different. In this recovery, the broader economy began to improve earlier in the cycle and we enjoy the benefit of improving global markets over the past couple of years in our Cellulose Fibers business. This time, however, it's Housing that has been lagging. Ironically, it now seems that the broader economy has hit a soft patch, perhaps in response to trouble in Europe and slower growth in China. Housing is at last beginning to play its historic role in putting people back to work.","There are plenty of reasons to feel cautious about the pace of the housing recovery, including election year uncertainty and the year end fiscal cliff. Additionally, high oil prices affect our cost directly in the form of diesel fuel, resins and glues and freight costs. And high gas prices affect consumers, especially homebuyers in California. Nevertheless, our quarterly results show that we're improving our performance in this uncertain environment.","With respect to global economic conditions, over 1\/3 of our revenues come from exports of products from our Cellulose Fibers, Timberlands and Wood Products segments. Slower growth in the Eurozone and China affects demand for our products in these markets. Demand is also affected by supply from global competitors, adjusting to changing levels of regional demand. I'll discuss specific factors as I review results for our business segments.","Now I'll comment on the performance of each of our businesses in the third quarter. In Timberlands, we had a solid quarter, with earnings increasing slightly as a result of increased profits from dispositions. Export sales of logs from our strategically located Western lands are a competitive strength of Weyerhaeuser and they're an important component of our earnings. During the past quarter, demand from Japan, which is our largest export market, remained stable. Quarterly volume was down slightly due to the timing of ship departures. These shipments will be included in the fourth quarter results.","Over the past few quarters, we've commented on the slowdown of log exports to China, but noted that we expected some pickup in Chinese demand towards the end of the year. Our effectiveness in building longer-term reliable relationships with direct customers, together with some correction of temporary oversupply, resulted in a 9% increase in our shipments to China during the quarter. This increase helped to offset the slight decline in volume to Japan, which will be reversed in the fourth quarter.","In Wood Products, we again delivered strong year-over-year results and quarter-over-quarter results. Sales realizations increased for most products as a result of improved commodity prices, as well as a higher value product mix. The segment also benefited from the effective execution of performance improvement initiatives. The result, earnings nearly doubled compared with the second quarter despite slightly lower volumes for lumber and OSB.","Excluding special items, our $92 million in EBITDA for the quarter was up $102 million from the third quarter of 2011 and year-to-date, we're up $195 million, demonstrating the operating leverage that we have with our large scale and all product lines, especially lumber and OSB. Improvement year-to-date is a result of better market conditions but also from deliberate, across-the-board initiatives that we've undertaken to improve our performance. In total, these initiatives have contributed to more than half of our year-over-year bottom line gain.","Examples of these broad improvement initiatives include revenue gains from targeted price increases for both commodity as well as value added products, volume growth from an expanded presence in the repair and remodel market, reduced manufacturing costs from higher operating rates and greater manufacturing reliability and lower raw materials cost due to improved log recovery, reduced purchase of outside veneer and reduced use in cost of wax and resin additives. We still have further opportunity to improve our performance, but we're pleased with our progress.","Moving to WRECO, as Kathy noted, earnings increased slightly from the second quarter results as home closings rose 21% due to steady market improvement, as well as seasonal activity. This quarter, we had no significant land sales compared to the second quarter when we sold our Cross Creek Ranch master plan community in Houston. Sales continued to show the strength of the housing recovery as quarterly sales increased 45% compared with last year. Year-to-date, total sales were 40% greater than last year and they're up in every one of our markets. This sales activity led to a 74% increase in our backlog compared with last year.","The national housing market continues to improve in a measured pace, tracking job growth and a steady decline in both new and resale home inventory. Real Estate is still local [ph], however, and the pace of recovery differs among our regional markets. In the quarter, our most improved market was the Inland Empire of California, where sales doubled from the second quarter and tripled from one year ago as we tap the market opportunity with attractive, newly designed homes for more price-sensitive buyers. Sales in the Washington DC market,  which typically are slow in the summer months, showed surprising strength compared with last year. This improvement included sales of affordable homes, which are required as part of our development entitlements in this region.","Year-to-date, our most improved markets are Arizona, Las Vegas, and California's Inland Empire, followed by solid gains in the Puget Sound region, Washington D.C. and San Diego. The L.A. Ventura market is beginning to show signs of slow recovery, and Houston, which has been a solid market during the downturn, has maintained steady volume this year.","My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fibers segment. Our Cellulose Fibers segment earnings increased significantly as a result of less plant maintenance downtime and higher productivity. This improvement came despite challenging global market conditions. Price realizations were approximately flat, holding better than commodity grade index prices which declined during the quarter.","With approximately 2\/3 of our Cellulose Fibers sales coming from exports, foreign exchange rates can affect our results. During the quarter, the Canadian dollar rose slightly, while the euro strengthened late in the quarter in response to new Eurozone policy measures. Both changes should help the relative competitiveness of our Cellulose Fibers segment.","We continue our dual focus of continuous improvement in our manufacturing and marketing, while also developing innovative new products. Innovation over time will provide margin uplift and allow us to continue to grow with global customers. Construction is nearing completion at our new modified fiber manufacturing plant in Gdansk, Poland. Product qualification is set to begin by year end, and we should begin to deliver product by midyear 2013.","Our newest announced product is THRIVE, a proprietary form of thermaplastic composite, using a sustainably sourced cellulose fiber from our pulp mills as a reinforcement additive. The product will initially be used in automotive parts and household goods. This green polymer product will help manufacturers of auto parts improve performance characteristics and cost compared to their existing petroleum-based parts. This will not have a significant near-term financial effect for us. It's an example of our success in developing innovative new products from cellulose, in this case, for new customers, starting with 4 today with global potential in the future.","Before turning to Patty for comments about our fourth quarter outlook as well as financial highlights, I will talk about our recent decision to increase our dividend by 13%, from $0.15 per quarter to $0.17. When we converted to a REIT in 2010, we stated that our objective was to set an attractive dividend that would be both sustainable and could grow over time. In setting our initial post-conversion dividend level, we wanted to strike the right balance, considering our overall economic outlook, our outlook for near-term company performance, our targeted capital structure and the affordability of our targeted dividend.","On last quarter's call, in response to a question, I said that we would set our dividend not looking back but looking forward, considering our future earnings potential, as well as our view of market conditions. Although we remained cautious about the pace of recovery in the U.S. and global economies, our board was pleased to take action at this time to increase our dividend. This decision was based upon the clear results of operational improvements to enhance performance within each of our businesses that are evident in our report this morning and are confident that housing fundamentals are improving.","And now I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss our fourth quarter outlook, as well as provide financial highlights.","Patricia M. Bedient","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. Notwithstanding the uncertainty in the overall economy, we are pleased that nearly one month into the fourth quarter, we continued to see the sustained signs of an improving housing market.","Our outlook for the fourth quarter is summarized on Chart 12, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the West, domestic log prices are anticipated to be slightly higher on volumes comparable to Q3. Export volumes to Japan, our highest margin log, remain strong and are expected to increase in the fourth quarter. Housing markets in Japan have been stronger this year, driven by a combination of historically low mortgage rates, planned increases in consumption taxes in later years and some rebuilding and repair activities from last year's tsunami. The weak euro continues to create heavy price competition from European laminated lumber. Demand and prices for our logs to China are expected to increase moderately, with improvement in both residential and commercial construction activity.","In the South, realizations for logs are expected to be slightly lower due to a smaller piece [ph] size, with a heavier mix to chips and fiber. Fee volume is likely to be slightly higher seasonally. We will see significantly increased costs, mainly due to the timing of silviculture treatments. Nonstrategic land sales are expected to be flat to Q3. Overall, we expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the third quarter.","In Wood Products, the fourth quarter is traditionally one of the weakest earnings quarters of the year due to seasonality. While we do not -- while we do expect to see some softening as we progress through the quarter, to date, prices and volumes have been unusually strong for this time of year across most product lines. We will likely have reduced volumes later in the quarter and we will continue to match supply with demand. We continue to focus on driving operational improvements across the system and we will take the opportunity with the slower holiday season to complete some minor maintenance in capital projects. We expect to be solidly profitable in the fourth quarter, but well below third quarter levels.","Moving on to Cellulose Fibers. In the fourth quarter, we expect sales realizations for pulp to decline, primarily due to softening in the fluff market, which lagged the decline in NBSK. Global softwood inventories are in the normal range, but uncertainty in the global economy still exists. Sales volumes are expected to increase somewhat compared to the third quarter.","Our final planned outage for the year was completed earlier this month, with downtime of about 6 days, compared with maintenance downtime in the third quarter of 13 days. As a result of fewer maintenance days, maintenance expense will be lower. Energy costs will likely be somewhat higher as a result of lower electricity sales and somewhat seasonally higher natural gas usage. We expect that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment for the fourth quarter will be comparable to the third quarter.","In our Real Estate segment, we anticipate home closings to increase to just over 800 compared to 615 in Q3. The mix of closings in the fourth quarter will include fewer closings from certain high-margin communities in San Diego and increased volume of affordable homes with low margins due to regulated sales prices. As a result, although our homebuilding activity continues to be strong, we will likely see margins drop to below 20% in the fourth quarter. The increased closing volume will also result in higher selling-related expenses. We expect that earnings from our single-family homebuilding activity will be slightly lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. And it is possible that the fourth quarter could have some land sales, although the amount and the timing is difficult to predict. There was no significant land sale activity in Q3.","Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. Through the third quarter, capital spending for Weyerhaeuser Company totaled approximately $219 million. We still expect total spending for the year, which includes reforestation, to be around $290 million. We ended the quarter with cash of $608 million. Major uses of cash during the quarter included debt maturities of approximately $181 million and a $97 million payment on a note related to a timber monetization for timber that was sold in 2002. During the fourth quarter, we expect to receive about $110 million when the related financial investment matures.","Cash received for stock option exercises during the quarter was approximately $66 million, driven by the higher stock price. Our dividend payout in the fourth quarter will increase to approximately $92 million, reflecting the increase in the quarterly per share dividend to $0.17, as Dan has already discussed. We have no further debt maturities this year and we expect working capital balances to decline seasonally by year end, however, not to the levels of last year end given our stronger wood products markets.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Patty. Quarterly results from all of our business segments demonstrate the operating leverage that we have to a recovering housing sector, as well as operational improvements in each of our businesses that are increasing our competitiveness. We will continue to focus on what we can control, improving our operating performance and our relative competitiveness, being prepared to take full advantage of the quality of our assets, the strong relationships with our customers and suppliers and the commitment of our dedicated employees.","And now we welcome your questions and comments.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I got a question on cost. You've done a good job of containing SG&A over the past year. But as we look forward to 2013, there's a possibility you could be growing revenue, maybe in the double digits. You should be seeing volume recovery in most of your businesses. Can you talk about how you think about SG&A targets in that environment? And then in terms of working capital requirements, as you ramp up volumes, what are the working capital needs and maybe the incremental capital spending that's going to be tied up as we move closer to a million starts next year or the following year?","Daniel S. Fulton","Let me first talk about -- address your question on SG&A. We've made a tremendous amount of progress on bringing down our overhead expenses over the last 3- to 4-year period, and our journey is not done. We continue to look for opportunities to continue to ratchet down our G&A. However, we are now shifting to a period where we expect to be growing because of the pickup in housing and the need to be restaffing in certain locations. A lot of the restaffing is not reflected in G&A, it's cost of sales headcount. So we continue to be focused on managing our G&A and keeping the gains that we've made during this downturn. We would expect selling cost to be increasing, coincident with the pickup in sales because fundamentally, most of our selling costs are tied to revenues. And we would expect selling-related expenses to be increasing as we begin to recover. As we think about working capital, Patty commented that we shouldn't expect the same level of working capital at the end of this year in our Wood Products business as we had last year because we are selling more material and we are manufacturing product not just to maintain our current level of business, but as I mentioned in my remarks, we are increasing sales in certain channels. And so there will be some additional working capital related to increased sales activities as we go into 2013 and as we continue to expect housing starts to recover. We would expect the same thing to be showing up in our WRECO business throughout 2013 because we expect our volume to be increasing coincident with the pickup in housing.","Patricia M. Bedient","Maybe the one thing that I would add, and you saw that in this quarter, as Kathy commented, where G&A will go up to the extent that it -- the stock price impacts, the variable compensation in terms of marking our share price to market. So I look forward to that part of the G&A going up, but as Dan said, we'll continue to stay very focused on holding on to the G&A gains and really increasing that through productivity and some of the activities that we have underway.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's very helpful. And then maybe just shifting gears to Chinese log demand. You referenced expectations for improved log prices on Chinese homebuilding activity. I'm just wondering, can you tell us what you're seeing in October and is that something that you're really seeing now? Is there sort of an expectation for an improvement towards the year end? Or can you just give us any kind of color on what you're seeing now?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, we saw some pickup in our export activity in the third quarter, probably a little bit better than we might have imagined. We had been anticipating some market recovery towards the end of the year. We were able to capitalize on better conditions in the third quarter, and we would expect that to continue through the fourth quarter and into next year. Some of that, as I said, is related to working down inventory, generally in China, but also us continuing to capitalize on the relationships that we have developed with our Chinese customers. There was a slowdown in construction in China that now seems to be reversing itself a bit. Remember that we're not selling structural grade material into China for wood frame housing. The wood that's going to China is used in construction for, primarily, forms as well as other industrial uses. But I think we're seeing the benefits of the predictability of our logistics, the quality of our logs. And so we expect that we continue to take advantage of the opportunity in China, recognizing once again that our largest market is Japan, where our export volume for logs.","Patricia M. Bedient","But Anthony, to your question, what we're seeing for China now, we are having -- and they are moderate increases, small, but we are seeing the pricing picking up on our China. And as Dan talked about, we really go through very established customer relationships. So it may be a little different than what you're seeing in the broader industry.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So 2 things. I mean, everything you've said about housing is right and bullish and I think we all feel pretty good about it. Was the increase in the cancellation rate anything special or is there something we should be watching for there? And then a second question, I know I've sort of asked of this question before. As I talk to Southern landowners, they tell me that rotations are changing dramatically just by default. Is your system not seeing that just because it's so big?","Daniel S. Fulton","With respect to cancellation rates, I think they've been extraordinarily low for the last several quarters, and I think, Mark, what we're seeing is a return to perhaps a little bit more normal situation. The primary reason today for cancellations is the channel and [indiscernible] qualification, which is still a difficult process for most home buyers. And so there is some level of discouragement that leads some to drop out but I -- I don't view the uptick in cancellation rate to be troubling. In fact, there's a very low level of finished inventory in the market for new homes and the inventory levels of these sales have come down pretty dramatically. So there's a shortage of product out there and that causes me to feel relatively comfortable. Southern log rotations, we're not seeing any significant changes in our system.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Dan, again, I appreciate the increased data and kind of visibility inside Weyerhaeuser we continue to get from you guys. I did wonder today, can you give us any color on the non-strategic timber sale in the quarter, just in terms of location, acreage and values that you're seeing out there?","Patricia M. Bedient","Mark, this is Patty. Actually, it's not just one, there's a number of ones that we have that are small in size. Most of the activity that took place this quarter, I believe, was primarily in the South.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And do you have an expectation, Patty, for what we will see over the next 12 to 24 months in terms of aggregate levels of nonstrategic sales?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, Mark, it's difficult to know. As you know, those sales are lumpy. I wouldn't see a significant pickup in the amount of acreage that we would bring to market from a sale perspective, only because we've really optimized the portfolio. So in terms of additional non-strategic assets, as you know, we sold a fair amount over the past. In terms of things that might come on the market, I think we are seeing some pickup from the industry broadly, but difficult to know exactly what will happen over the next 12 to 15 months.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And could you talk a minute  -- at WRECO, what you're doing vis-\u00e0-vis lots and lots of options at this point?","Daniel S. Fulton","Yes, I mean, we always approach the WRECO markets differentially, Mark, as we've explained in the past. It's really a function of what the entitlement risks are in each market. We are always active in the market. We have a strong pipeline of lots at various stages. And so we're confident that we've got lot availability that we can see for an increase in activity in 2013. As we look out towards 2014, our plans are in place to be sure that we've got the improvements going in, so that we'll have finished lots for those timeframes. We also have lots, I think, as we discussed before, that where we have the ability to sell to other builders at the right time and the right place, and we've got the optionality in our portfolio to either build homes on those lots or to sell them to others, if that happens to be an advantageous strategy. The lot market is tightening up in most major metro areas, especially finished lots. So the industry is working through a lot of the lots that had been developed prior to the turndown in the cycle. Now, we're back into a mode of having to put in infrastructure improvements to complete new lots. And so that is causing some escalation in prices in most markets.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","The thing that stood out, and I know we're not back to normal times and who knows what normal will be. But when you go back in the past, it seems like you all had usually a rush of closings in the fourth quarter in Real Estate that really took the number up a lot. And again, knowing we're just on the turn, I can see why it might be premature. But is there anything else going on in that might make the pattern seasonally be different as we go through the next few years as housing, I assume, continues to recover as that happens? Or will we -- at some point -- or is this an unusual year that the fourth quarter is not really moving up a lot?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, our fourth quarter closing estimate is increasing, and that is typical with the seasonality that you observed in the past. I think that's typical, not just for us, but for other builders. And so we have actually a fairly significant increase in closings that are projected. As Patty pointed out, the margins will not be as great as what they were in the third quarter. And so that's a quarter-over-quarter comparison that's important to recognize. Q3 margins were higher than normal because of a mix that was heavier to San Diego, especially some projects in San Diego where we were closing out subdivisions and had very high margins. As we move to the fourth quarter, the shift of mix moves away from San Diego to more affordable markets where margins are lower and is further affected by the fact that we have a significant number of closings that we're projecting out of our Winchester operation in the Washington D.C. Metro area, where they will be delivering some affordable homes that are required as part of the entitlement process in Maryland and Virginia. And so those are very low margin homes that are part of an overall subdivision development. Those affordability requirements are imposed on developers in projects that are roughly 50 lots or more. And so what you're seeing really is a quarter-over-quarter comparison that is a mix shift and it accentuates those differences. But we still expect an increase in activity in the fourth quarter foreclosings. What is noteworthy this quarter, as we look at the fourth quarter, I think as Patty noted, normally, we'd have more slowdown in the Wood Products business. And what we're seeing is pricing hanging in there a little bit longer than what might be normal and I think that's related to construction activity, not for homes that will be delivered this fourth quarter, but early next year.","Patricia M. Bedient","So Chip, just to give you some numbers on the closings, if you went back last year in the third quarter, we were at 508, and we went to 582 in the fourth quarter. This quarter, the third quarter, we were at 615 and we'll be over 800 in the fourth quarter for this particular quarter.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And that's very helpful with the mix. It sounds like it's unusual. I just want a quick follow-up. I'm looking at your guidance for Wood Products, and we always -- as we all know, have to take it with a grain of salt given the volatility although there are lags. It just seems to me that you are taking a quite cautious view, especially given that in the last week or 2 we've seen a rise in the price of both lumber and OSB at least in the trade press. And now we've got this hurricane, which of course you guys don't have to worry about out there, that is about to visit us here on the East Coast. And so I mean, are you taking a large dose of the normal seasonality in putting that into your guidance? And -- or do you actually think this is -- that no, which -- are you being conservative?","Patricia M. Bedient","I think it's a fair statement, Chip, that our overall guidance is conservative. As you appropriately pointed out, volatility for pricing in both of those commodities has been a pleasant surprise, both in the third quarter. And as I said in my opening comments, to date, in the month of October, we've been pleasantly surprised with the strength of pricing. Just to give you maybe some way to gauge that a little bit, in lumber, every $10 of movement in price for us, in this quarter, it will be about $3 million per month, given the volumes that we're projecting for the fourth quarter. And in OSB, every $10 is $2 million a month. So those earnings move pretty dramatically with price increases. So if these price increases hold, we will be above the guidance that we gave you for the fourth quarter, and I think you know this. The nice thing about Wood Products is you do get some visibility as we go through the quarter in terms of what's happening out in the market, given the printed publications that come out. But we're pulling for higher pricing in both of those. And I would be very pleased later in the quarter to be reporting that our guidance for the fourth quarter was higher than what we're talking about today.","Daniel S. Fulton","Two final comments on that question, Chip. When the new housing start numbers were announced last week, that did cause some increase in activity among our customers because our customers are running with very thin supply inventory levels, and they would normally be managing inventory levels down at year end. And so good news with starts causes the channel to react relatively quickly, especially with limited amount of product in the channel. And then finally, we do care about the hurricane. That will potentially affect our manufacturing business in our woods on the East Coast, as well as overall market conditions for our customers, and so we're concerned about that just as much as you are.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions. One on WRECO to beat that perhaps into the ground and one on Cellulose Fibers. The closing that you're projecting for fourth quarter are actually pretty normal relative to your backlog if you look over history. And certainly, you've talked about mix and the fact you have more affordable housing being produced this -- or closed this quarter. Yet, traditionally, then the fourth quarter from an EBITDA dollar standpoint and operating profit dollar standpoint, has been in fact larger than the prior quarters. Should we now assume that this change in mix is something that we should expect for future periods? Are there any implications from this or is this really just a one-off factor? And when you're talking about mix, could you relate at all what the selling price changes were on what closed this quarter within your regions? On Cellulose Fibers, my question is have there been any positive or negative implication thus far in terms of your demand from some of the outages that we've heard about on superabsorbents relative to that Japanese factory explosion?","Daniel S. Fulton","So George, I'll answer it in the order that you asked them. With respect to the fourth quarter, it is a mix issue, especially relative to Q3, and it includes these affordable units. And the issue on the affordable units is that there's a different rhythm to them. So in our Winchester operation, which is where these sales are coming from, they are normally a pre-seller of homes. So they take an order and then they build the house and deliver it. With these affordable units, they are attached, they're part of a larger project. We build them and then when they are close to completion, we turn really the sales process over to the community entity that handles these affordable units. And so it's a larger number of deliveries all at one time. And so when you have low margins in a large group of homes, it will tend to drag down the overall mix. That's not something that I would expect over time, but there is some lumpiness to the way those affordable units are delivered. We are also seeing an increase in closings that tracks the sales that we've had earlier in the year in some of our lower-priced markets, and so that is also affecting margin. As we look at cash flow, the increased activity in closings will generate more cash flow even if margins are down a bit because fundamentally, we're recovering all of our costs, including the land cost that's invested in those slots. With respect to the question on the SAP...","Patricia M. Bedient","Maybe before you go there, Dan, in terms of the EBITDA quarter-over-quarter, fourth quarter last year to this year, the other thing that impacts that, George, I think you referenced that the average closing price itself. And you can see that delineated somewhat on Chart 10 that's in the packet. You can see the average closing price at the end of last year's fourth quarter was almost $400,000, this year it's $372,000. Right below that graph, you can see the average sale price, which came down through the end of last year and the beginning of this year, but now it's trending back up again. So it's a combination of those 2.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Patty, that's mix. So I mean, would you say that all your markets are seeing increases in selling prices even if the mix itself has changed the average price that you're reporting?","Patricia M. Bedient","We are seeing some. It's not a huge significant amount. We certainly will look forward to seeing more as housing recovery is greater, but...","Daniel S. Fulton","We did see a pickup in the quarter in September. So if we look at our -- September numbers are different than the quarterly numbers, but the September numbers, prices were up, I think, in every single one of our markets.","Question on the SAP outage in Japan, that did lead to some activity with some of our customers who are trying to replace the amount of production. I think that plant produces about 20% of that product worldwide. And so our key customers contacted us, and we've been taking some of their needs in order to fill the gap that they'll experience with that outage.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, with the housing momentum gaining the -- with the housing momentum improving, especially with the housing starts number that we saw a couple of weeks ago, which I think was a lot better than people's expectations, as you look at your Wood Products manufacturing footprint, is there any capacity that right now isn't running that you think you will be bringing back into 2013?","Daniel S. Fulton","We're operating all of our lumber manufacturing facilities today. We're operating all of our OSB facilities. They have -- they are not running 100%. So they have some capacity potential. In our engineered wood products facility, we still have some mothballed facilities. The operating rate in our engineered manufacturing operations is lower than it is with OSB and lumber, and so we have the ability to ramp up production in order to meet demand in the near-term. And we have no announcements at this point nor we have made any decisions about when to bring back shutter capacity.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, understand that. And then as you're going to go through your budgeting process for next year, would you be able to share what housing starts number or a relevant range for housing starts number that you would expect PTUs [ph] as you think about budgeting within the Wood Products business next year?","Daniel S. Fulton","We will share that on our next call at the beginning of the year. So we're tracking a number of outside forecast. The ranges today for 2013 from third-party forecasters that we track range from about $900,000 up to as high as $1.2 million. We'll have a better handle on that at year end and then we will share with you what we are using for planning purposes and that will help you calibrate perhaps what we're expecting to be delivering in our Wood Products business, our Timber business and homebuilding.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I was wondering if you can talk a little bit about Southern sawlog markets. So we've seen a reasonable pickup in housing activity, wood product prices are up, but it doesn't seem like there's much traction in terms of log prices. I'm just wondering, what do you think is holding that back and what it will take to start to see a pickup in turn there?","Daniel S. Fulton","I think it will be consistent, steady demand. And we would expect some pickup in response to increased activity. It continues to be a regional market, Gail, as you know, and so it starts pickup generally. There's opportunities in the marketplace to manufacture more in certainly our Wood Products facilities as well as third parties. And I just think it's going to be continued uptick in demand that will tension the market then you should start to see some movement.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then in terms of homebuilding activity, when you look at kind of the sales activity that you're seeing, is the mix of business what you would expect to be normal, aside from the affordable housing issues that you're having in the fourth quarter? But I mean, are you seeing kind of the new homebuyers versus the mix you'd expect of new homebuyers versus move-up buyers, et cetera, that you would be expect in kind of a more normal housing market?","Daniel S. Fulton","We are. I mean, we sell to a broad range of customers. The activity that I talked about this morning in the Inland Empire has been reassuring for us because that market has been very slow, and so we've seen a steady increase in activity, and I think we found a sweet spot in terms of price and product for that market. So that's a first-time buyer product. In some of our other markets, we've seen move-up activity being stronger. Las Vegas is a market where we've had some real success in move-up housing. So I would say it varies by market. We're not seeing any noticeable long-term shifts in demand in terms of the kinds of homes and the kinds of features. We're all focused on affordability, and we're focused on getting homebuyers confident again to go back into the marketplace. And so we're starting to see that activity and each of our local markets are responding with new product that meets the needs of today's buyer. Not seeing any significant long-term shifts at this point.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Do you have a sense yet as to what your pension expense might be looking if rates, discount rates stay roughly where they are for next year versus this year?","Patricia M. Bedient","Mark, we'll be going through those calculations here shortly. We really haven't finished that work up yet, so I really don't have anything to share at this point, but we will be going through that on our fourth quarter call.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. If I could add one more. Do you -- I know last year, you had a pretty big increase in the amortization of actuarial loss that went up by, I think, about $70 million. Does that stabilize this year or does that also go up again this year?","Patricia M. Bedient","I have not gone through that computation, so I would just be speculating, sorry.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And then real quick, so the lumber panels, you mentioned you're operating at kind of 80%, 85%, if I caught you right.","Daniel S. Fulton","Yes.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. The types of housing starts increased, particularly the upper end, that some of the forecasters are talking about, would potentially imply that, quite frankly, you would struggle to meet all the demand and maintain market share. Am I missing something there? And what can you do? Is there flex in your system now where you can meet that higher demand if need be fairly quickly?","Daniel S. Fulton","We have flex in our lumber business because we have the ability to add hours and ultimately, if demand is sustained, to add some shifts. And then there is -- we have continued to make improvements in the productivity in the throughput in the mills that we do have. Our OSB mills have some flex capacity as we ramp up. And what we'll do is focus on serving the markets where we optimize our margin with longer-term relationships and we optimize our strategic advantages. So I would say we're looking forward to the opportunity to challenge ourselves, Mark, with that increased activity.","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes, especially as we look at our lumber system, Mark, we do have the ability to do some debottlenecking across the system as the demand picks up. So we're looking at the ability to do that first with noncapital solutions and then obviously, to the extent that there are other capital things that would give us some additional capacity that we have in front of us, we'll be looking at doing that as well.","Operator","Your next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just wondering, I actually missed your discussion of how many lots you had. I think you said 27,000 within WRECO and you had a big position in Nevada, which I missed.","Daniel S. Fulton","Yes, so what we said was that we have control of about 27,000 lots in our primary markets. Those are lots that are intended for our own homebuilding operations, as well as for sale to other builders. Of those lots, roughly 80% are owned and 13% are optioned. And then additionally, we control about 67,000 lots in a large master plan in Nevada. And that is a project that -- where we put the development and construction on hold, depending on improvement in local market conditions. The majority of those lots are held under a long-term option and the value of that particular property is based upon its development rights, and in particular its water rights. When you look at our lot position, we have always sold some portion to third-party builders. And what that gives us is a tremendous amount of optionality because we can choose to shift the mix between what we build and what we sell. So in general, about 25% of the lots that we control have been targeted for sale to the third parties, but we do had the ability to shift that mix depending upon opportunities in the marketplace. The length of our lot type line varies by market based upon local entitlement conditions. So we have a much longer position in a place like California where entitlements are very difficult, and a short position, in a market like Houston, which has no zoning and one can go through the process relatively quickly. And in some markets, we are developing the majority of our own lots and others. We continue to purchase lots from third-party land developers.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","So the 27,000, are those basically shovel-ready? And how would that compare to your target inventory in a normal housing environment?","Daniel S. Fulton","They are not all shovel-ready, but they are -- we control them and we have some level of entitlements. And what we do is we manage the development of these properties so that we're not investing in a lot of infrastructure earlier than we need to. So we're comfortable with the position that we've got. As the market picks up, we will continue to perhaps move the location of the lots around and the investment in lots, but that's an ongoing process based upon local demand and local opportunities.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Could you just remind me the time lag between when a home is sold and closed?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, that varies. So in some cases, we have finished homes. Houston is a market, for example, where we historically have built homes on a speculative basis because there is a large group of buyers in Houston that are relocating there, primarily in the energy business. And when they come to town, they need to buy a house. And so that house needs to be ready to move in, in probably a couple of months. If it's a completed home and if we sign a contract, in today's market, it's likely 60 days to go through that processing for a mortgage. And then the other extreme would be a pre-sale, which we do in most of our markets where we have a model complex, a buyer comes in, they sign a contract and then we build the house and the construction timeframe can run from, say 90 days to 6 months, depending upon the complexity of the house and the finish and ultimate price range and then you'd add the closing timeframe to that. So if it's a pre-sale, the homebuyer's going through the mortgage qualification process while the home is being built.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Again, sorry to beat the homebuilding issue to death, but just one quick question there. Can you tell us what your community count is on the WRECO side and how that's changed over this year and also on that, where you envision that going, I guess, in 2013?","Daniel S. Fulton","The community count for WRECO is down just a bit this year. And so what is happening in the homebuilding business at all times is you're continuing to open new communities, you're closing out new communities. Total community count today for us is 66 and we would expect that to be increasing next year. One of the things that we have focused on, especially over the last 2- to 3-year period is the sales per community. So we have focused on increasing the effectiveness and the productivity of every one of our communities to the point that today I think, based upon our data, we've got the highest number of closings per community of any public builder.","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And are you seeing credit trends among new homebuyers today or existing homebuyers, are using that going down the credit curve, so to speak, or is it still mostly in people with very high FICO scores, people that could get mortgages much easier? Are you starting to see some thawing of credit?","Daniel S. Fulton","Still very high FICO scores. Mortgage qualification process is challenging. We're still waiting for a definition of qualified residential mortgage through the consumer product protection bureau and also coming out of Dodd-Frank. That's an issue that needs to be addressed in the industry. Right now, the initial proposals continue to be for a 20% down payment. I think that's too difficult. And there needs to be some moderation and the pendulum swung very far to tightening credit, and I think that longer term, we need to see some moderation in that process.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just 2 questions on Wood Products. You obviously saw OSB prices jump in the 2012 here and they seem to remain high. How do you see about the -- what do you think about the sustainability of that market? And then also on lumber, although it's come up, we're still below long-term averages. Just your future sort of view on that pricing dynamic as well?","Daniel S. Fulton","I'll take lumber first, Paul. I mean, we take the long view on lumber and look at total projected North American starts, both U.S. and Canada. And we look at the relationship that we have with lumber that has historically come from Canada. We would expect demand to be increasing as the market recovers and we would expect a healthy environment for lumber. I can't project future prices. With respect to OSB, the market has been tight. Most operators are producing at relatively high levels. As I mentioned earlier, when the new starts number came out last week, it was evident that the supply channel was pretty thin. And so I think that's what's been helping OSB prices and we would expect that -- we've got a long way to go in this recovery. As I mentioned, today's levels are still very, very low compared to historic starts numbers and long-term trend numbers, and so we're bullish on the long term.","Okay.

We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.","On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer and Devin Stockfish, Senior Vice President of Timberlands.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Beth and welcome everyone. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $255 million or $0.34 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 billion.","Third quarter results include a $41 million tax benefit related to our previously announced U.S. pension plan contribution. Excluding this special item, we earned $214 million or $0.28 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA for the company totaled $505 million.","Our third quarter results reflect solid operating performance in the face of challenging headwinds, including severe weather and certain Chinese trade policy and unusually volatile markets for lumber and oriented strand board.","Our business is adapting changing conditions throughout the quarter and we remain relentlessly focused on the things we can control, improving our relative performance versus the competition and delivering on our commitment to disciplined capital allocation.","During the quarter, we demonstrated our discipline commitment to capital allocation, by increasing our quarterly dividend by 6.3% to $0.34 per share, repurchasing $290 million of common shares and announcing a series of actions to substantially reduce our pension liabilities.","In August, we also announced that I have elected to retire in early 2019 and that Devin Stockfish, currently Senior Vice President of Timberlands has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 01.","Adrian Blocker, who leads our Wood Products business will succeed Devin as Senior Vice President of Timberland and Keith O'Rear, who leads our Wood Products sales and marketing organization will become Senior Vice President of Wood Products.","As Beth mentioned, Devin is here in the room with us this morning. He will be participating in the Q&A and will make some remarks afterwards to close the call.","Right now, let me give some more detail on our business results. I'll start with a few comments regarding the housing market. Significant discussion is occurring regarding the trajectory of the U.S. housing market. The market continues to grow.","Total start increased nearly 4% year-over-year in September, despite disruption from Hurricane Florence. On a year-to-date basis, single-family and total starts have risen 6%. Repair and remodeling activity, which drives about 40% of lumber demand, is up 7.5% compared with the year ago.","However, recently monthly housing statistics have been volatile and in some cases softer than expected. We see no evidence of a change in underlying demand for housing. Employment and wages continues to rise -- employment and wages continue to rise with unemployment at the lowest level since 1969.","Consumer confidence began 2018 about previous session highs and has increased sharply as the year has progressed. Builders reports strong demand at entry-level price points and indexes of builder sentiment remained very positive.","However, the rate of housing market growth appears to have moderated slightly, indicating a potential mismatch between demand and available supply. However, mortgage rates remain relatively low on a historical basis, continued increases in home prices and interest rates may be causing buyers at higher price points to recalibrate their expectations if they take affordability into account. We expect will resolve as buyers and builders adjust product in response to the changing market backdrop.","For 2018, we anticipate total housing starts will be slightly less than 1.3 million and we expect continued market growth in 2019.","Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands charts four to six. Timberlands contributed a $126 million to third quarter earnings and $206 million to adjusted EBITDA. Western Timberland delivered $121 million of third quarter EBITDA, $31 million lower than the second quarter.","Average log sales realizations declined, fee harvest volume decreased 2% and row costs were seasonally higher. Unit logging and hauling cost also increased as we do more high elevation harvesting during the summer months.","Compared with a year ago quarter however, Western EBITDA increased $10 million due to higher domestic and export log price realizations. Western domestic log markets were highly tensioned throughout the first half of 2018. As we enter the third quarter, strong lumber pricing and fear of another challenging fire season drove many Western mills to build larger than normal log decks to avoid the risk of downtime.","Although the Pacific Northwest fire season arrived early, it was not severe and logging conditions remained very favorable throughout the third quarter. By early August, momentum in the domestic log market had reversed. Strong log supply, declining lumber prices and a pause in Chinese log demand due to the trade dispute put downward pressure on prices and domestic log realizations declined through the remainder of the third quarter.","Turning to our export markets, Chinese construction activity remained solid during the third quarter. Log inventories at Chinese ports continued to decline, ending the quarter at approximately 3.7 million cubic meters, 12% below second quarter levels.","In early August, the Chinese government announced its intent to impose a tariff on Western logs. Our China export log volumes declined in response to the uncertainty regarding implementation. The tariffs were implemented on September 24 and our Hemlock and Douglas fir log exports to China are assessed at a 5% rate.","Average realizations for the third quarter were off slightly compared with the second quarter as we adjusted pricing in response to the tariff.","Compared with a year ago China log sales volumes were lower due to the trade dispute, but average realizations were slightly higher.","In Japan, demand for our logs remained solid but log sales volumes decline modestly due to timing as typhoon activity delayed ships during the month of September. Average log sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter.","Compared with a year ago quarter, sales volumes to Japan were modestly lower and realizations improved substantially.","Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $80 million to third quarter EBITDA, $4 million less than the second quarter. Average realizations southern saw logs increased slightly compared with the second quarter and average pulpwood realizations were flat.","Sales volumes declined compared with the second quarter as hurricane Florence felt weather-related downtime for third-party customers as well as our own mills. Our operations along the Atlantic Coast curtailed harvesting for up to a week to ensure employing contractor safety during the slow-moving storm and fee harvest declined 2% compared with the second quarter.","Per unit harvest and hauling cost increased as we harvested a greater mix of things in the quarter and also incurred longer hauling distances as we flexed harvest operations to available wet weather ground.","Southern log export volumes increased compared with the second quarter, although demand eroded following Chinese implementation of a 25% tariff on Southern panel logs on August 23. Average realizations for southern export logs declined as we adjusted pricing to offset a portion of the tariff. Export logs represent less than 2% of our southern fee harvest volume.","Compared with the year ago quarter, Southern Timberland's EBITDA declined due to lower harvest volumes associated with hurricanes and higher fuel cost. Northern Timberlands contributed $4 million to EBITDA a $1 million more than the second quarter and comparable to a year ago.","Fee harvest volumes improved seasonally in most areas and average realizations increased modestly due to mix. The Timberlands business continues to make good progress against its 2018 operational excellence initiatives and is on track to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for the year.","Key focus areas include improving the productivity of harvesting and hauling operations, reducing road cost, optimizing forestry spending and maximizing the revenue from every log we harvest.","Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 7 and 8; Real Estate & ENR contributed $36 million to third quarter earnings and $86 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA increased by $39 million compared with the second quarter and [technical difficulty] compared with a year ago.","Real estate sales increased significantly due to typical seasonality. Third quarter also included a large acreage transaction in Montana, which accounted for approximately half of the acres sold in the third quarter. Average price per acre declined due to mix as Timberland prices in Montana are regionally lower.","Average land basis on property sold was modestly higher than second quarter and significantly higher than third quarter 2017 due to the greater mix of Montana acres. As a result, the segment's third quarter contribution to earnings increased $14 million compared with the second quarter, but it was $11 million lower than a year ago. The real estate business is solidly on track to meet or exceed its targeted 30% premium to timber value for 2018. ","Wood Products, Charts 9 and 10; Wood Products contributed $213 million to third quarter earnings compared with $329 million in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $250 million. EBITDA for lumber totaled $118 million, $77 million lower than the second quarter and comparable to a year ago.","Lumber prices have experienced record volatility in 2018. The framing lumber composite hit record highs in the first week of June, peaking at $582 before decreasing due to improving logistics and seasonally slower lumber usage.","Pricing continue to fall through the third quarter as hurricanes and general market volatility, further dampened demand. From July through September, the composite lumber price drop approximately $140 or 25%, the steepest quarterly decline own record.","Our third quarter average sales realizations decreased 9% compared with the second quarter, while the framing lumber composite declined 13% compared with the second quarter average. Lumber sales volumes declined 6% and manufacturing cost increased primarily due to lower operating rates.","Although our lumber mills sustained no damage from hurricane Florence, our North Carolina mills lost several dozen ships as we took downtime to ensure the safety of our employees and equipment and regional flooding limited access and operations at some locations.","Canadian log costs were higher, especially in Alberta, where an unusually wet weather has increased hauling cost and limited log availability. Third quarter EBITDA includes $6 million of charges for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber, comparable to the second quarter.","Comparing our third quarter results with the year-ago quarter, higher average sales realizations for lumber were largely offset by higher log cost. Manufacturing costs were flat as we offset cost inflation, with operational excellence improvement.","OSB contributed $77 million to EBITDA, $52 million less than the second quarter and $25 million less than a year ago. OSB prices began to fall at the beginning of the third quarter and benchmark north-central pricing decreased $110 or 25% from July through the end of September.","Compared with the second quarter, our average sales realizations decreased 13%. Sales volumes decreased 11% due to an extended scheduled outage to replace the press [ph] at our Grayling Michigan mill. Including log sales volumes and other project expenses, the outage reduced EBITDA by approximately $25 million. Compared with the second quarter, fiber costs also increased.","Comparing our results to the year-ago quarter, average sales realizations for OSB decreased 2% and sales volumes decreased 10% due to the Grayling outage. Excluding the $25 million outage cost, OSB EBITDA would've been comparable to the prior year as OpEx initiatives offset cost inflation.","Engineered Wood Products contributed $48 million to EBITDA, $10 million less than the second quarter and comparable to a year ago. Average sales realizations improved approximately 2% compared with the second quarter and 89% compared with one year ago, as we continue to capture the benefit of our early 2018 price increase.","Sales volumes decreased as hurricane activity and heavy rains in Texas slowed demand and what are usually strong growth markets.","Distribution contributed $3 million to third quarter EBITDA, $9 million lower than the second quarter and $9 million lower than a year ago. Declining commodity pricing throughout the third quarter compressed margins and our Southeast distribution centers, lost multiple shipping days due to hurricane activity. The business also incurred $4 million of expense from wildfire damage at its Redding California facility.","Through its continued focus on OpEx, our distribution business made money in the quarter, despite one largest quarterly commodity price declines ever recorded. The business remained highly focused on managing cost and product margins.","The wood products business has made good OpEx progress on its 2018 initiatives to improve fiber cost and recovery, reduce certain controllable cost and capture the benefit of focused capital investment.","However, efforts to improve mill reliability, which is our largest opportunity area have been hampered by weather as facilities have coped with unusual winter weather, flooding and hurricane this year. Our teams remain highly focused on reducing controllable costs, increasing fiber recovery, improving mill reliability, enhancing product margins and maximizing the benefit of our capital investment.","However, there is still significant work to do to achieve the segment's full-year target of $40 million to $60 million.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.","Russell Hagen","Thank you, Doyle and good morning. The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in Chart 13 of the earnings slides. In our Timberland's business, we expect our fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $15 million to $20 million lower than the third quarter.","In our Western Timberland operations, we expect fourth quarter average sales realizations for domestic and export logs, to be lower than the third quarter average, while log sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher. Larger than normal domestic log decks built in anticipation of a challenging fire season, which did not materialize are expected to come down.","We also typically see a seasonal reduction in the supply from nonindustrial landowners in the fourth quarter, due to less favorable weather. We anticipate that overall domestic supply in the West will come back into balance with demand by year-end.","Japanese export log sales volumes are expected to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter, for some shipments scheduled for the third quarter were delayed due to typhoon activity. Fourth quarter average sales realizations will be lower.","Chinese export volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter, while average sales realizations will be lower. We remain optimistic on Chinese demand for Western logs despite near-term volatility caused by uncertainty with tariffs and trade policy.","We expect slightly higher unit logging costs in the West, while road and forestry spend will decline modestly. In the South, we anticipate fourth quarter average sales realizations will be comparable to the third quarter and fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher as we return to normal production after third quarter hurricane activity.","We own very little timberland in the areas of Florida affected by hurricane Michael and experienced minimal infrastructure and resource damage due to that storm. Civil culture and forestry spending in the South is expected to increase slightly as we deferred activities from the third quarter into the fourth quarter, due to severe weather.","In the North, we anticipate higher fourth quarter harvest volumes and average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. Real estate and energy and natural resources, earnings and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. Markets remain active across our ownership and we continue to see strong interest in higher and better used properties.","We now expect EBITDA for our real estate and energy and natural resources segment will be approximately $260 million for the full year 2018.","In the third quarter, land basis as a percentage of real estate sales was higher than our full year guidance of 40% to 50% due to the mix of acres sold. We now anticipate that land basis will be approximately 55% for the full year 2018.","Wood products market prices for lumber and oriented strand board have continued to decline in the fourth quarter. Logistical challenges improved over the summer, allowing supply to reach the market as seasonal demand moderated. In addition, hurricanes and general market volatility have continued to dampen demand.","We expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than the third quarter. For fourth quarter to date, our lumber realizations are $80 lower than the third quarter average and current realizations are approximately $100 lower.","For oriented strand board our quarter-to-date realizations are $35 lower than the third quarter average and current realizations are approximately $50 lower. As a reminder, every $10 change in lumber realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. Every $10 change in oriented strand board realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.","Western and Canadian log costs are expected to be lower in the third quarter and we anticipate improved unit manufacturing costs for lumber due to less weather-related downtime. Our Dierks sawmill was commissioned in mid-October and will begin ramping up to full capacity throughout 2019.","We restarted our Grayling, Michigan-oriented strand board mill on October 21, following the completion of the scheduled press replacement. We will be ramping up to existing capacity through the end of the year. We anticipate higher operating rates and increased sales volume through oriented strand board in the fourth quarter.","Sales volumes for engineered wood products are expected to decline seasonally, compared with the third quarter. Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. Contribution to earnings decreased $4 million in the third quarter, primarily due to an expected increase in our unallocated pension and postretirement benefit cost.","The second quarter included a favorable true up to finalize prior yearend estimates for pension plan assets and liabilities. We expect non-operating pension and postretirement expense of $17 million for the fourth quarter.","Now I'd like to turn to an update on our key financial items, which are summarized on Chart 12. Capital expenditures total $105 million from the third quarter. We continue to expect total CapEx for the full year 2018 will be approximately $420 million, $300 million wood products and $120 million for Timberlands. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is historically the highest quarter of capital spending.","Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with approximately $5.9 billion of debt outstanding. We have no remaining maturities in 2018 and we expect fourth quarter interest expense to be comparable to the third quarter. For taxes, we continue to expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be between 11% and 13% based on the forecasted mix of earnings, excluding third quarter special tax benefit.","In August, we announced a series of actions intended to reduce the liabilities of our US qualified pension plan, while maintaining its current funded status. ","As previously disclosed, we made a $300 million cash contribution to the plan in the third quarter. We also offered certain planned participants the opportunity to elect an immediate lump-sum distribution of their pension benefits.","Upon completion of this lump-sum offer in the fourth quarter, we expect to record a one-time non-cash settlement charge. We currently estimate this non-cash charge will be approximately $200 million pretax based on current actuarial assumptions.","Cash from operations during the third quarter was $87 million. Excluding the $300 million pension contribution, cash flow from operations would be $387 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8.6 million shares of common stock for $290 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $348 million. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $210 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization.","Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your question.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Russell. After the Q&A, we'll make a few comments on owned succession to close the call, but at this time, I'd like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning and congratulations Doyle and Devin. Congratulations to you and Devin on the transition. I am wondering if you could talk more about the cost inflation that you're seeing in Timberlands. I think your outlook indicates Western log prices will fall sequentially in 4Q, but even with that, it seems like Western prices are still going to be significantly above where they were say at the end of '16, but I think the segment EBITDA guidance is expected to be down maybe 10%, 15% versus where you were at the end of '16.","I guess this is cost-driven. So is there a lag in terms of passing through these costs? Is there a reason to think that maybe some of them will roll off in next year? Just kind of any color you could give on cost in Timberland would be helpful?","Devin Stockfish","Yes sure and so I guess just at a high level, certainly we are seeing some inflationary headwinds in the Western business. I would say on a year-over-year basis, if you think about the logging side as probably around 3%ish cost inflation year-over-year.","On the trucking side and this is more across the business as a whole, it's closer to 7% or 8% and that's largely driven just by contractor and trucking availability and some fuel price inflation as well and I would say, we're doing everything we can to do battle that inflationary headwind with our OpEx and certainly that's a big part of how we are operating really business wide, not just in the West.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. And in terms of a timeline for recovering those costs, would that be first half of next year or any sort of -- any kind of thoughts you can give on the timing?","Devin Stockfish","So if you think about passing those through really it ties back to what we're seeing on log prices and generally it's less specific to cost inflation and really just market dynamics with log prices and certainly as Doyle and Russell mentioned, I do think some of the supply-demand dynamics that we've seen in the Western market is going to be coming back into balance as we get into Q4 and I would expect to get back up to more normalized pricing in the West as we get into the back half of Q4 and into 2019.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's very helpful and then just kind of a question on whether I think you identified that as an impact in the South for both the Timberlands business and the wood product business. Is it possible to quantify for the two segments how much of a hit weather was in the quarter?","Doyle Simons","Sure. And we think weather total impact on the quarter Anthony was approximately $15 million and that includes from the hurricane, the Japan typhoon, the Redding fire at our distribution facility and higher Canadian log costs because of very wet weather.","If you take that $15 million and you break it down, about $5 million of it was in Timberlands, half of that from hurricane, half of it from the typhoon and approximately $10 million of it was in wood products. So that's how we would break that down.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Thanks everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and Doyle, congratulations to you and Devon and Adrian and Keith on the transition and the best of luck to everyone. ","I guess my first question on wood products, can you comment at all in terms of how production might run relative to shipments in the fourth quarter? Do you anticipate maybe having to take inventory down a bit further and that being something we need to consider in terms of our models beyond pricing and shipments and broadly where to say inventories are right now within wood products?","Doyle Simons","I think generally in wood products across the system, I would say inventories are normal to slightly elevated, but headed in the right direction. What I would tell you George, in the fourth quarter versus the third, I would actually anticipate our volumes would improve.","In lumber for example, our operating rates in the third quarter were in the high 80s versus where they were in the second quarter, which was the mid-90s that was a result of all the disruptions we saw from weather and primarily in the South in the third quarter.","So as we move into the fourth quarter George, we would anticipate operating rates returning to more normalized levels. So that's how we're currently thinking about it.","George Staphos","Okay. So ultimately, doesn\u2019t sound like you have to take any production down time to get the inventories balance, you just think demand will more or less take care of it from what we could see?","Doyle Simons","That is correct. We have no current plan for downtime and part of our overall velocities George has been to focus on cost and our current cost position allows us to continue to run our mills when it may not make sense for some others to do so. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it at this point in time.","George Staphos","Okay. Thanks for that Doyle. I appreciate the comments on the West in terms of Timberland. Those are very helpful. If it's possible, could you give us a bit more granularity on how Chinese log realizations trended in the quarter versus your expectations? I know you said they are up year-on-year. You said they were down in this quarter.","Where do they wind up maybe in absolute levels and where do they wind up relative to your expectations and I had one more question to follow up after that?","Doyle Simons","Yes, so just a little bit of context around China. So when you think about the Chinese export program off of the West, really as Doyle mentioned, when the trade dispute really started picking up steam mid to late summer timeframe, what that really did was it put a little bit of a pause into that market, just as people were trying to react and figure out how that was going to be implemented. And so you saw a little bit of slow down into the China market.","I would say that, that is beginning to normalize. At this point, if you think about a 5% tariff, that's really not enough to meaningfully impact the volume that we're going to flow into China kind of in the short to mid-term.","One thing to remember about China pricing however, is that there is a strong correlation to domestic markets in terms of how we price the China wood and that can really swing one direction or the other depending on what's going on in the domestic market and the Chinese demand.","I will say just on the demand side, we're still seeing strong activity in China, the inventory levels at the port are coming down. According to our folks in China, there are still good take away from the ports and so we would certainly expect as we get to the back half of the quarter that we're going to continue to see good demand out of China.","George Staphos","So Devin, it would be fair to say that the trend in the quarter was really driven more by domestic market and less in terms of export trends and trade issues, would that be fair for Timberlands?","Doyle Simons","It's a little bit of both really. If you think about what happened in the West in the quarter, it was really, it was a perfect storm of events. You think about the fire season that the mills across the West were expecting and really they were putting that in the context of 2017 when we had a really severe fire season in the west and so across Washington and Oregon, everybody was planning for that in 2018, never materialized.","Then you saw a lot of volume being built up at the mills and so very heavy large log decks. Additionally, with the high pricing that you saw in the West for the first half of the year that brought a lot of the marginal players bringing wood to the market, so that increased supply and then you overlay that with the trade disputes as some of the logs at least during a portion of the quarter that would have otherwise gone to China stayed into the domestic market.","And so really what that did, it caused a little bit of a supply-demand dynamic that, that was a little out of balance and so as all of the things begin to normalize, we head into the winter weather where you're going to see less volume flowing into the market, that will all normalize and I think you get back into balance.","George Staphos","Okay. I'll turn it over. Thanks for the time guys and good luck in the quarter.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, George.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian McGuire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian McGuire","Hey good morning, everyone and I'll also add my congratulations Doyle on a great run and best of luck to Devin in the new role here.","Devin Stockfish","Thank you.","Brian McGuire","Just following on from George's questions, I think and based on Russell's commentary around the pricing sensitivity, it seems like lumber for you guys will be close to breakeven in 4Q, maybe a little bit positive, but given you guys are one of the lower cost producers at this point, what do you think that kind of signals around current economics for call it marginal producers in the industry, you think more likely to see any capacity curtailments or getting that's just sort of normal fourth quarter seasonality and if we can little bit of rebound in pricing, you would expect nobody to really be thinking about taking an extended downtime?","Doyle Simons","I don't want to speculate on what others may do. As you know, as you probably know, there already have been some announcements as to downtime in the quarter. As I said our focus on cost and cost position puts us in a good position to continue to run our mills when maybe it didn\u2019t make sense for some others to.","I do think that the pricing scenario we're currently in will correct itself. Our best guess is by the end of the quarter, it will be headed back in the right direction. So we'll have to see how that plays out from a pricing perspective. So that's kind of how we think about it.","Brian McGuire","Okay. Just thinking about if prices don't recover, if they actually continue to slide in a worst case scenario, you're just thinking about the cash flow and the CapEx in particular. I know it's been elevated the last couple of years, there just been announcement on some wood products but could you maybe give us a sense of where that CapEx number could go, if we do get into more of an extended downturn here?","Doyle Simons","Sure. We have been spending approximately $300 million a year in CapEx in our wood products operation. We would anticipate that type of number in 2019 and then falling off to $250 million or so on a go forward basis.","We've always said that maintenance CapEx is probably $150 million to $200 million, not suggesting this at all but you could lower it down to that price or to that level in the event that you made the decision that was the right thing to do.","Again I'd go back to I think what we're seeing is a confluence of events that have led to this significant fall in the pricing including as Russell mentioned, a slug of supply coming in from Canada that was built up slower seasonal land hurricanes, a lot of events that we think will level out over time.","So we're not predicting a precipitous fall in lumber prices for any extended basis, but in response to your question, we could lower CapEx significantly if we made a determination that we needed to do that.","Brian McGuire","Okay. Just trying to stress the model. I know you guys have set the dividend at a level where you think it's supported regardless of environment and do you think that's probably one of those components that would factor in there.","Just last one for me, if lumber price is down, just wondering how you think that might impact either it be it prices, I know there is not a direct correlation per se there, but they did sort of compete with each other in some applications. So just wondering what your outlook is for either be bright EWP prices the rest of this year and into 2019?","Doyle Simons","Yeah, so EWP prices as we mentioned were actually up a little bit in the quarter that's a result of the price increase that we went -- that we put in earlier this year. So as you said, there is no direct tie between EWP prices. Those are done -- those price increases are set and implement over an annual basis, whereas lumber as we know it's price is determined every day.","So at some point if you said there was a significant change in overall demand for lumber and\/or EWP that could have an impact on pricing, but right now we anticipate prices will be steady for the balance of this year and into next year for EWP.","Brian McGuire","Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks again Doyle.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","Hey. Good morning.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Collin.","Collin Mings","First question for me just on the share repurchases over half the authorization was used in 3Q, I don't know if you can update us on how much has been purchased here 4Q today and maybe just more broadly update us on the appetite for repurchase activity just given the near-term cash generation isn\u2019t what it was a couple months ago?","Doyle Simons","Collin as mentioned, we did repurchase $290 million in the third quarter. As we always do, we will report the amount that we repurchased in the fourth quarter and when we do the fourth quarter earnings call. So we still had $210 million under the current authorization and we of course will be working with our Board as we always do own capital allocation as we move forward.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then just going back to roughly your comments as part of the sensitivity, just running some quick math, would it be fair to say if pricing stabilizes at this level that wood products, EBITDA generation would be maybe somewhere around the $100 million number, is there some other moving pieces we should consider in that or just some guidepost, would that be a fair way to think about it?","Russell Hagen","Collin I think as you look, clearly the pricing is pretty dynamic right now. As Doyle indicated, we would expect pricing to start improving coming into the latter part of the quarter, but as we stated in the prepared remarks, will be significantly down quarter-over-quarter.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then just follow-up, going a little bit back to Anthony's question earlier, just as part -- a bit surprised by the Timberland guidance for 4Q just given that I would be a really multiyear low contribution from that segment, I get in the response some of the questions that you have this optimism as far as pricing recovering on the log front as we kind of move through 4Q, but just in terms of what you're seeing real time if you will, is pricing stabilizing? Is there still been further deterioration? Maybe just talk us through that a little bit both domestically and export.","Doyle Simons","Yeah so what I would say is that we still have reasonably high levels of inventory across the mill set in the West and so we're really just at the point now where we're starting to move into the rainy season here in the West and so that's going to take a little time for that to work its way through.","I would expect you're going to continue to see the inventories at high level for the next several weeks and then as we get into the back half of Q4, I think you'll start to see that normalize and so I think we're still at a point where that's working its way through the supply demand dynamic getting back into balance, that will improve I think over the back half of the quarter.","And that domestic pricing that certainly is correlated to the export pricing as well. So those things typically move more or less in tandem.","Collin Mings","Okay. One last one for me and I'll turn it over. Just going back to some of the disruptions on the export market, a lot of has been made up over the last couple years really about the export opportunities out of the U.S., clearly some disruptions near term, recognizing again that the overall contribution from that is pretty de minimis for you guys.","But just long term, how do you think about that business and are you actively exporting outside or out of the US out right now?","Russell Hagen","Yeah so obviously there's a difference between 5% tariff that we're seeing in the West and a 25% tariff on the South. The 25% tariff is certainly more meaningful to that business. Now as you said just for context, it is a relatively small part of our overall business, both in the South and then certainly Timberlands wide.","We're continuing to ship out of the US South to China and India, that has gone down somewhat and certainly we're not ramping that up at the same pace that we had anticipated pre-trade dispute, but if you kind of step back and look at the opportunity over the long term, we're still very optimistic that that's going to be a good business for us.","We've been on the ground talking to customers in China. I think Southern Yellow Pine is a market that will ultimately be developed in a much more meaningful way in China. I think the demand is there. Really I think in the short term we're going to have to just work our way through until this trade dispute gets resolved, but I would expect that it will get resolved as they always do and then there will be a very I think a bigger opportunity for us exporting out of the South.","Collin Mings","Okay. I appreciate the color and again Doyle congratulations on your retirement and compliments at Weyerhaeuser and congratulations Devin on the new role.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Collin.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Mark Wilde with BMO. Please go ahead.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Doyle, Devin, Russ.","Doyle Simons","Good morning.","Mark Wilde","Doyle, it's been about 25 years of earnings calls, I think you're probably happy to see them come to an end.","Doyle Simons","I would absolutely agree with you.","Mark Wilde","We've must be in the same boat with you. Three questions I want to ask about; first, there have been a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal over the last couple weeks about kind of supply issues on Southern Timberland and I wondered if you guys would want to offer any thoughts on the substance of those articles, really had to do a kind of subsidies over the last 30 years for Timberland planting?","Devin Stockfish","Yes sure Mark, this is Devin. Really that was getting to the Conservation Reserve Program that's in place -- been in place for a number of years and so really that's nothing new. We've all been aware of that program for long time and really it's just one factor that plays into the overall supply-demand dynamic going on in the south.","It has certainly added some additional acreage over the years, but once again I think our optimism over the long-term is really about just the continued capacity coming online, the export opportunities over time, the diminishing supply from the Canadian lumber and the underlying continued improvement in housing.","And so it's a piece of the puzzle, certainly not anything that everybody wasn't I think aware of already in terms of how they think about inventory levels across the South. So I guess that's how we would speak to that.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Fair enough. Second question I had I think we've all been surprised for the last 10 years about what's going on in the housing market. I think the notion that we're topping out here around 1.3 million starts is a big shock to a lot of us.","I'm just curious if we are topping out here, can you talk about sort of the sustainability of the dividend if we don't see further improvement in the housing market?","Doyle Simons","Mark, first I would say I am not sure we agree with the premise and then I'll answer your question, go ahead.","Mark Wilde","No, I was just to say Doyle, I think a lot of us have kind of been assuming would at least get the 15 or 16, but if you look at the data over the last three or four months, it's not what it's showing us. So I am just saying if we're indeed topping out and I'm not arguing that we are, let's just talk about the dividend on that basis?","Doyle Simons","Sure, so let's assume for a minute that we top out the housing currently where we are, I think clearly that's a sensitivity we ran when we were coming over the dividend, we make dividend decisions for the long-term.","We all have to remember that just last quarter we had record EBITDA and our wood products operation and in very high levels of EBITDA across the company, and housing starts at one point to something.","So clearly, wood product prices have fallen. Again I think that's a confluence of events that just happen to fall in the same part and push prices down in the third quarter into the fourth quarter, but under your assumption of 1.3 million housing starts, I think this company in the way we're positioned and are focused on cost can generate a significant amount of cash flow and would be very comfortable with the dividend level on a go-forward basis.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right. That's good. That's what I wanted. Last thing I wanted to ask about it's just Northern Timberlands, we generated $13 million in EBITDA this year around 2.5 million acres. I'm wondering how you think about that piece of portfolio and I'm particularly wondering if this is just a kind of valuation arbitrage between kind of where warehouse or trades on an EBITDA basis and what you might be able to do with that Timberland generating a relatively modest amount of EBITDA?","Russell Hagen","So Mark, this is Russell, as we stated when we first completed the merger with Plum Creek that we are going to look at all of the components of the portfolio and that's the Uruguay operations kind of as part of that review and then we continue to look at the portfolio really in all regions and determine, which timberlands makes sense on a long-term basis, which are strategic and where we want to grow and where we might want to divest.","Again that's an ongoing process. The one thing I will say about the North is there are very low input costs. So it's very low-cost type operations, but again we'll continue to review the portfolio and if makes economic sense, we'll act on them.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Fair enough. Doyle, enjoy your retirement.","Doyle Simons","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Good morning and Doyle congratulations. It's been quite a long time that we've worked together. We certainly enjoyed it. So all the best.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Chip and I've enjoyed working with you and many others on this call as well. It's hard to believe it's been a number of years it has been. So thank you.","Chip Dillon","Exactly at least one us and that would be you haven't changed that much, but hey listen, I had a question about when I look at the Timberland, well we both have a few more gray hairs, but looking at Timberland in the segment, you've given us great detail in terms of the sequential expectation and yet when I look year-over-year, it looks down pretty sharply and I didn't know if you just step back from the fourth quarter of this year and how that looks versus the fourth quarter of last year, how would you break up that roughly, I don't know $50 million $60 million decline in EBITDA between what we see in terms of the export market on one hand and what we see in terms of the domestic market?","And then I guess the third bucket would be just you mentioned the higher unit costs, which would suggest you're going to harvest a little less, but you still haven't fixed cost of all the folks that are involved with that?","Doyle Simons","I think the year-over-year story is primarily around volume. If you think from a pricing perspective, it's not going to be all that much different year-over-year for the quarter, but it's primarily around volume and there's also certainly some cost inflation, which I mentioned earlier a little more on the transportation side, but a little bit on the logging side as well.","Chip Dillon","I got you and then I know you probably it's hard to tell, certainly given the fragmentation of the housing construction of marketplace, but as you look into 2019 to the best of your intelligence, are you seeing builders going into next year with less to do or is this pause you think largely seasonal in terms of what we're seeing in the data?","And if it is the case of they have left to do, is it because they just can't get the permits or the people to do the work or is it because there's truly perhaps the demand or affordability issue?","Doyle Simons","Yeah, so let me share with you kind of our view on housing and given it's a lot of thought and start with the fact that there's just a lot of noise out there. There is weather events. There is increase in interest rate, the political situation, the volatility in the stock market, but if you step back, housing fundamentals are still compelling.","Employment and wages continue to rise, consumer confidence is strong and while we've seen growth in housing starts for a number of years, we're still below the $1.3 million, which was -- we're still below $1.3 million which is not enough to replace the housing stock and meet the ongoing household formation and while interest rates are up they're still at relatively low levels.","Maybe more important Chip to your question when we talk to our customers, the big homebuilders out there, they're still optimistic about how -- they do have lot constraint, they do have labor constraints and I think that's the big thing holding them back.","So what we believe we're seeing right now is kind of a short-term slowdown in the growth rate on housing rather than something structural. Again, when we look at it, when we talk to folks about it, we see continued strength in growth in demand in housing on a go-forward basis.","The other thing I would mention is we're also encouraged by what we're seeing in the repair and remodeling market, which as you know is a key driver of lumber demand and that's up 7.5% or so this year and we anticipate that kind of growth in 2019 as well in that market. So that's kind of how we think about it.","Chip Dillon","That's very helpful. Thanks again, guys.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Steven Chercover with Davidson. Please go ahead.","Steven Chercover","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of nitty-gritty questions on the Wood Product segment. So first of all on the Distribution segment, I was wondering if there was any kind of inventory write-down in addition to the fires and everything else that's contributed to the decline?","Doyle Simons","The decline in distribution was driven by a couple of things. Number one, as we mentioned, we did have the fire at our Reading facility that was $4 million as result of some damage to inventory and equipment there. So that was $4 million of the impact.","Secondly, our Southeast distribution centers were down for a period of time because of the hurricane and then third is just when you have falling commodity prices throughout a quarter, that's going to have an impact on distribution. So those would be the three key drivers for the delta quarter over quarter.","Steven Chercover","Okay. Thanks for that Doyle and then next one is can Engineered Wood Products sustain the pricing momentum or even sustain current pricing when lumber has fallen so dramatically?","Doyle Simons","Engineered Wood Product pricing is going to be based on what happens on the demand side of the equation. Again we think housing is going to continue to improve, which will drive demand. We did see a falloff in demand in the third quarter.","As we mentioned that was driven by weather. There was extremely wet weather and what are historically very strong markets for EWP especially in Texas, which had and continues to have a lot of rain. So the key driver for EWP is going to be what happens on the housing front and as demand continues to grow in housing, we think that demand will be in place, which will support current prices and could even potentially projecting it could potentially lead to further price increases as we move into 2019.","Steven Chercover","Okay. Thanks and final question on lumber. If lumber prices were to stay in the current price range, would that put pressure on log prices? I'm wondering from a chicken and egg perspective, due to nonintegrated producers bid logs, so they are going to earn a margin on their lumber or the types of the lumber is a function of the incoming log price?","Doyle Simons","Well as we've seen historically there has been a direct tie between lumber and log prices, but as we've seen in the South, that's no longer necessarily the case. So we'll see how it plays out, but I guess most importantly we're pretty optimistic about lumber pricing headed back in the right direction, because if you really step back from a lumber perspective, is we think as you move forward assuming housing continues to improve, you're going to be in a mode where you're going to have growth and demand of somewhere in the 2 billion board feet range a year and you're going have growth in supply, net growth in supply.","So there is some coming out of Canada increases in the South of 1 billion board feet and that's going to be a pretty good dynamic on a go-forward basis.","Steven Chercover","Okay. Thanks Doyle and all the best to you.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly","Thank you, Doyle. Certainly want to add my congratulations. You've done impressive things at Weyerhaeuser. Two questions, with valuations in other wood-related businesses coming down, how do you think about the relative size of the TRS?","Is this an opportunity maybe to scale up the TRS and also how do you think about Timberland assets in the market now in terms of relative value?","Doyle Simons","So in terms of the size of the TRS, we really don't have any significant constraints on the ability to growth at this point. As always n valuation is what will matter in terms of -- in terms of any potential acquisitions.","We've said, we think our biggest opportunities would be on the Timberland side, but we would look for bolt-on acquisitions in wood products especially if they tied into our timber base. So that has not changed, but we will be very disciplined on acquisitions as we move forward.","In terms of timberlands, valuations are still at pretty high levels, but we will continue to look for opportunities to grow our timberland where we think we can create value for shareholders.","Mark Connelly","Very helpful. Thank you, Doyle.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Today's final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Quinn","Thanks. Just skidded under the wire here. Maybe just a question on whether you've noticed anything in the Timberland marking themselves in terms of valuations, whether they've come down at all due to the market drop in lumber and OSB prices over the year?","Russell Hagen","Paul, this is Russell. We really haven't seen a change in the overall market dynamics. It's actually been pretty busy second half of the year. As far as valuations, we're still seeing as Doyle mentioned strong valuations and high-quality timberlands are in demand and we're seeing those trade at good prices.","So the short-term dynamic that we're experiencing in the second half of the year, we haven't seen it impact Timberland values.","Paul Quinn","All right. That's all I had. Congrats Doyle.","Doyle Simons","Thank you very much.","Doyle Simons","So as I understand, that was our final question. As I mentioned earlier, as we close the call this morning, we want to make a few comments on succession and I wanted to personally thank all of you for your support over the last five years and as we mentioned, for many of you it's been 20 or 25 years.","I will say, it's been an absolute honor to lead Weyerhaeuser for the past five years. When I accepted the job, I told our Board that I would stay for five years and every day I would be relentlessly focused on five things; portfolio, performance, capital allocation, culture and people development.","I'm very proud of the progress we've made to position Weyerhaeuser to drive value for shareholders and I couldn't be any more excited about the energy and vision Devon, Adrian and Keith will bring to their new roles as they continue to drive improved operational and financial performance.","Those of you who know Devin, he is extremely smart, driven and dedicated. He shares my passion for developing people and getting results and he is also an outstanding role model for our core values.","And with that, I'd like to turn it over the floor to Devin for a few closing remarks.","Devin Stockfish","All right. Well, thanks Doyle. Well, first I want to take a moment just to thank Doyle for his tremendous leadership and contributions to Weyerhaeuser.","During his time leading this company, we focused and enhanced our portfolio of assets, improved our operating performance and delivered on a commitment to disciplined capital allocation. It's been a real privilege to work with Doyle over the last five years and I certainly wish him all the best in his retirement.","I am personally truly honored to be assuming the leadership of this great company. Our assets are world-class. Our employees are incredibly talented. Our strategy is sound and I'm privileged to be working with a terrific senior leadership team.","In the coming months and years, we're going to build on this strong foundation to make Weyerhaeuser the world's premier timberland and forest products company. I am very excited about the opportunities in front of us as we continue working together to drive value for shareholders through a relentless focus on industry-leading performance and disciplined capital allocation.","I've had the chance to meet many of you in person already and it certainly look forward to getting to know the rest of you better as I assume the role. So for now, thanks everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.

I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you Beth and welcome everyone. 2016 was a transformational year for Weyerhaeuser. Through our merger with Plum Creek and a $2.5 billion divestiture of our Cellulose Fibers business we became a focused timberland and forest products company and nearly doubled the size of our timberland holdings. In the midst of executing these portfolio changes, we maintained our relentless focus on performance. ","In 2016, we increased full-year EBITDA by almost 55% to nearly $1.6 billion. We delivered the highest annual wood products earnings in over a decade. We captured merger cost synergies faster than expected and raised our 12 month run rate target by 25% and we achieved over $100 million in operational excellence improvements. Finally, we returned $2 billion of cash to shareholders through the repurchase of common shares. ","For the full-year 2016, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of just over $1 billion or $1.39 per diluted share or net sales of $6.4 billion. These results include the solid fourth quarter performance I will highlight this morning. Our fourth quarter net earnings were $551 million or $0.73 per diluted share on net sales of $1.6 billion. This includes after tax earnings of $489 million from discontinued operations, primarily the gain on divestiture of our pulp mills and after-tax special charges of $44 million for a tax adjustment associated with repatriation of Canadian earnings following our Cellulose Fibers divestiture, merger related expenses, and some non-cash real estate impairments. ","Excluding these items, we earned $106 million or $0.14 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $400 million. This is an improvement of over 60% compared with a year ago and represents substantial increases in each of our operating businesses. Before discussing our business results in more detail, I will make a few comments on the housing market.","Single family housing activity continued a steady improvement in the fourth quarter. Single family starts rose 10% compared with the third quarter and ended up the year up 9% compared with 2015. Total U.S. housing starts finished the year at nearly 1.17 million, a 5% improvement from 2015. As expected, the single family share of activity increased during the year and multi-family activity remained volatile. For 2017, we expect single family housing starts to increase by over 10% and we anticipate total housing starts of approximately 1.25 million to 1.3 million. ","Economic fundamentals support a trajectory of continued steady housing growth. Employment and wages are rising. Consumer confidence is strong, mortgage rates remain historically favorable, and public surveys indicate that builder confidence remained near historic highs. Although builders are managing through some constraints such as availability of skilled labor, stringent permitting requirements, and land and construction cost inflation, our customers echo the optimism seen in builder surveys and feel confident that housing market will maintain solid upward momentum.","Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with timberlands. Chart 4 to 6, timberlands contributed 123 million to fourth quarter earnings, 1 million more than the third quarter and 223 million to adjusted EBITDA. Western timberlands contributed $101 million to fourth quarter EBITDA compared with 109 million in the third quarter. Export log volumes declined due to seasonally slower construction activity and timing of shipments. Average realizations, however, improved moderately across all export markets as market dynamics remained favorable. ","In Japan, housing activity remained solid with wooden housing start up 8% for the full year. Japanese lumber inventories which were elevated for much of 2016 after a delay in the consumption tax increase continued to decline to the seasonally slower construction period and are now at more normal levels. This created favorable supply demand dynamics and supported improved pricing in the quarter.","Pricing for our Chinese export logs improved also. Fourth quarter log inventory to Chinese ports were largely flat with third quarter levels and we experienced continued strong takeaway throughout the quarter. In the Western domestic market, sales volumes were lower as mills took holiday downtime but average realizations improved slightly. Low mill inventories drove demand particularly in Southern Oregon market. ","Our Western crews did a good job adjusting harvest plans to adapt to record October rainfall. Our fourth quarter harvest lines were unaffected by weather and we had no infrastructure damage. However, per unit logging cost and road spending increased compared with the third quarter due to the wetter weather.","Moving to the South, Southern timberlands contributed 112 million to fourth quarter EBITDA, up 4 million compared with the third quarter. Southern markets remained flat as mills had adequate inventory, and average log realizations were largely comparable to the third quarter. The harvest volumes increased modestly as fourth quarter typically included a higher volume of stumpage sales. As in the West, our crew successfully flexed target settings to adjust to November severe weather and we had no material damage to our timberland. ","Silviculture expenses declined as fourth quarter typically includes fewer site preparation and hardwood management activities. EBITDA for Northern timberlands totaled $7 million. This was unchanged from the third quarter on comparable prices and volumes. The strategic review of our Uruguay operations is proceeding well. We continue to see strong interest and look forward to providing further information when the review is complete. ","Real estate, energy, and natural resources, chart 7 and 8. Real estate and ENR contributed $13 million to fourth quarter earnings. Excluding special items, the segment earned $27 million, $12 million more than the third quarter. EBITDA increased nearly two thirds -- let me start over, EBITDA increased nearly two and a half times to $90 million. Our average price per acre declined due to mix as fourth quarter included a large transaction in Montana where timberland prices are regionally lower.","For the full-year 2016, we sold approximately 83,000 acres or roughly 0.6% of our land base. Fourth quarter special items included $14 million of non-cash impairments. These resulted from a change in strategy for several small legacy real estate projects that were formerly targeted for development.","The asset value optimization work continues to proceed well. As we indicated during our December Investor Day, we have finished applying the AVO process across our Southern ownership and are in the process of listings in the 500,000 newly identified acres. Our focus has now turned to the West where we are evaluating our Washington and Oregon acres. This work is going very well and remains on track for completion by mid-year 2017.","Wood products, charts 9 and 10. Wood products contributed $99 million to fourth quarter earnings. The business delivered full-year 2016 earnings of $512 million, the strongest annual earnings since 2005. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $132 million, $71 million lower than the third quarter primarily due to seasonally lower sales volumes and operating rates.","Lumber contributed $57 million to EBITDA, $28 million lower than the third quarter. Sales volumes declined 12%, average lumber realizations decreased 2%, and Western log costs increased. Operating rates were lower and unit manufacturing cost increased due to planned downtime for installation of capital projects at several of our Southern mills.","Heavy rains and regional flooding resulted in modest weather related downtime in some of our Western and Southern locations and higher manufacturing costs for our Canadian mills. EBITDA for OSB totaled $46 million, $17 million lower than the third quarter. Sales volumes declined 18% and average sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Operating rates declined due to downtime for planned maintenance as well as repairs to our Sutton, West Virginia mill.","As we previously disclosed, the Sutton mill experienced a fire on November 1st. This was an insured event. Repair activities progressed rapidly and successfully and the mill resumed full production around year-end. The net fourth quarter financial impact of this fire on OSB business was approximately $5 million, the amount of our deductible as we brought the mill up and received insurance reimbursements faster than expected. We anticipate no net financial impact from this event in the first quarter as modest repair expenses should be offset by reimbursements received within the quarter. ","Engineered Wood Products contributed $26 million to EBITDA, $17 million lower than the third quarter. Sales volumes for Solid Section and I-Joists declined approximately 10% and operating rates were lower due to planned maintenance and holiday downtime. Average realizations increased modestly. EBITDA for distribution totaled $5 million, slightly lower than the third quarter. By focusing on improving product margins and tightly managing cost, the business performed well in what is typically a seasonally challenging quarter.","I will now turn to discontinued operations chart 12. We closed the sale of our pulp mills and printing papers business on December 1st and November 1st respectively. This completed the divestiture of our Cellulose Fibers segment. Net after tax earnings from discontinued operations of 489 million are primarily comprised of the gain on these two divestitures.","Chart 13 operational excellence, as I mentioned in my opening remarks I'm proud that each of our businesses maintained its relentless focus on improving relative performance and delivered strong 2016 operating results throughout the merger integration process. Each of our business has met or exceeded its 2016 operational excellence target. Timberland has delivered 42 million of operational excellence improvements primarily from merger related operational synergies. ","In Wood Products OPEX improvements included $16 million in lumber, $21 million in OSB, $12 million in Engineered Wood Products, and $15 million of EBITDA improvement for distribution. The benefits of these improvements are clearly visible on our bottom line. In total wood product EBITDA improved by almost $270 million in 2016 compared with 2015.","A $41 per thousand square feet year-over-year improvement in our OSB realizations created a tailwind of $120 million and an $11 per thousand feet improvement in our lumber realizations provided a tailwind of approximately $50 million. The remaining $100 million improvement was largely attributable to nearly 65 million of wood products OPEX and the addition of the Plum Creek wood products mills.","For 2017 we are targeting additional operational excellence improvements of $95 million to $125 million across our businesses. This includes $40 million to $50 million in timberlands, [Indiscernible], $20 million to $25 million in OSB, $10 million to $15 million in Engineered Wood Products, and $5 million to $10 million in distribution.","I will now touch briefly on our merger cost synergies. We have been achieving our targeted cost synergies faster than anticipated. And as we mentioned in December the scope of opportunity has exceeded our initial expectations. We raised our cost synergy target by 25% to $125 million and remain highly confident we will achieve this full amount on a run rate basis by the end of first quarter 2017. We also remain on track to eliminate the $35 million of cost formerly allocated to our sale of fibers business no later than 2017 year end.","I'll close this morning with a few comments on the softwood lumber agreement. Although discussions between U.S. and Canadian negotiators continued through the end of 2016 we have been unsuccessful in reaching an agreement. With the change in administration, negotiations are currently on hold while U.S. trade representative and Department of Commerce appointees are confirmed and take office. In the meantime the U.S. International Trade Commission and Department of Commerce have continued to evaluate the petition for countervailing and anti dumping duties filed by the U.S. Coalition at the end of November. ","On January 6th the ITC unanimously determined that there is a reasonable indication that the U.S. has been materially injured by imports of softwood lumber products from Canada. The U.S. Department of Commerce is currently conducting an investigation that will result in a determination regarding preliminary duties. We expect the announcement regarding preliminary countervailing duties in late April with an anti dumping determination following in late June. Our preference remains for a negotiated agreement. The U.S. coalition continues to work closely with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and we look forward to resuming negotiations.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook.","Russell S. Hagen","Thank you, Doyle and good morning. The outlook for the first quarter is presented in chart 16 of the earnings slides. In our timberlands business we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the fourth quarter. And our Western timberlands operations we expect increased log sales volumes and slightly higher average sales realizations in the first quarter primarily driven by higher export mix. Export volumes to Japan and China are expected to increase as a result of the timing of shipments and continued favorable demand. ","Domestic log sales volumes and average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter as a result of continued stable demand. Western road costs will decrease due to lower road spending which is typical in the winter months. Southern harvest volumes are expected to be seasonally lower than fourth quarter level as a result of harvest timing in some of our southern markets. We expect average sales realizations for the first quarter to be similar to fourth quarter levels. Silviculture spending in the South will be higher than in the fourth quarter as we perform more forestry activities such as competition control and fertilization during the first quarter of the year. ","In the North we anticipate first quarter sales volumes will be slightly lower than the fourth quarter. But we expect average sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter levels. Real estate, energy, and natural resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter are expected to be slightly -- significantly lower from the fourth quarter as a result of the timing of our real estate sales, the first quarter EBITDA comparable to the first quarter of 2016.","We typically close fewer transactions in the first and second quarters of the year as recreational buyer traffic slows during the winter months. The spring and summer months are the most active selling seasons with the largest portion of the sales closing in the second half of the year. We continue to expect over 250 million of EBITDA from our real estate and energy and natural resources business in 2017. As we discussed at our December Investor Meeting, we expect land bases as a percentage of real estate sales to be between 45% and 65% for the full year 2017. ","For wood products we anticipate higher sales volume across all product lines in the first quarter as we enter the spring building season. We expect manufacturing costs will improve as our operating rates return to normalized levels following fourth quarter's decreased levels resulting from maintenance and capital project installations. Realizations remained relatively strong going into the fourth quarter as we did not experience the seasonal declines in wood product pricing that typically occur during the holiday season. We anticipate lumber and OSB sales realizations in the first quarter will be comparable to fourth quarter levels. Overall for wood products we expect adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the first quarter will be higher than the fourth quarter and will be roughly $50 million dollars higher than the first quarter of 2016.","Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. For the fourth quarter, the $31 million earnings experienced in unallocated items is driven by $20 million increase in non-cash charges related to LIFO inventory adjustments, profit elimination, and foreign exchange. Moving on to our retirement and pension plans, the year-end 2016 funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and post employment retirement plans decreased by $383 million compared to 2015 as a result of the decrease in the prescribed discount rate. ","Discount rates decreased by approximately 20 to 30 basis points for both the U.S. and Canadian plants. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2016 and we don't anticipate any cash contributions in 2017. Cash paid for all other pension and other post employment retirement plans in 2016 was nearly $100 million which included onetime payments related to the Plum Creek merger. We expect cash payments in 2017 will be approximately $70 million. We expect to report approximately $100 million of noncash, unallocated pension and post retirement expense in 2017. ","Chart 14 summarizes our key financial items. As Doyle mentioned we closed the sale of the Cellulose Fibers pulp mills on December 1st pursuant to U.S. GAAP to receive and use of cash proceeds from the sale are recorded in different categories within our cash flow statement. The 2.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale is showing cash from investing activities. Immediately following the close of the sale on December 1st we used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the $1.7 billion term loan which you can see in cash flows from financing activities. ","Finally, we paid $494 million of taxes related to the sale of our Cellulose Fibers mills in the fourth quarter which is recorded in cash from operations and results in the negative $151 million of net cash from operations. Excluding the cash taxes paid on the Cellulose Fibers sale during the fourth quarter of 2016, cash from operations would have been $343 million.","Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of long-term debt. We have one scheduled maturity in August of 2017 for $281 million which we intend to repay with available cash. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $207 million including $22 million related to discontinued operations. Net of discontinued operations, capital expenditures for the full year 2016 was $425 million. Looking ahead to 2017 we expect total CAPEX will be approximately $435 million, $300 million for wood products and $135 million for timberlands.","Interest expense was $108 million in the fourth quarter. We expect interest expense will be approximately $400 million in 2017. Our 2016 effective tax rate for continuing operations was approximately 18% slightly above our earlier forecast due to a tax adjustment reported as a special item in the fourth quarter in connection with the sale of our Cellulose Fibers business. For 2017 we expect the tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the forecasted mix of our earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. I\u2019ll wrap up with chart 15 which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchase activities.","During 2016 we repurchased 68 million shares at an average price of $29.49 per share. There were no share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter with about 749 million shares outstanding. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions. ","Doyle R. Simons ","Thank you Russell. I am proud of our 2016 achievements. We have transformed our portfolio, delivered strong operating performance, and taken substantial strides towards a successful and value creating merger integration. And in 2017 I'm very optimistic about the opportunities in front of us. We remain strongly committed to driving industry leading performance, capturing merger synergies, fully capitalizing on improving markets, and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation to drive superior value for our shareholders. And now I\u2019d like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session ","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons","Good morning Anthony. ","Anthony Pettinari","With regards to the CAPEX guidance, and I think you said 300 million for wood products. Is it possible to say if you're adding or debottlenecking capacity in lumber and OSB for the year and roughly what percent capacity growth you might anticipate? And then specifically with regard to the anti dumping duties which we might get in spring\/summer, are you taking steps to rebalance capacity between the U.S. and Canada in your system?","Doyle R. Simons","So let me start with your second question regarding the anti-dumping duties and we are not taking any steps to rebalance, Anthony. As we've talked about previously, if you look at our Canadian operation, about a third of our Canadian operation is sold -- of our production is sold in Canada, a third is sold in export markets outside the United States, and a third comes into the U.S. Overall, our Canadian lumber operations is roughly 20% of our overall lumber operations, so you take that 20% times a third it's not a big part of the driver for our lumber operation.","In terms of CAPEX Anthony, the $300 million is in line with what we've done over the last couple of years, and our primary focus in our CAPEX in our Wood Products operation is low risk, high return projects that drive down our overall cost structure and that's been a key part of accomplishing our OPEX. With that said, some of those projects do in fact result in debottlenecking and additional capacity, and as we've also stated we are in the process of rebuilding two of our mills Dirk's and Millport, which have been really good mills for us historically. But, in order to significantly dive down the cost structure of those mills, we essentially needed to rebuild them in place and that will result in some additional capacity as well. But again, the primary focus is on the cost side where we will be increasing capacity as a result of some of the projects that we've put in place.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful. And then just regarding the real estate guidance for 2017, should we expect land sales to be weighted towards the South and maybe the North as you're still working through AVO in the West and if you could just talk generally about the demand you're seeing for timberlands and rural lands and if you could highlight any difference in demand between the West and the South?","Russell S. Hagen","Sure Anthony, this is Russell. So as you know the real estate business is a little lumpy but getting through our AVO process in the South, and as Doyle indicated, we're starting to work through to bring some of that AVO work to market. So we identified the 500,000 acres and now we're starting to bring a portion of that into the marketplace. I would expect the activity to be weighted a bit to the South. We still have opportunities in North obviously and we will be looking at that. As we get through the AVO process in the West, we'll start looking at what opportunities there are to bring that to market. And as far as demand for the rural real estate, the South definitely has continued demand. There's a really strong recreational buyer activity in the South. We do have demand in the North obviously but it is a little different buyer, and it's more of a small plot, small timberland plot-type ownership. But we see good strong demand in the South for recreational properties.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. ","George Staphos","Thanks. Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the detail and congratulation on the progress. First question, I just wanted to double check something. I thought I heard you say Russell that the pension liability ultimately went up, I want to say something like $300 million, but you didn't anticipate funding being required this year. If I heard that correctly, could you discuss why and I think you also threw out a pension expense figure for this year but I did not catch that, if you could repeat that that will be great? ","Russell S. Hagen","Sure, so the pension liability or the pension \u2013 the funded liability was down $383 million and as far as the pension expense it did increase. And that's really a function of a couple of things. Well, the first is the return on the pension assets, so we did decrease our rate down from 9% to 8%, and then we have additional amortization pension loss. So that's really driving the increase. And that total on an unallocated basis is $100 million. And as far as the funding, you know, the funding requirements are really prescribed by GAAP funding and then IRS funding. So we don't have any funding requirements in 2017.","George Staphos","Okay, thank you for the clarification there. Could you talk about what operating rates recognizing it's early in the year and a lot can change, what kind of operating rates do you think you'll be running at across the major wood products businesses? And then as it relates to distribution and engineered wood products, are you finding any opportunity to further marry those businesses and have them coordinate to a greater degree, as the -- and take share within the large builder pack market?","Doyle R. Simons","George, in terms of operating rates, we are optimistic about demand as we move into 2017 for all of our products. So I would tell you there will be some seasonality as there always is, but I would anticipate lumber operating in the low to mid 90's, OSB operating in the low to mid 90's, ELP normally operates about 10% lower than that, so I would anticipate that being in mid 80's type range. But as I said, we are encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of demand. And as we talk to our customers, they are bullish on housing and increasing demand for all of our products in 2017. ","In terms of the coordination between engineered wood and distribution, that's something that\u2019s here where we also have done a lot of work on. And I would tell you those two operations are working more closely together than they ever have historically. And that's been very beneficial in driving improvements in both our EWP and our distribution business and I think there will continue to be further opportunities for that coordination as we move forward. ","George Staphos","Doyle is there a way to size if at all what kind of benefit you might get from that in 2017? And then my last question, not that you haven't had great performance on this over the last couple years, but I noticed a little bit of a pickup in G&A, is that just still the residual effect of just putting Plum Creek into the business or are there other expense categories that are growing that you'll need to manage for in 2017? Thank you and good luck in the quarter.","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you, George. In terms of G&A I would tell you that the slight increase in fourth quarter versus third quarter is just timing. We are if you look at where these companies were before we combine them in 2015 versus where we're going up in 2017, we're highly confident that we're going to meet or exceed our $125 million target by the end of the first quarter of 2017. And as I said earlier we are at a basically $100 million run rate through the fourth quarter of 2016. So in really good shape on our G&A and as I mentioned earlier the $125 million is 25% higher than what we originally factored in when we announced the merger. ","In terms of the engineered wood products and distribution coordination and quantifying that George, as you would expect that is difficult to quantify but that is part of the OPEX improvements that we've highlighted in 2017. And there maybe some upside as these two operations continue to work closer together and figure out a way to drive value for customers and improve bottom line profitability.","George Staphos","Thank you for the details.","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","Hey, good morning. First question from me just as it relates to the lumber dispute. As we enter the potential look back window, have you started to see any change in Canadian shipments for the U.S. just more broadly in the marketplace?","Doyle R. Simons","You know Collin it's hard to tell yet. I mean we're only into the -- through the month of January and as you know the look back will be roughly 90 days. So, hard to determine yet if there's been a significant change in the Canadian activity. As you know Canadian activity was up significantly in 2016 and we'll be watching how that plays in 2017. A lot of rumors floating around as to what may or may not happen but too early to tell what changes if any the Canadians maybe taking as we move into 2017 in the potential look back period.","Collin Mings","Okay, thanks for that Doyle and then switching gears just I maybe splitting hairs here but just your guidance on real estate seem to maybe be a little bit more optimistic than the December Investor Meeting, just given kind of language around looking for it to exceed the 250 million in adjusted EBITDA. Am I reading too much into the language choice there or is there something kind of driving maybe a little bit more optimism on the real estate front?","Doyle R. Simons","Well Collin what I would tell you is as we continue to learn more about our real estate operation and what the opportunity is there, we continue to be encouraged by the AVO process and what that is unveiling. So we are confident that, that number will be over $250 million for 2017.","Collin Mings","Okay and then curious just given the potential for tax reform, can you touch on how important 1031 exchanges are to the real estate business. I know that's something that Weyerhaeuser legacy has engaged in to some degree but how do you think about it now just kind of given your current pack that it\u2019s on a combined basis?","Russell S. Hagen","So Collin this is Russell, as far as the 1031 program you're correct, Weyerhaeuser had used that in the past and that was primarily because they were in the built in gains period. So now that they're out of the built in gains period so on a combined basis rather built in gains period it\u2019s really not a tool that we would use going forward in a meaningful way.","Collin Mings","Okay great. I'll turn it over. Thanks guys.","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you Collin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. ","Gail Glazerman","Hi, good morning. Can you give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the export market, A lot of other commodities have seen a big uplift in volumes to China, are you sensing any of that at all in either log or lumber either from North America or some other parts of the world?","Doyle R. Simons","So Gail we continue to be encouraged about what we see in the export markets. Let's start with Japan as you know that's our biggest market. So as we said earlier prices were up in fact in the fourth quarter which was encouraging. Volumes were down but that was due to seasonality and frankly some of the timing of our shipments and how the ships played out that were going to Japan. In the first quarter in line with your point we do anticipate volumes will be up. And our best guess right now is flat pricing but we continue to be encouraged by what we see out of Japan. Housing market activity was up 8% roughly through the month of November which is the last data point that we have. As we look to China encouraging there as well. As you know log inventories continued to be at normal levels, pricing was in fact up in the fourth quarter. Volume again was down seasonally and as we move into the first quarter continuing to anticipate good demand out of China and we anticipate volumes up in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.","Gail Glazerman","Okay, can you give a little bit more color on the charges on some development projects, are there any projects that we might have heard of, or are they just really small?","Russell S. Hagen","Yeah, this is Russell. So as we've gone through an AVO process part of that is also to identify any kind of small development projects and Weyerhaeuser had done some small development activities really around and tied it with maybe some minimal infrastructure type investment. As we went through the portfolio, given the change in our strategy as it relates to development, we chose to move those into an HPU [ph] category and sell through those a little quicker. And because of that we took the impairment against those assets but so very small properties -- properties and we don't expect to have any material impairments going forward in future.","Gail Glazerman","Okay, Doyle, can you give any sense of where your customer log inventories are positioned moving into the year?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes, I would say customer log inventories in the West are kind of towards the low end of normal as we as we move into the year. And I would say in the South they are kind of at normalized levels in terms of where you would have seen log inventories historically. ","Gail Glazerman","Okay, and just last one. Obviously you're looking for fairly stable Southern pricing in the first quarter, can you give any perspective on what your outlook is for the year, are you seeing any sense of traction of building?","Doyle R. Simons","You know our take is the first and second quarter we would anticipate pricing to be essentially flat. We do think there's the possibility of slight improvements in pricing as we move to the second half of the year and then as we look further out than that we continue to be quite optimistic about the improvement in Southern log prices. As housing continues to improve that will drive demand. As you also know there are significant projects that are being built and will be coming online in 2017 and 2018 type timeframe that we think that's going to drive 12 million to 13 million green tons of additional demand. ","And then of course a big component of this will be what happens with Canada and we think either as a result of hopefully a negotiated agreement which will result in a quota or the duties that that will have an impact on the amount of lumber that is coming in from Canada which will result in more demand on Southern saw logs. So all those factors we are encouraged by what we see there and like I said are hopeful that we'll see some slight improvement in the second half of this year but more importantly as we move into 2018 and beyond. We think we're going to see some pricing power as a result. ","Gail Glazerman","Okay, thank you. ","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. ","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. A couple follow ups first. Do you guys get a sense of inventories of the customers on logs, do you have a view where they are on lumber and OSB?","Russell S. Hagen","Mark, I would tell you that our sense is inventories for lumber and OSB are pretty thin. I would say it is on below normal levels and that seems to be how our customers are running their business but I would say inventories are latent. ","Mark Weintraub","Okay, bit of a hypothetical but have you been able to do any work, have any thoughts if a border tax adjustment were to be part of a new tax bills, etc what would that mean for lumber and for that matter OSB coming in for Canada. I don't know if you've gotten any -- it would be treated any differently or any thoughts on implications there?","Russell S. Hagen","Hey Mike, this is Russell. As far as the border tax adjustment we've kind of looked at the implications of that. But as Doyle mentioned given we have relatively low volumes coming in from the Canadian operations into the U.S. we're primarily a domestic producer and sell into the domestic markets. We don't think it would have a material impact on our operations or in fact on us. ","Mark Weintraub","I guess, coming from kind of the other angle, would it have material implication on wood coming in from Canada not produced by you essentially, homebuilders not going to be as inclined to buy the woods from the Canadian and essentially act as a further umbrella for U.S. pricing?","Russell S. Hagen","I mean yes, that could be a factor and the amount of volume that comes down from Canada I would say that's a possibility.","Doyle R. Simons","But a lot of these changes to the markets we're doing a lot of work on it but it's still too early to know exactly how these will play out under this administration. But a lot of moving parts that could have frankly potential benefits for our company going forward.","Mark Weintraub","Understood, appreciate it. I wondered just if whether there was anything that would be different about materials coming in from \u2013 wood products coming in from Canada, but there's nothing that's being talked about that would differentiate it from anything else coming in from anywhere is that fair?","Doyle R. Simons","At this point that is generally fair. More work to be done and more specifics to be learned but I think to your point if anything it should be a net positive for our company and the U.S. industry.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, thanks so much.","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning everyone.","Doyle R. Simons","Good morning Chip. ","Chip Dillon","First question is Doyle, I remember it was about three years ago when you got into your current role, it seem like you had like a couple years where you were going to improve the pretty much the whole wood products business and I think it's fair to say you've exceeded expectations. But I was under the impression that after those two years CAPEX might come down and you would sort of be in a position where maybe you would have viewed -- accelerated a lot of opportunities. What I think of seeing today is CAPEX is staying elevated but to be fair you're also having continued high targets. In fact it looks like lumber and OSB they're higher for savings in 2017 and 2016. So the question is what changed, has it been that since you've been in there you have found new things you can do to plants you've already worked on or are you just expanding the number of plants that you are putting capital in, in order to get these savings?","Doyle R. Simons","And so it's good question, Chip. So, what we -- when we started this process as you were recalling as you highlighted two or three years ago, a lot of the improvements were non-capital improvements because our take was show -- these mills needed to show that they could make operational excellence improvements without capital. And then if they could do that then they earned the right to capital to further drive down the cost structure. So we initially said okay let's do this without capital. Once you show that and you earn the right to capital which will further drive down the overall structure of our mills set. So as you said we've made good progress. There's still more work to be done but we now have confidence Chip as we put in this capital that we will in fact continue to deliver on these OPEX improvements and more importantly than that continue to drive down the overall cost structure of our mail system where we will in the current upturn that we're in outperform the competition. And when things do eventually roll over, which we think was many years from now we will be back at the bottom.","Now with that said Chip I don't want to give you the sense that this $300 million of capital is going to be the level forever. We think there's a couple more years of spending at this level to get our mills fully positioned to where they need to be from a cost perspective and then you would see capital fall off to a more normalized level in the $200 million to $250 million range.","Chip Dillon","Okay, so 200 to 250. Now -- then the second question is it seems like as we've looked at the situation here we are in 2017 that there would be a lot of TMO [ph] type partnerships that were established 10 to 15 years ago that are coming up for, I guess they\u2019re maturing or the partnerships are at a point where they might dissolve. And yet it seems like the timberland market has stayed pretty solid. I don't know if it's great but it's been pretty solid and I didn\u2019t know if you had any thoughts as to are you seeing a lot of these partnerships sort of extend themselves or are you instead seeing them dissolved but there's just a solid demand sort of have new replacements in terms of investors to take over these ownerships.","Doyle R. Simons","Chip, what I would tell you -- I think timberland markets do continue to be strong and we see that over and over especially for high quality timberland there's a lot of interest in its investment class and for high quality timberlands there's a lot of interested buyers both domestic buyers and frankly international buyers starting to show up. So as these TMOs do mature and that is happening some of them you see being extended due to performance. Some of them you see trading back and forth but a lot of interest in continued in this asset class and like I said any process that is being run and there are some being run and we participate in just about all of those. There are a number of interested parties who are part of that","Chip Dillon","Okay, and then last question quickly. Any update on sort of your thinking about either the dividend, dividend policy at this point?","Doyle R. Simons","Yeah Chip, so as we mentioned at our Investor Day kind of over 90% of our business assets is in timberlands and as you have just highlighted a significantly improved cost structure for wood products. Our go forward cash flow will be much more stable and that's intentional. We're in the process of discussing the payout ratio with our Board and we will update you when those conversations are complete. But we think there is the opportunity to increase the payout ratio as we look forward. ","In terms of a dividend increase, as we have consistently said for the past few years we are committed to a sustainable and growing dividend. As we look into 2017 we're clearly going to benefit from cost and operational synergies, continued OPEX improvements, and as we've talked about this morning stronger housing markets. So, all those things will be factored in as we work with our Board on decisions regarding our dividend. ","Chip Dillon","Great, thanks for the update. ","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. ","Brian Maguire","Hi, good morning and congratulations on the strong 2016 results. We are seeing some inflation out in the economy these days with a lot of commodity prices moving higher, just wondering if you're starting to see that in your business from cost pressure and related to that maybe just wondering if some of the higher oil and gas prices might have any benefit on the energy part of the real estate segment just in terms of royalties and if that's kind of factored into your outlook or not?","Doyle R. Simons","So, on the second part of your question, clearly higher natural gas and oil prices will benefit our Energy and Natural Resources segment. We have a lot more leverage to natural gas and forever rough numbers just to give you a sense, every dollar improvement in natural gas, $5 million to our bottom line all else being equal. But as you would also anticipate when pricing increases that also gives you the opportunity to go lease more. Don\u2019t have quite that type of leverage to oil but as oil prices continue to improve there will be more opportunity from a leasing perspective. ","In terms of commodity price push we're starting to see a little bit of that not big numbers at this point but that -- turning to that, that is why OPEX is so important as we are at some point going to see some cost push and a big part of our operational excellence efforts are to make sure we are doing things that offset that or frankly more than offset that so that the benefits we see from our increased pricing and volume fall directly to the bottom line. ","Brian Maguire","Okay great. And then the other area where there has been a lot of volatility lately has been just in currencies and you get some sensitivity to the end. Just wondering, what kind of an impact the post election move in the dollar is having on realized pricing or competitive trade flows, particularly into Japan where I know you've got some competition from some European producers? ","Doyle R. Simons","Yeah, as you said the strong U.S. dollar continues to be a headwind for us. All other currencies that are important to us weaken versus the U.S. dollar after the election. Some of them has strengthened slightly this December but they overall net-net remain weaker than where they were at the end of the third quarter. In Japan as you said the risk there is the strong U.S. dollar pressures. Prices our customers products compete with lower cost lumber imports from Europe but as I said earlier despite all that we continued to have good demand for our logs into Japan and we actually saw some fall off in the imports that were coming in from Europe during that time period. So net-net while it's not positive we work through that and continue to have good demand from our Japanese customers and part of that is built on the long-term relationship and unique relationship we have with our customer base in Japan.","Brian Maguire","Okay, just one last one of I could just on the corporate expense in the quarter and the outlook there going forward I think there was maybe a LIFO or inventory hit there in the quarter. As soon as maybe just a year end true up but just thinking about what kind of run rate level we're at going into 1Q there and as you remove some of the stranded costs from Cellulose Fibers, where you think we would become ending the year there?","Russell S. Hagen","So this is Russell. As far as the $14 million LIFO adjustment that was a combination of LIFO and profit elimination and that was really a function of increasing inventories at year end. Then also bringing on some of the Montana inventories that were legacy to Plum Creek and so we increased log inventories particularly in those regions for anticipating when to break up. So it's really just an increase in inventory versus the driver for the LIFO on profit elimination. As Doyle mentioned we're on track to capture our synergy targets 125 million by the end of the first quarter and then we are on track to capture the additional $35 million of CS training costs by the end of 2017 and we're making good progress on both those accounts.","Brian Maguire","Okay, thanks very much.","Russell S. Hagen","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead. ","Mark Connelly","Thanks Doyle. I'm just expanding on Chips question, are the nature of the operational excellence improvements in timberlands any different now? I'm just curious whether things are evolving there and maybe maturity schedules and things are getting involved?","Doyle R. Simons","I would say the biggest difference in timberlands versus where we were the first two or three years are the additional opportunities that have been presented as a result of combining. Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek. So a portion of the $42 million that we got in 2016 was due to those operational synergies, the ability to rebalance wood flows, to minimize cost, and increase realization, optimize the silviculture practice cost based on our larger scale. And then frankly just best practices in harvesting and transportation both again as a result of scale but maybe even more importantly learning from each other. There were some things that Weyerhaeuser and when we got in there looked at it did better and lower costs than Plum Creek and there were some things that Plum Creek did. ","So as we move forward while we're confident in having what I would say were a fairly significant targets 40 million to 50 million in 2017 and I would anticipate a similar number in 2018 are because of the opportunities that have been created by combining these two companies taking best practices, taking advantage of the larger scale both from ability to service customers, rebalance wood flows, and drive down the overall cost structure of our timberlands operations. So really excited about that and I can tell our folks are really excited about it as they almost on a daily basis find additional opportunities for OPEX as a result of the combination.","Mark Connelly","That sounds great. Just one point of clarification, in real estate you mentioned a shift to the South but is there anything lumpy or should we start to think of this is a relatively normal quarter in terms of realizations?","Doyle R. Simons","So as I mentioned earlier in my comments, the first and second quarter are pretty kind of low volume of sales and so we're guiding for lower amount in fourth quarter. Real estate sales can be a little lumpy, it depends on the character of the transactions and so it's a little difficult to predict. And then the second half we'll see it will pick up. So, that's pretty much the pattern we would expect pretty low in the first and second quarter and then picking up in the third quarter and then a lot of closings really occurring in the fourth quarter.","Russell S. Hagen","And Mark in terms of the value from the different components is really it is depending on as you very well know there's different value components in the North. It tend to be lower per acre South than that and then of course the West even higher than that on a per acre basis. So it's really just going to depend on what the mix is and as Russell said at least initially it will be more weighted to the South than the West and then as we move to the West as we complete our AVO process that will factor in on the per acre value.","Mark Connelly","Very helpful, thank you.","Russell S. Hagen","Thank you. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please go ahead.","Mark Wilde","Good morning Doyle, good morning Russell. ","Doyle R. Simons","Good morning Mark.","Mark Wilde","Doyle, I wonder if you and Russell could just give us some sense of kind of how your appetite is right now for kind of timberland acquisitions and where your biases would be just regionally? ","Doyle R. Simons","You know Mark, I\u2019ll tell you that right now our focus, what I like to say number one, two, and three is continuing to make sure we fully capitalize on the value that we can create by combining Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek and driving the synergies and other benefits to the bottom line. So that's what we are primarily focused on. As we continue to work through that, and as I like to say earn the right to continue to grow we will be looking at Timberland acquisitions to potentially grow our company. With that said with the scale we have and diversity of geography we have we don't have to grow so we can be very disciplined as we move forward. ","In terms of South versus the West we're basically like both of those markets and would look so it's not a waiting more to one than the other. We both -- we like both the South and the West and would look to potentially growing both of those as we move forward.","Mark Wilde","Okay and then on the other side of the equation Doyle just I know you're still in the midst of the evaluation down in Uruguay but can you just give us some sense of sort of any tax consequences on that sale?","Russell S. Hagen","Hey Mike, this is Russell. Pardon me, yes thanks for the qualification. If that were the case we would have minimal tax impacts on that transaction.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Doyle the last question I had is just over an engineered wood. I know that there have been some conversations about sort of more fire code restrictions around particularly I-Joist, can you just kind of update us on what that situation is and how Weyerhaeuser kind of deals with those changes in regulation?","Doyle R. Simons","Good question Mark and there are a lot of various regulations, potential regulations regarding that. I can tell you we\u2019re doing an immense amount of work on that front. We've got a really good technology group that is looking for different applications that you can put on engineered wood products that will in fact extend what's called the burn through test, extend that and as a result of that meet any additional requirements that may be put forth from that.","So again a lot of work being done on that, very encouraged about what we've seen so far in the test that we're running and think we will be well positioned as we go forward in EWP.","Mark Wilde","How widespread is this Doyle, is this just kind of a state by state or is this more of a national basis?","Doyle R. Simons","No, it's clearly state by state that's the way these things work. Again a lot of uncertainty regarding exactly what that may look like and what the timing may be. But we've been on top of it and feel good about the opportunities to deal with this on a go forward basis.","Mark Wilde","Okay, just the last question also on I-Joist. I just I notice in your graph that prices of I-Joist have been kind of trending down over the last around four to six quarters yet at the same time kind of the inputs are like OSB for web stock are actually going up. So, would you expect to see kind of those higher input costs starting to roll through to I-Joist prices here over the next few quarters?","Doyle R. Simons","Yeah Mark, I do think there is the opportunity for price improvement in EWP as we move through 2017. ","Mark Wilde","Okay, very good. Good luck this year guys. ","Doyle R. Simons","Alright, thank you.","Operator","And your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. ","Paul Quinn","Yeah, thanks very much and good morning gentleman. Just a question on software negotiations, you mentioned that government employments haven't been made yet so there's no government to government negotiations. But maybe you could just give us some color on whether the industry is talking and whether you're making any progress and when you expect government to government negotiations to start.","","Doyle R. Simons","Yeah, I think it's going to take a little bit of time Paul to get the appointments in place and approved and get up to speed. So I can't tell you exactly when negotiations will start again. But it's going to take a little bit of time. In terms of the U.S. coalition a lot of work continues to be done just to -- so we don't lose any momentum during this period of time. I think the U.S. coalition are all on the same page and like I said are hopeful of a negotiated settlement as we move forward.","Paul Quinn","Great, that is all I had. Thanks a lot guys. ","Doyle R. Simons","Alright, thank you. So as I understand it that was our final question. I would like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And as always really appreciate your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Take care. ","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.

Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's 2013 results. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com, and materials can be found at our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will be discussing non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.","On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle. Doyle?","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Our vision here at Weyerhaeuser is to grow a truly great company for our shareholders, customers and employees. 2013 was a very good year, as we made initial progress toward achieving this goal by doubling net earnings, excluding special items from $316 million or $0.58 per diluted share in 2012 to $654 million or $1.14 per diluted share in 2013; increasing our dividend by nearly 30%; announcing an agreement to combine our Real Estate operation with TRI Pointe Homes and a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction; and acquiring approximately 645,000 acres of some of the finest timberland in the country through the purchase of Longview Timber. As a result of our actions in 2013 and our relentless focus on operational excellence going forward, we are well positioned to fully capitalize on improving markets and drive value for our shareholders in 2014 and beyond.","Speaking of improving markets, let me just comment on economic conditions that affect our company before I discuss our fourth quarter performance. First, the housing market. The housing market continued to improve in 2013, with total starts rising to 923,000, an 18% gain from 2012. The housing recovery showed resilience as construction activity increased in the fourth quarter, having adjusted to higher interest rates and market uncertainty caused by fiscal infighting, which impacted the second and third quarters. Housing fundamentals remain positive with low inventories and affordability still well above historic norms. In addition, prices for existing homes have increased 14% on a year-ago basis and the additional homeowner wealth is a boost to the economy. The economy has been adding jobs, and as people find employment, they are forming households and adding to the demand for housing. These trends are expected to continue in 2014, and we are planning for over 1.1 million starts, including 780,000 single-family.","I'll comment briefly on global economic conditions since approximately 1\/3 of our revenues come from exported products from our Cellulose Fibers, Timberlands and Wood Products segments. As the Eurozone continues to manage its debt crisis and emerges from recession, the currency has stabilized and strengthened. A stronger euro should improve the relative competitiveness of our Cellulose Fiber business, as well as our Asian log exports. In Japan, fiscal and monetary reforms have stimulated the economy and increased housing starts, which has improved demand for our products. In China, our export activity picked up in 2013, and while many forecasts of overall economic growth in China have been lowered, the government continues with its objective of moving people from rural to urban settings. This is the driver of construction activity and the source of China's growing demand for imported wood.","Now I will comment on our fourth quarter performance. For the fourth quarter 2013, we reported net earnings of $43 million or $0.07 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. We have several special items in the quarter, the largest of which was the previously announced noncash impairment of a community excluded from the combination of WRECO and TRI Pointe Homes. Charges for special items were partially offset by some unrelated tax adjustments, which Patty will discuss in more detail. Excluding these special items, we reported solid fourth quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.27 per diluted share compared with net earnings of $143 million or $0.26 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2012.","Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, Charts 4 to 6. Timberlands contributed $134 million to earnings in the quarter, up 14% compared with the third quarter 2013 as construction markets in China drove increased demand for Western logs. Our Western fee harvest volumes were up by 17% due to the stronger demand and a full quarter of harvest from the Longview land. I'm pleased to report that the Longview integration continues to go smoothly and that we are on track to achieve or exceed our EBITDA and synergy goals.","Turning to market condition. Selling prices for Western logs were generally higher in the quarter, while our sales realizations were flat due in part to a higher percentage of logs exported to China compared with higher value logs to Japan. Southern log price realizations were up modestly. As expected, road and silviculture costs were high in the quarter and the contribution from the sale of nonstrategic Timberlands declined by $3 million in the quarter.","Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. Wood Products contributed $58 million before special items to earnings in the quarter, down from $79 million in the third quarter but above the $38 million of earnings in the fourth quarter of 2012. Special items for the fourth quarter included noncash impairment charges of $10 million related to the permanent closure of previously curtailed engineered wood products operation. Sales volume declined across all product line in the quarter due to seasonality and unusually severe winter weather. OSB prices were lower in the quarter, while lumber and engineered wood sales price realizations were higher.","Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $88 million compared with $110 million in the third quarter. In lumber, EBITDA was down $7 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, as lower volumes due to seasonally weaker demand, extreme weather conditions and higher log cost more than offset the benefit from higher prices. In OSB, EBITDA declined by $15 million compared with the previous quarter due to 4% lower prices and 11% less volume due to seasonality, as well as extreme winter weather and capital-related downtime. Engineered wood products generated EBITDA before special items of $11 million in the quarter, down from the prior quarter due to a seasonal decline in sales volumes and, again, some weather-related production and transportation issues. And finally, EBITDA and distribution improved by $5 million in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter, primarily due to increased product margin. As we discussed in our December 17 investor presentation, we are committed to improving the EBITDA in both engineered wood products and distribution by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 compared with 2013.","Cellulose Fibers, Charts 9 and 10. Cellulose Fibers contributed $65 million to earnings in the quarter, up $18 million from third quarter 2013 and up $4 million compared with fourth quarter 2012. The improvement, compared with third quarter 2013, was attributable to higher pulp price realizations, lower maintenance expenses and improved productivity due to fewer maintenance outage days. These were partially offset by higher fiber cost and lower realizations from liquid packaging board. Fourth quarter liquid packaging board sales included a smaller proportion of higher-value products. We expect a return to our typical mix in the first quarter.","Real Estate, Charts 11 to 13. WRECO reported strong results as Real Estate contributed $71 million to earnings before special items in the quarter. As mentioned earlier, the fourth quarter includes special charges of $349 million primarily associated with the previously announced impairment. The improvement, compared with the prior quarter, was attributable to a 40% increase in single-family closings, an 11% increase in average prices and single-family gross margins of 23%.","I will now turn it over to Patty to specifically address our first quarter outlook.","Patricia M. Bedient","Thank you, Doyle. Good morning, everybody, and happy new year. Notwithstanding the harsh weather that much of the country has been experiencing, 2014 appears to be off to a good start with a steadily improving economy and housing starts for 2014 forecasted to increase by approximately 20% over 2013. The outlook for the first quarter is on Chart 15, and I'll begin my comments with Timberland. Export log volumes to both Japan and China are expected to increase during the quarter. The pricing momentum that we saw in the fourth quarter is carrying over to the first quarter. A higher percentage of Japan volume relative to the fourth quarter, as well as an increased percentage of Douglas fir logs to China, are anticipated to contribute to strong price realizations. The robust export markets are also putting upward pressure on domestic log price. Westerns fee harvest is expected to increase slightly compared to the fourth quarter in order to take advantage of the stronger markets. By contrast, the pricing dynamic in the South continues to be less robust. Log prices are expected to increase only slightly, while fee harvest volumes are expected to decrease by approximately 5%. Slightly lower road maintenance and silviculture spending in the West will be offset by slightly higher costs in the South. We expect that the effect of the strong operating earnings for the segment in the first quarter will be largely offset by decreased earnings from nonstrategic land sales. In the fourth quarter, we had earnings from nonstrategic land sales of approximately $20 million, and we anticipate the first quarter sales will be minimal. As a result, we expect overall first quarter earnings in the Timberland segment will be comparable to slightly higher relative to the fourth quarter results. The outlook for fee harvest volume for the full year of 2014 is expected to increase by approximately 10% to 12%, mostly as a result of the Longview Timber acquisition in July of last year.","In Wood Products, with the seasonally softer fourth quarter behind us and an improving housing market outlook, we expect Wood Products sales volumes to increase across all product lines in the first quarter. Channel inventories remain at low levels. Lumber sales prices have continued to increase thus far in the quarter, and we expect stronger realizations in the first quarter relative to the fourth. By contrast, OSB pricing has been softer thus far, and we expect overall realizations for the full quarter will be slightly weaker compared to the fourth quarter. Engineered wood products demand is anticipated to decrease (sic) [increase], although realizations will be slightly lower due to product mix. Log costs are expected to increase, especially in the West, consistent with our Timberlands outlook.","Increased operating rates should lead to lower unit manufacturing costs. However, the wildcard is the severe weather conditions that we've experienced in January, especially in the South. Operating postures and rates are being adversely affected by the extreme cold and great recovery decreases due to frozen logs. Transportation availability is also limited by treacherous road condition. We do expect these harsh weather conditions to begin to moderate as we move through the quarter and anticipate that the stronger market conditions will result in higher earnings in the Wood Products segment in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.","Moving to Cellulose Fibers. The year ended with global softwood pulp inventories at approximately 24 days, which is below the normal range of 28 to 32 days. Pulp sales volumes are anticipated to decline slightly as a result of the timing of shipments. Higher liquid packaging sales realizations and volumes are expected to offset the effect of the pulp sales decrease. Maintenance spending will be somewhat higher, and labor costs are also expected to increase slightly. We anticipate higher fiber costs in the West. Overall earnings in our Cellulose Fiber segment is expected to be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.","In Real Estate, the first quarter of the year is historically a seasonally weaker quarter for home closings compared to the fourth. This year is no exception. We expect to close approximately 600 homes in the first quarter, down from 1,072 in the fourth quarter. However, this is a 30% increase over the 463 closings in the first quarter of last year. Margins are anticipated to be around 20% to 21%, which is lower than the fourth quarter but comparable to the first quarter a year ago. We have 13% more homes in backlog as of December 31 compared to a year ago at prices 29% higher than a year ago. The number of actively selling communities at the end of 2013 is 35% greater than the prior year. We expect the selling costs in the first quarter will decrease relative to the fourth quarter as a result of fewer home closings. Consistent with the normal seasonal pattern, we expect that first quarter earnings from our single-family home-building business will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter but better than the breakeven results of a year ago.","Our previously announced combination of our Real Estate business with TRI Pointe Homes is on track to close in the second quarter of this year. We continue to be excited by the value creation of this powerful combination. The requisite registration statement was filed at the beginning of this month, and we have received clearance under our Hart-Scott-Rodino filing. We continue to work through the remaining steps to close the transaction.","Now I'd like to touch briefly on unallocated items, which are shown on Chart 14. Excluding special items, unallocated expense in the fourth quarter increased by $49 million compared to the third. Almost half of that difference relates to a smaller favorable impact from the elimination of intersegment profit and inventory and LIFO as a result of changes in inventory level. Amounts in the other category for the fourth quarter include charges for environmental and litigation reserves and other miscellaneous items with no single item greater than $5 million.","Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial highlights. We ended the year with a cash balance of approximately $835 million. Capital spending for the fourth quarter was $114 million, bringing our total spending for the full year to $293 million. For 2014, we expect the capital spending will be approximately $390 million, consistent with the guidance we shared during our Investor Meeting in December. During the fourth quarter, we completed the financing for the Longview Timber acquisition, and we also repaid all third-party WRECO debt. As of year end, we had approximately $4.9 billion in total debt with no maturities until 2017. During 2013, we replaced our revolving line of credit with a new agreement with $1 billion of capacity, and the agreement does not expire until June 2018. There are no borrowings outstanding under the line.","As Doyle mentioned, we had significant positive tax adjustments in the quarter, which we have called out as special items in our earnings material. These adjustments follow the completion of examinations by taxing authorities covering multiple years in both the U.S. and Canada. The largest of these relates to the exclusion from income of our alternative fuel mixture credit claimed in 2009. Looking forward to 2014, we expect our tax rate for our taxable REIT subsidiary earning to be approximately 33% to 35%, and of course, we accrue no taxes on REIT income as they plan to distribute all taxable income of the REIT to our shareholders.","Now I want to wrap up with an update on our pension and postretirement plans. During the fourth quarter, we made the decision to close defined benefit pension plans to employees hired after 2013. We replaced both plans with defined contribution plans. We also made plan amendments to certain of our other post-employment benefit plans. Factoring in these changes, as well as the strong investment earnings and increased discount rate, the funded status of our plans as of December 31, 2013, improved by approximately $1.45 billion compared to the funded status as of December 2012. Cash paid for all plans in 2013 totaled $137 million. We expect total spending in 2014 to approximate $110 million. Consistent with last year, we do not expect to contribute any cash to our U.S. qualified plan, which is fully funded. Our primary contributions will be to our Canadian plan for approximately $55 million, with the remainder going to pay benefits under our supplemental retirement plan and our other post-employment benefit plans, neither of which are separately funded.","Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you, Patty. As I said earlier, 2013 was a very good year for Weyerhaeuser as we doubled our earnings before special items, significantly increased our dividend and positioned ourselves for the future through significant transactions. But we still have a lot of work runway in front of us. As we look ahead, we are excited about 2014 and are relentlessly focused on growing shareholder value by driving our performance through operational excellence and capitalizing on improving markets to increase our cash flow and grow our dividend.","So with that, operator we will open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions for you. So first on the cost savings in the distribution and EWP business where we're targeting $30 million to $40 million for 2014. How should we think about how that flows through the model through the course of the year? Do you start to see that in the -- as early as the first quarter?","Doyle R. Simons","We'll start to see some improvement in the first quarter, Alex, but it's not going to -- and it will be all throughout the year. So you can't take the $30 million and $40 million, divide it by 4 and it's going to be even. It actually will build throughout the year as we gain traction on the initiatives that we outlined in our December 17 presentation.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's helpful, Doyle. And then just looking at the price performance of OSB relative to lumber, lumber has been so much more robust over the last 6 months. Typically, they historically move together. Can you just talk about the supply-demand dynamics that you're seeing and always be relative to lumber that may be driving some of that delta?","Doyle R. Simons","Sure. And in terms of -- we'll start with lumber. In terms of lumber, supply and demand dynamics are favorable. What we've seen, of course, is improvement in demand as housing starts have continued to grow. And on the supply side of the equation, Alex, while there have been some restarts and everybody's ramping up production, supply and demand are in pretty good balance. On the other hand, in OSB, as you're very well aware, while we have seen improvement on the demand side, there have been some significant restarts and new facilities that have come online, and that's what's led in our opinion to the volatility in OSB pricing over the past few quarters. And I think that will continue until we see supply and demand getting more in balance.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. And just one housekeeping question. The EWP facility that's primarily closed, how much capacity was that?","Doyle R. Simons","I don't know that exact figure off the top of my head. We'll tell you, Alex, if that is and we'll get back to you with that. That is the last facility that we had that had been curtailed. And now -- and so all of our facilities are now either running or have been permanently closed at this point.","Patricia M. Bedient","Alex, the facility was in Colbert, Georgia. As Doyle said, it was closed for some number of years, but it was about 3 million cubic feet, and it was a Parallam facility.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","A couple of questions, I guess. First, on the lumber pricing, I know this is random, land was up about $35 looking at the composite. Obviously, you're in lots of different geographies, et cetera. But why -- your price is only up $9. Was that really just a geography and mix thing? Or do you sometimes lock in pricing early in the quarter and maybe that can affect things as well?","Doyle R. Simons","Mark, you thought you might ask this question so here's what's going on. Very little blocking in prices. Actually what happened as we dug into this is, as you know, random leaks takes into account a variety of grades and widths. But it's mostly 2x4s and 2x10s, and that's normally pretty reflective of what's happening in the overall market. This quarter, mid-widths, which is 2x6, 2x8s, which are not included -- or not generally included in Random Lengths but are 40% of our volume at Southern Yellow Pine, were down 9%. So this is a quarter where random lengths, because of the mix and everything, went -- was significantly different than what our actual experience was. Now if you look at it overall, and we went back to compare it year-over-year, we're right on top of Random Lengths. Just this happens to be one quarter where the 2 are out of sync.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, got it, very helpful. So I just want to -- also, on the pension, so does that mean you ended the year at about like $100 million to $200 million underfunded? Am I doing the right math there, Patty?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, as you add all of our plans together, so that's a combination of our pension plans, as well as our post-employment benefit plan, they'll total about just under $500 million underfunded. If you look at just the pension plans themselves, it's really the Canadian plans that are underfunded. So you're about right on that number. But the total underfunded as we think about all of those. And as I mentioned, we don't fund the supplemental plan or the post-employment plan. So just pension alone, you're pretty much right, but altogether will be just under $500 million.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then lastly, has there been any further thought on -- I believe you got like $700 million, $730 million of cash from the TRI Pointe transaction, as well as the shares going to shareholders. Has there been any further thought on the use for that money?","Doyle R. Simons","Mark, as you know, and as we shared with the group in December, as we think about our financial priorities going forward, including the $700 million, first and foremost, we were focused on returning cash to shareholders. That will be primarily through a growing dividend going forward, but also through share repurchase where appropriate. Second is going to be investing on our business, again, through higher return projects to improve our cost structure and our margin. And we'll also look for opportunities to grow our business, but we'll be very disciplined in doing that through acquisitions that create value. And then finally, maintaining the appropriate capital structure to support a growing dividend, and we shared some of those metrics with you in December. So I give you that background just to say we are -- look, we understand the amount of cash we're getting. We understand the cash on the balance sheet. And we will, as we move forward through the TRI Pointe transaction, we'll be making decisions with what to do with that -- with the proceeds from that and exactly whether we're going to do a spin or split in all that. So what you could anticipate is we won't make a decision on -- we probably won't make a decision on the dividend until we have completed the TRI Pointe transaction, and then we'll be back to you at that point in time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Some housekeeping. I apologize if you already answered some, been doing a couple of calls at once here. First of all, Patty, did you say what the amount of pension expense will be in the P&L this year? I did catch the funding, but I'm not sure I caught the expense. And then the other housekeeping item, did you mention what was in the rather large tax adjustment in the fourth quarter? What drove that?","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure. Yes, George, you guys have had a busy week. So let me -- in terms of answering the pension and postretirement expense, maybe the way to think about that would be to look at Chart 18 that's in the material. I did not give you the expense number in my prepared remarks. But as you look at that chart, if you looked at what we had for expense in 2013, in total, it's about $100 million. In 2014, the total expense will be just about flat. So we really won't have any expense to speak of. Now as you think about the business segments though, we do charge the segments their normal service cost. So overall service cost in the business segment was, I think, around $60 million in 2013. That will come down to around $40 million because the service cost comes down as the discount rate increases, and the discount rate did increase year-over-year.","That $40 million offset then will be in the allocated segment as income in the unallocated segment because we want to make sure from a business perspective that we are charging the normal service cost into the business segment, so hopefully that's helpful there. On the tax, yes, I did speak to that. We had a number of years under examination, both in the U.S. and Canada, that we completed in the fourth quarter. You might recall, in the third quarter filing, in the 10-Q, we said that it was reasonably possible that we would be releasing up to $160 million of FIN 48 or unrecognized tax benefits as a result of those examinations, and that, that would be primarily related to the alternative fuel mixture credit. Remember, those go back to 2009. We had included the credit in income, and we had provided a FIN 48 reserve for those that now has been resolved. And so that's the reason, primarily the biggest part of the tax reserves that we released in the quarter.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. Last question, and I'll turn it over. Totally different topic. Doyle, in the past, the company had a number of what I'd call incubation-like businesses within Cellulose Fibers. And years back, there was talk about carbon replacement products being generated by Weyerhaeuser. Obviously, you've had the jet fuel venture. How do you see those playing out over time within Cellulose Fibers? Do you see them as still viable in an environment where you are pursuing operational excellence obviously? Are there areas perhaps where there's been investment spending that maybe that needs to come down at some point?","Doyle R. Simons","Thanks for the question, George. And I'll tell you, at Weyerhaeuser, to your point, innovation has been a core value and will continue to be a core value going forward. With that said, what we -- as we go through the process we're going through on operational excellence, George, we're become -- going to go become very focused to where we're innovating where it adds value to the bottom line. So we want to make sure that the monies that we spend, the effort that we spend on R&D and innovation ultimately results in a benefit to our bottom line. So as we move forward, that's part of the process we're in, is making sure we have direct alignment, again, between the funds that are being spent, the effort that's being spent on innovation and how we ultimately drive value for our customers and for our shareholders.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to start, can you just maybe take a step back and give some broader color on what you're seeing in the Wood Product market, particularly on 2 things, one, comparing it to last year where there was clearly a lot of panic and tension, and also just if you've seen any sort of response given -- and any change in your business just given the decline in the Canadian currency over the last month or so?","Doyle R. Simons","I'll take your first question on that, Patty, to address the Canadian currency situation, but you cut out or maybe we cut out a little bit when you said comparing it to last year where we saw something, and I didn't hear [indiscernible].","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. Last year, there was just a lot of panic and tension. I mean, a lot of the supply hadn't come back yet that you had to jump in housing starts towards the end of the year. And I'm just wondering, have you seen your customers may be more cautious relative to last year given what happened with the price movement? Or given the fact that we did see another late year of ramp-up in housing activity, do they feel well prepared for the housing season that's coming up?","Doyle R. Simons","Sure. So let me talk specifics, and then I'll step back. If you look in terms of specifics, Gail, currently versus kind of the fourth quarter, lumber prices have continued to improve and are up probably $25 versus the fourth quarter average. OSB, as I mentioned, a little bit earlier, in response to a question, we've seen continued pressure there, and those prices are down somewhere probably in the $10 range. Specifically, regarding customers, I would tell you to your exact point, I think inventories are very lean. Customers are cautiously optimistic. They do remember kind of what happened last year. But I would tell you, as we talked to our customers, they are confident that we're going to continue to see growth in housing starts. And in fact, some of our customers' biggest concern at this point is will we have the supply to provide them with what they're going to need to service their customers going forward. So that's kind of how we characterize where we are versus where we were a year ago.","Patricia M. Bedient","And Gail, to your question about the Canadian currency, as you noted, the Canadian dollar has depreciated here of late. And typically, the effect of that is that it makes it easier for Canadian lumber to come into the United States. We really haven't seen a lot of impact as a result of that. That would be primarily the FPS that comes across, both from interior BC, as well as Eastern Canada. And as we've talked about in the past, from a supply perspective, the interior British Columbia is dealing with the Canadian pine beetle, and Eastern Canada is dealing with reductions in the allowable cut. The other piece that is a positive dynamic at that is that today, the export markets for lumber are much more robust than they were a few years ago when we saw a much weaker Canadian dollar. So it is something that we do track very closely. But so far, we haven't seen a big impact from that. And we also do have some Canadian production as well, so we are benefited to the extent that it will come to support.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just a couple more. Your cancellation rate seems to have moved up a bit in WRECO. I'm just wondering if there's anything out of the usual there.","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes, Gail, good question. We really haven't seen anything that we would say would be a trend. It did move up in the fourth quarter, but we haven't seen anything that we would say is really a trend year-over-year. The cancellation rate is in line. I think as we look forward to the first quarter, it's really difficult to tell based on what's going on in the markets because of weather, really severe weather, which you know well better than we do here in the West. Because sitting here in Seattle, which we often complain about the rain, well, there are no complaints about our weather this year compared to what the rest of the country is experiencing. And that does hit for us in our Winchester subsidiary in the Washington, D.C., Virginia, Maryland area, as well as even in Houston, which we wouldn't think would be suffering cold weather, but even the South is being hit. But in talking with our Real Estate folks, there isn't anything that we see that we would say is a trend. Mortgage interest rates are going up a little bit, but it's not a huge significant thing at this point, but we'll stay tuned to that.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just a couple of quick modeling questions. I might have missed it, but can you give us any sort of guidance on what you'd expect the average price in WRECO to do in the quarter? Also, any guidance on the change in pulp downtime costs? And then just one quick last one after that.","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure. The average price will increase relative to the fourth quarter. As you look at our backlog, the average price in the backlog is higher than what it has been in -- at the end of other quarters, so we'll enjoy that going into the first quarter. Margins will come down a little bit compared to the fourth quarter, really based on mix. To your question about maintenance spending, we'll have a little bit more maintenance spending, really more in the major maintenance area. The actual downtime won't be real significant. I would expect that overall, the increase in maintenance spending would be maybe $4 million to $5 million additional than from what we had in the fourth quarter.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just quickly, I thought you mentioned your outlook for OSB, your guidance for Wood Products, you're assuming just a slight decline in OSB pricing? I just want to verify that I heard that, and does that imply that you're expecting a pretty healthy recovery through the balance of the quarter?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, we said that it would be weaker relative to the fourth quarter realizations. So it is one of those things that sitting here in January, it has weakened. We would hope that, that would not be the case as we -- weakening further as we go through the rest of the quarter and start to see the spring building season. But that's something that we'll have to track. I think January is a difficult month usually to forecast for the quarter because it's a weaker quarter -- or weaker month for the quarter. And as you know, again, we are being challenged more this quarter because of the weather impacts, so we'll just have to see what happens as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLP.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I wonder if you can help us think about the magnitude of the profit difference between China and Japan, and how that's going to change, especially as you sell more Doug fir to China, which sounds like a good thing. And second question, can you remind us how different Longview's end markets are versus the rest of your Pacific Northwest business?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, in terms of Longview, I'll take that one first. They do have a high percentage of premium logs as compared to our Western market, so a good percentage of that will go to the Japan market, as well as they also have, though, on a specie mix, a little more whitewood, and that's what you saw in the fourth quarter pricing to China. The mix was more heavily than our typical mix to whitewood versus Douglas fir. As I mentioned in my remarks, we will be changing that mix, so that mix will change a little bit in the fourth quarter to send more Doug fir to China. Now Japan will always compete for the highest-value Doug fir log because of the fact that they do build housing in the traditional post-and-beam construction, for example. They build housing out of wood as opposed to China being more of a construction activity use of the wood. But those -- that historical gap between China and Japan has closed a little bit based upon the strength of the construction activity taking place in China.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","And do you think that's going to keep narrowing, Patty?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, it's always difficult to tell because you've got the activity taking place, and it is the additional supply dynamics as well. But we -- as we sit here today for the first quarter, certainly continue to see very robust demand coming out of China. So I don't see anything that will change it in the near term and, I think, just both of those economies in the longer term. But our demand from Japan has been very stable as well. So we like the fact that we've got 2 very robust markets now that we are -- have the ability to ship wood into.","Operator","Your next question is from Ketan Mamtora with Deutsche Bank.","Ketan Mamtora - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. Can you remind us what you have in the form of tax shields at this point, whether in oils or alternative fuel credits or anything of that kind?","Patricia M. Bedient","We do have some cellulosic biofuel products that we have to apply against our cash taxes. In terms of cash taxes, for example, in 2014, we don't expect to pay any additional cash taxes. I don't have the actual amount of the cellulosic biofuel credit, but you'll get a more detailed review of what we have in taxes, obviously when we file the 10-K, which will be here in the next couple of weeks.","Ketan Mamtora - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Right. But you do not expect any significant cash taxes in 2014?","Patricia M. Bedient","Correct.","Ketan Mamtora - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. And then on EWP, I saw the prices were up quite nicely year-over-year. Can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing in that business in terms of just overall pick up, and then if you can tell us what the operating rates were in all the Wood Products grades in Q4?","Doyle R. Simons","Sure. Let me just start with the operating rates, and then we'll go back to the -- what we saw in pricing. But in terms of operating rates in lumber in the fourth quarter, operating rates were roughly 85%. A portion of that fall from the third quarter had to do with weather-related items. In OSB, the operating rates were approximately 89%. And in ELP, we've ramped up production there. If you factor out all the closed facilities and started-up facilities, we're nearing -- we're at much higher rates than we've been over the past few quarters in EWP. In terms of pricing, we've been encouraged by what we've seen in EWP from the standpoint that EWP normally does lag. Lumber and OSB as housing has continued to improve. Over the past year or so, we've started to see gained traction in EWP pricing. And while that will be lumpy going forward, we would expect that trend to continue going forward.","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes. And EWP pricing in terms of how we price the product, we aren't seeing a significant change in the first quarter. It really is a function -- the lower price realizations is really a function of mix in terms of the actual sale of the products that are going in. That business does have a very wide product mix ranging from TJIs to solid section to Timberstrand and Parallam, so it's really a mix that's moving that. Demand continues to be very good.","Ketan Mamtora - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got you. That's very helpful. And then just one last one. You mentioned a couple of times about weather. I was wondering if it is possible at this time to sort of quantify what that impact would be in Q1.","Doyle R. Simons","No. It's difficult to do for Q1 because we're right in the middle of it. As you know, I'm kind of just giving you a sense as every leader of every business that we have came to me yesterday and gave me an update on exactly the impact from weather. So whether it be in our Timberland, whether it be in our Wood Products operations or Cellulose Fiber, all of those are experiencing some impact from weather. Just for lumber, for example, we've already lost 20 days in our lumber operation due to either the impact from frozen logs or impact from roads being closed or whatever that -- or something freezing in one of our sawmills, so difficult to give any impact this point. We did do that exercise for fourth quarter. And I can tell you, in our Wood Products operation, which is where the impact was in the fourth quarter, that number was probably somewhere between $3 million to $5 million in the fourth quarter, and we'll be continuing to monitor the weather impact in the first quarter, as Patty said. As Patty said, we are hopeful that as we move forward through the quarter that the weather improves, and we can make up some of the impact that we've experienced over the last couple of weeks.","Patricia M. Bedient","So we'll be running some additional days in lumber, for example, to make up the additional volume that was lost in the additional days that Doyle was talking about, and that's primarily days in the South.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","First question is on looking at the land sales, you mentioned in the first quarter when you gave the guidance on the Timberland, it was excluding the land sales. And I know there's 2 components: What you sell and what you transfer. And I noticed -- I know the fourth quarter tends to be a big number, and the first quarter is low. In '13, that swing was about $25 million. Should we kind of see that kind of a swing as well where it might go from $30 million in the fourth of last year to something in the single digits in this quarter?","Patricia M. Bedient","I think the way to think about it, Chip, is we had $20 million in the fourth quarter of 2013, and we really wouldn't see much at all in the first quarter of 2014, so that -- about a $20 million swing quarter-to-quarter.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then could you give us some help on the interest expense you think you'd see for the year? And I know that you might have to qualify it, given the WRECO situation, but I know it popped up in the fourth quarter and -- as we expected. But what -- should we annualize that number x what we think happens to WRECO, or what would you have us do?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, Chip, remember that in the fourth quarter, we had a loss on the early extinguishment of debt, that was the Longview Timber debt, and we put that loss in interest expense. So be sure that as you look at the fourth quarter interest expense, you back out the $25 million early extinguishment that we called out for you as a special item. Past that, I think you've got the debt. The interest rates, I think, are all -- I mean, there's no change really there as well. So I think that, that will give you a pretty good guidance in terms of what to put in for the full year of 2014, and we don't have any maturities now coming due in 2014.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. So $350 million to $355 million. And then on the -- you mentioned real quickly on the tax situation, at least for the black liquor part, I would imagine that's all noncash, is that right?","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes. We do have, in terms of some refunds coming back in 2014. So it wasn't cash in 2013. But in 2014, as a result of closing out some of those examinations, we do expect to get some refunds back. That's one of the reasons why we have no cash taxes due in 2014 on a net basis.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And then the last thing is you mentioned in the guidance on the Cellulose segment, a little more maintenance, and I know there -- that there are a lot of moving parts as you go to a longer cycle for the mills. What -- can you give us some idea as to how that will unfold throughout the year? Will there, for example, be very high or very low maintenance quarters that you can identify at this point?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, yes, there will -- it will be lumpy because it will depend on what we do in terms of the mills, probably the biggest lumpiness will occur in our liquid packaging operation because we do have some capital projects to tie in later this year. I don't recall whether that's third quarter, but I think it is. So you will see some lumpiness through the year. On a year-over-year basis, other than that extended outage at Longview for that capital, it'll be pretty steady. It'll be different in terms of the mills, so where we take the maintenance. But the total amount will be up a little bit because of the liquid packaging extended maintenance outage. Other than that, not much difference. So in 2013, we had 1 mill that didn't have an outage. So our New Bern mills didn't have an outage in 2014. We've got 2 mills that won't take an outage, and then that will continue as we go through a full cycle of implementation.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A question or comment. Just on the question, have you -- besides EWP and distributions' hard cost savings targets by the end of the year, have you been able to put a more definitive time line on the $260 million that you identified on that -- in the New York -- your New York Analyst Day in lumber must be in Cellulose Fibers?","Doyle R. Simons","In -- as I mentioned in December, we have set those targets. We will be working forward on those. You'll start to see those -- some of those bottom line improvements as early as the first quarter of this year, and then we will give you updates on a periodic basis or probably on an annual basis as to exactly where we are. So again, we don't know. Some of it's capital intensive, some of it's not. We don't know the exact timing. But I could tell you, we are focused everyday on executing against those specific initiatives and those operational excellence targets that we set forth. The other part of it that is near term just like EWP and distribution is the SG&A cost savings, which we indicated we would be at a run rate of $75 million lower by the end of this year, and we are confident that we will, in fact, achieve that.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Is there -- just for modeling, is there a range that you can give us for what you expect in '14?","Doyle R. Simons","Well, I mean, I think the range would be the things that you've outlined, the specific numbers on EWP, the specific numbers on distribution, the specific numbers on SG&A. And then again, you can -- it's not going to all be back-end loaded in the numbers. As we said, it's going to be a 2-, 3-, 4-year process. There will be some lumpiness, but there will be benefits that show up as early as the first quarter. And as early as the first quarter and clearly in by the end of 2014, we'll see some benefits. And again, the ultimate measure, as we said in December 17, is going to be our relative performance versus the competition, and I'm confident you're going to see that improved going forward.","Patricia M. Bedient","Paul, the other thing that I would just caution a little bit on modeling is remembering that the cost target that we've given you, for example, in lumber, our cost targets of lowering our cost net of logs. As you know very well, the biggest percentage of cost in lumber is the log cost. So log cost is continuing to escalate, which is a good thing for us in terms of our Timberland business. But net-net to the lumber cost, if you were just looking at the P&L, the cost net of logs on a per 1000-board-feet number should be lowered, but the absolute number of cost will fluctuate based upon log cost.","Operator","And your last question will come from the line of Joshua Zaret with Longbow Research.","Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC","Doyle, in Timberlands, in what you call International Operations, which I assume is Uruguay, you've shown dramatic revenue growth over the last several years through 2012, and then it fell 15% in 2013. So a couple of questions related to that. One, what caused the downdraft in revenue and, I guess, earnings? And two, are there plans -- if I'm right, it's Uruguay. Can you tell us where the state of the forest and the converting operations are in their plans to double that revenue in the next whatever years?","Doyle R. Simons","So I'll try to answer your -- the second part of your question and then, as Patty did, to deal with the first. So Uruguay, as you indicated, is a primary component of our international operation. We are focused on continuing to grow trees there. As you may recall, Josh, we just planted those trees not that many years ago, so we're not in the full harvest mode at this point in time. So as time passes, we'll be able to generate additional revenue and earnings off of those -- off of that 300,000 -- approximate 300,000 acres of land in Uruguay going forward.","Patricia M. Bedient","And sure, Josh, the revenue in the international segment has fluctuated. It is only Uruguay as we sit here today. It has included some China. It has included some other smaller pieces. So -- and the other thing is that from time to time, it has included some land sales in Uruguay as well. But as we sit here today, it is purely focused on the Uruguayan operations. And the end product that we produce there is lumber appearance or panel -- appearance panel that we come out of there. The other thing that has been in international operations is we had a small joint venture in Brazil, which also has now been curtailed since a year ago. So going forward, I think, and especially as panel markets start to pick up, we will see some of that reverse.","Joshua L. Zaret - Longbow Research LLC","Okay. So I mean, it's been consistent growth until last year. So you believe that will be back on track? And could -- but -- so could it have been land sales that caused that down or...","Patricia M. Bedient","It's likely the land sales. I don't have the detail of that in front of me. We would be happy to take it off-line and walk through it with you, there have been some land sales in Uruguay in the past. So there's some lumpiness that comes into that as well.","Doyle R. Simons","Okay. If I understand it, that was our last call. Let me just conclude by thanking everybody for your interest in our company and, as I mentioned earlier, goes to you all.","Patricia M. Bedient","Thanks, everybody.","Operator","Thank you, again, for participating in today's conference. You may now disconnect."],"22798":["Weyerhaeuser Co.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Company's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I will now turn the call over to our host, Beth Baum. Ma'am, Please go ahead.","Elizabeth L. Baum - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Ginger. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2016 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website.","On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion.","Second quarter results include after tax earnings of $38 million from discontinued operations and $11 million of after tax charges for merger and legal expenses. Results for our entire Cellulose Fibers segment are reported as discontinued operations. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we're into $130 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA from our continuing operations was $413 million and this represents an improvement of $77 million or 23% compared with first quarter results.","I'm proud of our second quarter operating performance. Our teams continued to execute well and deliver solid operating results including Wood Products strongest second quarter in over a decade. In the quarter, we also announced the sale of our pulp mills and liquid packaging board facility for collective proceeds of $2.5 billion or approximately $1.8 billion after tax.","Closed the Twin Creeks transaction receiving $440 million in cash and in transaction value and 260,000 acres of Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per acre. We purchased over $830 million worth of our common shares, and made strong progress on merger integration and activities as we work together to successfully integrate Plum Creek and fully capture the cost and operational synergies that will drive superior value for our shareholders. Before I turn to our second quarter business results, let me make some brief comments about the housing market.","Single family housing starts continued to grow at double-digit rate, and year-to-date activity remains in line with our expectations. Through June, single family starts had improved 15% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis, and total US starts were up 8%. Although supply side constraints such as skilled labor, permitting delays and fees and rising land and construction costs dampened the market's acceleration during the second quarter, solid economic fundamentals including job growth and historically low mortgage rate continued to drive improving housing demand. We continue to anticipate approximately $1.2 million housing starts for 2016 in line with consensus estimates.","Let me now turn to our business segment. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $125 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $21 million to $220 million. Non-cash depletion and amortization costs increased by $25 million following a full quarter of higher depletion rates, resulting from acquisition accounting.","Western Timberlands contributed $114 million to second quarter EBITDA compared with $118 million in the first quarter. Western fee harvest volumes increased but average realizations for Western logs declined modestly primarily due to a greater proportion of sales to domestic and Chinese markets.","As anticipated, sales volumes to Japan declined in the second quarter as first quarter post forward (05:01) demand in advance of a scheduled consumption tax increase which was later delayed. Pricing for our Japanese logs moderated slightly in the quarter. Volumes to China rose due to seasonally higher construction activity and average log realizations were essentially flat.","Log inventory to Chinese ports were a little changed during the quarter and remain at normalized levels. In western domestic market, log supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Average realizations declined slightly due to mix and per unit logging cost increased seasonally as second quarter harvest includes a greater proportion of higher elevation white wood.","Southern Timberlands contributed $99 million to the second quarter EBITDA, $22 million more than the first quarter. Southern (05:51) increased by 40% due to a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. Realizations for Southern logs declined slightly due to mix, as second-quarter sales included a higher percentage of pulp wood. Silviculture and forestry costs increased due to catch-up on first-quarter activity and has been delayed due to wet weather. Northern Timberlands' EBITDA improved slightly compared to the first quarter.","The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million operational excellence targets for 2016. During the quarter, internal benchmarking teams completed an initial survey of operational synergy opportunities and prioritized areas with the greatest potential value. A deep-dive comparison of each company's practices in the highest-value areas is under way. We are pleased with the progress to-date and look forward to capturing these opportunities later this year and into 2017.","Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $12 million to second quarter earnings compared with $15 million in the first quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $28 million. For Real Estate, the number of acreage sold declined slightly due to the timings of transaction closings. Average price per acre increased as second quarter included the sale of a high value parcel in Cannon Beach, Oregon.","EBITDA from Energy and Natural Resources operations improved slightly. Our Real Estate team is running full out as they apply a concrete to asset value optimization or AVO process to the legacy Wayerhaeuser Timberlands. This work is proceeding well, and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in early 2017.","We expect real estate activity will ramp up significantly in the fourth quarter of this year, and into 2017 as this process moves toward conclusion.","Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $156 million to second quarter earnings, an improvement of 80% compared with first quarter. By effectively capitalizing on improving market and ongoing operational excellence initiatives, the business delivered its strongest second quarter since 2005. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $189 million, $72 million more than the first quarter.","EBITDA from lumber grows to $96 million. This is an improvement of $45 million or nearly 90% compared with first quarter. Average realizations improved nearly 10% and sales volume increased by 8%. The business also had another strong quarter operationally. Western log costs declined and recovery improved and manufacturing costs net of logs decreased due to the continued benefit of operational excellence initiatives.","OSB contributed $43 million to EBITDA, $12 million more than the first quarter. Average sales realizations increased 12% and our mills continued to run well.","Engineered Wood Products EBITDA increased to $45 million, $14 million more than the first quarter. Sales volume rose due to seasonally higher demand and a full quarter of Plum Creek, MDF and plywood operations. Average realizations for solid section and (09:27) declined slightly due to mix.","In Distribution, EBITDA rose $5 million compared with first quarter due to improved sales volume, higher margins and ongoing cost control. The business have increased EBITDA about $14 million year-to-date against the 2016 full year target of $15 million to $20 million.","Late in the third quarter, we announced changes to improve the profitability of our Montana wood product operations. In the third quarter, we will permanently close the lumber and plywood mills in Colombia Falls. These moves will allow us to align the available logs supply with our manufacturing capacity including adding shift at our Kalispell facilities and best position our Montana operations for long-term success.","Wood products remains relentlessly focused on OpEx initiatives and is on track to achieve its 2016 target. During our first quarter earnings call, we indicated we thought the second quarter Wood Products results could be comparable to second quarter of 2013. A time when we were just beginning our OpEx journey and lumber and OSB pricing were significantly higher than it is today.","In fact, we've exceeded second quarter 2013 EBITDA by $23 million despite the fact that average lumber realizations in the second quarter were $35 per 1000 (10:46), lower than three years ago and average realizations for OSB were more than $90 per 1000 (10:53), lower than they were in the second quarter 2013. This overall improvement highlights the significant contribution, operational excellence is making to our business results.","I will now turn to discontinued operations, chart 11. As I previously mentioned, beginning this quarter our entire Cellulose Fibers segment has been reported as discontinued operations This includes results from our pulp mills, liquid packaging board facility, and a printing papers joint venture. Discontinued operations contributed $52 million to pre-tax earnings compared with $29 million in the first quarter.","Average sales realization for pulp and liquid packaging rose compared with the first quarter. And sales volumes for liquid packaging increased. Maintenance and energy cost declined slightly. Second quarter results also reflect accounting changes resulting from the reclassification as discontinued operations. Non-cash depreciation expense decreased by $23 million compared with first quarter due to a requirement to seek depreciation on asset held for sale, and corporate overhead expense previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers is now reported in unallocated items. This change affects both current and prior periods. These expenses total approximately $9 million per quarter or approximately $35 million on an annual basis.","The effect of these accounting changes was largely offset by charges associated with the strategic review process and other transaction expenses. Yesterday, we received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance in the US for the announced sale of our pulp mills to International Paper. We continue to make progress, remaining regulatory approvals, primarily competition clearance in several foreign jurisdictions. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter. Similarly, we have received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the sale of our liquid packaging business and continue to progress with remaining approvals. We expect to close the liquid packaging transaction in the third quarter.","The process for our premium paper joint venture is proceeding well. We are actively working with prospective buyers and we will update you when that review is complete.","I want to thank our Cellulose Fibers' employees who are maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering strong results throughout the strategic review and sale processes.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items, and our third quarter outlook.","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide \u2013 chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly or roughly 5% compared to the second quarter due to seasonality and lower export prices.","In our Western Timberlands operations, overall, we expect harvest volumes to be similar to second quarter levels. Although Japanese housing activity remained strong, we anticipate crisis will soften as markets adjust to the delayed increase in the consumption tax.","In China, seasonally slower construction activity and continued currency headwinds will result in lower sales volumes and moderately lower pricing.","Domestic log volumes and prices are expected to remain stable. Operating conditions throughout the Western region have been favorable as the risk of fire has been low. Western logging costs will be seasonally higher in the third quarter as summer weather allows us to shift harvest activities to higher elevations, which have a higher percentage of cable logging and longer haul distances. In the South, fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than the second quarter but on a lower grade mix as third quarter activity typically includes a higher percentage of a thinning volume.","Silviculture and road spending will also be seasonally higher. In the North, third quarter harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the prior quarter. Note that second quarter harvests are the lowest of the year because of logging and hauling limitations due to spring breakup, or as we like to say in the Northern Woods, the mud season. We expect average sales realizations will be similar to second quarter levels.","In Real Estate, and Energy and Natural Resources segment, we expect significantly higher earnings and adjusted EBITDA from real estate sales during the second half of the year. Nearly all this improvement will occur in the fourth quarter. Third quarter real estate activity will be primarily focused on continuing work on the AVO process, in building our inventory of higher and better used properties. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly compared to the second quarter, but the mix of real estate sale is slightly heavier to higher basis lands.","In the fourth quarter, we expect EBITDA will be more than double the third-quarter level as the first results of AVO assessments in the portions of the US South are taken to market and begin to move through to closing.","The Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain tight as buyers continue to only purchase product to meet their immediate needs, which has been pushing lumber and OSB pricing higher as we enter the third quarter. We're anticipating comparable sales volumes and continued strength in lumber and OSB pricing in the third quarter as housing starts, especially single family, continue to improve and builders move into the late summer building season. We expect to see continued solid performance in Engineered Wood Products.","Overall, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be considerably higher than the second quarter. Lumber and OSB prices improved throughout July. If prices stabilize at current levels for the balance of the quarter, the segment is on track to improve EBITDA and earnings by roughly 10% compared with second quarter. However, we believe there's continued upside for both lumber and OSB prices and anticipate earnings could exceed this level.","Now, let me direct your attention to chart 10 which details the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $1 million, $9 million lower than the first quarter results, which included a $13 million gain on foreign exchange. Note that unallocated corporate function expenses now include approximately $9 million of costs that were recorded in Cellulose Fiber segment prior to the discontinued operations reclassification.","Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $485 million, up $74 million from the first quarter. Cash flow from operations including Cellulose Fibers was $492 million for the second quarter. This is an increase of $445 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year.","In addition to increased cash flows from Wood Products and Timberlands segments, we saw positive variance in our working capital due to the seasonal decrease in inventory levels quarter-over-quarter. Cash from investing activities was a positive $350 million for the quarter, as we received $440 million in cash proceeds from the Twin Creeks transaction, which closed on April 1.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $101 million, including $12 million of our discontinued operations. We expect 2016 CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $425 million, with Timberlands' capital spending expected to total $125 million for the year, and Wood Products' spending of approximately $300 million.","Financing cash flows included $831 million for share repurchases, and $228 million for common dividends. As of June 30, we had drawn $1.4 billion of the $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.4 billion, was $6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. We intend to pay down the term loans for the proceeds from our recently announced asset sales.","Interest expense of $114 million for the second quarter reflects a full quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. We expect interest expense will be comparable in the third quarter. For our continuing operations, the company anticipates the full-year tax rate will be between 18% and 20% based on the expected mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income.","I'll wrap up with chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchases activities. Through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 58 million shares of common stock under our February 2016 share repurchase program at an average price of $29.18 per share.","We have continued our repurchase activity during the third quarter and as of August 1, our cumulative repurchases totaled $1.98 billion or nearly 67 million shares at an average price of $29.45. The company did not repurchase shares during the period June 1 through June 28 because of the measurement period for our mandatory convertible preference shares.","The mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares on July 1 at a rate of approximately 1.69 common shares per preference share. As a result, common shares outstanding increased by approximately $23.2 million shares subsequent to quarter-end.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Russell. I will wrap up this morning with some brief comments on integration, synergy and SG&A. We continue to make strong progress on merger integration. I'm encouraged about the teamwork I see among employees at all levels as we work together to service our customers, identify best practices and implement improved processes for our merged company.","We have fully identified the sources of the $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies. As of the end of the second quarter, we are capturing about one-third of these reductions on a run rate basis.","I'm highly confident we will reach our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year one. In addition to capturing merger synergies, we must address the $35 million of corporate costs, formerly allocated to the Cellulose Fiber segment. To ensure our businesses remain competitive, we will eliminate these costs just as we did following the divestiture of our Home Building business.","We have been planning for the reductions as part of the strategic review process, and anticipate eliminating these costs within 12 months after closing the International Paper transaction.","In closing, I will mention that the move to our new Seattle headquarters remains on track for mid-September. I'm also pleased to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, December 13. We will send out the details in a press release later this morning.","At that meeting, we will provide specific updates on progress against the key targets for our merged company, and you will have an opportunity to hear firsthand from each of our business leaders about their key initiatives as we work together to drive superior value for our shareholders.","And now, I'd like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Timberlands \u2013 as you think about 3Q in the South, I think you talked about softer price mix. If you take the impact of mix shifts away and you just look at same product prices. I was wondering what you're seeing in July and August. Are prices just flat or you're seeing any kind of improvement in Southern log prices?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Now, Anthony, what we're seeing is if you take it \u2013 and you're thinking about it exactly right on what I'd like to say, an apples-to-apples basis, prices we anticipate will be essentially flat in the third quarter versus the second quarter.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And I guess, what do you attribute that to? I mean, presumably lumber mills can pay more for fiber and housing starts are growing double digits. Is there just too much inventory out there? Why aren't log prices improving or inflecting as I think some of us thought that they might now by now?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Anthony, and the question, and we've all talked about it is as what is the inflection point where you see significant improvement in pricing. And we remain confident, as housing continues to improve as you said, as additional lumber capacity comes online in the South we remain confident we're going to hit that inflection point based on where supply and demand reach equilibrium. And at that point, well, we believe we'll start to see Southern log prices begin to return to the levels they were prior to the recession. However, we don't think we're going to see that in the third quarter. We're set to wait as we move forward to hit that inflection point.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. And then, just in Wood Products, you mentioned the Columbia Falls announcement and adding shifts elsewhere. Was Columbia Falls \u2013 will it end up being kind of net neutral from a capacity standpoint? And then just generally, if you could talk about your Wood Products footprint. Are you adding capacity with the increase in starts or how should we think about for the year?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So for the year, Anthony, overall, we're running our facilities close to 95%, 96% 97% operating rate due to these good markets. So, you always have a percent or two of Creek (25:46), but we don't anticipate adding any significant capacity in the near term.","Columbia Falls net-net, you will have lower capacity but higher profitability. As we stated when we announced that, the reason for that move was to align the available fiber with the productive capacity, and by doing this, we are able to run the remaining mills full out with additional shifts, which will ensure the long-term success of our Montana operations and improve the overall profitability of our Montana operations on a go-forward basis.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Our next question is from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. How you doing? Doyle, first question in Wood, obviously, very strong result, better than your guidance. As we look out the next couple of quarters, where do you see the most cost pressure? And you're doing a great job on SG&A relative to the revenue base in the business. That's obviously part of the program at Weyerhaeuser, but where do you start to see some tension here? How long can you hold the line here within Wood? And then I had a couple of follow-on questions on SG&A.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of cost pressures, George, at this point in time, we don't see any significant cost pressures now. It all runs up, you clearly would have some freight cost pressures and people continue to anticipate that happening at some point, but in the near term, don't see any significant cost pressure. We'd love to see some cost pressure from a log perspective, but not seeing that as we just referenced in the near term.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Yeah. That was part of the question behind the question. The second question I wanted to get into is on Engineered Wood. It sounds like from your commentary that you're pleased with the performance there. And looking at the slide deck, if I thought correctly, we've seen price is drifting a bit lower. If that's correct, what's driving that? Is it again lack of cost push? Is it perhaps somewhat more competitive markets? Single-family starts are obviously doing well, which you would think would be beneficial for Engineered Wood supply, demand and market trend. So, how would you frame that for us?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, what I would say from a pricing perspective, a big part of that slight downward pressure we've seen is just having to do with mix. As we move forward, George, I would say that there are some price increases. Or a price increase that will be playing out in the West, but a portion of that price increase will be offset by some pricing pressure in the East as you have the dealer consolidation and all the different things that are happening from a customer perspective overall. But going forward, we would anticipate prices would be flat to maybe up slightly.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then the last one if, again, we did our math right. Again, you've done a very good job on SG&A over the last number of years across the businesses. If I look at Timberland, if I look at Real Estate & ENR versus year-ago levels that ratio has ticked up a bit. Obviously, some of that's probably just mixed in Plum Creek. Again, can you help frame what the opportunity there is for cost reductions in the next couple of quarters as you come out of 2016 and head into 2017? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, George. And the way we look at these cost reductions is pretty straightforward. We say, what was the SG&A and R&D for both combined companies in 2015, and as we said, our goal, and we're confident in reaching that goal, it's about the first quarter of 2017, we will be at that run rate. So, we're modeled \u2013 we're as you would anticipate, George, we're on top of that. We know exactly where we are. We've identified the source of those synergies, and we're starting to realize some of it, more to come as we run through the balance of this year and into early next year. But that's the way we're monitoring it to make sure it does, to your point, in fact, show up on the bottom-line.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, Doyle. Thank you. Good luck in the quarter.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Collin Mings from Raymond James.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Collin. How you doing?","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good. Good. A few questions here. First, just maybe big picture, talk a little bit more or update us on how you think the softwood lumber negotiations are going to play out, and just kind of your update as far as thoughts if no deal is reached in the standstill period, comes and goes without a deal.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. And as you know, we are very actively involved with and aligned with the position of the US Coalition, and there is an ongoing dialogue between the Coalition and our US Trade representative. I do believe participants send from both sides are interested in a resolution. And I'm frankly encouraged the governments \u2013 each of the governments are continuing to have discussions.","As you know, this is a really important issue for Weyerhaeuser, and we remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached prior to the deadline. But we're prepared to move forward if that doesn't happen in follow trade days (31:21). That's kind of where we are.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for the update there. I think, one thing as far as in the prepared remarks, roughly you talked about CapEx, the $425 million. I think that's down from a comparable $450 million, I think, that's what you had got it to earlier. Is that right? And, maybe, what caused the change there?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's correct. We did lower our CapEx spend. We brought it down a little bit on the Timberlands side as we look at the combined operations for the Plum Creek and Weyerhaeuser. We've just refined that number as we move into the second half of the year.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just thinking about some of the commentary around the expected ramp in real estate sales, maybe just talk a little bit more about order of magnitude, what you're think in the fourth quarter could be as far as the amount of step-up. Again, I know, we talked on prior calls about the overall ramp showing up more in 2017, but just from a modeling standpoint, how should we think about the fourth quarter?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So, Collin, as we look at the third quarter, we'd expect the third quarter to be pretty similar to the second quarter. And then again, as we bring more of the AVO (32:27) properties into the market and we started ramping up that program, you would expect the fourth quarter to really increase probably double the third quarter volume.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That was very helpful. And then just one last one and I'll turn it over. Just going back to Anthony's question on Wood Products. How much of your EBITDA is generated from Canada operations at Wood Products?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Collin, I don't know that number exactly off the top of my head, we'll follow up. But most of our revenue is generated out in the US, although Canada is an important part of our overall Wood Products operation. So, I'll have to get back \u2013 we'll get back with you on that.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russ.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Russ, is it possible to get a go forward look at annual harvest volumes in the South and in the West?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","As we have guided to our total year volumes, we're at about 40 million tons to 42 million tons. So, as you look at our harvest volume to-date, and then you can extrapolate out to what you think the third and fourth quarter will look like, but we don't provide specific guidance for the volumes on a quarter-to-quarter basis.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And is there likely to be a difference between what you'll do, say over the next three to five years in terms of harvest volumes, and then what you might define as kind of long-term sustainable? It seems to me both Longview and some of those (34:13) properties offered opportunities for accelerated harvest in the near years.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Mark, what I would tell you is, as you would anticipate, we're spending a lot of time updating our strategic harvest plans for the combined land base. So, we're right in the midst of that, so we'll give you some \u2013 in the future, we'll give you some look at how we think that'll play out in the time horizon that you just laid out. We're right in the middle of that process currently.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. And then, Doyle, can you just give us something of what you're expecting from Japan over the next couple of quarters?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So, Japan has been interesting in terms of how this consumption taxes has played out in the second quarter. As we talked about, the volume s down due to the latest consumption tax and prices decline. In the third quarter, Mark, our best guess is that volumes will be kind of flattish. And prices could be down slightly again as consumption tax plays out and also from the competition from the European laminators due to the strong dollar.","And then as we look in our crystal ball and the crystal ball isn't always right, but as we look in our crystal ball for the fourth quarter, we would expect some rebound in prices in both Japan and China. That's kind of how we see it playing out.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. And then, final question, just when we think about the SLA, Doyle, is it \u2013 would we be correct if we think the sort of the biggest issue for you guys in how this plays out is really the impact and sort of value of timber coming off of your Southern and your Western Timberlands?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","There's no doubt, Mark, that that is an important component of getting the SLA right on a go-forward basis.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","But if we get tougher restraints, could we see you actually increasing the amount of capital you'd put in the saw mills?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Mark, as you know, we have an ongoing \u2013 a game plan to \u2013 that we've shared with you and others about the capital that we'll be spending in our Wood Products operation on a go-forward basis to make sure we're positioned well, to fully capitalize on the upturn and get our costs to where they need to be. So, spending capital in our Wood Products operation at about the $300 million level that we've done over a past year or two, we think is going to be the right level, at least in the near term going forward.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks, Doyle. Good luck.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Yes. Thank you, and good morning, Doyle, Russell and Beth.","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","So first question \u2013 a couple of just accounting things. One is, I know that when you sold the Cellulose business, and congrats on getting that approval, they at least said that the EBITDA in 2015 was $350 million. And I'm just wondering, would that have really been $386 million or does that $350 million not include that corporate cost number for them?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Chip, I'm not \u2013 that $350 million is really based on their calculations and based on their models. And so, while we did see that number, you definitely want to look \u2013 we're reporting up to the point of where it's going to be out of our system. I really can't comment on how they came up with that particular number.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","So, that's what, it was for 2015? But I guess another way to ask the question is if I look at last year's EBITDA, as you reported it for the segment, then obviously about $36 million of the EBITDA would've been $36 million higher without these corporate cost allocations, is that fair?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. That is correct.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. And then the second question is, I know \u2013 I believe it's just typically the case, but when you make it a discontinued operations, I believe the number you present in your slide includes all the cash costs, but not depreciation. In other words, you said that it made $52 million, but that, I would assume, does not include depreciation or does that bear any depreciation, or for that matter, any interest expense?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So we \u2013 there's $23 million of depreciation associated with that that was \u2013 we stopped, mid-quarter. If you looked at prior quarters, it would be about \u2013 the equivalent would be about $38 million of depreciation.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. So, you actually had $38 million per quarter going into the second quarter, but then you did $23 million in the second, and it'll be zero in the third. Is that fair?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Correct.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a more broader question, thanks for those details, is when you look at Eastern Canada, I've been hearing that \u2013 and I don't think you guys are terribly active there, but as you think about the lumber market, it seems like Eastern Canada, I'm hearing that their harvest or their growth of timber has actually come back in recent years and that there would be more activity there in lumber and perhaps even plywood, but lumber in particular. If there is any market for off take, OSB plants or pulp mills. And do you agree with that? In other words, do you think that you could see potential supply, leaving aside any kind of trade issues, coming from Eastern Canada or do you think that's not likely?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Chip, I would say, at least from our standpoint, it's in the not likely category. We have not seen what you're referencing and don't think additional capacity or additional capabilities are going to be available in Eastern Canada.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","And would you say it is fair in the Eastern half of the country, I'm not so sure about the West part of the continent that your residuals can often by a very material percentage of your profit?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's a \u2013 it's an important part. That's right.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners","Understood. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Doyle, is it safe to say that with the better lumber prices and very successful asset sales that you're feeling pretty good that Weyerhaeuser has addressed the rating agencies issues and that at this point, you've got room to execute on your buybacks the way you want to rather than to make them happy.","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Mark, this is Russell. We definitely spend time at the rating agencies to make sure that they understand our deposition and our EBITDA generation. And we're very comfortable with where we're at with the rating agencies and our current investment grade rating.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Mark, as you referenced the share repurchase \u2013 we have, as we said, we were going to do it on an accelerated basis. We've essentially completed the $2 billion in, I guess, less than six months and did it in what we think has been a attractive value from our shareholder perspective of less than $29.50 per share. So, pleased with the progress that we've made on the share repurchase.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","That's super. And just one quick comment or question on the log realizations. We've heard that smaller land owners in the South had been more aggressive. Do you think that's one of the reasons why we haven't seen log prices keeping up? Or is that not as widespread as we're hearing?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that is a component of what has happened on the log pricing. Small land owners, you never exactly what motivates them or when they bring things to market. But clearly there, we have seen some of that happening over the past year or two.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Gail Glazerman from Roe Equity Research.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC","Hi. Good morning. A quick question...","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Gail.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC","A quick follow-up on the buybacks. If I remember correctly, it was initially going to be $2 billion of the $2.5 billion was going to be accelerated, and I'm just wondering if you could give some perspective on your approach to that remaining $500 million?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC","Will that be also accelerated or more opportunistic?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So, you're exactly right, Gail. What we've said is that the authorization for the $2.5 billion, if we will do $2 billion on an accelerated basis, and as I just mentioned, we have essentially completed that. We've also said consistently that once we do, we'll take a pause and we'll work closely with our board to determine the timing of the additional $500 million. So, that's what we'll be doing.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC","Okay. This might be a little off the wall, but (43:14) used to talk about trying to build an export market out of the South? And is that something, an effort that you're continuing, and what your view would be from that, on the long-term?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. We are, as you would anticipate constantly evaluating our markets and the way to grow markets. As you also know, the South is very small in terms of export market currently, but we'll continue to look at opportunities as we move forward, and we think that market will in fact develop over time.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC","Okay. And just one last one, yesterday, your partner with some of the development plans, and around the Carolinas is talking about an accelerated monetization. And I was just wondering if you could give some perspective on how that might affect Weyerhaeuser?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So those are the joint venture partnerships that Plum Creek entered into. And we have been in discussions with them, and we're aware that they're seeking to do an accelerated program to divest to some of those properties. Given that's a joint venture, we treat that as equity accounting. We'll see the benefit of that as they execute on that plan.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on the real estate, and the stepping up of activity there later this year and into next year, is that primarily going to be on legacy Weyerhaeuser lands or would we \u2013 should we expect it to be a mix of legacy Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek? Because obviously the Plum Creek land presumably were stepped up, but the Weyerhaeuser lands haven't been.","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, Mark, this is Russell. We'll see a mix, but we may see some more Plum Creek lands coming in, in the third and fourth quarter, which will result in a little higher bases because of that step-up. As we look at the combined portfolio, obviously, we're focused on getting to the Weyerhaeuser lands through the AVO process. But in conjunction with that, we're looking at all the opportunities on the combined portfolio. And it really does provide us with a lot of optionality as far as which lands to bring to market.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then, shifting gears a little bit, but any kind of big picture thoughts on how you'll be going about the dividend recognizing you had a lot of improvement in your Wood Products business. It's kind of underlying earnings there. Yet, Timber has maybe been a little bit slow to see the price improvement in the South. How \u2013 what might be a kind of a helpful way of thinking through how you'd be approaching the dividend at this point and if it's changed at all as your mix of businesses have changed quite a bit in the last year or so?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mark. As you know, we're committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. 2016 is going to be very noisy as we continue to move forward and lots of moving pieces. As we look into 2017, we're going to continue to benefit from cost and operational synergies, continued OpEx improvements, strong housing market, all those types of things.","We will be spending time with our board as we move forward to figure out exactly how to think about the dividend on a go-forward basis with the mix of assets that we now have with the much more stable earnings stream that comes from Timberlands and then the improvements that we've made in our Wood Products to take some of the volatility out of that, and most importantly probably to eliminate some of the downside in our Wood Products operation on a go-forward basis. So, all things that would be factoring in to what the appropriate level of our dividend is on a go-forward basis.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And one last one if I could, the tax rate guidance, 18% to 20% I guess a little higher than I would have anticipated. And maybe, what one question would be, does the interest expense \u2013 can that get allocated to taxable \u2013 the taxable REIT subsidiary or does some of that actually run through the \u2013 not get that benefit?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So, Mark, we're guiding the 18% to 20% for our full year tax rate. As far as the allocation of the interest expense between the taxable REIT subsidiary and the REIT, we actually have debt that is associated with taxable REIT subsidiary. So, that's allocated and tax effected accordingly. And then, there's debt associated with the REIT assets. So, you'll get a blended rate.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. I'll circle back. Thank you.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions today. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thanks everybody for joining. As indicated, that was our final question, and I'd just like to close by thanking everybody for their interest in Weyerhaeuser. Take care.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call.

Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Please review the statements -- the warning statements on our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. On the call, we will discuss non-GAAP financial measures. A GAAP reconciliation can be found in the earnings materials, which are on our website.","Discussing third quarter 2013 this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle. Doyle?","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you, Kathy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us for today. It's been a busy almost 3 months since I joined Weyerhaeuser, and as I've said before, I'm excited to be here.","This morning, I am pleased to report solid third quarter earnings of $157 million or $0.27 per diluted share on net sales of $2.2 billion. This is a 34% increase in earnings compared with third quarter 2012 and a 28% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared with year-ago levels.","Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, Charts 2 to 4. Timberlands contributed $118 million to earnings in the quarter, up $4 million from second quarter 2013 as the contribution from a partial quarter from the Longview Timberland acquisition mostly offset a smaller-than-expected seasonal decline in earnings from the company's legacy Western operations. In addition, non-strategic Timberlands dispositions were up modestly in the quarter.","In the West, log sale realizations were down in both domestic and export markets. Fee harvest from legacy Western lands was seasonally lower and as expected, road and silviculture expenses increased in the quarter.","In the South, log sale realizations in the third quarter were flat compared to the second quarter and fee harvest volumes were up modestly.","We continue to be excited about our acquisition of the Longview Timberland and are fully engaged in leveraging our silviculture, logistics and marketing expertise to realize the full potential of this outstanding asset. This transaction closed on July 23 and contributed $16 million in earnings and $26 million in EBITDA in the quarter. Going forward, we will be focused on maximizing the earnings and cash flow from all our Timberlands.","Wood Products, Charts 5 and 6. Wood Products contributed $79 million to earnings in the quarter, down from $136 million in the second quarter, but above the $59 million of earnings from third quarter 2012. Average sales realizations for OSB declined 26% in third quarter 2013 compared with second quarter 2013, and realizations for lumber fell by approximately 7%. The effect of these lower prices was somewhat offset by higher sales volumes across all product lines and lower log cost in the West.","Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter was $110 million. In lumber, EBITDA was down $26 million in the third quarter compared with the second, as lower prices were partially offset by higher volumes and lower log cost, especially in the West.","In our lumber operations, we are focused on continuing to drive down our cost structure and improve our margins.","In OSB, EBITDA was down by approximately $42 million in the quarter compared to second quarter as significantly lower prices were partially offset by higher volumes and lower fiber costs. We continue to be focused on lowering manufacturing cost and delivering high margin products to our growing customer base in this business.","Engineered Wood Products generated EBITDA of $16 million in the quarter compared with $7 million in the second quarter of 2013. This improvement was due to higher prices in volumes and lower costs. We are committed to continuing to improve the operating performance of this business.","The Distribution business remained challenged in the quarter as it worked through higher-priced commodity inventory. We expect improved results from this business in the fourth quarter due to our performance improvement initiatives.","Cellulose Fibers, Charts 7 and 8. Cellulose Fibers contributed $47 million in the quarter, down from second quarter 2013 as higher-than-anticipated costs associated with the scheduled shutdown of a liquid packaging board facility, higher fiber costs associated with wet weather in the South and higher chemical costs in the quarter more than offset slightly higher pulp realizations due to mix. We are focused on 3 priorities in this business: first, we will continue to drive down our cost through operational excellence; second, we will focus on developing new specialty products to improve our margins; and finally, we will continue to support our growing global customer base. Our ramp up of our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk, Poland is going well.","Real Estate, Charts 9 to 11. WRECO reported solid results as Real Estate contributed $33 million of earnings in the quarter, more than double the contribution during the second quarter. Single-family closings increased seasonally by nearly 21% over the second quarter, and margins improved to 22.3% as margins increased due to previously implemented price increases.","As Patty will share with you in more detail in just a moment, we expect a very strong quarter in this fourth -- we expect a very strong fourth quarter in this business with closing volume increasing nearly 50% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter.","In a moment, I will come back with some general comments on markets, but let me now turn it over to Patty to specifically address our fourth quarter outlook.","Patricia M. Bedient","Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for our fourth quarter earnings is summarized on Chart 13, and I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. In the West, export realizations are expected to be comparable to the third quarter on higher sales volume, primarily as a result of including a full quarter's operation of the Longview acquisition. Domestic realizations are expected to increase slightly. Lower sales volumes from our legacy Western ownership will be offset by increases from the Longview acquisition. Fee harvest in the West is expected to increase by about 10%, and Longview accounts for most of this increase. Costs are anticipated to be lower in the West due to decreased silviculture spending. In the South, realizations are expected to be slightly lower due to mix. Fee harvest is expected to increase on a seasonal basis. Logging costs are anticipated to increase due to a slightly longer hauling distance this quarter. Silviculture costs will also increase due to the timing of treatment. Sales of non-strategic Timberlands are anticipated to be modestly lower. Overall earnings in the Timberlands segment are expected to be comparable to the results in the third quarter.","In Wood Products, the fourth quarter is traditionally one of the weakest earnings quarters of the year as we close out the building season and mills prepare to perform minor maintenance and capital projects during the slower holiday season. As a result, we expect to see lower sales volumes across most product lines and flat to potentially softening prices as we progress through the quarter. We continue to focus on controlling inventories and matching supply with demand while driving further operational improvement. We anticipate that log costs will increase in both lumber and oriented strand board. Earnings in the Wood Products segment are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, but still above the $38 million we earned in the fourth quarter of last year.","In Cellulose Fibers, pulp realizations are continuing to move up, and shipment volumes are also expected to increase modestly. Worldwide inventories of softwood pulp are well-balanced and exchange rates are favorable. Maintenance expense should be lower as we have fewer days planned for maintenance outages. We anticipate higher productivity and decreased chemical costs during the quarter. We expect that earnings in the Cellulose Fiber segment will increase significantly during the fourth quarter compared to the third.","In Real Estate, we opened 8 new communities in the third quarter, and we expect to end the year with a community count in the mid-80s, which compares to 62 communities at the end of last year. At the end of the third quarter of this year, our backlog of homes sold but not closed was 1,435, an increase of 36% compared to a year ago. Although we have seen some weakness in consumer confidence, driven by the current uncertainty of governmental actions, we continue to believe that we will see improved results as housing recovers. During the fourth quarter, we expect to close over 1,100 homes or approximately 35% higher than the fourth quarter a year ago. The average price per closing is projected to be higher than the third quarter, with gross margins between 21% to 22%. Selling costs will increase as a result of the additional closings. We also expect earnings from land and lot sales to be comparable to the third quarter. Overall, fourth quarter earnings in our Real Estate segment is expected to increase significantly compared to the third quarter.","I'd like to touch on unallocated items, and unallocated items are shown on Chart 12. During the third quarter, we had a very large positive adjustment for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. This is the result of reductions in inventory, primarily in Wood Products. We do not expect the fourth quarter adjustment to be of the same magnitude.","Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. I'll be referencing numbers on Chart 14 for these comments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of approximately $900 million, comparable to the second quarter, excluding cash associated with the financing of the Longview Timberland acquisition. In July, we purchased the equity of Longview Timber for $1.58 billion in cash and assumed debt of approximately $1.1 billion. During September, we issued $500 million of new debt, and earlier this month, we borrowed an additional $550 million under a term loan, which, together with cash on hand, were used to repay the debt assumed in the acquisition. As a result of the early repayment of the assumed debt, we will have a charge for early extinguishment of approximately $24 million in the fourth quarter. Debt repayments for the third quarter, exclusive of the acquisition, totaled $163 million. Fourth quarter maturities are approximately $69 million. After the fourth quarter, we have minimal maturities until 2017.","In addition, during the third quarter, we replaced our existing revolving credit agreement with a new $1 billion agreement that does not expire until 2018. There are no borrowings outstanding under this agreement. Capital expenditures, including reforestation for the third quarter were $76 million, bringing our year-to-date expenditures to $179 million. We still anticipate spending for the full year to approximate $300 million.","Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you, Patty. In terms of markets, and specifically housing markets, we continue to be encouraged as long term favorable housing fundamentals remain in place. With that said, the housing recovery appears to have taken a slight pause due to higher home prices, higher interest rates, although still very low by historical standards, slowing job growth and the antics of our government. However, we continue to believe we are in the early stages of a longer-term return to trend levels of housing starts.","Forecasters now [Audio Gap] that there will be approximately 950,000 U.S. housing starts in 2013 and somewhere between 1.1 million and 1.2 million starts in 2014. The housing starts long-term average is north of 1.5 million units. So there's still a lot of runway in front of us. We are focused on driving ROI and cash flow to capitalize on the upturn, as well as appropriately positioning our sales for the future.","On that note, we will host an investor meeting in New York on December 17. In that meeting, we will address where Weyerhaeuser is today, where we are going and what we are doing to make this a truly great company for our shareholders. We look forward to sharing our thoughts and plans with you at that time. Later this morning, we will put out a notice containing the details of the meeting.","Finally, regarding our previously announced process to explore a range of strategic alternatives for WRECO, we are fully engaged in the process, continue to be encouraged by the interest in this business and will be back to you when the process is completed. Until then, as I'm sure you will understand and appreciate, we will not have any further comment on the strategic review.","With that, we will now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We have a question from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Doyle, a couple of bigger-picture questions maybe to start. You mentioned driving cash flow and ROI within Weyerhaeuser in the years ahead. Are these going to be the primary metrics that you focus your team on, or are there any other metrics that we should be aware, that you can discuss at this juncture, that you'll be using to gauge the progress of the company? And then you mentioned a couple of times, certainly within Wood Products, and I think also within Cell Fibers, that you are focused on lowering manufacturing costs to paraphrase at this juncture to the point -- to the extent that you can comment where do you see the opportunities to do that?","Doyle R. Simons","Good morning, George, and thanks for the question. I would say in terms of your first question, clearly, ROI and cash flow will be key metrics for our company going forward. But I wouldn't say they'll be the sole metric, but clearly, those will be key metrics for our company going forward. We look forward to our conversation on December 17, at which time we will provide hopefully a lot more clarity on, again, where we are, where we're going, how we're going to get there and how we will measure our progress along the way. In terms of Wood Products, one of the things we are focused on throughout the company will be to continue to drive down our cost and specifically, our manufacturing cost. What we're looking forward to doing is delivering high-quality products to our customers, products that our customers want and are willing to pay for and doing that at the lowest possible cost. So that will clearly continue to be a focus for Weyerhaeuser going forward.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Doyle, maybe the follow on and I'll turn it over, do you see the opportunity more driven by process or by needing to maybe put in more investment or some other factors as well? And then just quickly, and I'll turn it over, should we expect that your overall operating profit in WRECO in 4Q is up versus last year's level?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes. I'll address the first question, and then I'll ask Patty to address your second question, George. But in terms of opportunity, I think it's all the things you listed. I mean, it will be process, it'll be -- we'll look at opportunities to drive down cost across-the-board. Again, what we're focused on is producing high-quality new products for our customers and doing that at the lowest possible cost. So we'll be looking for opportunities to do that. Some of those opportunities will require some capital. Some of those will not. With that, let me ask Patty to address your second question.","Patricia M. Bedient","So George, your second question, I think, was profit in WRECO this quarter compared to a year ago, fourth quarter compared to a year ago?","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Correct.","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes, I think that the thing that swings from quarter-to-quarter is that -- and I don't remember fourth quarter a year ago, how much we had in terms of land sales and lot sales in the fourth quarter. Our single-family home-building business will be very strong in the fourth quarter of 2013 compared to 2012. And I think -- as I've mentioned in the comments that at this point, we would expect a comparable amount of land and lot sales, although as you know, they're quite lumpy but comparable to the third quarter, which I think was about $9 million.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess, just starting on the longer-term -- the near-term outlook for housing, when you talk about consensus numbers of 1.1 million to 1.2 million next year, from kind of what you're seeing from the market and hearing from your customers, how much confidence do you have that consensus has it right?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes, as you know, predicting housing numbers is always a little difficult, Gail. I would tell you that when you step back and look at the long-term fundamentals, I continue -- we continue to be very bullish on housing. As I mentioned, there has been a slight pause here due to a lot of factors, but clearly, in my mind, we have and we'll continue to have an upward trend in housing as we start to approach the 1.5 million to 1.6 million average over the next few years. And I don't know exactly what the slope of that line is going to be. I think it has flattened a little bit just because of the issues that I raised. But we'll see how it plays out, but I think, in my opinion, the 1.2 -- 1.1 million to 1.2 million is a pretty good guess at this point in time.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, and I mean, the pause that you're seeing, I mean, how significant was it? I mean, it looks like WRECO buyer traffic was down pretty significantly. Was that seasonal or was that reflective of the uncertainty that we saw rise with interest rates coming up in DC?","Doyle R. Simons","I think it was a combination of both, Gail. I think clearly, again, as we had the shut down from the government, as we had prices go up in houses and some other factors, we saw a pause. But again, I think pause is the right term. I don't want to overstate the pause. And again, if you look at the underlying fundamentals, they continue to be strong and in place and I think will drive housing going forward.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just a quick question on Engineered Wood. Given what's been going on in terms of the input costs, do you see the recovery as sustainable, or at some point, would you expect to see some price pressure emerge as customers kind of start pressuring you given some of the cost relief of lumber and OSB pricing?","Doyle R. Simons","I think in that business, as we mentioned, we saw a nice improvement in the quarter, Gail. Now there will still be seasonal factors that will have an impact. And as Patty outlined, fourth quarter is a slow seasonal quarter. But longer-term, that's a business that we're encouraged by what we're seeing on the pricing front, probably need additional pricing going forward. But more importantly, we're focused on our operations and making sure that we provide, on a cost-effective basis, the products that our customers need.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citibank.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In Wood Products, you talked about your expectation for improved distribution performance in 4Q, and I was wondering if you could give us any color on the performance improvement initiatives that are driving that improvement. And then maybe what is the magnitude of earnings improvement you're expecting versus the loss this quarter, and how much of that is really driven by the performance initiatives versus just sort of working through inventory?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes, good question, Anthony. And the improvement that we anticipate in the fourth quarter, as you just highlighted, will be driven primarily by 2 factors. One is the fact that we will have worked through most of the high-priced inventory in the fourth quarter. And then secondly, as I mentioned, we have some very specific profit improvement initiatives, including real focus on operational excellence. And again, making sure we have the right cost structure in that business that we also have a very focused effort regarding growing specific product lines that we need to continue to grow in that business to make it a profitable business going forward. So back to your original question, 2 key drivers for the fourth quarter: one, we will have worked through the high-priced product; and secondly, we have a very focused profit improvement effort in place in that business, and I think we'll see the impact from both of those in the fourth quarter.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. But it is safe to say that maybe more of the benefit of the performance improvement initiatives are -- will be seen in 2014, or just in terms of the time frame of completing some of those initiatives?","Doyle R. Simons","Sure. Sure, Anthony. Yes, we will see the initial -- I mean, we've been working on it, but we'll see, like I said, some of them in the fourth quarter. But it's not just solely in the fourth quarter. We will continue to build those into 2014 and beyond. So these aren't onetime initiatives. This is an ongoing effort to improve the operations of our distribution business.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just switching to Timberlands. Do you think that this quarter's EBITDA contribution from Longview, adjusting for the fact that you only had 2 months, is representative of what the business could do over the next few quarters? And do you have any updated view on synergies or the time frame to realize those synergies?","Doyle R. Simons","Sure. In terms of Longview, like I said, we're excited about that acquisition and are pleased with the results in the third quarter. To your specific question, I think the third quarter adjusted for the things you just said is generally representative. The other thing I would say is as you know, third quarter in the West tends to be, seasonally, a weak quarter, so you should factor that in as you think about this acquisition going forward as well. In terms of synergies, as we've previously stated, we anticipate synergies -- achieving synergy savings of approximately $20 million. And I would tell you we are on track to achieve those synergies by the end of 2014 at a run rate.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just -- I want to come back to distribution again because you've now got another publicly traded peer out there with the distribution business. They've made $21 million the last 2 quarters. You guys have lost $27 million. I mean, how much of this do you think is maybe just different treatment from an inventory standpoint? And what are the other issues here? Because it's a huge delta.","Doyle R. Simons","Yes, Mark, we understand the delta that is in place. I can tell you I think part of it does have to do with -- my guess is, and it's only a guess because I don't know what our competitors do, but I think part of it may have to do, at least in the third quarter, with the treatment of inventory. As I mentioned earlier though, we understand the gap and the opportunities and challenges that we have in that business, and we are focused on improving that business everyday.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Doyle, do you regard that business as somehow kind of intertwined with your Engineered Wood business, that especially you have to be in Distribution to be successful in Engineered Wood, or not?","Doyle R. Simons","Mark, we look each of our businesses individually, and we expect each of our businesses to achieve above cost of capital returns over a cycle.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And just in Wood Products, you talked a lot about improving cost of things. Are you doing anything just to kind of rethink maybe how Weyerhaeuser has approached markets from the commercial side? In other words, thinking about how you sell, how you go-to-market, whether you're really kind of getting the best dollar you can for everything you produce?","Doyle R. Simons","Sure, Mark. As I mentioned in my initial comments on Wood Products, one of our key focuses is delivering products that our customers want and are willing to pay for. And a big part of that is who our customer base is, how we go to market. As you know, we have very -- we produce very high-quality products here at Weyerhaeuser, and I think our customers appreciate that. And we just need to make sure we have got the right customer base in place and that we're delivering quality products that our customers want and are willing to pay for.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","All right. And the last question I had is just on the Timberland side. Your log prices were down quite a bit quarter-to-quarter, but I notice that you're export mix skewed to China. I know they typically buy lower-priced logs. I just -- I wondered whether kind of a mix shift in where you were selling contributed to that $10-drop in log -- average log prices.","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, as you -- we talked about on the quarter outlook for the third quarter on our last call, pricing was projected to be weaker in the third quarter because of the seasonality, and we did see that. And now we're starting to see those prices move up again. In terms of the mix, we do have a higher percentage of the total mix going to China. Part of that is because of the Longview acquisition of just exporting more into China overall. So I think from a mix perspective, China does impact that a little bit, but we did say that pricing would come down somewhat in the third quarter, as it does on a seasonal basis.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","First question is as we look at your -- the company's last couple of years, capital spending has been quite a bit below the depreciation, and that's understandable because of the purchase accounting and -- some of it is at least, and depletion. But I mean, Doyle, as you look at things, do you think something down in the sub-250 range, is something that's sustainable, or could there possibly be opportunities either in the Wood Products business or maybe a requirement for boiler rebuild or something in the Cellulose business that we should keep an eye out? In other words, should we see CapEx remain at about half of depreciation?","Doyle R. Simons","Chip, we're -- as I mentioned earlier, I've been spending a lot of time with our senior management team over the past few weeks, and we are right in the middle of that process regarding capital. That's something that we will share with you at the December 17 meeting and probably even get more specific when we release fourth quarter earnings. I can tell you generally, Chip, in terms of our financial priorities going forward, first and foremost, is going to be to return cash to shareholders, primarily through a growing and sustainable dividend. But also, at the appropriate time, share repurchase. Second will be to invest in our businesses through high-return projects and look for opportunistic growth opportunities. And then finally, making sure we maintain the appropriate capital structure for our shareholders going forward. So that's generally how we think about it. But again, we'll be back to you with much more detail in a couple of months.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. And just a quick follow-up. I know that in -- a couple of years ago, the company changed the way they did maintenance in the Cellulose business and found a way, I believe, to cut costs by shifting from annual to, I guess, every 18 months. And I didn't know if that's something that you felt was good and likely to be sustained, or if you think that there could be some tweaking to the way you look at the costs, especially for maintenance in the Cellulose business.","Doyle R. Simons","I think -- Chip, thanks for the question. I think that is something that's good and will continue. As you know, we are in the process of phasing that in, and I think we'll start to really see the benefits of that in 2014 and 2015. But I think that is the right approach. It ultimately, over time, will lower your maintenance expense and also a key benefit of that, of course, is you improve your productivity because you're not going down as often in your mill system.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First question is can you give us an update on the restart of the Alabama engineered wood products facility? How much capital do you think you'll need to put in to get that up and going? And how do you see the trajectory of the volumes out of that facility going into the market?","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, Alex, thanks. I think the important thing to keep in mind about our Evergreen mill in Alabama is that we announced that we would be restarting it. But the actual restart is not projected to take place until late spring of 2014, probably around in the May time frame before we'll actually producing significant product at that location. Anytime you're starting up a mill that's been down for more than a year, it certainly takes time to put a workforce in place. And so we're very focused on doing that. From a capital perspective, we will need to put some capital into that mill because it has been down for some period of time. But it's not a huge increment of capital. So I think that as the market continues to recover, especially for engineered wood, we're really looking forward to bringing that capacity online at a time that the market will really need it.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then on lumber, as I look at your shipment numbers quarterly relative to what you state is your capacity number for lumber in the 10-K, it seems like you're essentially running at capacity even though housing is well below normal levels. As you think about the medium term, do you expect you will be able to grow your lumber shipments with the market without having to put significant capital into your system? Or will you have to put in a significant capital to be able to do that, given you're essentially running at capacity based on the numbers that are reported?","Doyle R. Simons","Alex, I would say we're running somewhere in the low- to mid-90s in terms of operating rates in our lumber operation. And what we're focused on every day is improving our reliability in our lumber operations and doing things to get additional production where it makes sense to do that. So that's the focus of our lumber operation going forward.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just one more question on pulp. Softwood inventories are in excellent shape, prices are moving up while, on the other hand, hardwood inventories are elevated and prices are moving lower. There seems to be a significant amount of hardwood inventory that -- hardwood capacity that will be coming online over the next 12 months. As you talk to your customers, what kind of impact do you think all this new hardwood capacity that's entering the market, what kind of impact do you think it may have on softwood pricing and your Softwood business?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, Alex, it's difficult to know exactly what the impact will be, but our products from a fluff perspective are really focused more in the softwood grade. And in addition to fluff, we have a number of specialty proprietary products in the fluff grade spectrum. So our focus really is on, as Doyle said, is to continue to drive down costs, which is always a good thing. And then really in our product mix, in addition to our products today, to developing new products. In the priorities for the business that Doyle spoke to in his comments, #2 priority was innovation around specialty products, things like the product that we announced, which we call THRIVE, which is a cellulose-based product that has some promise for us going forward in terms of the automotive industry and others. So we're working on all fronts. But difficult to know exactly what that hardwood capacity will be, but it doesn't substitute directly for fluff today.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Two questions. How much of the improvement in Engineered Wood was attributable to the lower OSB prices? And second, you commented a little bit on the increased sales from Longview to China. China for you has been relatively low margin. Is there an opportunity to move some of that Longview capacity into higher-margin markets, or is this just going to be a shift a little bit down in the overall mix?","Doyle R. Simons","Mark, I'll try to address your first question, and then I'll ask Patty to address your second question. In terms of the improvement in ELP in the quarter, I don't know exactly how much of that was attributable to the lower OSB cost. But as I mentioned, it's a -- it was a -- the improvement was a combination of lower cost and improved revenues in that business.","Patricia M. Bedient","So Mark, as you think about the Longview acquisition, one of the things that you are not seeing as much of an impact in terms of the overall revenue, and that chart is a revenue chart that's in the web slide, is that we actually did purchase, through third-party purchases from Longview, some logs to go to Japan to round out our inventory needs for Japan, as we do on the marketplace. So that's why you don't see the significant change there. It's not that Longview logs are not going to Japan. They're now going as Weyerhaeuser logs. The other thing that I would say is as the light wood market becomes stronger, we will take advantage of shipping whitewood off, to the extent that we have it, off the coastal lands of Longview to take advantage of both the China market, as well as the Korea market. So the mix will move around, but we will ship the appropriate log to the appropriate market to get the best margin out of that. One of the opportunities for us in terms of driving synergies from that acquisition is that even though we were purchasing logs from Longview, we now have the trees and we have the opportunity to merchandise the cutting of the tree into logs to get that -- pull the highest grade to the highest market for that. So we, as Doyle said, really are very pleased with what we've seen so far.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","A quick question on Japan. How should we look at the effect of the consumption tax increase next April? And how do you expect that to flow through in terms of timing on export log sales to that country and the magnitude of the drop-off once that tax is in?","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, Paul. Difficult to know because the consumption tax is just one of the factors that affect the demand. Right now, we're seeing very strong demand. There is projected to be a small move up in the consumption tax, but the Japanese government has also -- proving to be very accommodative to housing financing. So I think that if that consumption tax does move up as it is projected, that we'll also likely we see some potential benefit to the overall housing economy in Japan. So difficult to know, but our own view at this point would be that demand will continue to be strong in 2014. It may have some slight impact from the consumption tax. But it is something that we're monitoring pretty closely.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","And then I just had a follow-up question for Doyle. Just you've been there almost 3 months now. What's most impressed you at Weyerhaeuser? Where do you see your biggest challenge?","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you for the question. And I would tell you when I showed up at Weyerhaeuser, I spent the first few weeks going around to our facilities, meeting our people and really listening -- learning and listening a lot. Over the past few weeks, as I think I mentioned earlier, I have been spending a lot of time with our senior management team, kind of distilling everything that I learned when I was out visiting our facilities, kind of figuring out where we are, where we need to go and how we're going to get there. And that will be the focus of our Investor Meeting on December 17. And at that point in time, we'll spend a lot of time highlighting, like I said, where we are and what our biggest opportunity -- what our biggest strengths are and what our biggest opportunities are as we move this company going forward. So I look forward -- we look forward to sharing those thoughts with you on December 17.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Evan Wingren with D.A. Davidson.","Evan Wingren - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Given that a lot of your competitors have seen sort of log prices in the south up a little bit this quarter, I noticed that yours were flat. Was that surprising to you, given -- kind of given what we heard about the wet weather in the South as well?","Doyle R. Simons","Our log prices in the South, as you mentioned, we did not see much of a movement. There were, in various regions, impacts because of the significant wet weather. I think that's a portion of what you've seen in some of the competitors. Also, there may be some different inventory situations for various competitors as well. What I am encouraged about is, I think when you step back and look at it overall, I believe our pine sawtimber prices this year will be up probably 4% to 5% versus last year, when all is said and done. And probably more encouragingly as we continue to see housing rebound, demand continues to grow, we see the impacts of the Canadian situation, I'm convinced that we will see sawtimber, pine sawtimber prices in the South start to -- continue to increase, maybe even more rapidly as we move into 2014 and beyond.","Evan Wingren - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And kind of moving to Cellulose, the additional 6 days of maintenance you took, could you maybe just give a little more color on that? And maybe how much did that cost you in the quarter, if you could provide that as well?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes. Part of the impact in the quarter was due to the additional downtime that we took. And above and beyond the downtime that was scheduled, we had a couple of additional downtimes at our liquid packaging operation that were a result of not coming up quite as well as we had planned in that operation. So that had a impact on the third quarter versus the second quarter as well. Now the good news is the liquid packaging operation is back up and running and running well, and there will be no impact from that shutdown in the fourth quarter.","Evan Wingren - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","All right, fair enough. And then on EWP again, I mean, do you have a range that you can provide maybe of what you think utilization rate was in that business during the quarter?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes. Overall, there's a lot of different products, as you know, in that business. But overall, the operating rates were in the mid-60s for ELP in the quarter.","Evan Wingren - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And on the pricing side of that, are you seeing momentum sort of heading into the back half of the year, or maybe just sort of what are the trends you're seeing there on pricing, just moving forward?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes. As we indicated, prices were up in the third quarter versus the second quarter in ELP. And I think, clearly, the trend is for favorable pricing going forward. Now we've got to factor in the seasonality. And as Patty properly highlighted and as you very well know, the fourth quarter tends to be a slower seasonal period for Wood Products, including ELP. But I think we will see favorable trends in pricing in ELP going forward.","Evan Wingren - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And just one more kind of housekeeping. I sort of missed the extinguishment of debt cost, $24 million. Could you just bring that back real quick?","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure. So when we acquired Longview Timberlands, that acquisition, we assumed debt in that acquisition and we repaid that debt early, in October. And as a result of repaying it early, there were some prepayment costs associated with that, and we expect that there'll be about $24 million of loss from early extinguishment of debt. That will be in the fourth quarter number. So I just wanted to make sure that you all have that number as you think about putting together your fourth quarter estimates.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","In the past, Weyerhaeuser has indicated their intent over the cycle to pay out roughly 75% of free cash flow in dividends. If as, through actions that you take, an increasing proportion of your cash generation in the future is coming from the more stable timber business, does that lend an upward bias to that 75% number?","Doyle R. Simons","Mark, as I mentioned earlier, in terms of our financial priorities, first and foremost is returning cash to shareholders primarily through a growing and sustainable dividend. So one of the things that we'll be continuing to monitor going forward is just exactly what the right payout ratio is in terms of our FAD contribution. So that's something we'll be looking at. But we understand and are committed to -- we understand the importance of and are committed to a growing and sustainable dividend going forward.","Okay, as I understand it, there are no additional questions. So let me just close with a couple of comments. Let me start by thanking everybody for joining us this morning and for your continued interest in our company. And also, I just want to say, I look forward to seeing everybody on December 17 in the -- at the meeting that we will be hosting in New York. And as I mentioned earlier, we will be sending out details for that meeting later today. Thank you very much.","Operator","This concludes today's earnings call.

Doyle Simons, CEO elect, is also with us this morning. Doyle becomes President and Chief Executive Officer on August 1. I know you are looking forward to hearing from Doyle, but the purpose of this call is to focus on second quarter earnings and performance.","As summarized on Chart 1, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter 2013 net earnings to common shareholders of $196 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion.","Turning to our business segments, my comments reviewing the second quarter 2013 refer to changes from the first quarter of 2013.","Beginning with Timberlands, Charts 2, 3, 4. Timberlands contributed $114 million through earnings, $10 million more than in the first quarter. The disposition of non-strategic Timberlands in Q2 was $14 million. Non-strategic Timberlands dispositions were $3 million in Q1. Export demand continued strong as export log sales rose 27%. Western log price realizations increased 9%. Both export and domestic prices were higher.","Southern log price realizations were flat. Fee harvest volumes declined 4% in the West and were essentially flat in the South. Road and silviculture expenses seasonally increased.","Wood Products, Charts 5 and 6. Wood Products contributed $136 million to earnings, $42 million less than in Q1. During the quarter, lumber sales volumes increased 13% and oriented strand board sales volumes rose 3%.","Price realizations declined 8% for OSB, and lumber price realizations were slightly lower. Engineered wood product volumes were flat, while prices increased 4% for both solid section and TJIs. Log costs were higher in the West. Manufacturing costs increased due to downtime and repairs associated with the fire of our Arcadia, Louisiana OSB mill.","Engineered wood products' maintenance expense was higher than normal, and raw material cost increased. Margins in the distribution business were adversely affected by the steep drop in commodity prices during the quarter.","Cellulose Fibers, Charts 7 and 8. Cellulose Fibers contributed $57 million to Q2 earnings, $26 million more than in Q1. Scheduled maintenance costs were $7 million lower than in the previous quarter. There were 12 annual outage days. Higher productivity resulted in a 4% increase in pulp production. Energy fiber and chemical costs were lower. Slightly higher electricity sales at Grande Prairie also contributed to lower manufacturing costs.","Real Estate, Charts 9, 10 and 11. Real Estate contributed $14 million to earnings, an increase of $14 million from the seasonally weak first quarter. 636 homes were closed in second quarter, a 25% increase over the same quarter last year and a 37% increase from the first quarter. The single-family growth margin increased to 21.6% due to mix. The average closing price increased 3% to $405,000. At the end of the second quarter, the backlog, the number of homes sold but not closed, rose 27%. Q2 includes $2 million in earnings from land and lot sales.","Unallocated, Chart 12. Unallocated expense in the quarter netted to 0. The elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO was an expense of $24 million in Q1 compared to a gain of $8 million in Q2. Unallocated share-based compensation was an expense of $7 million in Q1 compared to a gain of $5 million in Q2 due to the change in stock price.","I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. We've had a very busy quarter at Weyerhaeuser. This morning, I'll provide some color on our second quarter performance beyond the specifics that Kathy has just reviewed. In addition, on June 16, we made a series of significant announcements that we discussed in a call on June 17. Following my discussion of second quarter results, I will recap those announcements and provide an update related to those matters.","Let me first address our second quarter results. I'm pleased to report that earnings for the second quarter increased significantly from the first quarter, more than double last year's second quarter results. As noted in our earnings release, it is a fourfold increase before special items.","During the quarter, the U.S. economy sent mixed signals. Private sector employment is increasing, partially offset by fiscal contraction. Consumer confidence in June increased to its highest level in 5 years. This is a big factor in bringing buyers back into the housing market.","As I discussed during our May analyst meeting, we still believe that we're in the early stages of a longer-term return to trend levels of housing starts. Existing home sales continued to improve both in volume and price.","Retail inventory continues to be limited. New home sales continued to increase, and new home inventory continues to be especially tight. There was less than a 4-month supply available in June.","Total new housing starts in June were seasonally adjusted 836,000 was a bit of a shift towards the higher percentage of single-family homes. Forecasters now estimate that there will be approximately 1 million starts in 2013. Most projections for 2014 are up an additional 20% to 25%.","Home prices for both resale and new homes continued to rise in most markets. Both the recent Case-Shiller and National Association of Realtors' indexes report year-over-year increases of 10% to 15%. The greatest uncertainty in the U.S. economy today seems to be the role of the Fed in managing interest rates and the signaling about its strategy to taper asset purchases.","Global economic activity affects our Cellulose Fibers and Timberlands business segments, and growth remains fragile. The U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against the Canadian dollar and the euro, and we've seen a significant weakening in the Japanese yen as a result of government policy designed to spur domestic growth.","Now I'll comment on the performance in each of our businesses in the second quarter, starting with Timberlands. In Timberlands, as Kathy noted, operating earnings were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter, with total earnings up slightly due to disposition of non-strategic Timberlands. In the West, we continued to benefit from our long-term strategy of maximizing returns by leveraging log exports. Japan remains our primary export market, but all of our Pacific Rim markets remained strong, with volume and price increasing in the quarter.","Our new Longview Timber acquisition is a perfect fit with this strategy, as these acres are well positioned to flow volume to Weyerhaeuser's strategically located Pacific Coast export facilities and then to overseas markets. The market story in the South hasn't changed much from last quarter. Our risk volumes were flat, sales volumes increased slightly and prices remained essentially flat.","As U.S. housing continues to recover, we expect southern log volumes to gradually improve but with a somewhat slower price response as deferred harvest volume comes back into the market. Our Timberlands operations are focused on extracting the most value from the current market, relying on our low-cost scale harvesting and hauling capabilities, as well as directing our logs to the highest end-use markets.","In Wood Products, we had another strong quarter, though earnings declined quarter-over-quarter. Wood Products contributed the highest earnings of all of our businesses in the second quarter, $136 million, and delivered $227 million in cash flow.","Over the last few months, a question frequently asked is whether the market has bottomed. We entered the second quarter with lumber and OSB prices at levels not seen since the top of the last housing boom. Prices peaked in the early weeks of the quarter then fell steeply until bottoming around the end of the quarter. From peak to trough during the quarter, Random Lengths' composite lumber price fell almost 30%, and the Random Lengths Index for 3\/8-inch OSB fell over 40%.","Despite these significant price adjustments during the quarter, year-over-year, our realizations are up over 50% for OSB and almost 25% for lumber. While lower than the peak at the beginning of the second quarter, prices are at a level that provide opportunity for good returns for our Wood Products businesses.","As I've noted in the past, fundamental demographics and improving consumer confidence are major factors in bringing fires back to the market. Housing is recovering but has a long way to go before reaching trend. Our Wood Product volumes in the second quarter support this point. We had solid volume takeaway across all product lines.","As we look forward, we continue to be encouraged by the opportunities we have in Wood Products. We're taking advantage of improving demands for our lumber, OSB and Engineered Wood Products. At the same time, we continue to focus on operational improvements that reduce cost and improve revenue opportunities.","Moving to WRECO. As Kathy noted, and as you can see on our web slides, volume, price and margin all increased during the quarter. Volume increased as a result of normal seasonality as well as continued recovery toward long-term trend levels. Our community count increased over 10% from the first quarter, leading to a strong increase in sales. We remain on pace to increase our net community count by 16% this year.","June sales were unseasonably strong. This is the first time that June sales exceeded May sales since 2005, a signal of continued recovery in our markets. Second quarter sales activity was strongest for us in the California markets of L.A., Ventura and the Inland Empire, followed by Phoenix and Houston. Prices were up in all of our markets quarter-over-quarter.","Last quarter, I expressed concerns about cost increases eroding margins of pre-sold homes. However, our experience in the second quarter is that prices are increasing faster than cost, allowing us to maintain and gradually grow margins.","Even with the increasing level of closings during the quarter, our improved sales raised our backlog by over 25% over the prior quarter at almost 40% year-over-year. In 2012, we closed over 2,300 homes. At our analyst meeting in May, we forecast that 2013 closings would increase to 2,800. Today, we estimate that we'll close nearly 3,000 homes this year. We expect a large percentage of our backlog will be delivered in the fourth quarter, historically our most active quarter for home closings.","My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fibers segment. Overall market conditions for pulp and liquid packaging were again relatively stable in the quarter. Our earnings improved significantly, primarily as a result of reduced maintenance expense and higher productivity. Pulp sales volumes were essentially flat, while volumes increased modestly for liquid packaging.","When we talk about the strategy for our Cellulose Fibers segment, we focus on 3 elements. First, we strive for continuous improvement in our manufacturing through increased operating efficiency and reduced cost. Both of these contributed to our quarter-over-quarter improvement. Second, we need to continue to develop innovative products for new markets and improved margins. During the quarter, we added several new customers for our Pearl product, which will lead to future increases in sales volume. We also moved closer to commercialization of our THRIVE cellulose-based composite product. And third, we want to support our growing global customers. In June, we completed the qualification process and shipped our first commercial product from our new modified fiber facility in Gdansk, Poland.","Now I'll briefly recap the major announcements that we made on a very busy Father's Day, June 16. First, we announced the acquisition of Longview Timber LLC, whose primary asset is 645,000 acres of unique, high-value Timberlands strategically located in Washington and Oregon. This acquisition expands our timber holdings in the Pacific Northwest by 1\/3 to approximately 2.6 million acres. It also increases the total amount of timberlands that we own or control to nearly 7 million acres.","The total purchase price, including the assumption of debt, was $2.65 billion. I'm pleased to report that this acquisition closed earlier this week, and Tom Gideon and his Timberlands team are now on the ground working with the Longview Timber team.","This timberland enhances our leading position as the largest owner of timberland in the region. These lands are highly complementary and contiguous with our existing ownership in the area. We intend to leverage our silviculture, infrastructure, logistics and marketing expertise to reap the full potential of this valuable asset.","Second, in conjunction with this acquisition, we announced that our board intends to raise our quarterly dividend from $0.20 to $0.22 per share. This increase should begin with our third quarter dividend, which will be declared in August and payable in September. This will be our third dividend increase in the last 4 quarters, bringing our total dividend increase to 47% over that time.","Third, we announced that our board has authorized a process to explore a range of strategic alternatives for WRECO. These alternatives could include continuing to hold and operate WRECO, or a merger, sale or spinoff of the business. Given the improving fundamentals of the housing market generally and of our own operations and the strategic growth markets, especially California, we want to explore strategic alternatives for the business to ensure that WRECO achieves its full potential. There can be no assurances that the board's evaluation process will result in any transaction or that any transaction it pursued will be consummated. However, we are fully engaged in the process, and we are encouraged by the interest that we've received. We do not intend to comment further unless or until the evaluation process is completed or terminated.","Our final announcement on June 16 was to report that I will be stepping down as President and CEO of Weyerhaeuser on August 1. Doyle Simons, who is previously Chairman and CEO of Temple-Inland and has been a member of the Weyerhaeuser board since June 2012, has been appointed by the board as my successor.","On August 1, I will become Executive Vice Chair, in which capacity I will serve until my planned retirement in October when I turn age 65. After August 1, I will provide support to Doyle as we complete the transition of responsibilities. It has been a privilege for me to have been able to serve as President and CEO of the company for the past 5-plus years, and I'm especially pleased to have Doyle follow me.","Now before turning the call over to Patty, who will discuss our third quarter outlook, as well as provide a financial update, I'd like to give Doyle an opportunity to say a few words. Doyle?","Doyle R. Simons","Good morning, everybody, and thank you, Dan. I am truly excited to take over as President and CEO on August 1, and Dan will be a very tough act to follow. As Kathy mentioned, the focus of today's call will be our second quarter earnings. I look forward to speaking with each of you on the third quarter call and beyond.","With that, let me turn it over to Patty to discuss our third quarter outlook.","Patricia M. Bedient","Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for the third quarter is summarized on Chart 13. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands.","In the West, export price realizations and volumes are expected to be lower for the quarter. The Japan market is normally seasonally softer during the summer months due to rainy weather, and Japan continues to experience carpenter and construction labor shortages as a result of a strong housing market. In addition, China has entered its typical July slowdown.","Domestic log markets in the West are anticipated to be weaker during the third quarter due to lower saw mill production in the West as a result of pressure on lumber pricing. In addition, we typically see more logs coming to market in the summer from the small, private, non-industrial land owners who don't have adequate road systems to harvest on a year-round basis. As a result, we traditionally plan a lower fee harvest volume in the West for the third quarter. We also accelerated some harvests into the first half of this year to take advantage of the strong export market. While we do anticipate a slower third quarter, we expect activity will again pick up later in the year.","In the third quarter, we will also see increased road costs in the West as we expect more seasonal road maintenance and spur roadbuilding as is typical this time of year. In the South, overall price realizations are anticipated to be comparable to the second quarter. Although fee harvest volumes should be higher due to seasonally better weather, this increased volume will carry a heavier mix due to first settings [ph]. We're also planning higher cost from seasonally increased silviculture treatments, which again is typical of the quarter. We expect that earnings from non-strategic landfills will be somewhat higher in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.","As Dan mentioned, we closed on the acquisition of 645,000 acres of high-value timberlands in the West just a couple of days ago. We're very excited about the opportunity that these lands provide going forward. However, the third quarter results will only include about 2 months of activity. The positive effect of these incremental earnings will be more than offset by the seasonal slowdown in our existing operations and therefore, we expect that overall earnings in our Timberlands segment will be lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.","In Wood Products, as Kathy discussed, prices for both lumber and OSB declined throughout the second quarter, such that we began this quarter at significantly lower levels than the average of the second quarter. Current prices for lumber and OSB are improving. However, we expect third quarter average realizations for OSB will be down substantially compared to the second quarter, and average realizations for lumber will also be lower.","Engineered Wood Product sales realizations are expected to improve modestly. Sales volumes for OSB and engineered wood are expected to increase, while volumes for lumber should be comparable to the second quarter.","Log prices in the West should be lower in the third quarter, comparable to the second quarter for the South and slightly higher in Canada. OSB and engineered wood manufacturing costs should improve given higher production, and we expect lower OSB web cost for I-Joist.","The improvement in manufacturing cost will not be enough to offset this quarter's lower average sales realization in OSB and lumber and, as a result, we expect that earnings in our Wood Products segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second. However, given the recent improvement in prices, a strengthening housing market and our continued focus on operational improvement, we expect that earnings will be well above the third quarter of last year.","In Cellulose Fibers, we expect modest improvement and average sales realizations and volumes for pulp and liquid packaging board. The effect of these increases will be offset by higher maintenance costs associated with increased planned annual outage days in the third quarter compared to the second, as well as the impact of the lost productivity associated with the maintenance downtime. We expect that third quarter earnings in our Cellulose Fiber segment will be comparable to the second quarter.","In Real Estate, we expect continued improvement in our single-family homebuilding business as a result of a strengthening housing recovery, especially in Southern California, as well as the seasonally stronger third quarter compared to the second quarter. Sales have continued at a brisk pace, and we expect to close over 700 homes in the third quarter compared to the 636 closed in the second quarter. Average closing prices are anticipated to be comparable to the second quarter at about $400,000 per closing.","Price increases have been implemented in most of our communities, which will result in margin expansion for future closings. We expect margins of approximately 20% in the third quarter, which is slightly lower than the second quarter due to mix. Volume costs will be higher as a result of the increased closing volume. We anticipate a slight increase in our earnings from land sales compared to the 2 million in the second quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in our Real Estate segment will be higher in the third quarter compared to the second.","Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. I'll refer you to Chart 14 for this discussion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of just over $900 million. This does not include the cash rate in our June equity offering of approximately $1,450,000,000. These funds are segregated on our balance sheet as they were designated for the acquisition of the Longview Timber lands. Excluding these funds, cash increased approximately $270 million compared to the end of the first quarter. Cash from operations increased from a negative $61 million in the first quarter to $374 million in the second quarter.","Year-to-date, for the first half of the year, we had capital expenditures, including reforestation, of approximately $100 million. We still expect to spend up to $300 million for the full year, so the activity will pick up in the second half of the year. Excluding the Longview acquisition, we have debt maturities for the remainder of the year of just over $230 million, of which, just over $160 million is due in the third quarter.","With the closing of the Longview acquisition earlier this week, we assume debt of just under $1.1 billion. We expect that we will repay this debt in the fourth quarter and replace it with unsecured longer-dated maturity debt. We expect that this will be a combination of bank and public market debt, the mix and timing of which is still to be finalized.","Finally, Chart 15 summarizes the changes in our share count as a result of the equity offerings we initiated in June for the acquisition.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Patty. As I stated at the beginning of my remarks, we had a very busy quarter at Weyerhaeuser. We had solid financial results with all 4 of our businesses contributing to increased profitability. From a strategic perspective, we're excited about our acquisition of the 645,000-acre Longview Timber asset. This acquisition is consistent with our stated intent to play to our strength and grow our timberlands base, taking full advantage of our Timber REIT structure.","And finally, the strategic review of our WRECO business evidences our commitment to ensure that WRECO achieves its full potential for the benefit of our shareholders.","And now we welcome your questions and comments.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Dan, best of luck. I guess you talked about -- and WRECO is seeing strength in June business this year than in May. I'm wondering if you can give a little bit perspective on July with interest rates rising? Have you seen any sort of changes in consumer behavior in WRECO?","Daniel S. Fulton","We have not seen any significant changes in behavior, Gail. The thing that was noteworthy about June was as we look at the pattern of sales, it was noteworthy because normally, we see some summer slowdown. But in fact, June being stronger than May, it was the first time that's happened since 2005. And so to me, that is evidence that we are on a path of this longer-term recovery. So you think about where housing starts are today as compared to long-term trend levels, we've got a long way to go. And so we should expect to see steady improvement, and so we're breaking some of these seasonal patterns, and that's a good thing.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one other quick question. Patty, can -- the Wood Product guidance for the third quarter, are you assuming that the current -- the recent price improvement in OSB and lumber continues? Or is it kind of based on current levels of pricing?","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes, it is that it will continue to improve for all the reasons that we talked about in terms of the underlying fundamentals, but it will still be well below what the average was for the second quarter. But as I said, we do expect that while it will be less than what we earned in the second quarter, it will still be well above the third quarter of last year. So I think that will give you a little bit in terms of the guideposts of what we're looking at out of the Wood Products segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","So your pulp business is doing fine. What I was wondering is if you could tell us how well you think the market has absorbed the new capacity that other people have been bringing on? You haven't seen quite the impact that some others have, but I'm just curious if you think competitive pressure there is still significant. And then the second more specific question, with respect to logs in the South, I'm curious how much the wet weather has actually affected your production. Obviously, we're all talking about demand, but I'm curious whether we're going to see a production impact from all the rain that we've had.","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Mark. Well, with respect to the pulp market, as Patty commented, thinking about the third quarter guidance, we are seeing relative stabilization. There has been some change in supply, some going out of the market with Rayonier completing their shift in their mill. Fundamentally, we rely on the relationships with our longer-term customers, and so we feel relatively confident about demand levels going forward. We would certainly benefit from a pickup in global growth because there's been some softness. But at this point, I think the reliance that we have on our longer-term relationships with large global customers has served us well.","Patricia M. Bedient","I think the other thing as we think about our Cellulose Fibers business relative to other commodities plus producers is that we do have a number of specialty products within that particular space. I think Dan referenced the Pearl product and certainly, our cross-linked product that is -- commands a higher price, also probably underpins the fact that you haven't seen as much pressure on ours as probably some of our competitors.","Daniel S. Fulton","And then you had a question about logs in the South, Mark?","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Yes, I'm just curious whether the weather that we've been seeing mostly in the Southeast has had much impact and is going to have much impact on you down there?","Daniel S. Fulton","We do not expect a significant impact in the third quarter.","Patricia M. Bedient","I think that as we look at our Timberlands business, we do expect that we will harvest more fee volume in the third quarter, as I said, which is typical. We did -- probably one place where we'll see some additional impact is from -- earlier in the second quarter, we would have likely done a little more silvicultural treatment traditionally. But because of the wet weather, some of that did get deferred into the third quarter. So it's really more from a copy [ph] perspective that you'll see some impact for our particular operation.","Daniel S. Fulton","Another element, Mark, is -- one other element, Mark, is that we have -- generally, a road system that's in better shape than perhaps some of the smaller owners.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Congratulations to Dan and Doyle. I wanted to ask a kind of an arcane question. You mentioned that we don't see an improvement in the, I guess, EBIT of the Timberlands segment, and I was wondering if one reason could be accounting for the write-up of inventory of logs that you obviously have to do when you make an acquisition? And if -- and as you work down those inventories, if they've been written up, that could help raise earnings in future periods?","Patricia M. Bedient","Chip, there really isn't a big impact from the write-up of log inventory in that we don't carry big log inventories in the Timberland business in the West. So if you're thinking about large log decks that typically you would see in the West, those might be in competitors' saw mills but certainly not in the Timberland business. So we really won't have a big inventory as we make the acquisition. And Longview typically didn't carry big long inventories as well. So we really look at the activity in the third quarter from Longview, being the fact that we will really only have that for about 2 months. And then also, they have the same impact in terms of pricing for the third quarter that I talked about in the export market, certainly that we are looking at as well. So we do believe that as we go into the fourth quarter, we expect that pricing will be picking up and that we will then also have had the 2 additional months on the ground to really start to work on some of the logistics and marketing synergies that we talked about during the call on the announcement of the acquisition.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And then just a quick follow-up. As we go from the third to the fourth quarter, how will the maintenance expense in the Cellulose segment change? More specifically, the impact of not taking this much down time if we leave price neutral?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, we're really only talking about guidance for the third quarter on this particular call, Chip. So in terms of giving fourth quarter guidance, we'll probably defer to the fourth quarter. But most of our maintenance did happen to a great extent earlier in the year. So I would expect that it will be somewhat lighter, but I don't have specific guidance for you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Dan, best wishes for your retirement, and we appreciated the interactions that we've had over the last couple of years with you. Thank you for that. A couple of quick questions for you. First, it seems like you guys saw a pretty good pricing momentum on the EWP side. Can you just talk about how you see your utilization rates in that business and opportunities perhaps for a little more prices as you move through the balance of 2013?","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Alex. As we've talked here about Engineered Wood Products, it is the product line in Wood Products that is most closely tied to new home construction. Utilization rates have been relatively low in this business during the recession, and we've been talking about the fact that we would expect it to start to pick up with housing recovery. And so we've seen, I would say, early stages of that. And as construction starts, continue to pick up, that will affect that business pretty significantly because the products that are produced are going into new home construction. As we've talked about, our own experience in WRECO with the increase in sales, and we look at broad housing start numbers, we are starting to see the momentum of this recovery, and it should translate into increased sales activity for the engineered products and with the facilities that we've got. That will be evidenced in our higher utilization rates. So that's what we've been expecting to happen, and so we're starting to see early evidence of that.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And just a question on sawlog prices in the U.S. South. We continue to flat line even though we're -- you're 2 of a housing recovery. Do you think there's much visibility there in terms of just where the inventory levels actually are and how long do we take to be able to work through the deferred harvest levels in the U.S. South and actually see some sort of uptick in sawlog prices in the South?","Daniel S. Fulton","We've discussed in the past the fact that there were more deferrals in the South than in the West because of the fact that the West has export potential. Additionally, there are more small land owners in the South. And what we are seeing is as housing begins to pick up, there is an increase in volume, but there's not that significant cost pressure that there is in the West. So it will happen eventually, but I can't call the timing.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Best wishes, Dan. I just had 2 areas I wanted to ask about. First, Patty, can you give us just any guidance going forward from kind of harvest volumes and mix at Longview, both in the third quarter and then on an annual basis thereafter?","Patricia M. Bedient","I really don't have numbers to give you on that, Mark, but I would tell you that we will be looking at accelerating some harvest over what historically Longview has done. So maybe pointing you towards the filings that we made of the Longview financial statements in the first quarter of this year. So you can see 2013 first quarter and then 2012 as well. So we'll be accelerating that harvest because of the maturity of the forest, as well as, as we enter again into the fourth quarter, we'll see export activity beginning to pick up; as well as, as we look at lumber pricing continuing to improve domestically in the West, we expect that we'll be seeing a pickup in domestic log activity as well.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. The other thing I wanted to ask about is just the distribution business. I really appreciate the fact that you've segregated that out now. You had a $13 million EBITDA loss in the second quarter. We know that there were inventory issues with the falling prices. I'm just curious about how you would think of -- have us think about that business on a going-forward basis and also if there's sort of a level of housing starts that you think will get you to EBITDA breakeven in that business, and maybe even what like 1.5 million starts might mean for profitability in the business.","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Mark. In the second quarter, the operating losses that we had in our distribution business were, in large part, related to the significant drop that was experienced in prices for the commodity OSB and lumber. Some of that is a function of the level of inventory that we're carrying. Some of that is the function of the challenges in that business with that kind of a price decline. Longer term, I can't put a number on housing starts as to what level it will take in order to return that business to profitability. I can tell you that our focus is on improving operations today as it has been with our other Wood Products businesses in order to be profitable at the level of starts that are available to us in today's market, rather than projecting it in the future. So as is the case with our other Wood Products businesses, we had a significant number of initiatives underway to improve operations. I'm confident that we will see some progress, but obviously, we're disappointed with what happened in the second quarter. And we believe that as the market picks up, we will certainly benefit from the leverage of the business, but we also need to make operating improvements.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citigroup.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Congratulations to Dan and Doyle. Just following up on Wood Products, I was wondering if you could share your operating rates for the 3 businesses. And during the quarter, we obviously saw a decline in lumber and OSB prices, and there were discussions of some mills out West taking downtime. And I'm wondering if that lumber price weakness caused you to step back from adding shifts or any flex capacity? Or if you could share with us what you saw in the quarter?","Daniel S. Fulton","In the second quarter, Anthony, our operating rate for lumber was elevated slightly, so we operated at about a 93% operating rate. And OSB operating rates were flat to the second quarter at about 88%. And then our I-Joist business, we were roughly 45%, and then sawlog's a bit north of 55%, which is consistent with where we were in the prior quarter. In terms of our production rates, we do adjust based upon market demand. We have -- in each of our markets, we focus on operating the right shifts at the right time with the right capacity and will continue to adjust to market conditions. And [indiscernible]. As we -- go ahead, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe switching to the log side, and for 3Q in the West, you referenced potentially weaker export prices. And I'm wondering, as you went from maybe the end of the quarter into July, if you have any -- if you could share any kind of view on log prices to Japan and China? And in your comments, you -- when you discussed sort of weakness in China, you seemed to reference it as being pretty seasonal or sort of typical seasonal weakness. And I was just wondering if you could give us a view on the Chinese market as well.","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, Anthony. It's Patty. As we think about the China market, it, as well as Japan, was strong in the first half of the year. And as I've said, typically, in China, when you get into the July time frame, very hot. The workers really go back to more of the rural areas, and so we always see somewhat of a seasonal slowdown in China. And that really is our view on China as we go through the third quarter, which will be softer. But we expect it will pick up again in the fourth quarter. So that really is seasonal from our perspective. And your other question was?","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just in terms of price movement from June to July. Are you seeing a meaningful deterioration of export prices out West? Or are they basically stable? What are you seeing?","Patricia M. Bedient","It's a little softer as we talked about on the guidance. It's not a huge drop. Prices are still good. It's just that, relative to the second quarter, they will not be as strong.","Daniel S. Fulton","Anthony, just to add a little bit of color, we had actually very strong sales in the second quarter to China. They picked up quite a bit from the first quarter. China is primarily a buyer of whitewood rather than Douglas fir. As you know, our -- Weyerhaeuser lands are very heavy to Douglas fir, the -- as are the Longview Timber lands. But the Longview Timber lands have a little bit higher percentage of white wood, and we'll be able to take advantage of that in providing some additional supply to the China market.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Congrats again to both Dan and Doyle. My question, my first one, is on WRECO. You mentioned that sales levels have been brisk. June was an outlier relative to May versus the last 7 years. You mentioned that pricing seems to be outpacing cost, if I heard you correctly. And from the homebuilders as well, you've been seeing generally strong outlooks into the third calendar quarter. And so while I realize that you're seeing a modest improvement in WRECO profits thus far into the third quarter in your guidance relative to 2Q, I'm wondering why we aren't seeing a little bit more lift now, Dan, in terms of homebuilding profits. In the past, you've talked about mix. What factors are limiting factors now, if any? And when do you hope to surmount those? Thanks, and I had a follow-on.","Daniel S. Fulton","Let me talk about the increase in sales activity throughout the first and second quarter and the impact on our backlog. So at this point, when we talk about backlog, George, you're aware that backlog includes -- so it's sales of homes that have not been closed yet, and they may be homes that are completed or under construction or still to be built. We have very, very low levels of standing inventory and so for most part, our backlog has a longer-term delivery cycle, which would shift more of those closings and backlog to the fourth quarter as compared to the third quarter. So you see what we've done so far in the first 2 quarters, Patty talked about the deliveries that we expect in the third quarter. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we've now increased our expectations for closings for the entire year. So we expect having a very strong fourth quarter, likely a higher percentage of fourth quarter closings than we have seen in quite a number of years. Even though fourth quarter is generally stronger, this fourth quarter, I think, will be stronger than most. There is a mixed shift that takes place quarter-to-quarter, and it is impacted by where those houses are. And so we had a higher percentage in the second quarter in San Diego, including some homes that we thought we'd close in the third quarter that actually closed at the very end of the second quarter. And at the same time, we had a shift of some homes that we thought would close in the second quarter that moved into the first couple of weeks of the third quarter. So that mixed shift does matter. The most significant factor in what you highlighted is that in our remarks, we said that we are starting to see some margin improvement as we're able to pass through price increases. So on a same-store basis, we are seeing margin improvement. But in some quarters, that's clouded by mix. So our view is that over the longer term, we should expect to see those higher margins show up in the closings that we would see coming in the fourth quarter and perhaps even into the first quarter of next year.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I understand. And Dan, the relative question I had, in the last few quarters, you've talked about mix being dampened by, I think, some level of more affordable housing being built into your communities. Will that factor be lessened to any great degree over the next few quarters? Or is that always going to be something you have to contend with? Should we see a better margin from here on out as that mix factor lessens hopefully?","Daniel S. Fulton","So what you're referring to is the issue of margins on affordable homes that we are required to build in some master-planned communities as part of the overall master plan entitlement. It has affected us most significantly in the Maryland, Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C. where we build affordable townhomes as part of larger master plans. That will still be a factor, and it's a factor because when we deliver those affordable homes, we generally do it with a block of homes at one time. And so there's a larger percentage perhaps in any given quarter. But as our volume picks up generally, that would be a smaller and smaller percentage of our overall closings. And so we should expect that the impact of that will be diminished as we go forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I guess, like Mark Wilde, I was trying to get some help modeling Longview, and I'll try a different approach. If we look at the purchase price and assumed, say, a 6% discount rate, that would imply annual sales of $160 million. Would that be a good way to add to your legacy land base and then maybe give a little extra bump for the synergies and increased harvesting that you planned?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, I think the way to think about it, Steve, is really to look at what Longview has been harvesting. And I think that's around 475,000 to 500,000 board feet. And I think also, to think about your outlook for pricing in terms of how you think about what pricing will do on a go-forward basis, considering that there is a rich mix in terms of mature logs, but also logs that can go into the Japan market and that as we look at what will happen with their cost structure, we do believe that the synergies that we talked about, of about $20 million, we will get certainly over time but will get a significant portion of that even yet this year in terms of on a run rate perspective and that we will also access the marketing expertise that we have as well. On the flip side, as you think about the historical amounts for Longview, we will take out the purchase price, most of which will be Timberland, and we will pool that with our Western lands in terms of a single rate for depletion. I think I would refer you to the pro-formas that were in the prospectus that we filed for the equity offering, and you can see how that will roll through the financial statement. For the third quarter, that cooling didn't have a significant impact on the results, but it could in the future as we go forward, given the mix of what we would harvest from Longview and what we would harvest from our existing Western lands.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And I -- just as a follow-on, having done such a large transaction, should we consider you to be still in the market? We know you want to grow your land base. Or are you out of the market for Timberlands for a little while?","Daniel S. Fulton","We're always in the market trying to improve, what I would call improve our hand in our land position. A lot of that activity happens on a quarter-over-quarter basis with $10.31 exchanges, where we can improve the return on -- to hold on all of the lands that we have, and the way we do that is we have to maintain an active position in the market. So we're exposed to opportunities that emerge. We'll take a look at them. And as we talked when we announced the Longview acquisition, we've looked at a lot of property over the last several years, and this was really one that had an extraordinary fit to us for a lot of reasons. So we'll be cautious. But for the right property, we will be certainly taking a look. But we've got a lot to absorb with the Longview acquisition, and our focus right now is to integrate that into our operations and to capture all of the opportunities that it brings us.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Two quick ones. One, on the pulp business, you had some initiatives underway with the intent of reducing maintenance costs sourced -- spreading that out over 18 months instead of 12 months. Can you give us an update on how that's proceeding and whether that will have any impact on 2014?","Daniel S. Fulton","We've made a lot of progress in shifting to an 18-month scheduled maintenance schedule, Mark. We've talked about this over the last couple of years. It takes some time to implement this on a mill-by-mill basis because, in some cases, we have had to invest in some operating equipment to allow us to do that. In other cases -- in every case, we have to have an approval from a regulatory body at the state or, if it's not state-controlled, even our own insurance carrier. So we've been working through that process. And additionally, all of our mills, with the exception of Grande Prairie, have received an approval to go to an 18-month outage schedule. Grand Prairie is still being evaluated. And in some cases, where we receive an approval, it'll be subject to further review after that first 18-month cycle to be sure that we are operating safely. Our focus is to be sure that we're doing it safely. But we've made great progress, and you should expect to see some of the benefits begin to play out in 2014. But really, 2015 probably will be the most significant impact.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And I believe at one point you had said about $40 million would be a potential benefit from that. Is that still a good number?","Patricia M. Bedient","I don't remember what the exact number was that we had before, Mark. But there's no reason that we would see a change from what the number was that we had before, but I don't have the prior ones in front of me. I think just as we think about the mills, we have underway now with us -- we are completing the annual outages for some of the mills in 2013. They are on their 18-month outage. So you don't see it in '13 because their outage did take place. But their next outage will be 18 months from now. So some will not have an outage in '14. We do have 1 mill that didn't have -- won't have an outage in '13. So what we're trying to do is stagger those because it is a function of not only the maintenance between, timing between, but also the staging of customer orders as well. So it is underway as we speak. And as Dan said, we would expect, with the exception of Grande Prairie, which is still -- we're looking at it. We expect to try to move that one as well. But we would expect all of them during 2014 to be on an 18-month schedule. That doesn't necessarily mean they won't all have an outage in '14, though, but they will be on a staggered basis.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay, great. And then if I'm doing my math right, it seems like you're hoping, anticipating to have north of 1,000 closings in WRECO in the fourth quarter, and I'm trying to get a sense as to what type of gross margin you think is embedded in the backlog. I understand that in the third quarter, there's some mix, which is going to bring the gross margin down a little bit perhaps from the third quarter level. I think in the past, you've talked about low 20 gross margins. Are we at a point where you're able to achieve those types of gross margins on the backlog that you see? Or do we have to get to higher run rates for that?","Daniel S. Fulton","We have identified low 20% gross margins as a long-term number that you should be able to count on. And over a couple of quarters, we've had some mix issues. I don't want to provide guidance for fourth quarter margins at this point. You are correct. As you look at the estimated number of closings and -- I would fall back to my comments that we've been through a period where we had cost increases that were keeping pace with price increases. And in the second quarter, our price increases outpaced cost increases, and so we are encouraged about the longer-term direction of our margins. And as we look at the homes that are in that backlog, we would expect some continuing strength and pickup in margins, but we can't provide at this point a fourth quarter guidance number.","Kathryn F. McAuley","Okay. That concludes our call. I'll turn it back to Dan.","Daniel S. Fulton","So just some brief closing comments from me. First of all, as always, we appreciate your attendance today and your interest in Weyerhaeuser Company. I want to thank all of you on the call for your support during my tenure as the Weyerhaeuser CEO. The past 5 years have tested us, but through the hard work and dedication of Weyerhaeuser employees, we've adjusted to changing market conditions, and I believe that we're well positioned to continue to improve our performance in order to maximize the value of all of our assets. As I wrap up my final earnings call with you, I look forward to the experience and the energy and the commitment that Doyle brings to his new role. And then I'd like to add one final comment, and that is that throughout my entire tenure as CEO and the many times that we've been together with you in our analyst and investor meetings, and on the many calls that we've had for quarterly earnings and other special events, I've been joined throughout that process by Patty Bedient and Kathy McAuley. I just want to say that I've been incredibly blessed to have had their support along our path together, and I want to thank them in front of all of you. And I want to direct anybody that has further questions to follow up with Kathy. But we appreciate you joining the call, and I am really looking forward to the next phase of company performance and what Doyle will bring to it. So thanks very much, everybody, this morning. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

[Operator Instructions] And I'd like to turn the call over to your host, Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead.","Kathryn F. McAuley","Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Fourth Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides for this call can be found at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","As summarized on Chart 1, Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter 2012 net earnings of $143 million or $0.26 per diluted share and net sales of $2 billion. For the full year of 2012, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $385 million or $0.71 per diluted share on net sales of $7.1 billion.","Turning to our business segments. My comments reviewing the fourth quarter 2012 refer to changes from the third quarter of 2012. Beginning with Timberlands, Charts 2 and 3. Timberlands contributed $95 million to pretax earnings, $15 million more than in Q3. Earnings from nonstrategic land dispositions were $20 million, a decrease of $5 million. In the West, log price realizations increased 8% and volumes rose 5%, driven by strong export in domestic demand. Southern log price realizations increased 3% and volumes rose 9% as log demand began to tighten. Fee harvest volumes were 13% higher in the South and 5% higher in the West. These increases were due to seasonal factors and market demand.","Wood Products, Charts 4 and 5. Wood Products contributed $38 million to pretax earnings in Q4, $21 million less than in third quarter. Commodity products benefited from tight inventory channels. Price realizations increased 2% for lumber and 8% for oriented strand board. Lumber volumes were 1% higher, and oriented strand board volumes rose 6%.","Engineered wood product volumes were seasonally weak. Solid section volumes declined 12% and TJI's 14%. Increased log and raw material costs in maintenance downtime resulted in higher operating costs.","Cellulose Fibers, Charts 6 and 7. Cellulose Fibers contributed $61 million to pretax earnings, $17 million less than in Q3. Pulp sales price realizations declined 2% and sales volumes rose 6%. Liquid packaging board price realizations declined 6%, and volumes were 7% lower due to operational issues at a production facility. Chemicals and energy costs increased in the quarter. These cost increases were partially offset by lower maintenance costs. During the fourth quarter, there was one scheduled maintenance outage of 6 days versus 13 days maintenance outage in third quarter.","Real Estate, Charts 8 and 9. Real Estate contributed $81 million to pretax earnings, $64 million more than in Q3. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales were $65 million. Earnings from single-family home sales were $16 million. The average closing price increased to $381,000 from $372,000 in the previous quarter. Gross margins declined to 20.2% due to mix. The backlog of homes sold but not closed was 774 at the end of Q4, an increase of 80% from the number of homes in the backlog at the end of 2011.","Unallocated items, Chart 10. The foreign exchange loss of $2 million in Q4 was due to a weakening of the Canadian dollar. This was a negative swing of $13 million. The elimination of interest segment profit in inventory and LIFO was income of $8 million, primarily resulting from lower lumber and oriented strand board inventory. This compares to an expense of $10 million in the third quarter.","I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Kathy. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Over the past several years, we've laid the foundation by implementing initiatives that positioned the company to capture the benefits of an improving U.S. housing market. 2012 marked the clear beginning of that long-term recovery. This market improvement, together with our progress in implementing our own improvement initiatives, is evident in our fourth quarter and annual results.","Revenues rose 13% during the fourth quarter and 14% for the full year. Our fourth quarter earnings increased 22% over the third quarter due to strong results from our Timberlands and our Real Estate segments. For the year, our net earnings before special items increased 78%, led by improvements within our Wood Products business.","Our performance has improved steadily throughout the year, allowing us to continue to invest in our business, pay down debt and increase our dividend. As a result, our total shareholder return for the year was over 50%. I'm excited about the opportunity to build on the momentum of 2012 as we enter 2013.","Before I discuss the performance of our business segments, I'll provide a brief comment on economic conditions that affect our company. First, the U.S. housing market. The housing market certainly turned a corner in 2012. Total starts, both single and multi-family, totaled 781,000, nearly a 30% increase from 2011. We began the year with stronger-than-normal spring selling season. This momentum continued through the fourth quarter, and we were pleased by the surprising strength of new home sales and Wood Products commodity prices. As we've noted in many fourth quarter reviews, both of these typically tail off at year end.","On a seasonally adjusted basis, December housing starts jumped to a 954,000 annualized level. This is the highest level of housing starts we've seen since June 2008. Further evidence of a strengthening market is seen in home prices, which have increased year-over-year according to all major price indices.","Another sign of improvement may seem counterintuitive is the declining level of existing home sales. At this point in the cycle, the cause is not lack of demand but record low levels of supply. Uncertainty in the home mortgage market has been a drag during this recovery. However, long-awaited new rules governing qualified mortgages add needed clarity to the process, and fence-sitting potential home buyers are finally moving back into the market. These changes are good for the housing industry and for the overall U.S. economy.","To help you compare your own modeling and forecasting with ours, we're planning for just over 1 million total housing starts for 2013. Those starts are comprised of 675,000 single-family and 335,000 multi-family. This is roughly a 30% increase over 2012, that's a similar percentage increase as last year but off of a higher base.","Market conditions are much improved from one year ago, but today's level of housing starts is still low by historic standards. We are at last on a clear path to recovery to long-term trend levels.","I'll comment briefly on global economic conditions since approximately 1\/3 of our revenues come from export of products from our Cellulose Fibers, Timberlands and Wood Products segments. Compared with conditions at the end of the third quarter, we're slightly more optimistic. In the Eurozone, the extreme prices conditions in 2012 seem to have abated and the euro has strengthened. The stronger euro should improve the relative competitiveness of our Cellulose Fibers business, as well as our Asian log exports.","The Canadian dollar remains strong, which should maintain the relative competitiveness of U.S. manufactured wood products. This may be offset somewhat by reduced softwood lumber tariffs.","In Japan, the new government seems ready to implement a stimulus package to jump-start their economy. This should increase export demand for all 3 of our forest products businesses. And in China, our export activity went through a period of adjustment in 2012. During 2012, the Chinese economy slowed but they also went through a political change. Export volumes for our logs, lumber and Cellulose Fibers products improved during the fourth quarter, as well as for the full year, albeit at lower levels than we had seen in the more frothy days of 2011. While these markets will likely remain somewhat volatile, we look forward to continued growth in Chinese demand.","Now I'll comment on the performance of each of our businesses in the fourth quarter. In Timberlands, our earnings increased from the third quarter due to stronger domestic and export demand for our logs. Price realizations improved as a result of domestic price increases in the West and the South, with a shift in the mix in the West as a higher percentage of our logs were exported.","Fourth quarter export shipments increased as a result of greater demand from all of our primary export markets: Japan, China and Korea. In addition, as I mentioned on last quarter's call, some shipments that have been scheduled for the third quarter slipped to the fourth.","Harvest volumes increased from the third quarter despite some challenging weather conditions. Our operations were affected by high wind and rain conditions in the West during November and wet weather in the South at the end of the quarter. For the full year, harvest volumes increased 13% as we flexed in response to improving market demand. Minerals activity increased slightly during the quarter as continued softness in gas prices was offset by revenue from oil leases in the Tuscaloosa Basin. As we look forward to 2013, we expect continued strong markets for logs. Minerals activity should remain steady.","In our Wood Products segment, the fourth quarter was a tale of 2 markets. We anticipated weaker demand for all of our products as we moved into the late fall and early winter months when we typically see a seasonal slowdown. Market surprise this year was the continued strong demand for our commodity products, lumber and OSB. This demand was caused by tight supply channels and the increasing strength of the housing recovery.","Engineered products, which still suffer from low operating rates, did not benefit from the pricing strength of commodity products. Fourth quarter activity for these products and our related distribution activity was a negative drag on the positive results in lumber and OSB.","As demand improved for lumber and OSB during the quarter, we also experienced higher manufacturing cost. We had higher cost for logs, veneer, OSB web stock, maintenance and energy. We also incurred increased labor costs as we began to staff up to meet an anticipated increase in operating postures in 2013.","We continue to focus on effective execution and performance improvement initiatives across our entire Wood Products segment. The combined benefit of these initiatives and improved market conditions is apparent in our year-over-year results. Fourth quarter earnings improved nearly $100 million compared with last year, and the annual earnings increased over $300 million. Over half of this increase is attributable to our performance improvement initiatives.","As we enter 2013, we are well positioned to respond to the increased demand from new housing starts, as well as the repair and remodel market. We've come a long way in this business, and we have more opportunity in front of us.","Moving to WRECO. We finished the year with an exceptional quarter, and we're well positioned for improved market conditions in 2013. The notable event during the quarter was the sale of nonstrategic land in San Diego, which generated $65 million in earnings. This land, which is part of our Pacific Highlands Ranch master plan, is designated for very high density residential and mixed-use. As a large-scale land developer in California, our master plans include a wide range of land uses. Sale of these properties is consistent with our long-term strategy and intent.","Let me turn to our single-family homebuilding business. Earnings from our single-family homebuilding business were comparable to the third quarter as single-family margins declined, primarily as a result of mix. The encouraging news from this year's fourth quarter was that our home sales increased nearly 40% from one year ago. This quarter marked a significant turnaround for our markets in Southern California and Las Vegas. Our Pardee president described the change as though someone turned on a switch.","For the quarter, our California sales were up over 80% over last year and Las Vegas sales nearly tripled. This long-awaited California recovery is good news for WRECO and it's also a strong signal of future opportunity for our Western Wood Products and Timberland businesses. At year end, all WRECO indicators point to improving buyer sentiment.","Our backlog is up 80% year-over-year. The average home price in backlog is 13% greater than one year ago. Our traffic count was up over 60% in December compared with last year, and our cancellation rate for the year was the lowest since 2004.","With this improving momentum, we'll be opening a significant number of new communities during the year, which will enable us to meet our growing demand. New communities allow us to present a fresh new face to our customers to capture the emerging enthusiasm of buyers. Many of these new communities will be open during the first half of the year, capitalizing on this year's spring selling season.","My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fibers business segment. Cellulose Fibers segment earnings declined from the third quarter. The decrease was primarily a result of decreased fluff pulp realizations and lower-than-anticipated earnings from our liquid packaging business. Worldwide pulp inventories declined during the second half of the year. Prices now seem to be stabilizing as we move into the new year. As I noted earlier, improvement in the Eurozone and government action in Japan may improve market conditions for us in 2013.","In addition to our core Cellulose Fibers products of fluff pulp, NBSK and liquid packaging board, innovative specialty products continue to provide opportunity for us to differentiate our products and improve margins. Sales volumes of our pearl product to China continued to increase. In Poland, we have begun production trials of our Crosslink modified fiber product. We're on track to enter full production in the second half of the year. Longer term, we expect that our new THRIVE cellulose-based composite product will open new markets for us.","And now I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss our fourth quarter outlook -- first quarter outlook, I'm sorry, and provide financial highlights.","Patricia M. Bedient","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone, and happy new year. Well, we are looking forward to 2013, but as Dan said, I will focus my comments primarily on the first quarter of the year.","So the outlook for the first quarter of this year is summarized on Chart 11, and I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands. Export markets in the West are expected to continue to improve throughout the quarter. Log demand from our Japanese customers is strong as a result of the improving housing market in Japan and the supportive stance of the new government to implement policies to encourage growth.","China log demand is expected to start somewhat slower due to the Chinese New Year holiday period in February but then continue an upward trend later in the quarter as residential and commercial construction picks up. As a result, export prices are anticipated to increase during the quarter. Stronger export demand, as well as an improved domestic lumber market have also contributed to rising prices in the domestic log market.","In the South, realizations for logs are expected to be slightly lower due to a smaller diameter log size. Fee volume will be seasonally lower, primarily in the South, and may also be affected by recent wet weather logging restrictions. Before the effect of nonstrategic land sales, we expect that earnings in the Timberland segment for the first quarter will be comparable to the fourth quarter. Earnings from nonstrategic land sales will be lower, likely less than half of the $20 million earned in the fourth quarter. As a result, overall earnings in the Timberland segment will likely be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth.","In Wood Products, market conditions for the first quarter are anticipated to be strong as the housing recovery continues on an upward path. We expect volumes to increase across all product lines. Sales realizations for lumber and OSB are expected to improve, and engineered Wood Products realizations will likely be flat due to mix. We have announced price increases for engineered Wood Products beginning in March, but most of the effect will be in the second quarter.","Log costs are rising, especially in the West as the demand for export logs increases and the seasonal risk of weather-related restrictions is greater. Unit manufacturing costs should be lower as operating rates improve in response to increased demand and less holiday downtime.","In engineered Wood Products, the benefit of higher operating rates will be mostly offset by higher input cost, especially for OSB, which is used for web stock. Given the strong market and our continued emphasis on operational improvements, we expect earnings in the Wood Products segment will increase significantly in the first quarter compared to the fourth.","In Cellulose Fibers, sales realizations for both pulp and liquid packaging are expected to increase slightly from modest decline in pulp sales volume. The biggest variance in earnings compared to the fourth quarter will be in the area of maintenance. We expect to have approximately $20 million more maintenance expense in the first quarter as a result of an increase in the number of annual shutdown days, as well as a number of major maintenance projects. As we've discussed on prior calls, we are preparing for a transition to longer time between planned shutdowns, moving from a 12-month schedule to 18 months. We expect maintenance expense for the full year of 2013 to be similar to 2012 as we begin to implement this change, which should be fully in place by 2014.","Progress on the startup of our Poland converting facility is on track as we continue the qualification process. We expect that overall earnings in the Cellulose Fibers segment will be lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth.","Home sales in our Real Estate segment have continued at a robust pace. Typically, we would not expect activity to pick up until after the Super Bowl. However, as Dan mentioned, we are seeing increased activity in most of our markets on a year-over-year comparison. Although it is early in the quarter, sales for the first 3 weeks of this year are up 125% compared to last year. These sales will become closings later in the year.","At the end of 2012, our community count declined to 62 open communities as sales activity was brisk. At the end of the first quarter, we anticipate our community count will increase to approximately 80 communities. Our plan for community openings could change depending on market dynamics. We expect to close fewer homes in the first quarter compared to the fourth, as the first quarter is traditionally the weakest quarter for closings.","In the fourth quarter, we closed 842 homes and expect that number to decline to just over 500 closings this quarter. However, it is a sizable increase over the 349 closings we had in the first quarter of 2012. Margins should be comparable to the fourth quarter at just over 20% and approximately 3% higher than the first quarter of 2012.","Selling costs will decrease during the quarter as a result of fewer closings, and G&A costs should be lower as we will not see the year end catch-up for incentive comp that affected cost in the fourth quarter.","We expect Real Estate segment results from our single-family homebuilding business in the first quarter to be slightly profitable and increase over the loss of $8 million in the first quarter of 2012.","Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. We ended the year with cash of just under $900 million, strong cash flow from operations, as well as the receipt of cash associated with the maturity of a timber monetization note from 2002 were the major contributors. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter, including Timberlands' reforestation, approximated $66 million. The total for the full year of 2012 was $285 million, and in 2013, we expect to spend a similar amount.","We ended the year with total debt of $4.3 billion. In 2013, we have debt maturities of just over $400 million, $156 million of which will be paid in the first quarter. Following our 2013 maturities, we will not have any significant debt payments until 2017. In addition, our $1 billion credit facility has no borrowings outstanding.","I'll close with some comments regarding our benefit plans. At the end of 2012, the underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans increased by just over $400 million on a GAAP basis. This increase was driven by the lowering of discount rates. For example, in the U.S. qualified pension plan, our largest plan, the discount rate declined from 4.5% to 3.7%. The negative effect of this change in discount rate was to increase the plan's liability by over $540 million. Declines in discount rates have a significant effect on a plan's funded status. For example, if the discount rate was 5.4%, which was the rate in effect just 2 years ago, this plan would be in an overfunded status.","Cash contributions for all of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans in 2012 was $145 million. We expect a similar amount in 2013. The expense for these plans in 2012, excluding special items, was approximately $80 million. In 2013, we anticipate total expense of $98 million. $64 million is for normal service costs, which will be charged to the business segments, and $34 million is nonoperating expense, which will be included in unallocated items.","Now I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Patty. Since 2008, we've had a steady drive to sharpen our focus on our core businesses and improve our competitiveness. We committed to improve profitability despite challenging market conditions and to maintain this discipline when the markets eventually recovered.","I commented at the beginning of my remarks that we've laid the foundation that positions us to capture the full benefits of an improving U.S. housing market and an improving global economy. The evidence is now in that we're in the midst of a housing recovery. As the market improves, we'll have the opportunity to grow, increasing timber harvesting, Wood Products manufacturing and community development and homebuilding, and our Cellulose Fibers business will continue to grow with our global customers as we are doing in Poland.","With this increased activity, we face challenges such as the availability and cost of skilled labor, inflationary pressure on manufacturing input costs and increasing land and materials costs. We're confident in the ability of our talented teams to meet the opportunities that an improving market brings, and we're absolutely committed to maintain the discipline that has brought us through this unprecedented period.","And now we welcome your questions and your comments. Kathy?","Kathryn F. McAuley","Yes. Brent, would you please open the floor to questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess starting off within WRECO, can you talk a little bit about what sort of mix changes might come with the increase in community count? Because it seemed like 2012 mix was a little bit weak. Would you expect to see that shift a little bit or remain kind of where it was in 2012?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, the mix is dynamic, in talking about the fourth quarter mix, Gail. We had, in the fourth quarter, an increased percentage of homes that are affordable dwellings. We had talked about that on our last call that these affordable units come with an overall master plan approval process. That was in the Washington D.C. market. And then we had a shift between third and fourth quarter away from a higher percentage of sales and closings in San Diego to other markets. So we would expect, as we look at the first quarter, as Patty commented, we expect the mix to be about the same. We have adjusted our product in every single market in response to evolving market conditions. We've had significant response in the Inland Empire Area of California in developing a new more affordable product. But in other markets, we've actually moved up market because that's where the demand has been in the last year to 18 months. As the overall market conditions improve, we will continue to find the opportunities where we have the greatest margin potential. With all of these new community openings, we have opportunities to adjust our product mix. And so what we will do throughout the year is try to give you some guidance on how we would expect that mix to be changing from quarter to quarter. But as we look from 2012 to 2013, we should not expect a significant mix shift, other than this resurgent demand from California can have a positive impact on us as we move throughout the year. It takes some time for those sales to convert to closings, but we have good visibility. As we look out, houses that are in our backlog, we know what those margins should be, and I think we'll just continue to update you on a quarterly basis.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just -- can I sneak one more in?","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes, okay.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Log price developments, can you help us understand kind of the developments that you saw in the fourth quarter, and currently how much might have been due to weather and how much you think is due to true underlying kind of slight demand tightness because it does seem like, in both the West and the South, there were weather impacts?","Daniel S. Fulton","There was a little bit more weather impact in the fourth quarter in the West than there was in the South. In the first quarter, likely that we'll have more weather conditions that would impact us because of wet weather. What we are seeing in the log market is the impact of some recovery in U.S. housing, both in the West and in the South, and in the West, a continued increase in demand for exports. So we expect some upward pressure on log prices. We have weather events every quarter that may impact us a bit, but I think generally, we would expect that the impact is coming from the demand side.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two general areas of questions, one in Wood and one in Real Estate, piggybacking on Gail. I guess in Wood Products, Dan, inflation offset a lot of the pickup in revenue that you saw in the segment. I guess that's to be expected this time in the cycle. If we look out the next year or so, would you anticipate that your realization should be at least able to keep up with inflation? And then taking a different take on it, if we hold raw materials and pricing constant, what kind of incremental margin do you expect you should be able to see out of Wood Products over the next 1 to 2 years?","Daniel S. Fulton","What we would expect is that as the market recovers, we certainly have different products, so we have our lumber business, we have our OSB business, we have engineered Wood Products. As the market demand picks up, there is pressure on log prices. And so the relative margin between logs and lumber shifts over time or logs and oriented strand board, but more related to logs. The impact in our engineered business comes through, as you noted, OSB input costs. But I can't answer your question specifically because it's a function of what supply is available on the market for logs and what production capacity comes back online in the Wood Products business. So it is the dynamic of supply and demand, and it's a function of production capability across the system. So quite frankly, I can't give you a specific number as I look out a couple of years. So what we believe is with a recovering market in the U.S., we should see increased demand for Wood Products, which will then translate to demand and ultimately pricing on logs, plus in our case, we have a significant export market off the West Coast, and that plays into the pricing dynamic also.","Patricia M. Bedient","George, the other thing that you saw in those margins in Wood Products in the fourth quarter was we had some downtime for the holidays and downtime for maintenance and implementing some capital projects. So as we see utilization rates improve, that will significantly impact that margin going forward as well.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, I'll leave that general area to the side for now. If we switch to WRECO, it was nice to see the increase in pricing and the backlog. Can you speak to what's been driving that? Is that what you're seeing in California or Las Vegas? And I guess again, just back to Gail's question, you had called out the mix issue in the fourth quarter, and you are more or less where we had expected you. But also, it seemed like Las Vegas, Nevada were stronger than we would've expected in the fourth quarter regionally broadly, not just Weyerhaeuser-specific. I'm curious why you didn't see more of a mix effect in the quarter.","Daniel S. Fulton","You're talking about sales prices which don't translate into the quarterly closing numbers, and so there's a lag, George, when we write those sales and when they are delivered. We were encouraged and have been encouraged not just by the fourth quarter, but as Patty noted, sales early this year had been very strong, which is atypical. We joke a bit about the Super Bowl being a turning point in the early year selling season, so this year is a bit of an anomaly. We're seeing prices moving up in every single market for similar type products, so that is not even addressing the mix issue as to whether or not it's a first-time product or a move-up product or there may be some additional pricing power. So we think that what's happening is certainly the existing inventory has diminished significantly. Homebuyers are going back into model complexes and making the commitment to buy new homes in part because they have more confidence in the economy, in their jobs, and they can obviously see that the market has bottomed and there is more likelihood of upward pricing movement, as well as perhaps some uncertainty about where mortgage rates are.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So the backlog price increase was broad not region-specific. Is that what you're saying?","Daniel S. Fulton","Yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","The first question is just to make sure I get this right. On the pension funding status, I believe last year it was about $1.1 billion under. And so you're saying, based on the discount rate changes, should be about $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion?","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes. As you look at the total underfunded status for the pension plan, as you said, and this would be for the U.S. plan, as well as our nonqualified plan, we were, I think, about $1.150 billion. And at the end of this year, that will increase by about a little over $400 million. That's still for the pension, Chip. That doesn't include the other postretirement benefit plans. But if you're talking just pension, those were the right numbers.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Well, actually on that, I noticed that dropped from about $0.5 billion to $400 million from '10 to '11. Did that change the other things that much in 2012 or they stayed flat?","Patricia M. Bedient","When you say the other things...","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","The other postretirement benefits?","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes, they were fairly flat. The biggest change was in the pension plan.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay, that's great. And then one quick one in addition. When you go back in past cycles, you can see, and I know the footprint's different, but you often see a pretty substantial seasonal, or often have increase in the operating income in the Wood Products segment. And as you know, prices today are way above their fourth quarter averages, and notwithstanding the, I guess, last night's report that there might have been a little bit of a backoff in lumber. I mean, could we see a triple-digit operating income number in the Wood Products segment, is that what you mean by significant?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, when I say significant, Chip, remember we're talking about the first quarter when you talk about a triple digit, but that's what we're working toward. So it will be a multiple of the fourth quarter and pretty close to that triple digit.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Dan, just one question. 2 years ago at Investor Day, you talked about the opportunity from being long land in your homebuilding business and the opportunity to sell land to homebuilders that were short. Has that process met your expectations? And is it reasonable for us to assume that we would see a significant ramp in that kind of activity in 2013?","Daniel S. Fulton","Our strategy is not changed, Mark, and we have -- we are not long land everywhere but we are long in certain markets, especially where entitlement processes reward a longer land position. Where we have master plans, we have the ability to not only build those lots but sell to others. We took advantage of that more in 2011 than we did in 2012. In '11, there was a resurgence of activity. Builders found themselves to be lot short, and we took advantage of that in certain regional markets. We looked for opportunities in those master plans where we have the excess land to sell to others on a profitable basis. We did some of that earlier this year, or in 2012, when we sold the Cross Creek Ranch property in Houston. And so we have that opportunity in front of us, and we'll look for opportunities where we have pricing and margin potential to take advantage of that as compared to building out those lots ourselves.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Carly Mattson with Goldman Sachs.","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Can you talk about how the company thinks about refinancing the 2013 maturities, and whether we should look for potential new issuance in the public bond market, or whether Weyerhaeuser would prefer to pay a downward cash?","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, Carly. It's still early in the year but what we have said in the past is that we think that $4 billion of debt is about the right amount of debt for the size of the company today. We've been working that down. So when we pay off our 2013 maturities, we'll be right at -- maybe just a little below that target. So I think the point will be what other uses we may have for any additional debt in the future. But where we are right now, we have said in the past, and that would still be our view, that around $4 billion in debt is the right amount for the size that we are today.","Carly Mattson - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then as a follow-up question, have you had discussions with the rating agencies about, particularly Moody's, about your -- the high BB rating that Weyerhaeuser has? And how does Weyerhaeuser think about the difference between being a crossover credit or a full investment grade credit. Has that view changed at all?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, Carly, we have ongoing conversations with both rating agencies, as you might well imagine. And we have historically been an investment grade rated company from both rating agencies. And Moody's moved us down years 2 ago when the markets in Wood Products especially were much more challenged than they are today. So we'll look forward to moving back into that investment grade area at Moody's, given the increase in the profitability and cash generation of the company. But I'll have to wait for them to make that move.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","In the Wood Products business, can you just provide more color around what the impact was from the maintenance downtime during the fourth quarter? And then as we look to 2013, is there any color you can provide on how we should be thinking about the change in the maintenance expense as we work our way through the year? I think in the pulp business in the past, you've been kind enough to provide that type of color to the extent that you can in the Wood Products business, that will be very helpful.","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, Alex. As we think about the seasonality in the business in the fourth quarter, we typically plan to be down implementing, that's when we target to do our capital project implementation and we plan maintenance. So it was more a quarterly statement as opposed to an ongoing piece as you think about the first quarter and second and third quarters, so I don't think there's anything big about that, that's different. It's just that the market was very much stronger in lumber and OSB, especially. And we probably didn't take as much downtime -- we didn't take as much downtime as we typically would in a normal year. Most of that would have come as well in engineered wood, where the operating rates have not been as strong. And then did you have a question about Cellulose Fibers?","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No. I just -- the question really was if you guys can just put out a number for what the maintenance expense was in the Wood Products business for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter, how that changed?","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes, yes. I don't have a number for you in the actual maintenance for the fourth quarter for Wood Products. Let me see if we can pull something together and maybe you can check back with Kathy.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the follow-up question, as you know, Wood Products, what is the current profitability level in that business look like? Is it EBITDA breakeven at this point? And as you guys look at that business over the next couple of years, what U.S. housing starts level would that business really begin to generate meaningful profitability for the company?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, that -- the Wood Products segment is generating cash, Alex.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Well, I'm speaking about engineered wood products, not the entire segment. Just the engineered wood products subsegment.","Patricia M. Bedient","Engineered wood products, in terms of the operating rate for the fourth quarter were still about 40% to 45% in that business. So really what we need to do is to get that operating rate up. And as we look forward in that business, it is a late cycle recovering business in Wood Products. In other words, of the 3 technologies that we have, engineered wood products, because it is more exposed to single-family -- housing or new housing rather as opposed to repair and remodel, it recovers a little bit later in the cycle. I can't tell you that, as you might know, the Builders' Show is going on this week, and the talk at the Builders' Show is concern about being able to get capacity or to get product as the cycle continues to recover. So we look very much forward to getting to that point. And I think as we move forward to increase housing starts, as Dan mentioned in his outlook, that we will see much improved results in that business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just following up on the sale of lots, given San Diego has historically been one of your stronger regions from a margin perspective, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the decision to sell that land rather than develop it yourself? And to the extent you can, can you talk about where the sale sort of leaves your land position in San Diego?","Daniel S. Fulton","Sure. Anthony, the property that we sold is part of a master plan, North County, San Diego called Pacific Highlands Ranch, where we have a significant number of entitled single-family lots that we would build out over time. That's a market that as you commented on, has been very good to us in the past. We have high margins in our single-family business in San Diego. The particular land that we sold is zoned for high-density residential. It was a very high density so multistory product and mixed-use. So it is not our core product that we build. That is the kind of property that we would typically sell to other builders and developers who specialize in it. Some of that will be rental, some of that perhaps could be for sale but likely more rental housing. And so it's consistent with our strategy to sell the property that is zoned for other than single-family to others, and that was the decision. So as we think about our land position in San Diego and our lot count, doesn't affect, really, our lot count at all because it's not a product that we would build. So it's totally consistent with the way we manage that business. The good news is that the multifamily market has been very strong, and so it was an opportune time to sell it. The purchasers of that property, will still have to go through some of their own entitlement process over a 1- to 2-year period before they break ground.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then just maybe one last one, switching to Timberlands. I'm wondering how much your log exports to China were up or up or down year-over-year in 2012? And as you look forward to 2013, from a volume perspective, do you expect kind of a meaningful change in log exports to China?","Daniel S. Fulton","For the year, our export volume to China was up, but we expect it to increase as we go forward into 2013. The mix that we've talked about in the past is not significantly changed, so about 70% of our exports go to Japan, roughly 20% China and the balance to Korea. And as we look forward to full year 2013, I can't give you specific numbers on what the China volume is because it's not that predictable. But we see covering demand and we expect to be in a position to be delivering logs there as well as into our traditional markets of Japan and Korea. We have seen a pickup in activity in Japan. That's generally a more profitable market for us. They buy higher-quality logs, we have much longer-term relationships. But the relationships that we've built to China are encouraging for us and so we see it as an opportunity.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Dan, I wondered if you could just talk a little bit about sort of your positioning in the Wood Products business. It seems like over the last few months, we've started not only see a pickup in housing and building products activity, but we've started to see more M&A with the GP deal and then this Interfor deal that was announced the other day. I just wanted to get a sense of how you feel about your footprint in the business?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, we've seen that activity, Mark, and I would say it's not surprising. As the market starts to pick up, you'd expect to see some more of that activity. We like the position that we have, so we have good balance in our lumber business between the West and the South. As the market picks up, especially in California, we're excited about the opportunity to see improvement in our Western lumber system. OSB business, we've got 6 mills that are operating. We've increased production in that business over the last year, and we're moving, even as we speak into 2013, to increasing operating posture. I think in the fourth quarter, we are operating at about an 85% level. In OSB, we expect that to increase. So we're well positioned to serve both the Southern and the Western markets. Engineered wood products, Patty talked about it, is a late cycle business. We've got the leading brand in that business with our Trus Joist brand. And if single-family housing picks up, the opportunity there is that we do have a lot of operating leverage because we are operating it well less than capacity today, but we're positioned in the West and in the East to serve the broad needs of a recovering single-family, as well as the multifamily sector. As we look forward, there's still some question about the relative mix between singles and multis, as we move forward wondering whether there's change in patterns and increasing density. But we like the position that we have in every one of those products.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Would you want to expand in any of these businesses?","Daniel S. Fulton","We look at opportunities. And fundamentally, as we look at opportunities, it's a function of how it would fit with our existing system and in relative financial opportunities. So I think we're active all the time in looking, but we have no immediate plans that we're prepared to discuss.","Patricia M. Bedient","[indiscernible] is there to say that our focus, really, is on improving the operations that we have, and we aren't operating the operations that we have today at full capacity. So we have room to continue to grow the business with the existing facilities that we have. So that's really the focus.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's fine. Just can you just mention where you're at in terms of kind of maximizing with kind of oil and gas and mineral revenue from the land? And you do have a lot of land down in Louisiana, and I just, I wonder where you're at in terms of extracting all of the subsurface value that you might from your holdings?","Daniel S. Fulton","Our average earnings over the last year or so have been about $10 million a quarter, revenues coming from our minerals operation. There's been a bit of a shift in mix, Mark, between oil and gas. If we were to go back 3 to 4 years ago, when the gas shale activity took off, I think our minerals business at that point was generating about $60 million. Some of that was coming from these upfront lease payments as well as royalty payments. So on a steady-state basis, for the next 12 months or so, I think $10 million a quarter is probably a predictable number. Production levels are down in that business because of prices today for natural gas. Drilling costs for shale oil had been relatively high. We have land that's well positioned both in the Haynesville Shale gas area and the Tuscaloosa oil shale region. So we have active drilling going on in our properties, and I think it's really a function of pricing of the end product for oil and gas that will dictate how much additional activity there'll be in the next 12 months.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","You guys have talked a little bit about the increased staffing, and I'm going to assume most of that has to do with the community count and with lumber production. But would you be able to speak a little bit more specifically on the lumber production side, how much you think you can get both lumber and OSB production up or just overall Wood Products production up throughout the year?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well when we talk about it, and I mentioned briefly with respect to OSB, we're increasing our operating posture and we have been doing some hiring, bringing people back to work in order to add shifts. As the market expands for lumber, we have the same ability to add hours and in some cases to add shifts. But we respond both to demand, but primarily pricing. And over the past 12 months, most of the hiring that we have done in the company has been production employees that we've been putting back to work in order to be able to ramp up and respond to the increased opportunities for Wood Products. In WRECO, our general staffing level has been relatively stable as we add communities, then we would certainly add production superintendents and sales teams. But in the WRECO business in particular, most of the activity is subcontractor-based, and so it doesn't have a significant impact on our headcount. Did that answer your question or did you have a different focus to your question?","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","No, no, I think that's helpful. When we look at the Timberlands business, you guys had mentioned also and it seems like the Southern log harvest went up pretty nicely in the fourth quarter. How much below, I guess, sustainable harvest or how much above your sustainable harvest could you harvest in the coming years if there was a very strong recovery? And what could those levels go to from where they are today?","Daniel S. Fulton","During the recession, we went through a period of a couple of years where we took our harvest levels down, and we have been bringing them back over the last 2 to 3 years. So you've seen a fairly significant ramp-up in harvest activity, 2011, 2012. We are managing our Timberlands on a sustainable basis. Over the next 12 to 24 months, you should not expect to see a significant increase in harvest activity because we are operating today at a sustainable level. In any given market situation, we have the ability to flex a bit, say plus or minus 10%. It's a little bit -- takes a little bit longer to increase in the West because of road requirements and permit requirements. But we have shared projections in the past in our main conference of long-term harvest levels in terms of how that would ramp up over time. That's more of a function of the maturity of the timber rather than responding to specific market conditions. So we have some limited ability to flex short term, as we've done in the last year or so. So we'll respond to market conditions.","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Patty, you touched on the pension obligation and how that went up on a GAAP basis. Could you give us -- I know that may not be finalized yet, but could you give us an idea on where that went on a PBO basis at year end?","Patricia M. Bedient","I don't know that I have that in front of me. Let me just see if I can help you with anything on that. I think we may have to wait for the K filing, which will come out later here in the next couple of weeks. Let me see if I can find the number for you, Josh, as we're sitting here.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","So your log sales prices were up pretty good, particularly in the West Coast, which wasn't the case for all landowners out here. So I'm just wondering is that due to your exposure to Japan and China? Or is there also some benefit to putting higher logs through your mills at higher prices because you're basically transferring the revenue from a taxable jurisdiction into an untaxable jurisdiction?","Daniel S. Fulton","The latter is not the case. We sell logs to our lumber business or conversion businesses at market. The difference in pricing is more likely a function of our Japanese trade, Steve. And the quality of the logs and the long-term relationships that we have with customers there, where we are being rewarded for the quality of the logs and the consistency of delivery over a long period of time. And I think we have that same opportunity emerging in China because of the quality of our fiber, the predictability and sustainability on the logistical side. I think we're fairly compensated for the value that we deliver.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Perfect. One other quick one. Across the WRECO footprint, do you feel that you have a need to reload your land position anywhere across that in any of your geographies?","Daniel S. Fulton","We are always purchasing new land in our WRECO system to replace the lots that we are selling with the houses that we deliver. So that is just an ongoing function of managing a pipeline of future lots. We are very strategic in where we have a land position. The length of that position varies by market depending upon the challenge of entitlements and how we are able to control it. So our focus is on efficient management of our cash, and allocation of resource was in that business to, number one, be sure that we have a pipeline, but also ensure that we are earning maximum possible returns on the use of our capital. So it is a region-by-region decision. But in fact, we are always in the market looking for lot positions for future deliveries.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","You talked about housing starts potentially being up 30% this year, and I want to understand what type of flexibility you have in your lumber business in particular, given that potential? If one were to assume that might mean lumber demand and if you have a differing view on this, please share. But let's say lumber demand might be up about 15% or so, would you expect to have the capability in your system to increase your production by at least 15%? And you talked about having already started that process. Where are you in that process? How much increased production have you already started to achieve?","Daniel S. Fulton","We've had a steady increase in production as the market has begun to recover. In our lumber business in the fourth quarter, we were operating in about an 80%, in maybe mid-80s production rate so we have room to move beyond that in response to increased market demand. Also in the lumber business, Mark, our typical shift posture is 2 shifts. And so we have the ability to add hours to those shifts on a selective basis, and we have the ability, in some cases, to add an entire shift. We've got one facility in Cottage Grove, Oregon, that operates 24\/7. That's not typical in the lumber business. But we do have a fair amount of flexibility in lumber to respond. And the response obviously comes from not just volume but we have to look at who our customers are and what pricing is. And so at the level of starts that we are at today, we've got a fair amount of room. As I pointed out, the level of starts in 2012 is very low by historic standards. We've got a lot of room to move between now and getting back to trend levels, which are sort of 1.5 million to 1.7 million.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Right. I guess what I'm trying to understand is that given your view of the world, presumably you're positioning yourself to be able to produce a good deal more product this year. And what I'm trying to understand, whether or not those actions have already been taken and we are already seeing that production, or whether you are in the process of taking those actions and the increased production will show up in 1 month, 2 months, 3 months?","Daniel S. Fulton","The increased production should show up as demand increases. So we're not producing excess inventory, and we're not producing inventory at prices that don't give us the margins that we think are appropriate. So we have the ability to respond as the market picks up. There's some delayed response. It's a little bit longer-term response when you -- when we're ramping up, let's say, adding an entire shift to an OSB mill. That takes a little bit longer time. And so we've gone through some of that activity over the last year in our Wood Products business but more likely related to our OSB facilities.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","So basically, you feel that you can be very quickly responsive and so you do not necessarily need to be building log decks, getting more work out. You don't have to like plan a month or 2 ahead of time, just so as I can understand?","Daniel S. Fulton","No, we're always planning ahead of time. So we have, actually, fairly robust staffing plans where we look out a potential demand and we're filling those positions. But I can't give you specifics on a by-mill basis. We are -- the headcount that we've increased over the last year, as I mentioned, has primarily been related to Wood Products production.","Patricia M. Bedient","Mark, when you think about lumber, we don't have huge log decks. We don't carry huge log decks in our supply chain. So the things that -- and that's just a function of the way that we operate on an efficient basis. So the things that would provide hiccups in that to being able to meet that demand are more things like if we were to have a weather-related event in the West. That would drive out-of-log downtime. So it's not if you go back a few years and you think -- and some competitors still do today, carry a lot of inventory in the yard, we have really worked on our supply chain between our Timberlands business and our lumber business so that we can respond as market conditions do increase.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just an easy question, just on log pricing. It looks like prices are up in the Pacific Northwest, and I can understand the sort of the rally in Japan in advance of tax hikes in '14 and higher Chinese demand. I'm really concerned with the log prices in the South. And if I look at it historically, I mean, it seems to be a correlation of after 6 months of the lumber price hike, you were 6 to 12 months, you've seen log prices come up and we've seen that gap expand out, and lumber prices are up sort of 30% to 40% year-over-year. So the question is, when do you expect the log prices to start to move up significantly or materially in the U.S. South?","Patricia M. Bedient","Paul, we are starting to see log prices move up in the South, I would say more on a modest basis. Our own sales realizations for logs in the Timberlands segment, as I spoke to, will actually be down just slightly. But that's really more a function of the diameter size of the logs that we're logging this quarter, and that's not atypical for us. We are looking at settings that we can access, especially as it relates to this wet weather. So that's just an isolated instance -- incident. But we would expect saw log prices to start to move more significantly in the South as we go through the year, assuming, that would be our assumption, that housing continues to recover.","Kathryn F. McAuley","Thank you. Dan?","Daniel S. Fulton","Okay. I'd like to thank everybody for taking the time to join us today. We continue to appreciate your interest. As you can tell from our comments, we're encouraged by the recovery in housing that's underway. We think we're well positioned to take advantage of it, and we look forward to -- we're looking forward to 2013 because I think we have the opportunity to fully participate in this recovery. And we look forward to your continued interest. If you have questions following the call, follow up as you normally do with Kathy. Appreciate it very much. Good day, everybody.","Patricia M. Bedient","And, Josh, you can get that answer to your question from Kathy, we'll dig that out for you.","Kathryn F. McAuley","Okay, thank you. Have a nice day.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.","I would now like to hand the conference over to Ms. Beth Baum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Beth Baum","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2019 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statement in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.","On the call, this morning, are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.","Devin Stockfish","All right. Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $99 million or $0.13 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding a net benefit to $40 million from special items, we earned $59 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $308 million. Our businesses continued to deliver strong operating performance despite challenging market conditions. And in a moment, I'll dive into our business results.","But, first, let me set the stage with some brief comments on the housing market. U.S. housing activity continued to improve in the third quarter, led by stronger activity in the important single-family segment. Single-family permits and starts have now increased for five months in succession. Additionally, seasonally adjusted single-family starts exceeded 900,000 units in back-to-back months in August and September, which we haven't seen since 2007.","Total U.S. housing starts have also strengthened totaling 1.28 million in the third quarter compared with 1.26 million in the second quarter and 1.21 million in the first. As we look forward, many indicators point to continued improvement in housing activity. Wage growth remained solid and the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low. Mortgage rates are hovering near 3.5% significantly lower than late 2018. Consumer confidence surveys indicate a positive view of current and future conditions. Homebuilder sentiment has increased for four straight months and sits at the highest level since February 2018. And builders continue to ship more product to serve the significant demand for affordable housing.","That said, several supply side headwinds for housing remain. Builders continue to face a series of challenges including labor and lot availability and regulatory burdens as they seek to bring affordable housing to market. Additionally there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the outlook for U.S. economic growth that could impact buyer sentiment. While these challenges will continue to affect the housing market, we believe that the supported fundamentals outweigh the headwinds.","Entering the fourth quarter, our builder customers tell us their demand continues to improve and they intend to maintain strong building activity until winter weather no longer permits. Going into next year, we continue to anticipate increasing momentum in the single-family housing market and a modest growth trajectory for U.S. housing.","Turning now to our third quarter business results, I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands charts 4 through 6. Timberlands contributed $72 million to third quarter earnings and $154 million to adjusted EBITDA. Western Timberlands EBITDA decreased by $30 million compared with the second quarter due to seasonally lower harvest volumes and lower average realizations for domestic and export logs.","Western fee harvest volumes decreased 11% compared with the second quarter and 5% compared with year ago, as we intentionally brought less wood to market during the seasonal peak in supply. Log and haul costs also increased as we typically shift to higher elevation logging during the summer months. In the Western domestic market, mills entered the third quarter with full inventories in preparation for summer fire season. However, as summer weather in the Pacific Northwest, was wetter than normal there was no notable fire activity and logging conditions remained favorable.","Log supply increased seasonally as private nonindustrial landowners brought their logs to market and mill log decks remained at comfortable levels through July and August. Domestic log prices trended modestly lower through the summer months, but started to firm up at the end of August, as demand and pricing for Douglas fir lumber began to improve. Log supply tightened in September with the early arrival of the fall rainy season and log pricing increased in the quarter. Moving to the export markets, in Japan, post-and-beam housing starts were up 1% year-to-date.","Demand for our customers' Douglas fir lumber products remained solid. And our third quarter log sales volumes to Japan were comparable to the second quarter. Average sales realizations were modestly lower, due to pressure from unfavourable foreign exchange rates and U.S. domestic pricing trends.","In China, overall log inventories decreased by 15% during the third quarter, and totaled 3.5 million cubic meters at the end of September. Chinese demand for our Douglas fir and hemlock logs, remained generally steady compared with the second quarter.","Our third quarter log sales volumes to Japan -- to China increased, but this was primarily due to timing of vessel sailings. Average realizations for our China export logs, decreased modestly compared with the second quarter, due to mix and competition from lower priced species, which pressure pricing for our hemlock and Douglas fir.","Overall, third quarter log export revenues were lower than the year ago quarter, due to lower realizations for our Japan and China logs. And moderately lower sales volumes to China.","For Western Timberlands as a whole, EBITDA is significantly lower than a year ago, due to lower prices for domestic and export logs. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands EBITDA increased by $5 million compared with the second quarter, as higher fee harvest volumes were partially offset by seasonally higher forestry spending.","Third quarter weather was generally drier than second quarter this resulted in good operability, and strong log production across our southern regions. Our fee harvest volume increased 7% as we benefited from the improved weather, and also caught up on thinning activity postponed during the unusually wet conditions earlier this year.","Average realizations for our Southern logs decreased 1% compared with the second quarter, due to mix as the increasing thinning activity resulted in a higher proportion of fiber logs.","Average realizations for our Southern sawlogs increased due to improved pricing in the mid-South, where markets remained relatively strong due to wetter conditions. Realizations for our fiber logs were comparable to the second quarter.","On the export side, we have been operating our Southern export business at minimal volume since Chinese tariffs were applied to the Southern yellow pine logs in 2018. Less than 0.5% of 1% of our Southern fee harvest volumes are, sold to expert customers.","Comparing overall Southern Timberlands results with the year ago quarter EBITDA increased by $11 million, due to higher average log sales realizations, and higher fee harvest volumes.","Northern Timberlands EBITDA increased by $3 million compared with the second quarter, and was comparable to a year ago. Compared with the second quarter, fee harvest volumes increased seasonally, as the northern operations emerged from spring break-up.","Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources charts seven and eight. Real estate and ENR contributed $32 million to third quarter earnings, and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA.","Third quarter EBITDA was $11 million lower than the second quarter, and $26 million lower than a year ago. As expected, the number of acres sold decreased significantly compared with the second quarter, and the year ago quarter.","As we previously indicated, our 2019 real estate sales are heavily weighted toward the first half of the year, whereas in 2018, most of our sales occurred in the third and fourth quarters.","Average price per acre was roughly two times that of the second quarter, and the year ago quarter due to geographic mix. Approximately 85% of our third quarter acres sold were in the South and West.","In contrast, over half the acres sold in the second quarter of 2019, and third quarter of 2018, were located in Montana, where Timberland prices are regionally lower. Wood Products charts nine and 10.","Wood Products contributed $75 million to third quarter earnings before special items, and $123 million to adjusted EBITDA. Earnings and EBITDA were nearly comparable to the second quarter, on flat average realizations for our commodity products.","EBITDA for lumber increased $5 million due to lower Western and Southern log costs. Lumber pricing declined at the outset of the third quarter, then reversed course in mid-August as improved housing activity drove incremental demand, and previously announced mill curtailments began to reduce supply.","On average, the framing lumber composite price increased 3% in the third quarter compared with the second. Our average log -- lumber realizations were comparable to the second quarter as our mix of production is weighted more heavily to Southern Yellow Pine.","Third quarter sales volumes were flat with the second quarter. Our lumber mills ran very well again this quarter even with some modest hurricane-related downtime in our Southern operations.","Unit manufacturing costs for lumber increased slightly due to that downtime as well as hurricane preparation activities. Comparing third quarter results with the year ago quarter, lumber EBITDA was significantly lower due to a 21% decrease in average sales realizations, partially offset by lower log and manufacturing costs.","EBITDA for the third quarter of 2019 includes charges of $4 million for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. In OSB, EBITDA increased by $5 million compared with the second quarter due to lower fiber and unit manufacturing costs.","As with lumber, third quarter OSB pricing vary by region. Although pricing in the benchmark north central region increased significantly during the third quarter, pricing in several other regions trended materially lower. The OSB composite price which includes all producing regions was flat in the third quarter compared with the second.","Our third quarter realizations trended in line with the OSB composite price which is a better proxy for our geographic mix. Our OSB sales and production volumes were comparable to the second quarter. Comparing our third quarter results to the year ago quarter, EBITDA was significantly lower due to a 33% decrease in average sales realizations, partially offset by higher sales volumes as our Grayling Michigan mill was down for a scheduled press replacement in the third quarter of 2018.","Engineered Wood Products EBITDA decreased by $9 million compared with the second quarter. Average sales realizations for I-Joists products were flat with the second quarter and average realizations for solid section decreased by 1% due to product and geographic mix.","Sales volumes for I-Joists increased 4% and production volumes were comparable to the second quarter. Sales volumes for solid section products increased 3%. Solid section production declined 12% as we completed scheduled annual maintenance shutdowns at two mills and continue to draw down our first quarter inventory build.","Unit manufacturing costs increased due to lower operating rates and higher maintenance expense resulting from these scheduled shutdowns. Fiber costs declined due to lower cost per logs in oriented strand board web stock.","Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA for Engineered Wood Products increased due to lower cost per logs and oriented strand board. Distribution EBITDA was comparable to the second quarter and significantly higher than year ago due to improved margins.","Third quarter results for Wood Products include one special item a pretax benefit of $68 million from insurance recoveries related to our Flak Jacket product remediation. To-date we have received $93 million of insurance proceeds and we continue to expect a significant portion of the remediation cost will be covered by insurance.","I'd like to now turn to operational excellence. Our businesses continue to make good progress on operational excellence and we are on track to achieve our 2019 target of $80 million to $100 million.","Year-to-date our operational excellence initiatives in timberlands have been focused on log marketing and merchandising, optimizing silviculture spend, reducing growth costs, and improving log and hauling efficiencies across all geographies.","In Wood Products, our OpEx initiatives are focused on reducing our controllable manufacturing costs, increasing our high-value product mix, and improving log recovery across our operations. Our real estate business is also on track to meet or exceed its targeted 30% premium to timber value.","I'll now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.","Russell Hagen","Thanks Devin. Good morning. Key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Chart 13 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect our fourth quarter earnings will be comparable to the third quarter and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly lower.","In our Western Timberland operations, we expect domestic log sales volumes will decline modestly in the fourth quarter. Wet operating conditions reduced log supply late in the third quarter and inventories tightened. We anticipate domestic log sales realizations will improve modestly in the fourth quarter as a result of steady domestic demand and the continued seasonal reduction in supply from non-industrial landowners.","As is typical for this time of the year, we expect our Western road and unit logging costs will be lower compared to the third quarter. Demand for our Japanese export logs remains solid and we expect fourth quarter sales realizations to be flat with the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales volumes are expected to decline due to the timing of shipping schedules.","Chinese export log sales volumes are expected to be comparable with the third quarter and we anticipate average sales realizations will decline modestly in the fourth quarter. We're taking advantage of our ability to allocate volumes between the domestic and China markets to capture the highest margin opportunity.","In the South, operating conditions have been favorable for the past several months and log inventories have returned to healthy levels. We expect fourth quarter average log sales realizations will be slightly lower than the third quarter and fee harvest volumes will decline.","In the North, we expect fourth quarter EBITDA to decline due to the seasonally lower fee harvest volumes and a partial quarter of Michigan results. In September, we announced an agreement to sell our 555,000 acres of Michigan Timberlands for $300 million. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and these assets are now listed on our balance sheet as held-for-sale.","Turning to our Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources segment, as previously discussed the pace of our real estate sales is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year in 2019. Market conditions remain positive and high net worth individuals, recreational and conservation buyers are all active.","We expect fourth quarter earnings for Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources segment will be approximately $10 million lower than the third quarter. We continue to expect full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $270 million and anticipate land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be between 50% and 55% for both the fourth quarter and the full year.","For Wood Products, we expect lower sales volumes across most product lines, as building activity typically declines in the fourth quarter as we move into the winter months. Our channel inventories have tightened, buyers continue to limit purchases to immediate needs. We anticipate higher Western log cost, partially offset by modestly improved operating cost as we continue to capture operational excellence improvements.","Fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA for Wood Products segment are expected to be approximately $25 million lower than the third quarter before any benefit from improvement in sales realizations.","For lumber, fourth quarter to-date average sales realizations are $5 higher than the third quarter average. Current realizations are comparable with the third quarter average. Oriented strand board fourth quarter to-date average sales realizations and current realizations are both $5 below third quarter average.","As a reminder for lumber every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.","Chart 11 outlines the major components of our third quarter unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items improved $3 million due to a non-cash benefit from elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory and LIFO compared with the second quarter.","Third quarter special items include a $15 million pre-tax legal charge stemming from the judgment in a suit related to Flak Jacket. We're appealing this ruling.","Our third quarter non-cash, non-operating pension and post-retirement benefit cost was comparable to the second quarter. We continue to expect to record approximately $60 million of expense for the full year 2019.","Turning to our key financial items, which are summarized on chart 12, we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $153 million. Cash from operations during the third quarter was $292 million.","Turning to cash from investing. Our capital expenditures in the third quarter totaled $98 million. We continue to expect total CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $380 million nearly $120 million for Timberlands, $250 million for Wood Products and approximately $10 million from planned corporate IT system upgrades.","As a reminder, the fourth quarter is historically the highest quarter of capital spending. We also expect to receive $300 million of cash in the fourth quarter as we close on the sale of our Michigan Timberlands.","Moving on to financing. In the third quarter, we paid $302 million to extinguish the debt of a variable interest entity that was established as part of the timber installment sale in the early 2000s. This is the last of these entities and we'll receive $362 million of cash in the first quarter of 2020 when the related financial investment matures.","We ended the quarter with approximately $6.6 billion of total debt outstanding this includes a $440 million balance on our line of credit, a portion of which was used to bridge the temporary cash outflow associated with the variable interest entity debt maturity. We have no debt maturities until 2021. We expect our fourth quarter interest expense to be comparable to the third quarter bringing the full year 2019 to approximately $370 million, excluding special items.","I'll close my comments with taxes. Excluding special items in the third quarter we recorded a $10 million income tax benefit. On a year-to-date basis, our effective tax rate before special items was a benefit of 15%. We expect our full year 2019 effective tax benefit to be similar to the 15% we have booked year-to-date though will be somewhat sensitive to fourth quarter lumber and oriented strand board pricing.","Turning to cash taxes. We expect to pay minimum cash taxes in 2019, due to an anticipated fourth quarter refund for prior overpayments. We've also filed a $90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution that claim is still in process and so we're unlikely to receive that cash in 2019.","Now, I'll turn the call back over to Devin and look forward to your questions.","Devin Stockfish","Thank you, Russell. In closing, I am extremely proud of the work that our people are doing all across the company. Our teams are delivering strong operational performance in each of our businesses despite challenging market conditions. In every area that we can control, our employees are driving solid execution each and everyday. We remain intently focused on serving our customers and delivering operational excellence in every aspect of our business.","Looking forward, we continue to expect that U.S. housing will follow a modest growth trajectory, which should ultimately support improved pricing across our commodity products. And with our businesses running well, we're well positioned to capture the full benefits of an improved housing environment. But as we continue to improve our operating performance and optimize our portfolio, we will also position the company to deliver superior value to our shareholders across the range of market conditions.","And now, I'd like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Thank you. Good morning, Russell. Good morning, Devin. How are you? Hi, Beth. Thanks for all the details. A couple of questions here and then we'll turn it over. First of all and this comes up periodically on the conference calls, why do you think at this juncture we haven't seen that expected uptick in Southern Timberlands pricing or timber pricing? Obviously, you're seeing a pick up in demand your outlook for next year is moderately positive in terms of housing. Canada has been having difficulty supplying logs into the U.S. Why are we seeing that uptick in your view? Any updated thoughts on Southern timber pricing here? And what we can expect looking out into 2020?","Devin Stockfish","Yeah. Sure, George. And I think I would note that we have seen an uptick in the first half of the year that really sort of translated all the way into Q3 on Southern sawlog prices. So we have seen a bit of an uptick this year. Now, candidly some of that had to do with the rain that we had in the first part of the year, the tension in some of the wood baskets, but I think we have seen some improvement year-over-year.","But ultimately, what it comes down to is supply and demand within the region, and this has been a long story in terms of getting the Southern sawlog prices up. But ultimately what gives us confidence that ultimately we are going to see the improvement is the improved capacity that we're seeing coming into the U.S. South 5.5 billion board feet of incremental capacity coming in. When we look at the wood baskets where the new mills have come in we have seen tensioning within those wood baskets. And as that capacity continues to come in and get online you see that tensioning effect.","Additionally, on the pulp side, we've seen a number of pellet mills come in. In fact, Enviva just broke ground on a new pellet mill in Mississippi. And so it takes time for each of those mills to come in, get up to speed and start taking logs. But again, as we've seen these mills come in, in the specific wood baskets where we've seen incremental capacity you see a tensioning effect. And over time that brings up the demand across the system.","The other thing I would just note is, over time we also think there is an opportunity for an export program to really develop out of the U.S. South. Pre-tariffs, we were really working to build up that program and making some good headway in terms of exporting logs out of the U.S. South. I think ultimately when the tariff dispute ultimately comes to resolution we're going to see that opportunity open back up. And so it takes time, it's been slower than we would have expected or like, but I think we're on the right trajectory over time.","George Staphos","Okay. Devin, I mean, relatedly and you're correct there has been a little bit of a bump this year, but certainly timber prices are nowhere where anyone would have expected a few years ago at least I don't think in the South or also where they are right now. The capacity that's gone in at 5.5 billion square feet few years ago, it was 3 billion square feet and 4 billion square feet. So you've seen more converting capacity go in. We haven't seen the price really lift. At this juncture, they just -- housing has been a little bit slower to come back and that is the reason why you haven't seen that tensioning.","And then relatedly -- and again, thanks for all the detail that you put in the slide deck, you have one of the best in the industry. It's kind of interesting how we've seen the Western Timberland EBITDA decline almost in half relative to where it was to begin 2018. From your vantage point, where are the big buckets? And what changes that trajectory over the next couple of periods and years? Is it really just trade getting back to normal, or is there something else in your view that would be helpful there.","Devin Stockfish ","Yeah. I think a couple of things on the Western market. Ultimately, the Western system is a very tensioned market. And so I think the biggest driver that you see in terms of Western log prices is what's going on with the Western lumber prices. And so when you have mills that see lumber prices reduce dramatically, there's a limit to how much they can pay for logs and keep those cash flow positive.","So I'd say that's been the biggest driver. There have been a couple of other things around the margins the trade dispute with China. We continue to ship logs to our customers in China, but I do think a number of other landowners in the Pacific Northwest have kept some of that supply in the domestic market.","A little bit around the margins, there were some wind damage in South Oregon. And so there's been a little bit to salvage activity there that's been a little bit of headwind down in that market, but overall the big driver has really just been Western lumber prices.","And so as we look forward sitting where we are today, we're moving into the rainy season here in the Pacific Northwest. In fact, last few weeks it has been pretty rainy up here, and that typically will take the non-industrial landowners out of the system. It will reduce log flow. And so provided that we can keep Western lumber prices at these levels or even get some uptick, I think that bodes well for improved log prices in the west.","George Staphos","Okay. Last quick one for me. Just timberland transactions have been again a little bit slow this year at least from our vantage point. What do you think if you grew the premise? And maybe you disagree, what do you think has been driving that? Thanks and good luck in the quarter.","Russell Hagen","Yeah, George, this is Russell. I'll take that question. I don't think much has changed since the last time we talked last quarter in the timberland's market. We're a little closer to be year-end. I think we've seeing about $750 million worth of transactions closed. As we look in the pipeline, there's probably another $750 million that will close.","So the full year we'll expect to see in the U.S. about $1.5 billion worth of transactions. That's definitely lower than kind of what we would expect on a run rate of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. That doesn't include any large transactions like the PotlatchDeltic transaction last year.","So definitely, we're a little lighter this year than I think we would have expected given what we've seen in prior years, but I really don't think that's a reflection on the market per se. I think it's just a timing issue.","There is still a lot of demand for quality timberlands, the transactions that are coming out get a lot of attention. And so I would expect to see us return to a more kind of normal run rate basis going forward.","George Staphos","All right. Thank you very much guys.","Devin Stockfish","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire","Hi. Good morning guys.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Maguire","Just a follow-up on those comments Russell and the prior comments just on the lower Western log price realizations. Why do you think that we haven't seen some of the Western land transaction prices come down some timber or the lower log price realization? Is it just not as tether to like current EBITDA and cash flows as a lot of other asset classes? Or do you think we're just seeing maybe lower interest rates and cap rates kind of offset the lower kind of EBITDA that you're getting of that land these days?","Russell Hagen","Brian, there's kind of two points. The first is, timberland values typically don't trade kind of correlated to log pricing. When you're going into acquire timberland asset you're thinking over a longer-term period of time than just the immediate log price dynamics. And so I think that's factored into the overall investment and valuations.","The second is in the West. As Devin mentioned, that's a very tensioned market. And part of that is the ownership structure is very different than say in the South. There's fewer private owners in the West, there's more federal and state ownership. And so, you really just don't have the same kind of number of available transactions in the market that you see in the South plus.","The West is really an excellent timber base. The trees are high valued Doug fir, primarily grown for a sawlog-type product. And so, they really are of a high value. And I think, again, as you see any Western timberlands come to market you're going to see a lot of demand, particularly of their high-quality timberlands.","Brian Maguire","Okay. I appreciate that. Just to switch over to wood products, just wondered if you could provide some comments and your thoughts on where inventory sits in the channel? And in light of some of the recent capacity closure announcement in both lumber and OSB now, any thoughts on if there's enough tension in the market, especially if the kind of recent starts activity continues?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. Well, starting off with the question on inventories in the channel, it's really been the story of the year. We've seen customers carrying relatively low inventories. I would say that's the case now, generally speaking, across the system, really in lumber, OSB and EWP, fairly lean inventories across the system.","And I think that's just a reflection of the fact that for the majority of the year, the supply has been adequate. So people can buy on an as-needed basis and that really has enforced people to carry material inventories. And so, that's currently the case.","What I would say from a broader perspective, I think, there is reason to believe that you're going to see some upward pricing pressure. We've seen a fair amount of curtailment activity over the course of this year, even some more announced just recently.","And importantly, we've seen the continued improvement in housing and importantly the single-family segment. And so, to us, to the extent that you see this building activity continue in the strong level that we've seen here of late and we can keep that going for a while longer before the winter weather sets in, combined with the capacity curtailments that have been announced, I think that really bodes well for pricing as we head into the end of the year.","But certainly, I would say, even and over and above that as we think about the 2020 building season, which is a little ways out, but it's always worth thinking about, I think we're setting up really well to have a materially different view next year on what pricing looks like and what 2019 look like.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks very much. I'll turn it over.","Devin Stockfish","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari","Just following up on Brian's question and maybe just zooming in on OSB, you do have a number of competitors that are taking curtailments. I think your production has kind of moved up over the course of the year.","I'm wondering if you can talk about where your operating rates are in OSB? Where do you think you may be on the cost curve? And just generally, how you're positioned in the OSB market, given there're some pretty significant regional differences I think that you talked about earlier?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. Sure. From an operating perspective, we're sort of in that mid to upper-90s percent range, which is more or less where we were in Q2 as well. And I think, at a high level it's important to remember when you're thinking about our OSB business.","Number one, we typically are a little bit more heavily weighted to the higher value products and so a little less of a participant in the commodity sheathing portion of the business. And I think importantly, we've been very, very focused on our cost structure and that's true across all of our manufacturing assets.","Certainly, that's the case in our OSB business as well. And so, to the extent that you've got higher-value products and you've got a lower cost structure, I think that's really what gives you the ability to continue to run and generate cash where that may not be the case for some others.","And that was certainly the case for us in OSB in Q3. We were cash flow positive in all of our mills in each of the months, except for one mill that had some scheduled maintenance downtime. And so, we're thoughtful about our operating posture, we're always looking to match our supply with profitable demand and generate appropriate returns over time. But, I think, as I mentioned, just the product mix and the cost structure give us a little bit more flexibility in that respect.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's really helpful. And then, you announced the Michigan sale during the quarter, I am wondering if there is any detail you can give us on that property in terms of species, age class earnings contribution relative to kind of the northern region timberlands that you have? And then, do you see further opportunities that are comparable, whether it's in the North or in other regions?","Russell Hagen","Yeah. Anthony, this is Russell. So we did announce the 555,000 acres sale to Lyme timber for $300 million at $540 an acre. And that represents our total Michigan ownership. We have a mix of hardwood logs and pulpwood, so we service both some saw milling and then also pulp activities up there and then there is also a softwood component. We're on target to close in the fourth quarter and so we're very pleased with the overall transaction and the outcome.","As far as other Northern Timberlands, I won't comment on specifics, but as we demonstrated, we continue to look at the portfolio. Our goal is to optimize the portfolio over time and the Michigan sale was part of that ongoing effort. So it's a key strategic driver of ours to make sure that we have the right mix of acres that will drive the highest return to the shareholders over time. So we're constantly looking at all of our regions and it's something we're always evaluating, both on the buy side and on the sell side.","So as part of that process, we're going to identify certain timberlands that may not be strategic for us and we'll act on those appropriately. And on the buy side, we can be very patient. We have 12 million acres. We're in every operating region in the United States. And so we can be patient and make sure that anything that we contemplate creates shareholder value over time.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Devin, good morning, Russ.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning, Mark.","Russell Hagen","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde","I'd like to just come back on that Michigan land. So Russell, can you just -- can help us at all thinking about the earnings impact from that sale? My own work would suggest it's about 20% to 25% of your land base, but as I understand, it's probably a bigger portion of the earnings in that segment?","Russell Hagen","Yeah, Mark, we don't break out the specific earnings in a segment. But you're right, it's about 25% of the total acres in the North. I think for context, last year we generated $19 million to $20 million of EBITDA out of the Northern Timberland operation. So that can kind of give you an idea of generally what the contribution was.","Mark Wilde","So you're saying the contribution last year would have only been about let's say $4 million?","Russell Hagen","Probably a little higher than that.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right. And just again to kind of come back on the issue of how Northern Timberland is identified, if we look at the South and the West, you're really a plantation forestry company and much of what you got kind of across the North is just kind of natural regeneration. So does that make the North different for you from kind of a strategy standpoint?","Russell Hagen","Mark as we've said in the past, our focus has definitely been kind of in the West and in the South. When you think of the North, it's -- the West it's pretty consistent I guess growing areas primarily Doug fir, primarily the sawlog outcome; in the South, it's Southern Yellow Pine, pine plantation. When you look in the North, we really have four distinct kind of areas. We have Montana and Michigan, Maine and then West Virginia and each one of them have distinct products, distinct customers, distinct strategies. And so, I would say that you do need to look at it on an individual kind of region basis in the North or in the North it's not as comparable clearly to the West or the South.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And the last one on the Northern Timberland, just we have a lot of carnage right now in the hardwood lumber business and I'm understanding some really underperforming properties on the timberland side in hardwood. What effect is that having on you? And also does that create any potential opportunities?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, Mark. This is Devin. No question, the China trade dispute has had a negative impact on the hardwood sawtimber market and I think you're seeing that really across the board. I think certainly as we think about going forward to the extent that the trade dispute can get resolved, I think that will be alleviated, but it's going to be some tough sledding in that market until that ultimately does happen. In terms of specific opportunities, I don't know that there is anything that we would highlight right now. We're watching the market across the board that's true both in the hardwood business and really the rest of our ownerships, so nothing specific to highlight on that right now.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then Devin just last one for me. Just over on the Wood Products side of your portfolio, we've been hearing for several months more positive commentary and results from the homebuilders but it really hasn't to this point kind of flowed through to the suppliers to the homebuilders. How do you interpret that?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, Mark. I think part of this earlier in the summer, when we really started to see a little bit of pickup in the activity was there was a bit of destocking. I think there was probably a bit more spec home inventory in the system that had to be worked through. And so not all of that pickup in activity really translated into actual Wood Products demand pull through.","I think you're starting to see that get more into balance. And as we see the starts activity and the new home sales activity continue to improve that should have more pull through. The other thing I think that's been really hard in terms of dialing in the supply-demand dynamic is with all of the curtailment activity that we've seen that introduces noise into the system.","And so when you see some of these mills take indefinite or permanent shutdowns, there is an inventory flushing that typically occurs in the system. And I think that's part of what we saw in Q3 as some of these mills closed down and we're really eliminating the inventory.","You probably saw a little bit more of that flushing through that had a bit of a dampening effect on pricing. But ultimately there is no question as we continue to see housing improve and if this trend continues which we think it will that ultimately will result in more Wood Products demand. And you combine that with the curtailment activity, put the noise aside that will be I think a positive for commodity pricing across the board.","Mark Wilde","Yes. It definitely looks like it when we look at these SPF prices the last couple of weeks Devin. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Devin Stockfish","Yes, thanks, Mark.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. One or two follow ups. First just on the Michigan sale, so you've got $250 million on assets for sale you're selling it for $300 million. So can we conclude it's a $50 million gain on that sale? And I assume that's not included in any of your guidance, so I assume you're going to take that out as a non-recurring item when you report for the fourth quarter?","Russell Hagen","Yes Mark. That's correct.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And then there has been some chatter about opening federal forests to logging. Any perspectives on the likelihood of that happening and\/or potential impact if it were to?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, Mark. Honestly, I don't think we're overly concerned about that. There are a lot of impediments to rapidly increasing logging of federal land, the litigation environment, frankly the capacity in the system to do that. So it's not something that we're particularly concerned about. I think even if we do see a little bit of an uptick it's not going to have a material impact on any of our businesses.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And then lastly, obviously, this year the tax rate has been pretty unusual. Kind of on a go-forward basis is there a formula or way that we should be thinking about? Does it go back to the way it used to be or is there kind of a different way to be thinking about the tax rate for 2020 as well?","Russell Hagen","Mark, the provision for income tax is this year has been primarily driven by the performance in the TRS and primarily Wood Products performance. As you're aware, we calculate the estimated annual tax rate on a consolidated basis, so combining the REIT and tax for REIT subsidiary, because we don't pay taxes on the REIT income. We get a lot of volatility in the effective tax rate, particularly when the other proportion of earnings between the REIT and the TRS changes, which is really what you're seeing this year.","So, as we've said, the fourth quarter rate is going to be highly dependent on Wood Products pricing just as a function of that proportion. I think as we come into 2020, we should start seeing that tax rate normalize as we have improved performance, particularly in the Wood Products operations.","Mark Weintraub","So is it fair to basically use zero on the timber earnings and 20%-or-so for whatever we estimate the TRS might be which will be largely the Wood Products business?","Russell Hagen","Yes. I mean, we don't pay tax coming out of the REIT. So on the TRS, probably more of an all-in rate of around 25%. Again we'll provide guidance in February when we update our guidance for 2020 for you.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, super. Thank you.","Russell Hagen","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Russell Hagen","Good morning, Collin","Devin Stockfish","Good morning, Collin.","Collin Mings","First question for me. Just, Devin, going back to your prepared remarks on the Japan market, can you just maybe expand on the demand trends you're seeing there? It looks like wooden construction starts actually fell there year-over-year in August? And then with the consumption tax increase, it would just be helpful if we could get your latest read on that market and maybe how you expect that to evolve?","Devin Stockfish","Yeah, sure. Yeah, I think the important thing for us when we think about the Japan housing market is the post and beam market. And so that really is where our product feeds into the construction activity and that's been up 1% year-to-date. And so that has remained a pretty strong market for us. Our customers in Japan have had steady demand and we continue to see that.","I think as you think over time the one piece that is always a little bit of a variable is just with currency. That market is served by European supply and U.S. supply. But our customers are doing well. They have had strong demand, good activity there. And so we're seeing good solid activity into that market and anticipate that continuing.","Collin Mings","Okay, thank you. And then switching to real estate, Russell just given some of the recent headlines in both Florida and Maine as it relates to warehouse or in zoning, can you maybe just update us on your thoughts on how important pursuing entitlement is in select markets to your strategy of creating value and extracting a premium to core timberland?","Russell Hagen","Sure. So specific to the Florida headline that's a relatively small development area. It's been about 1,700 acres. We've been pursuing entitlement over a number of years. As you're aware, the entitlement process can be a bit of a bumpy road. And so I think that's really what you're saying, but that really is not a significant contributor to our overall performance on the overall real estate program.","As far as Maine, we completed that entitlement back in 2012. Since that time, we really haven't seen that market materialize for development. And so we're opting to seek to convert that back into timberlands and manage it on a sustainable basis like we manage all of our timberlands. Again that really isn't a significant contributor to the overall real estate performance going forward.","As far as the entitlement, I mean it's a relatively low cost way of taking properties up the value curve. And so we're seeing opportunity to entitle a property and then divest it to a developer or another party, we're going to pursue that and we think through every one of our opportunities pretty clear understanding that it just takes time, but ultimately we're trying to seek the highest value for those lands that we've identified for development outcomes and then also for HBU sales.","Collin Mings","Got it. So it sounds like again it will be basically a selective process of what you actually decide to pursue as far as the entitlement front. But I guess to your point, it's relatively low cost way of maybe adding some value in some select markets, is that fair?","Russell Hagen","Yeah that's fair. Again it is very -- it\u2019s a relatively small subset of our overall AVO portfolio. And again it's a low cost way of taking that property up the value curve.","Collin Mings","Okay. Thank you, Russell.","Russell Hagen","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly","Just a couple of things. How much of the additional saw milling capacity that's still to come in the south is in places where it's going to have a direct impact on you? My recollection is that we've already seen a pretty good portion of what's going to hit you directly, is that right?","Devin Stockfish","Yeah. I think as you think about the 5.5 billion board feet that are coming in, I would say we're good way down the path on that starting up operations, and it's differential as you mentioned by region. I think there are still a few mills that are coming in that will have an impact on us others less so. But generally speaking, we have operations in all major wood baskets. And so we may be a little bit more heavily weighted to some states versus the other, but there will be some impact really across the board in each of those new mills coming into place.","Mark Connelly","Okay. That's helpful. And just one last thing. Russell, you mentioned that buyers are still limiting inventory and we're clearly seeing that. Last quarter you characterized the inventory level as fairly normal. Would you still say it's relatively normal or is it starting to get lower?","Devin Stockfish","Yeah. Just to clarify, are you talking about within the Wood Products channel?","Mark Connelly","Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry. Yeah.","Devin Stockfish","Yeah. I would say that they are still relatively lean across the system and that's true for lumber OSB and EWP.","Mark Connelly","Super. Thank you.","Devin Stockfish","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon","Yes, good morning Devin, Russell and Beth. Thanks for all the details.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning.","Chip Dillon","First question is -- I will say that our base case is that the Wood Products business will certainly not be as good as it was last year, but better than this year, next year and that should allow you to pretty much cover your dividend just with cash flow. But I am encouraged and just want to make sure I'm on the right path. It's about $1 billion a year at the current rate, and it looks like if I'm doing my numbers right that you are probably three quarters of the way there not that this is how we should look at it, but with the Michigan sale, the last tranche of the variable entity payment next year that gives us $302 million. You mentioned $90 million I think you're looking for from 2018 in terms of a tax refund. So I add that up, and I'm in the $700 million range. My question is what is the refund that you're looking to get for the overpayment this year?","Russell Hagen","For this overpayment, it's about $40 million to $45 million.","Chip Dillon","Okay. And I take it, the path, I just went down is the right way to look at things that. You're looking at north of $700 million of inflows from all these activities?","Russell Hagen","Yes. It's correct.","Chip Dillon","Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then just shifting gears, I noticed two of the businesses that six, seven years ago that seem to really be struggling had -- basically were the bright spots of the quarter from one I can tell, and that of course would be the distribution business and especially engineered wood products. And I didn't know if there is anything unusual in this quarter or if we should sort of hang our hat on how well these businesses are performing? I note that both can receive certain cost benefits from the timing of raw material changes. So, I didn't know, for example, the low OSB prices were boosting EWP unusually and maybe the same in distribution if you had inventory gains?","Devin Stockfish","Yeah. I would say there is always a minor benefit when OSB prices go down to our EWP business, because the web stock is one of the products that goes into the end-use. But I would say at a higher level, this is the case really across all of our manufacturing businesses. We have been doing a lot of work to improve our operating performance and to improve our cost structure, and that's true in EWP. It's true in our distribution business. And although we've seen product pricing a bit challenging this year, I would say that's equally true for lumber and OSB. These businesses are operating as well as they ever have, and that has been a really important focus for us in our overall business strategy.","And so, you're seeing that now. I think as we alluded to earlier, when the businesses are operating well and we're continuing to prove -- improve every day. When we do see an uptick in the housing activity and the commodity prices, we're really well positioned to generate a lot of value from these assets.","Chip Dillon","Great. Thank you very much.","Devin Stockfish","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Please go ahead.","Steve Chercover","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning.","Steve Chercover","Just a quick one on OSB. I mean I have a sense that your system is low cost, and I'm just wondering is that due to your fiber baskets in which you operate, the equipment or maybe the proximity to markets? And I understand that you are making some premium products.","Devin Stockfish","Yeah. What I would really attribute that to you is all of the work that we've done to improve efficiencies, improve recovery, the operating performance, the continued focus on cost generally. I mean amongst our various manufacturing assets, some are maybe a little bit better located relative to fiber than others. I wouldn't say that in and of itself is the key driver, it's really just been the continued focus on improving our operations and keeping a very tight control on cost. And that ultimately has been the big driver for us.","Steven Chercover","Okay. And then in honor of the World Series, I've got a curveball for you. And it does kind of center on control. So in Oregon you have an office manager who stole $4.5 million from you over 15 years. And I assume it's an isolated incident. But are you putting in safeguards to ensure that this can't happen again?","Devin Stockfish","Yeah. Well as you can imagine, this case is currently under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney. So there is a limited amount we can really comment on. But what I would say is, it's very disappointing.","The employee obviously no longer works for us. We've instituted appropriate controls to ensure that this doesn't happen again. And so, that's really what we can say there, very disappointing situation.","Steven Chercover","Okay, thanks a lot.","Devin Stockfish","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Today's final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Quinn","Yeah thanks and good morning guys.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning.","Paul Quinn","Just a question on U.S. South log pricing, and Devin you mentioned that the 5.5 billion board feet of lumber capacity adds. When I take a look at WWPA data on South production, over the last 5.5 years, it's kind of up 3.5 billion board feet. So, just wondering where that disconnect?","Is that two billion, expected to come over the next couple of years? And what's your -- Weyerhaeuser has done a number of upgrades. What I'm hearing from other companies is that, it's taking longer in the sawmill ramp ups to get to the design capacity. Have you experienced the same thing?","Devin Stockfish","Yeah. You know I think the important thing to remember on that, 5.5 billion is that announced capacity. And so that's just been coming in tranches over the last several years. And we still have a little bit left to go.","And to your point, once you actually commission a sawmill to the point where it's running full, and you start adding the second shift that's a process that can take six to 12 months frankly.","And so, we've seen certain of our competitors that have put in mills. And it can take a little longer at times. I will say for our two mills in particular Millport and Dierks, we've actually done a really nice job in getting those mills up the start-up curve.","Ultimately that will add around 300 million board feet of incremental capacity to those two mills. And so, it's a complex process to get mills up and running, after you get them started. And really get them fully operational. And that does take some time.","But we're confident that all of that, 5.5 billion is ultimately going to come in. This is one of the best wood baskets to manufacture lumber certainly in North America, if not the world. And so, we think that's going to continue to happen here in the near-term.","Paul Quinn","All right, best of luck. Thanks.","Devin Stockfish","All right, thank you.","Devin Stockfish","All right, well I think that was the last question. So I'll just say thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. And thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. And have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Weyerhaeuser Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Thank you.","I now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior VP of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am.","Denise Merle","Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s second quarter 2014 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com, our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website.","On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Denise and good morning everyone. Weyerhaeuser delivered a solid earnings performance in the second quarter driven by very strong results in each of our businesses and reflecting our employees\u2019 relentless focus on operational excellence.","This morning we reported second quarter net earnings of $280 million or $0.47 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $2 billion. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we earned $234 million or $0.40 per diluted share. This is an increase of nearly 65% compared with the first quarter and almost 30% compared with one year ago.","Special items in the quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to the post retirement health plan and restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions.","Earnings associated with Weyerhaeuser real-estate company RICO are being reported as discontinued operations as a result of the divestiture of that business on July 7. I would like to thank the Weyerhaeuser and RICO employees for their hard work in completing this transaction.","As part of the RICO transaction, we retired nearly 59 million common shares worth over $1.9 billion. These retirements which will be reflected in our third quarter share count more than offset the common shares issued in conjunction with last year\u2019s Longview Timber acquisition.","I will begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about market conditions. Severe winter weather earlier this year dampened the start of the spring building season and the U.S. housing market recovery remained sluggish with total housing start up only 6% in the first half of 2014 compared with 2013.","Rising employment and strong consumer confidence support our expectation of further housing market improvements. However, we have lowered our 2014 housing outlook as a result of the weaker market during the first half of the year and are now planning for between 1 million and 1.1 million starts.","The bottom line is we believe that residential housing markets will continue to improve but at a slower rate than it had been previously anticipated.","Let me now turn to our business segments starting with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands posted another outstanding quarter contributing $170 million to earnings. In the West, we experienced steady demand in our domestic markets, our realizations from Western domestic logs declined.","Although overall Chinese demand softened somewhat during the quarter as a result of elevated inventory to support our sales volumes to our customers increased compared with the first quarter and our pricing remained comparable. As anticipated, Japanese demand weakened in the second quarter due to the effect of the increased consumption tax.","Western logging and road cost increased seasonally as we log our higher elevations in the summer months when snow is not present. We remain extremely pleased with the performance of our Longview Timber acquisition which contributed $51 of EBITDA in the quarter.","In the South, sea harvest volumes declined due to wet weather and log prices rose by approximately 1% compared with the first quarter. Second quarter also included $24 million from dispositions of non-strategic Timberlands an increase of $20 million compared with the first quarter.","The Timberlands segment continues to benefit from operational excellence initiatives including reduction and stomp to customer logging cost and increased extraction of export quality logs.","Wood products charts 6 and 7, wood products earned $102 million in the second quarter, an improvement of nearly 60% compared with the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $132 million compared with $93 million in the first quarter and sales volumes increased seasonally across all our product lines.","In lumber, EBITDA improved by $9 million as high sales volumes due to improved weather and seasonality were partially offset by lower average price realizations. Lumber manufacturing costs continued to decline as a result of our operational excellence initiative which are focused on lowering our costs net of logs.","In OSB, EBITDA was flat as lower realizations were offset by growth and enhanced products and improved productivity. Results for engineered wood products improved significantly compared with first quarter as EBITDA increased nearly fourfold to $30 million.","Sales volumes increased more than 25% for solid section products and nearly 40% for TGI Joists, and average realizations for both products rose slightly.","The business also benefited from lower manufacturing costs compared with the prior quarter as a result of operational excellence initiatives and the successful ramp-up of the evergreen Alabama mill.","Our distribution business reported EBITDA of $3 million in the second quarter, an improvement of $8 million. The business remains focused on lowering cost and improving sales and margins. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the progress that our engineered wood products and distribution businesses made against their operational excellence targets in the quarter.","Cellulose fibers, chart 8 and 9, cellulose fibers earned $91 million, a substantial increased compared with $54 million in the first quarter. Fluff realizations were strong and maintenance cost declined due to fewer schedule maintenance outage dates. The business had another excellent quarter operationally and set a year-to-date record for productivity.","Discontinued operations, chart 11. As I indicated in my opening remarks, results from our real-estate business are now reported as discontinued operations. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings of $22 million from discontinued operations compared with $10 million in the first quarter. The improvement was primarily due to a seasonal increase in home closings.","At the end of the second quarter, we clearly identified all planned cost reductions associated with our SG&A initiative. Implementation is ongoing and we incurred an additional $6 million of restructuring charges in the quarter relating to this initiative. I\u2019m highly confident we will reach our $75 million run rate reduction target by the end of the year.","I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our third quarter outlook.","Patty Bedient","Thanks Doyle, and good morning everybody. The housing recovery thus far in 2014 has been slower than anticipated. However, this week\u2019s better than expected forecast on GDP growth for the remainder of the year was welcome news.","The outlook for the third quarter earnings is summarized on chart 12, and I\u2019ll begin my comments with Timberlands.","In the west, export log realizations and volumes are expected to decline as a result of normal seasonal softening. The Japan market is normally weaker during the summer months as a result of rainy weather. In addition to the normal seasonality, the Japanese lumber market has been adversely affected by the implementation of the consumption tax increase. High log inventories at Chinese courts will also likely result in lower demand and prices.","Domestic log markets are anticipated to be weaker as well during the third quarter. Softer export markets combined with the increased supply of logs that typically come to market during the third quarter from the smaller non-industrial private land owners who do not have adequate road systems to harvest on year round basis are expected to exert downward pressure on prices.","As a result in anticipation of the softer markets in the third quarter, we intentionally accelerated harvest into the first half of this year. For these reasons, we anticipate a lower fee harvest in the west in the third quarter compared to the second.","Supply constraints as a result of fire related logging restrictions could result in some upward price pressure in certain markets especially in Oregon. In the third quarter we also expect seasonal increases in western road costs.","In the south, we expect that fee harvest will increase as some harvest in the second quarter was delayed due to wet weather. In addition, we typically perform more of our spending activity on the third quarter, which increases volumes and lowers the average realizations due to mix. We are also anticipating higher cost due to seasonal increase in silvicultural activities.","Earnings from non-strategic land sales should also decrease compared to the higher levels of the second quarter. We expect that overall earnings in our Timberland segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second but comparable to the third quarter of last year.","In wood products, we expect that sales realizations will be down slightly for both lumber and OSB with relatively consistent volumes. Sales realizations for engineered lumber will be up as a result of price increases that were effective as of the beginning of this quarter.","Engineered lumber volumes could be somewhat lower due to orders that may have been called forward into the second quarter as a result of the announced price increase.","Log cost in the west should decrease in the quarter and also in Canada to a larger extent. Housing demand has been more muted than expected, however our inventories continue to be in great shape across our system. And our continued focus on cost reduction and operating efficiencies continues to benefit all businesses. We expect that earnings in the third quarter in the wood product segment will be comparable to the second quarter.","In Cellulose Fibers, global softwood inventories as beginning of this quarter were in good shape at a couple of days below normal. We do see some softening in paper grade especially into China and we expect that inventory levels will return to normal during the quarter.","Fluff demand globally remains healthy and our order books are full. The most significant change in our Cellulose Fibers business in the third quarter will be an extended planned outage at our Longview liquid packaging operation. We will be completing a number of capital improvements that have been planned for some time. These include upgrades to the press section, evaporators, digester and head-box.","The improvements will lower energy and fiber costs and increase the quality of the board and product mix. Although the outage will result in increased maintenance cost, our sales volumes will be only somewhat lower as we have been building inventory in anticipation of this outage and we have had excellent year-to-date operating reliability.","In addition to the liquid packaging outage, we will also have increased plan maintenance in our port mill system compared to the second quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in our sale of fiber segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and more comparable to the first quarter of this year.","Our real-estate results have been restated for all periods to show RICO operations has discontinued. At the end of the second quarter, our balance sheet was grossed up for funds RICO borrowed in anticipation of the transaction. Both the cash and the debt are included in discontinued operations as of June 30 and were eliminated after the end of the quarter when the divestiture was completed.","As previously announced, we closed the divestiture on July 7. As a result, our share count was reduced by approximately 59 million shares bringing our current share count to just under 530 million. In addition, we received over $700 million in cash. Our third quarter results will show a gain on the divestiture of approximately $1 billion.","Chart 10 summarizes the unallocated items for the second quarter. In the third quarter we expect that we will once again have a special item for the pretax gain of approximately $45 million related to an earlier post retirement health plan amendment which we are amortizing ratably over the year.","Other ongoing unallocated items are difficult to forecast, as they are driven by changes in foreign exchange, share price and inventory levels.","Chart 13 summarizes certain financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $845 million, an increase of almost $70 million. There was no change to our long-term debt of just under $4.9 billion and we have no maturities until 2017.","As of the end of the second quarter, we had year-to-date capital expenditures including reforestation of $159 million and we still expect the total for the year to approximate $400 million.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Patty. Through the RICO divestiture and Longview Timber acquisition we have positioned Weyerhaeuser as a focused force products company with a productive asset base and significant runway for earnings growth and cash generation.","Our strong second quarter results reflect our employee\u2019s commitment to operational excellence. And we remain focused on driving superior returns from our assets to generate value for our shareholders. Thank you.","And now I would like to open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi","Good morning.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Anthony.","Patty Bedient","Good morning.","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi","I had a couple of questions in Wood Products. In engineered wood products it looks like you\u2019ve got $20 million of EBITDA improvement year-to-date. And I believe that you had the $30 million to $40 million target for the year. And given the progress thus far, do you feel like maybe you\u2019ll be at the top end of that range?","Is there maybe potential upside to that target? And then, also for the three main businesses within wood products, I was wondering if you could share what your operating rates were in the quarter?","Doyle Simons","So, let\u2019s start with your first question and in our ELP business, Anthony, we were very encouraged by the progress we made in the quarter. As you referenced, we went from $8 million of EBITDA to $30 million, from $8 million of EBITDA in the first quarter to $30 million of EBITDA in the second quarter.","Also as you referenced, our commitment was to improve EBITDA in that business by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013. And we think we\u2019re well on the way to doing that, that\u2019s the commitment we\u2019re going to work to get as much earnings out of that business as we can get in 2014. And like I said, we\u2019re encouraged about the progress we made to date.","In terms of operating rates, if you will start with lumber, lumber operating rates were in the low 90%. OSB, was approximately 90% and then ELP overall and as you know that the mixture of products was in mid-70s in terms of operating rates for that business.","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just a follow-up maybe on Cellulose Fibers. The project in liquid packaging board, is that going to result in any material increase in capacity or is it just a cost measure?","Patty Bedient","Anthony, the most important part of that project is cost reduction and quality improvement. We will get some increased capacity maybe in the around 10% range but that project really was done to lower our energy and our fiber cost and as I said improved the product quality.","Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research","Thank you. Just following up a little bit on the liquid packaging and the Cellulose Fibers, can you give us a sense as to roughly how much the outages, are going to impact the third quarter relative to the second quarter?","Doyle Simons","Sure Mark. As we indicated in the comments, we anticipate earnings will be lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter in Cellulose Fiber. And that is primarily if not wholly driven by the outages.","Just to quantify it a little bit, we think the Longview liquid packaging outage will result in roughly $30 million of the impact. And as we also said we have additional outages compared to the prior quarter in our port mills. And that would be another $5 million to $10 million impact on the third quarter versus the second quarter.","Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research","Great. And then, is it fair to say that when you come out of it the other end, you not only get that back but presumably from the project, picking the liquid packaging, you hopefully have even higher earnings power assuming pricing and markets are similar. And any way to give us a feel for the type of returns or earning enhancement that you might get from the project?","Doyle Simons","Well, as Patty alluded to Mark, the project will do three things, improve quality, lower cost and then have roughly 10%, over time it will take a little bit time to get there but 10% improvement in production. So, all those things will factor in. We won\u2019t provide a specific number but clearly the reason for doing that project is to drive additional earnings in cash out of our liquid packaging board operation.","Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research","Okay. Thank you and congratulations for the evidence of continued operational improvement.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Yes, good morning Doyle and congratulations on a great quarter.","Doyle Simons","Thanks Chip.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","I wanted to ask you about distribution, I know that it seemed like in the first quarter hadn\u2019t really turned much of a quarter but on the numbers I see here, it looks like you went from something like $16 million EBITDA loss from the first half of \u201813 to $2 million loss in the first half of \u201814.","So, it may not be \u2013 it may not have arrived yet, but it looks like if the needle is moving in the right direction, do you still think you\u2019ll get to your goals for the year or have your feelings about the business changed any in the last three to six months?","Doyle Simons","So, we\u2019re very encouraged about the progress we\u2019ve made in distribution Chip. And as you will recall, the objective there is to improve earnings about $30 million to $40 million. In that business versus 2013, we think we\u2019re absolutely on track to do that. I can tell you there is a real focus on continuing to grow profitable share, making sure our cost are at the target levels.","And I\u2019ll just tell you we\u2019re encouraged as now more than half of our sites are in fact profitable and we see more and more of those becoming profitable as we move forward. So again very \u2013 lots of work to do as you mentioned but very encouraged by the progress that\u2019s been made over the past couple of quarters.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Okay. And then on the $1 billion gain on RICO, is the early tax impact on that that we should anticipate in the third quarter?","Patty Bedient","No Chip, that transaction as we talked about was done in a reverse more structure. And that is one of the benefits of that structure is there is a tax on that gain.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","I see, and then lastly, just on the dividend at this point, I would imagine with $700 million plus coming in from RICO and with the strong results and I know the third quarter is not going to be quite a repeat. But with the lower share count, is that something that you guys are thinking about in the near-term in terms of bringing?","Doyle Simons","So, Chip, as we previously disclosed, we\u2019re going to be visiting with our board in mid-August regarding the dividend, potentially use of cash proceeds and those types of things. Just to remind you and everybody else, as we think about capital allocation and what our financial priorities are, as you know, first and foremost is returning cash to shareholders primarily through a growing dividend but also about share repurchase where appropriate.","Second, is investing our business to high return projects. And then, just as you heard on sale this morning, then improved cost structure and our margin and of course we\u2019ll also look for opportunities to grow our business through value creating acquisitions. Again, an example there would be Longview.","And then, finally, making sure we maintain the appropriate capital structure. And as you know we\u2019re in good shape on that front. So that\u2019s the way we think about it and again we\u2019ll read back to you in mid-August.","Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners","Thank you.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS","Hi, good morning.","Patty Bedient","Good morning, Gail.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Gail.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS","Maybe going back to engineered wood for a little bit, the volume growth that you had relative to the comments about housing maybe not picking up as quickly as you thought and given how much engineered wood is driven by housing. I mean, what do you think of your volumes, were you picking up share, was there an inventory build or do you think that volume has actually been used?","Doyle Simons","I think there are a couple of things that were happening. Or I\u2019m guessing there were a couple of things that were happening there. I think first as we mentioned Gail, there is a price increase going into effect, and first is third quarter. So, I think there might have been some pull forward in terms of buying in the second quarter versus the third quarter. So I think that\u2019s part of the equation.","I will also tell you as I mentioned earlier, we had a very focused sales effort in that business and I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making there. So, I think our sales folks did a really good job of growing profitable share in that business in the second quarter as well.","Patty Bedient","And Gail, as Doyle referenced in his remarks, we did bring up the ever green Alabama facility so all of our engineered wood products facilities now are operating. And so that came up starting shipping product in May so we\u2019ll have it for the full quarter in the third quarter.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS","Okay. And going, and looking at Cellulose Fiber, was there anything in the second quarter result that you wouldn\u2019t view as sustainable, I mean, I was wondering, it is your best quarter since 2011, pricing reported didn\u2019t move dramatically. I\u2019m just wondering, kind of what you think of that upside?","Patty Bedient","Well, probably the thing that drove the upside the most was just outstanding operational performance across the Cellulose Fibers system. And I think that all of the hard work that they\u2019ve been doing is paying off and I would look to that being sustainable and repeatable as we go forward.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS","Okay. And looking at the Japanese market, I guess what trends did you see moving through the quarter obviously the tax went up at the start of the quarter? Were things still getting worse or they\u2019re stable, just how do you see that market?","Patty Bedient","Are you talking primarily on logs?","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS","The logs market, yes.","Patty Bedient","So, we had thought that it would be impacted we started to see some impact in the second quarter and that continued into the third quarter. It\u2019s a little difficult to tell for sure because as I mentioned, the third quarter is normally seasonally weaker. But I think the latest news that we\u2019ve heard just earlier this week was that the Japanese government is thinking that the impact of the consumption task, now this is broadly was not as significant as many once thought. And that it is starting to come up and they see more activity towards the second half of the year. But we\u2019ll have to see. But certainly it is softer in the third quarter.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS","Okay. And just one last question, your Timberlands guidance for the quarter, can you give the sense of what type of land sale activity might be incorporated in that?","Doyle Simons","So, share it.","Patty Bedient","It\u2019s about \u2013 it will be lower than the second quarter as we mentioned, it will probably be somewhere around $8 million to $10 million lower than the second quarter.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you. Good morning everyone.","Doyle Simons","Good morning Alex.","Patty Bedient","Good morning.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Couple of questions, starting off, engineered wood products. Can you put a little bit more meat around how much you think pre-buy may have contributed to the volume number in the second quarter? I guess we\u2019re now through July kind of looking at how the divine trends were in EWP in July. Does that sort of give you any incremental insight into how much pre-buy there was in the second quarter?","Doyle Simons","Well, it is always difficult to assess pre-buy, I would tell you our activity in the month of July continued to be good. So, I would tell you there are some \u2013 there clearly was some pre-buy in the month, in the second quarter. But we didn\u2019t see just a dramatic fall-off in July so we continue to be encouraged by those markets and our sales efforts in those markets.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful Doyle. And then, when you talk about share, so taking share in the EWP, is that again just traditional lumber or would that be against other players in the EWP market?","Doyle Simons","And again, it\u2019s hard to know exactly what happens on shares because we don\u2019t see all the different information. But really what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about profitable growth is just growing the ELP business overall. And there are some coming out of saw logs maybe but that\u2019s not specifically what we\u2019re talking \u2013 when I say I didn\u2019t mean all of it, some of it coming out of lumber, possibly but that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re referring to.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, understood. And then, just one last one, Patty, on the corporate line, just from a modeling perspective, so, is it really just zero to minus 5 an then everything else is kind of noise around like you said currency and inventories and some of the other things as well on that line?","Patty Bedient","Yes, Alex, as I mentioned, it is difficult to forecast. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why when we put this information together we\u2019ve started putting that chart 10 together for you just so you can see what it looks like in the number of things that move around. So, if for us, the foreign exchange really is a function of the Canadian exchange rate. So as that moves, our share based comp certainly you can track that with the stock price.","And then, there are just a whole lot of other stuff that goes in there. This quarter, and as we go forward, the other thing that we are focused on is lowering our G&A but we will have some costs on a go forward basis that were historically allocated to the RICO business. And we are focused on making those costs lower as well. But you may see some choppiness as a result of that as we work through the G&A cost.","Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay, got you. All right, thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Patty Bedient","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good morning, Doyle, good morning, Patty.","Patty Bedient","Good morning, Mark.","Doyle Simons","Good morning Mark. Good to hear you.","Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Good to be here. I wondered if you guys could talk a little bit about just this shift that we\u2019ve seen over the last year and where your log exports are going because it\u2019s been a pretty marked drop off in the proportion of the volume that goes to Japan and about a 20% to 40% in terms of the growth in what\u2019s going to China?","Patty Bedient","Sure Mark. It really is a function of not Japan getting smaller but the China market growing. And so, as you think about the percentage of the pie to those markets, it moves around. What we\u2019re really focused on is growing the pie, and Japan continues to be an extremely good market and important market to us. But what\u2019s moving that really is more growth in the China market in terms of incremental growth.","Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","And Patty, does that, should that change sort of your average just realization in your export log prices, because my understanding is always that China doesn\u2019t buy as high priced of log as what goes into the Japanese market?","Patty Bedient","Yes, that\u2019s fair Mark. From a mixed perspective, you will see the average realization come down. But you will still see a spread between the specific China log compared to the Japanese log.","Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Yes. And how would you think about that spread right now?","Patty Bedient","It\u2019s closing a little bit but they\u2019re both \u2013 both of them have come down in the quarter as we talked about. So I don\u2019t know that the spread is changing all that much.","Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Just a couple of other quick ones. Doyle can you talk a little bit about how you would think about both investments and\/or acquisitions outside of Timberlands, say in the Wood Products area? And then can you give us a little color on that joint venture you announced with Pioneer?","Doyle Simons: Okay. In terms of the way we look at acquisition opportunities in wood products, Mark. We will, as we\u2019ve said, we would be interested in potentially growing our wood products business but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined. We\u2019re not going to grow those businesses just for the sake of growing. And if we find one-off opportunities that something we would consider, but our primary focus in our wood products business is we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s just running on what we have better. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing every day.","Patty Bedient","Mark, I think you\u2019re referencing the licensing that we did on some of our technology IP international intellectual property. And I think it\u2019s an important recognition of the importance and the strength of our intellectual property. But I will tell you that it\u2019s not a meaningful increase in terms of our quarterly results.","Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Okay. Very good. That\u2019s helpful. Good luck in the second half of the year.","Patty Bedient","Thank you.","Doyle Simons","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA","Thank you. To follow on Mark\u2019s question, so the market in Asia for logs is moving in the direction that you said last quarter you thought it would. Does that change the way you think about your Timberland mix?","Over the years, obviously Weyerhaeuser bulked up on higher value species and got rid of a lot of the lower value, Hemlock and other lower value stuff. So, are we likely to see Weyerhaeuser maybe attempt to move that shift back to owning or being more willing to own lower value species in the Pacific Northwest?","Patty Bedient","Well, Mark, we are focused primarily on Douglas Fir, that is what our most of our lands are best suited to grow. We do have some Whitewoods as well. And so, as you know, not every acre grows best the same species. So I would say we will continue to have a focus on Douglas Fir but our Whitewoods inventory will be important as well. Although it does come at a lower price point based on the quality.","Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA","Okay. And then a second question, you\u2019ve said that you have catch up investing to do, particularly in Wood Products. When do you think you will have caught up? Will that happen this year or next? And what do you think of as normal spending in manufacturing and maintenance, once that catch up is done?","Doyle Simons","So, Mark, we\u2019re spending a lot of time working on capital issues currently. We will, as always once we make some decisions for next year, either late this year or early next year we will be passing those on to you.","It will take more than one year period to get our \u2013 to make the investments in some of our wood product operations that we need to, to get our cost structure to where we want it to be.","And as you know, that\u2019s the real focus of the investment we\u2019re going to make going forward is to continue to drive down our cost structure in order to fully accomplish the OpEx initiatives that we laid out. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. And as we develop more detail, we will be sharing that with you.","Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA","Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America","Thanks, hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I guess my first question I wanted to go back to distribution. And Doyle recognizing there were a number of factors that you had mentioned in past, that you were focused on in terms of improving the profitability.","Were there one or two key things that you did this quarter better as a business than you did first quarter or second quarter last year that drove the swing in profitability? And could you comment to those things?","Doyle Simons","Sure, sure George. And it really is, when you step back and look at it, it\u2019s getting the focus where it needs to be and just doing the blocking and tackling better. But just a couple of things that I would highlight is, we set very specific targeted cost levels that we needed to accomplish in our distribution business to get \u2013 start to get earnings to where they needed to be. And we made significant progress towards those target levels in the second quarter.","And then the other thing I would say is, while we\u2019ve been successful in driving the top-line in that business as I referred, we haven\u2019t always had a focus on driving what I call a profitable share. And I think our folks did a really nice job of growing business that added profit to the bottom line in the quarter. So, those are the two specific things that I would highlight occurred in the quarter.","Again more work to do but really encouraged about the progress that we\u2019re making in distribution and our folks have done a lot of really good work in that business.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America","In terms of the runway, is it going to be more on the cost side or is it going to be more on what you\u2019ve got on the racks and can sell? I mean where do you get the further uplift from here, if you had to pick between those two?","Doyle Simons","Normally I\u2019m not ambiguous as you know George. But I would tell you, it\u2019s absolutely both. We have to pull both those levers to get to where we need to get to. So I think there is, opportunities both on the cost side and making sure we get the turns right, making sure we have the right products that our customers need. So lots of levers to pull in that business and we\u2019re going to need to pull everyone (inaudible) we are.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. Thanks for that. Doyle, in terms of the Longview board machine, I seem to remember that machine\u2019s maybe had some operating difficulties in the last couple of years. Now clearly you\u2019re going to improve productivity, you\u2019re going to improve cost and you need a little bit of throughput out of this as well.","But how much of this was driven by the fact that maybe the machine had been a little bit less reliable in terms of quality over the last few years? And can you explain a little more in terms of what was behind that?","Doyle Simons","So, let me give my view point of probably little more short time and I\u2019ll let Patty expand on it. But again, I\u2019m just telling you, this facility has run really well, and Patty mentioned in her comments, it\u2019s run really run over the past few quarters, both from a quality perspective. You\u2019re right, historically we\u2019ve had some quality issues but quality, we made significant improvements in quality over the past few quarters.","And just to be real straight forward about it, the operating rates and reliability of liquid packaging had been kind of up the charts the last few quarters. Now again, we\u2019re excited about this, the outage and the capital that we\u2019re getting because we think that\u2019s going to allow us to take it to the next level. But this is not one where we go we\u2019re having big, big problems so we got to go spend this money, this is the one that\u2019s really going to just further enhance what we\u2019ve been able to do at this facility at least over the past year.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America","That\u2019s where I was going with that question. Go ahead, Patty, I\u2019m sorry.","Patty Bedient","No, I was going to say George that as we look at the spending that\u2019s being done at Longview there is some spending for cleaners that will improve the quality. But as a percentage of the total dollars, it\u2019s a small amount of that. The big piece as well in this project is that it will allow us to upgrade the product mix coming out of that operation. Today, the excess fluff pulp goes into wet lap. And so there is not a great market for that. So we\u2019ll be able to change the product mix a little bit.","And then again, the big piece will be just lowering the fiber cost and lowering the energy cost. So, it\u2019s not a place where as we look across our system that we would spend capital in any operation that we didn\u2019t think had the ability to run well and run reliably. And Longview has proven that. And I think they have a really good package going forward as it relates to the return that we\u2019ll get from these projects.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America","Okay. Last question and I\u2019ll turn it over. Would it be fair to say that in recognizing it is the Board\u2019s decision, that at this juncture, from your vantage point of the key metrics, either from a balance sheet standpoint or the operating fundamentals of the Company and the sectors that you\u2019re in, that you\u2019ve checked the box, so to speak, in terms of being able to raise the dividend in the next several quarters? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter.","Patty Bedient","Yes, I think George, going back to the comments that I made in December at the Investor Meeting. We said that we would be looking forward to increasing the dividend in the future but that would likely be after we closed the RICO transaction. And that is now closed and as Doyle said, we\u2019ll be visiting on that with the board at the next board meeting in mid-August.","George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you, Patty.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with DA Davidson. Please go ahead with your question.","Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson","Thanks, good morning, everyone.","Doyle Simons","Good morning.","Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson","A couple that pertained to I guess the Wood Products segment. Starting with engineered wood products, I think you indicated that all of you facilities are now running and you\u2019re at around a 75% operating rate.","Let\u2019s, if we call housing at $1 million, and potential $1.5 million, that\u2019s a 66% operating rate. Will you guys have sufficient engineered wood product when the housing actually hits mid cycle, particularly if EWP gains share versus solids on lumber?","Doyle Simons","So, as I have said, we\u2019re running at 75% kind of on a blended average across the system. Some of our mills are running more than that, some of our facilities are running less than that. So, clearly, in some products if housing continues to improve, we may not have enough production to always meet our customer\u2019s demand.","In others we clearly do have as Patty mentioned, we\u2019re in the process of ramping up evergreen. So we\u2019ve clearly gotten more capacity there. So, we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re positioned overall in engineered lumber, in order to continue to service our customers as we move forward.","Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson","But the capacity you have is the limit, right? Everything that has been de-commissioned has been demolished or is there any kind of temporarily or indefinitely idled capacity that still exists?","Doyle Simons","You\u2019re exactly right. The capacities that we have, is what we have. And so there is nothing sitting out there to go start back up, we\u2019re running what we have.","Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson","Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then, just on distribution, great to see it, turn the corner a little bit. Again looking towards mid cycle, can you give us a sense of the revenues and I guess EBITDA or margins are, please?","Doyle Simons","Yes. It\u2019s hard to project exactly what revenues or earnings are going to be. But I\u2019ll just tell you as mentioned our commitment this year is to improve by $30 million to $40 million in our distribution. But let\u2019s be clear about it, that doesn\u2019t get us to where we absolutely need to be.","We think as we do benchmarking versus our competition, we understand we are clearly not the leader. Our goal will be to be the leader in that business. And I\u2019ll just put it this way Steve, I think there is still a lot of run way. Once we accomplish the $30 million to $40 million this year, there is still a lot of run way in front of us to continue to improve earnings and cash flow out of that business going forward.","Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson","Yes, I should think so. And so, therefore, would it be safe to say that your aspiration is to see 3%, perhaps 4% EBITDA margin once you\u2019re back at mid cycle potential?","Doyle Simons","Yes, I mean, our goal is to be like I said the leader in that business. And those types of numbers are absolutely what we would be able to accomplish.","Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson","Great. Thanks, Doyle.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Yes, thanks very much. Morning, Doyle and Patty. Just a couple of easy questions here. Just trying to put in context on Cellulose Fibers, you mentioned the year to date record productivity. I know you\u2019ve moved to 18 months maintenance schedules on some of your mills. Just if you could give us an update on where you are in that program? And then how the year-to-date productivity record balances with that?","Patty Bedient","Sure, Paul. As it relates to the 18-month cycle, now all mills will be on an 18-month cycle. The last one really is Longview which was on 18-month and we took it down, it went down in \u201813, it\u2019s coming down this quarter or this year in order for us to be able to flip those capital improvements.","But now they are all on an 18-month cycle going forward. So, I don\u2019t have the specific, how many mills and which year will be in \u201815 versus \u201814 in front of me. But they are all on that cycle.","In terms of the productivity, that really is as we look at it, how are we doing in terms of our uptime and how are we doing in terms of our production per day. And all of our mills are really operating very strongly. And they are competing with each other as well as one gets better they benchmark each other and share best practices. And we\u2019re really pleased with the work that\u2019s being done by the folks in Cellulose Fibers.","As I mentioned, the third quarter earnings will be significantly lower but that\u2019s because of the maintenance that we\u2019re doing because the mills aren\u2019t running well.","Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Okay, great to hear. And Doyle, you mentioned that you\u2019d be interested in growing the Wood Products business. Just curious as to which area within Wood Products is more highly sought after than other areas?","Doyle Simons","Yes, and what I\u2019ve said on the wood products business is, our primary focus is continuing to run what we have better and again making progress there. In terms of specific businesses, there is not a specific business we feel compelled to grow at all.","We like our position. And all of those \u2013 in those businesses, again we think our biggest opportunity is to run when we have better. With that said, if we find growth opportunities then we think can add additional value for our shareholders in that business that\u2019s something we would consider.","Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets","Great thanks very much. Best of luck.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Patty Bedient","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.","Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James","Good morning, Patty and Doyle.","Patty Bedient","Good morning.","Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James","Congrats on the quarter. A couple of questions here. Can you guys discuss a little more about the trends you\u2019re seeing in the different wood baskets you operate in the US south?","I know we\u2019ve heard kind of just generally out there that Arkansas and Mississippi is heavily lagged. Maybe as it relates to you guys the Carolinas. But put a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing, kind of your expectations there for the back half of the year?","Doyle Simons","Sure, so in terms of further on saw logs, we should step back and look at overall in the south, we saw log prices go up about 4% in \u201813 versus \u201812. As we mentioned earlier, we had seen saw log prices up modestly in the first half of \u201814 versus \u201813. And we think that trend will continue into the second half of \u201814.","Yes, there are always some regional differences based on capacity, based on weather, based on a lot of different things. So yes, you do see some different things in mid south versus Gulf versus Atlantic, whatever the case may be. But overall, we continue to anticipate but continued improvement in saw log prices going forward.","Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And then, I don\u2019t know if maybe you guys could break out roughly how much of the EBIT during the quarter came from the south versus say the west?","Patty Bedient","I don\u2019t have that exact number in front of me. I would tell you that in terms of looking forward in the third quarter, most of the decrease in EBIT will come in the west versus the south because of the export markets both in terms of what the export markets are doing in export and then obviously that has an impact back to the domestic market as well.","Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And then, just to like following up on earlier question and I know it\u2019s early. But as you think about the \u2013 really the step-up in the run rate as far as the CapEx this year is. The $400 million kind of \u2013 is that even appropriate if we think about 2015 or could there be another, I guess, I\u2019m asking, could be there another leg up in terms of CapEx dollars, do you feel like this was kind of the high water mark?","Patty Bedient","Colin, as we look at our capital expenditure what will drive that is our ability to continue to have high quality projects which we would focus on as driving our cost down. So as Doyle said, we\u2019re still looking at those numbers. I hope actually that that number will go up a little bit because that means we do have good projects but we\u2019re still working through that as we are speaking.","And I think the other thing that we have really had a focus on is making sure that before we spend capital, all of our operations are really operating well. So, we\u2019re not looking at growing capacity necessarily from additional capital spend, it really is focused on improving the cost position of our operations. But we\u2019ll be giving you more clarity on that as we get closer to the end of the year.","Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James","Okay. And then, again, going back to just the capital allocation and still recognizing you\u2019re in the middle of that process right now. Can you maybe just put a little more detail on how much time are you really actively spending right now looking at Timberland acquisition and growing that part of the book currently or has it really just been trying to again determine where you want to put capital to work and still kind of integrating Longview?","Doyle Simons","We\u2019re always looking for opportunities to grow our Timberland base. So, there is as you probably are assuming \u2013 I\u2019m sure you know there is some activity out there. There has been a pretty consistent flow. We look at every opportunity that comes along. We take a disciplined approach to it. And we will continue to do that.","So, no, we didn\u2019t \u2013 Longview has been a fantastic acquisition for us. We\u2019re well ahead of our synergy targets. We\u2019re on track to deliver the EBITDA that we indicated out of that acquisition. But we didn\u2019t put other things on hold as we went through that process. We\u2019ve continued to look. Again, we\u2019ll be very disciplined but we think there will be opportunities to grow our Timberland base going forward and we\u2019re focused on doing just that.","Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ve now reached the allotted time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Doyle for closing remarks.","Doyle Simons","Thank you. And thanks everybody for joining this morning. Before we sign-off, one thing I would like to do as, I would like to acknowledge Kathy McAuley who actually retired effective today. It\u2019s hard to express just how much Kathy has contributed to Weyerhaeuser during her 14 years with us. Patty and I would like to offer our sincere thanks. And more importantly wish her all the best in her retirement.","As we have previously announced Denise Merle has taken on responsibility as Senior Vice President of HR and Investor Relations. And Beth Baum is the Director of Investor Relations. They will both be available to answer any follow-up questions that you may have.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth L. Baum - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding after-tax special items of $10 million for merger-related cost, we earned $167 million or $0.22 per diluted share. This is over 2.5 times of earnings from continuing operations we reported in the fourth quarter and one year ago.","Adjusted EBITDA totaled $454 million, an improvement of 14% compared with the fourth quarter and 35% compared with the first quarter of 2016. I am very pleased with our first quarter performance as we illustrated the power of leveraging internal improvements across improving markets. Our employees did an outstanding job of capitalizing on operational excellence initiatives, merger-related synergies and strengthening market conditions to achieve outstanding operating and financial results in the quarter, while also fully delivering on our increased $125 million merger cost synergy target.","One year into our merger with Plum Creek, I'm proud of what our teams have accomplished and the dedication and focus they continue to display as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company. Before turning to our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market.","Housing activity began 2017 on a very solid trajectory. Total housing starts averaged over $1.25 million for the first quarter, an improvement of 8% compared with last year despite some unusually wet West Coast weather. Single-family starts rose 9% in the month of March and are up 6% year-to-date. Leading market indicators are also favorable. Single-family permits are up 13% compared with first quarter of last year and builder confidence remains near record highs.","Employment and wages are rising, consumer confidence has surpassed pre-recession levels, and interest rates, although increasing, remain historically low. Our customers are reporting robust demand with strong activity in California as winter weather has mitigated and signs that an increasing number of millennials are entering the home-buying market.","Labor and lot availability remain the most active constraints, but builders are motivated to manage through these challenges and capture the benefit of favorable market conditions. The spring selling season appears to be off to a robust start and we continue to expect between $1.25 million and $1.3 million total housing starts for 2017.","Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $148 million to first quarter earnings, $25 million more than the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose to $242 million. Western Timberlands delivered $133 million of first quarter EBITDA, an improvement of over 30% compared with the fourth quarter and 13% more than a year ago.","The market for Western domestic logs was stronger than expected during the quarter as the combination of solid building activity and low mill inventories drove demand, while unusually wet and snowy winter weather reduced the available log supply. Our Western team did an exceptional job of taking full advantage of our scale and operability, flexing harvest settings to some lower elevation tracks and leveraging our strong road system as they directed additional volume into the most tensioned domestic markets.","Domestic log sales volumes and realizations increased compared with the fourth quarter and unit logging and road costs decreased due to lower logging elevations, continued operational excellence improvements and deferrals from silviculture, and road maintenance activities due to wet weather.","Turning now to our export markets, in Japan, housing activity remained solid with year-to-date start-up of approximately 5% through February and demand for our logs has remained steady. Although Japanese construction activity typically moderates in the first quarter due to winter weather, log sales volumes were up slightly and average realizations increased compared with the fourth quarter.","In China, log sales volumes declined compared with fourth quarter due to timing of shipment and our intentional decision to flex volume into this strong domestic market. Average log realizations improved and market conditions remained favorable. Log inventories at Chinese ports remain within a normalized range, having risen early in the first quarter before declining in March as construction activity resumed following the Lunar New Year holiday.","Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $96 million to first quarter EBITDA, lower than the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower harvest volumes and slightly lower average realizations. Southern markets remain flat as log availability was plentiful due to favorable weather and mills are holding adequate inventory.","Fee harvest volumes declined seasonally compared with the fourth quarter and average log realizations were slightly lower due to a higher proportion of pulpwood sales. Although pulpwood log realizations weakened during the quarter as seasonal maintenance and other mill shutdowns reduced demand, realizations for our delivered saw logs were comparable.","Northern Timberlands contributed $8 million to EBITDA, an improvement of $1 million compared with fourth quarter as the region benefited from OpEx initiatives to reduce contract logging costs. Fee harvest declined seasonally and average realizations were comparable.","The Timberlands business made good progress on its operational excellence and synergy initiatives in the first quarter. Regional teams continue to identify and roll out best practices for optimizing spending and value creation for our silviculture activities and improving wood flows to further reduce cost and maximize the realization we capture from every log.","The business is on track to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for 2017. The strategic review of our Uruguay operations continues to proceed well with strong interest from multiple parties. We look forward to providing further information when the review is complete.","Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and E&R contributed $26 million to first quarter earnings and $43 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $47 million compared with the fourth quarter but improved $9 million compared with the first quarter of last year. Fourth quarter is typically our seasonally strongest quarter, while first quarter typically reflects the lowest level of transaction activity.","Earnings were comparable to fourth quarter earnings before special items as first quarter had a lower average land basis on the mix of property sold. Average price per acre improved by $500 due to mix. Approximately three-fourth of our first quarter acreage sales were located in the U.S. South with the remainder predominantly in the Pacific Northwest. In contrast, fourth quarter included a large transaction in Montana where timberland prices are regionally lower.","Our team continues to make excellent progress applying the asset value optimization process to our Western Timberland and I remain very confident we will meet our target of completing this work by mid-year.","Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $172 million to first quarter earnings, an increase of nearly 75% compared with the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved $75 million to $207 million. EBITDA for lumber totaled $99 million, $42 million more than the fourth quarter, primarily due to a 5% increase in average realizations. Lumber sales volumes increased 6%. Operating rates and manufacturing costs improved due to strong operating performance and reduced downtime for maintenance and capital projects, although several Western mills did lose small amounts of production due to weather.","EBITDA for OSB totaled $66 million, $20 million more than the fourth quarter and more than double the first quarter of 2016. Average sales realizations increased 3% and sales volumes increased 21%. All of our OSB mills ran extremely well in the quarter and unit manufacturing costs declined due to higher operating rate and strong OpEx progress on controllable manufacturing cost.","Engineered wood products contributed $37 million to EBITDA, an improvement of $11 million compared with the fourth quarter. Sales volumes for solid section increased 11% and I-joist volumes were up slightly. Operating rates rose seasonally and unit manufacturing costs improved due to less planned maintenance and holiday downtime. Average realizations for solid section and I-joist declined slightly due to mix as first quarter typically includes a greater proportion of commodity and industrial products.","Distribution EBITDA totaled $8 million, an increase of $3 million compared with the fourth quarter and double the EBITDA of one year ago. This business continues to make progress by improving product margins and tightly managing warehouse, delivery, and selling costs across increased sales volumes.","Each of the Wood Products' businesses made good progress on their respective OpEx initiatives during the quarter with OSB and distribution demonstrating particularly strong results. We continue to expect collective OpEx benefits of $55 million to $75 million from this segment in 2017.","I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. On April 24, the Department of Commerce announced preliminary countervailing duties on Canadian lumber producers. For most producers, the duty will be approximately 20%. These duties will become effective upon publication in the Federal Register. For some producers, the duties will also be imposed retroactively effective 90 days prior to publication.","The Department of Commerce continues to evaluate the coalition's petition for antidumping duties, which would be additive to the countervailing duties announced earlier this week. We expect a preliminary decision on the antidumping duties to be reached on June 23. We appreciate the action the U.S. government has taken to address the unfair trade practices that are harming U.S. lumber producers. The government will continue its investigation throughout of 2017 as the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission collect and evaluate additional information in support of final determinations on both the duties and material injury to U.S. producers. These determinations are expected in early November and late December, respectively.","We continue to prefer the certainty of a negotiated agreement. Formal discussions remain on hold, pending confirmation of the U.S. Trade representative. In the meantime, the coalition is working closely with both the Office of the USTR and the Department of Commerce. We look forward to resuming formal negotiations and are hopeful we will be able to reach a quota-based agreement.","I will close this morning with a couple of comments on merger cost synergies and other cost reductions. As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to achieve our merger cost synergies ahead of schedule and at levels that exceeded our initial expectations. We captured our original $100 million run rate target at the end of 2016, several months earlier than anticipated, and have now exceeded that by 25%, fully delivering on increase of $125 million run rate target by year one deadline. Approximately 80% of these costs have been achieved through reductions in controllable SG&A, while the remainder have come from cost of sales. We remain on track to eliminate the $35 million of cost formerly allocated to our sale of Fibers business no later than 2017 year-end.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the second quarter is presented in chart 12 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the first quarter and comparable to second quarter of 2016. Western saw log markets continue to perform well with solid domestic and export demand, while Southern saw log markets remain flat.","We also expect seasonally higher road, logging and silviculture costs as we begin the spring and summer months. In our Western Timberland operations, average sales realization should increase slightly, but fee harvest volumes are expected to decrease modestly. Japanese export log volumes and average sales realizations should be comparable to the first quarter supported by continued strength in the Japanese housing market.","Export log volumes to China are expected to be higher in the second quarter as a result of the timing of shipments and continued favorable demand. Average sales realization should be comparable. Domestic log sales volumes are expected to decrease slightly compared to the first quarter, while average sales realizations should increase slightly supported by continued steady demand.","Western road costs are expected to be higher than the first quarter due to additional road spending which is typical as road building activities increase in the second quarter and the catch up on activity which was not completed in the first quarter due to weather. Logging costs were also increased due to planned shifting of harvest activities to higher elevations. While an increase in higher elevation logging is typical in the spring months, they'll be more notable than usual because we flex some first quarter activities to lower elevations due to unusually wet and snowy weather.","Southern harvest volumes are expected to be higher in the second quarter, as more favorable weather allows for increased access to harvest areas. We anticipate average sales realizations for the second quarter will be similar to first quarter levels. Silviculture spending in the South is expected to increase due to typical seasonality. In the North, we anticipate second quarter sales volumes will be significantly lower than the first quarter due to spring breakup season. Average sales realizations will be comparable to the first quarter levels.","Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. As is typical for the real estate business, activity will begin increasing in the spring and summer months with a large portion of sales closing in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect over $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources business in 2017.","For Wood Products, higher sales realizations for lumber, OSB, and engineered wood products, along with higher sales volumes for most product lines, will result in significantly higher adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter. Overall, we expect earnings and EBITDA to improve by approximately 20% to 30% compared to the first quarter.","Before moving to unallocated items, I'd like to highlight a new accounting standard we've adopted in the current quarter which changes how we report pension and post-retirement costs. Previously, we recorded this activity within cost of products sold, general and administrative expenses and other operating costs.","The new accounting standard results in a reclassification of most of these costs to a new line item below operating income titled non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits. The total amount recorded in the statement of operations does not change. Looking at chart 10, unallocated items, the $28 million variance in earnings before special items compared with the fourth quarter is driven by a $33 million increase in non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit cost.","As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, this expected variance is primarily the result of the annual update to our pension and postretirement actuarial assumptions, which included a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities of both our U.S. and Canadian plants. We expect to record approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter of non-cash pension and postretirement expense in unallocated throughout the remainder of 2017.","As stated in our prior earnings call, we do not expect to make any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2017. And we anticipate cash payments in 2017 of approximately $70 million for all other pension and postretirement plans. Chart 11 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $455 million. Cash from operations during the quarter was $35 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to inventory and other working capital build, as well as the timing of semiannual interest payments.","The current quarter also included $59 million in net taxes paid, primarily attributable to the foreign tax payments associated with the 2016 gain on the divestiture of our pulp mills. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $75 million. We continue to expect our full year capital expenditures to total approximately $435 million, $300 million for Wood Products and $135 million for Timberlands. Financing cash flows included $233 million for common dividends paid in the first quarter.","Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of long-term debt. We have a scheduled maturity in August of 2017 for $281 million, which we intend to repay with available cash. Interest expense was $99 million in the first quarter. We expect interest expense to be similar in the second quarter and approximately $400 million for the full year. We continue to anticipate the full year 2017 tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the forecasted mix of earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Russell. I noted at the beginning of today's call that internal improvements and strengthening market conditions can create a powerful combination. Our first quarter results demonstrate this. And with a solid improving housing trajectory, favorable dynamics across our Wood Products businesses and continued leverage from operational excellence and merger synergies, we are well-positioned to deliver continued strong results.","Although markets are improving, we will not lose focus on the factors under our control. We remain committed to fully capturing the benefits of our merger with Plum Creek, achieving industry-leading performance and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation to drive superior value for our shareholders.","And now, I'd like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Doyle, a couple questions around the South. One, can you update us on where you're at with the capital program at the Southern saw mills and whether a resolution on this trade issue could lead you to invest more capital in Southern lumber operations?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","So, Mark, as we have consistently talked about, we are focused on investing capital to drive down our cost in our overall Wood Products operation. For last year, this year and for probably the next couple of years, we will be investing at approximately $300 million level in our Wood Products operation overall. We would not anticipate investing more than that during the timeframe. And, in fact, after investing at the $300 million level for the next couple of years, we would anticipate going back down to what I would call a more normalized level of between $200 million and $250 million.","We are very encouraged by the initial returns on the capital that we have spent. And that part of the capital in our lumber operations \u2013 specifically again the focus is to drive down cost to low risk, high-return project. But we also will be increasing capacity modestly as we rebuild a mill in Dierks and that will be coming on later this year and also a mill in Millport. So, net-net that will add about another 300 million board feet of capacity but again, the focus is on driving down our cost.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And just one related question. I noticed in looking at some of the trade data that the Southern log export volumes are up more than 100% year-to-date. I know Plum had been doing some work in trying to develop these markets. I wondered if you could talk about what you are doing to kind of participate in this and whether there are any things you can do to encourage kind of more log export volume out of the South because it looks like it would really help to kind of create a little more tension in the markets down there?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","We agree with you, Mark. We think it would be helpful from that perspective and we're doing a lot of work on identifying and promoting export activity out of the South. We've had some initial successes still at a very small level but spending a lot of time talking to potential customers and starting to develop those markets and frankly are pretty optimistic about it. It's still early, still small volumes but we think there's a real opportunity to expand Southern export markets as we move forward.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then just lastly, Russell, are you guys \u2013 can you give us any number for what you expect to pay in countervailing duties on the Canadian operations this year?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yes. So we've done the calculation on the countervailing duties with the volume coming out of our Canadian operation into the U.S. And based on a high-level estimate, we would expect about a $6 million cost on a per quarter basis.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. All right. I'll turn it over. Thanks.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. I just wanted to delve a little bit further into operating rates in the supply side across your wood businesses. So recognizing you've got the capacity coming on later on in wood products and in lumber, Doyle, currently, what would you estimate of your operable capacity what your operating rate is? One of your peers was reporting yesterday that they've obviously been able to take up their production through capital projects and optimization programs.","Do you have further ability to flex your existing capacity without running at impractical levels either from a waste or safety standpoint? And then, on OSB, I think, you said production was up something like 20%. Congratulations on the performance. What further ability do you have to take your production up and do you think you garnered a bit more share than peers in this quarter and why? And then, I had one follow-on. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. So, in terms of operating rates, George, in the quarter, lumber was in the low-90s. As we mentioned, our OSB operation ran very well. It was in the high-90s and ELP was in the mid-80s. You're always looking for opportunities to increase reliability and, therefore, increase production. Our mills are running well. There's always, what I call, creep in terms of being able to increase production but there's not big steps other than what we've already talked about in response to Mark's question of what we're doing on the lumber side to increase significantly incremental capacity. So, what we're focused on is running reliably and at the lowest cost as possible.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And, I guess, on OSB, you're pretty much \u2013 if you're in the high-90s, you're pretty much tapped out. Would that be fair and do you think you garnered more share than peers in the quarter? And if so, was it geographic mix or something else do you believe?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Other than creep, I would agree with you. We are almost maxed out in OSB and don't believe we necessarily grew share. We've been running at pretty high levels in OSB other than taking some maintenance downtime and those type of things. So, we just ran extremely well in OSB in the quarter and demand for the product was very good despite the fact that the first quarter is normally a slower seasonal period.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Appreciate that, Doyle. Thank you. My last one, I'll turn it over, as we think about the AVO program, and I realize the details will come out in June, so maybe this is getting a little ahead of the curve. If we think about the premiums that you've been getting in the South, would it be fair to say that in the West you'll be less likely to achieve that same premium probably because development and land values for that matter in the West are harder to do and higher priced respectively or how would you have us at least preliminarily think about that? Thank you, guys.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","What I would tell you is that we were encouraged by the process so far in the West. As you also said, we'll be talking more about that when we wrap it up. With that said, as we very consistently have said, we're looking for a premium of 30%. And I would anticipate that we will achieve that premium or more in the West just as we have in the South.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's great. Thank you, Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Just a clarification. On the OSB, that big percent increase in volume, that was versus the fourth quarter where you were fire impacted? Was that also against the prior year first quarter?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Mark, really good question, and glad to be able to clarify. You're right. A big part of the pickup in first quarter versus fourth quarter was due to the fact that Sutton was running for the full quarter. My comments were more due the fact that in OSB in the first quarter we ran in the high-90s, as I indicated, but quarter-to-quarter you're exactly right.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great. Thank you. And then you mentioned in the prepared remarks about a 20% to 30% improvement in EBITDA. Was that specific to Wood Products or was that for the company as a whole looking 2Q v 1Q?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Again, thanks for clarifying. That was a specific comment regarding Wood Products and that range is due to the fact that we don't know exactly what prices are going to do from this point forward. If prices stayed where they are today or moved up, it would be at higher end of the \u2013 towards the 30%. If they rolled or turned down from this point, it would be closer to the 20%. So that's the reason for the range. With that said, Mark, that comment was very specific to Wood Products.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then, lastly, is there any visibility at all as to timing on when duties might become quotas? And I realize you certainly don't have anything specific, but are we talking potentially quarters or is that more likely a process that could take years?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","You're right, Mark. We don't know exactly, but I would be \u2013 I am hopeful that we could be in a situation where we could enter into a negotiated agreement \u2013 a quota-based agreement sometime this year.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then, lastly, if I could. On the duties that are being collected, what happens to those duties? Is that determined yet or is that yet to be decided?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Well, those duties go to the U.S. Treasury and are held by the U.S. Treasury.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Might they go back to U.S. sawmills as I think they did last time or not necessarily?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. Not necessarily. That was a negotiated agreement, as you will recall, after many months back and forth. Some of it went back to U.S. sawmills. Some of it went back to the Canadian producers. So, that was part of the negotiations. So, I don't think \u2013 we'll just have to see how this plays out as we move forward.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe. Please go ahead.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Hi. Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Gail.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Just starting on the Western log market, the weather that you suggested that impacted your ability to harvest some higher elevation, how much do you think that contributed to the overall market pricing in the quarter? And have you started to see kind of better harvest conditions take some pressure off?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","So, as I said in the comments, Gail, we were very pleased with our ability to leverage our scale operability, get roads during the quarter to capitalize on the tight markets. What I would tell you as we moved into the second quarter we continue to be encouraged by what we see in the West, continued strong demand. To your point, the mill inventories remained thin, especially in Oregon. They're better than they were at some points in the first quarter. But mill inventories continue to be thin. And I would tell you overall, as Russell indicated, we anticipate prices in the West to be up slightly in the second quarter. So, weather has improved. We are able to move up into the higher elevation in the second quarter. But we're very pleased with our ability to capitalize on what happened during the first quarter.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. Thank you. And going back to the trade agreement, do you have any sense of how the markets might have anticipated that and how much that might have played into what you saw in lumber pricing in the first quarter?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Gail, as you know, it's hard to determine how much, if any, impact the overhang from the waiting for the quarters to come out had on pricing. What I will tell you is I think key drivers to the pricing improvement were the fact that inventories were very lean going into the first quarter and demand was better than expected. I think all you have to do is look at OSB which didn't have the whole tariff situation and those prices ran as well. So, I'm not going to tell you that the SLA didn't have an impact on pricing in the first quarter because I'm sure that it did. But I think it was more \u2013 had more to do with the volatility in pricing that we saw. I think underplaying supply and demand was the biggest driver of the improvement in lumber pricing that we've seen year-to-date.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","And do you feel that the CVDs as announced were pretty much in line with what the market was expecting or do you think there's tons of surprise that it was 20% and not fairly lower?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","I think there was a lot of speculation as you very well know, Gail, on what those rates would be. What I will tell you is they came in about where we expected that it would. And I think now we'll wait and see what happens in the antidumping and what the overall number is as we move forward.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. And just, finally, can you talk a little bit what you're seeing in terms of log export markets, in particular the competitive environment there? Any incremental or release in (35:09) pressure out of Russia, for instance, going into China? Any incremental competition Japan from Europe?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yes. So, what I would tell you is we continue to be encouraged by what we see in the West overall, including the key export markets which, of course, for us are Japan and China. In terms of Japan, Japan housing market remains solid. 2017 total starts are up almost 5% year-over-year through February. Demand and pricing per logs, as we said, was solid in the first quarter and we anticipate that's going to continue into the second quarter.","In terms of China, inventories there are in good shape which as you know is a real key. And in March, it's roughly 3.8 million cubic meters. We anticipate that inventories are going to remain at reasonable levels through 2017. And in the second quarter, we anticipate volumes are going to rise and we'll have log prices that are comparable to the first quarter levels.","And we anticipate as we move through the balance of the year continued strong demand and pricing to be up slightly for the remainder of the year in China. I do not see any big moves in terms of competitors kind of maxed out in terms of the infrastructure challenges that we have. So, we did see an increase in U.S. exports to China so far in the first quarter of 2017 and that number is up pretty significantly versus first quarter of 2016.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Collin.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","First question just going back, Doyle, in February, I believe you indicated that you're hopeful we'll see some slight improvement in log pricing in the U.S. South as we move into the second half of the year. Just can you update us on your thinking here just in context of what's happening on the lumber side of the business?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yes. So, what I would tell you is, at this point, Collin, we don't expect any \u2013 let me start about what we've seen in saw log pricing. So, if you go back and look at the last four quarters in terms of just saw log pricing, it's been very flat. You've seen some pressure on pulpwood pricing, but saw log prices has been very flat over the past four quarters.","As we look into the second quarter, we don't expect any significant improvement in saw log pricing. We do continue to believe there is some potential for, maybe, some minor pricing traction in late 2017 as demand continues to grow and the Canadian (38:04) markets decline, whether it's due to duties or, hopefully, as I mentioned, earlier in negotiated agreement.","Now, longer-term, as we've talked about, we're very optimistic that due to the additional housing demands, the incremental capacity that's coming online in the U.S. South and right now that's at least 12 million tons of additional demand that's in the process of coming on line and then again less lumber from Canada. We think all of those things are going to add up to provide us with the opportunity for much better pricing on Southern saw logs as we move into 2018 and beyond.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks. That's a helpful update there. And then maybe switching gears, can you just maybe touch more on your outlook for OSB pricing throughout the year just against the backdrop of, clearly, better pricing here at start of the year, better residential construction activity, but then also the potential for more supply?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. So, we're optimistic about OSB pricing for the year of 2017. We talked about that it was up nicely in the first quarter. But as you look at where it is in the second quarter, current prices are up probably 10% versus the first quarter average. And we think based again on the strong housing demand that we've seen and the current supply, that OSB pricing should be good for the year 2017.","As we move into 2018, as you highlighted, there will be some incremental capacity that comes online. But we're going to frankly need some of that as housing continues to grow. And the other observation I would make is it takes a while for a new capacity to get up and be fully running. So, we'll see how that plays out, but we're hopeful that supply and demand continue to be in good shape as we move forward.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks. And then just one last one from me, just going back to the OpEx goals. And, again, in the prepared remarks, you highlighted you were on track to achieve that in the Wood Products side. Is there any way to quantify or think about how much of the 2017 goals were captured in the 1Q number versus what you saw ahead of you as far as the runway of just kind of the OpEx side of things regardless of what happens with product pricing?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. So, what I would tell you is in Timberlands, as we talked about, we're right on track for the $40 million to $50 million. So, I would say in the quarter, we got about what you would expect if you just do it on a quarterly basis. In terms of our Wood Products operation, Collin, as we said, we had particularly good quarters from a OpEx perspective in OSB and distribution. So, I would tell you at least for \u2013 and it's just one quarter out of four but through the first quarter we're ahead of schedule in both of those businesses and I would stay right in line with our other two businesses which are lumber and EWP.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","That's helpful. Thanks, Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Please go ahead.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","It sounds like the U.S. and Canada nearly had a softwood lumber deal late in 2016 and someone on the Canadian side thought they'd get a better deal with President Trump. I guess that's true if the bonehead moved on Canada's part. But as the largest U.S. lumber producer, presumably you are privy to the details. So, can you say whether the terms were similar to the deal that expired in October of 2015 and...?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","No. Steve, not surprisingly, we don't have any comment on negotiations that go on between the U.S. and the Canadian governments.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Well, clearly, the two countries need one another. So, it sounds like you're looking more for a quota.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Well, clearly, the two countries need one another. And, as I said, we are very hopeful of a negotiated agreement between the U.S. and Canada as we move forward.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. And then I'll switch gear with one other question. You made some nice progress on engineered wood and it's great that it wasn't driven by price. But it's interesting to me that price is down when generally high lumber prices I thought were conducive to substitution into EWP. So, why were prices down...?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yes. So, what I would say \u2013 I'm sorry. Go ahead.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Well, I was just going to say why are they down and are there any initiatives to raise prices?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. There are in fact initiatives to raise prices and we have announced a 7% to 10% price increase and are encouraged by the progress we're making on that. Of that 7% to 10%, we should realize that by the end of the third quarter with maybe 25%, 30% of that in the second quarter and most of the balance of that to be realized in the third quarter. To your first comment, the reason prices were down slightly was primarily due to mix and the fact that the first quarter typically includes a greater mix of commodity and industrial products, which carry a lower price. So, just as you indicated, positive lumber pricing good for EWP and we anticipate EWP prices moving up for the balance of the year.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you, Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","I just want to \u2013 I had a question on timberland values. (43:57) report was questioning some of the softness in the market and we see the transactions that are there. They seem to be a little bit all over the place. But the idea of softness was sort of \u2013 and it's more in the U.S. South with the idea of disappointing U.S. South saw log prices and higher discount rate. Are you seeing that at all or are you seeing more robust market conditions?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","No, Paul, we haven't seen that at all. What I would tell you is demand for high-quality, well-managed timberland remains very strong. As investors continue to view timberland as an attractive part of their portfolio, timberland valuations remain steady. We're participants to all the major deals that come to market and have not observed any changes in the valuation trends overall.","As you very well know, there was a big transaction that happened this quarter by one of our competitors. That was at a nice level in terms of value per acre. So, we continue to see strong interest from a diverse group of investors in every deal that comes along, again, for high quality, well-managed timberland.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just on a potential deal on softwood lumber. You guys are clearly in favor of quota. Would you like to share with us sort of what percentage of quota you would like to see?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Paul, that is ongoing \u2013 or those will be ongoing discussions between the Canadian and U.S. government. And, again, hopefully, we can reach a agreement that works for all involved by the end of this year.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners","Yeah. Hi, guys. It's actually Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. So, firstly, a little bit on the land sales. You're guiding for EBITDA of $250 million this year. So, over the next five years or even more, we know there's quarterly seasonality, but how lumpy will this EBITDA be on a year-on-year basis?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","So, on the Real Estate, yes, as you indicated, that can be a little lumpy because it's more transaction-based. But I think what we'll see coming in, as I indicated in the second quarter, will be comparable to first quarter and then we'll see a majority of the transactions close in the fourth quarter. That's probably the typical pattern of closing any cash flow that you'll see in this business. We just don't get a lot of activity in the winter months and then it backloads at the end of the year.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners","Sure. So, on a yearly base, let's say, from 2018 and onward, do you expect a lot of variability on a year-on-year basis?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","No. I think we've indicated that we would expect the Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources business to contribute anywhere from 10% to 15% of our total adjusted EBITDA. And so, that's pretty much where we target that business.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Perfect. And just on the acquisition front. Given that Wood Products are performing very well, are you considering selective acquisitions on that front and if so, which specific categories, lumber, OSB?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","So, what we've said is currently our priorities number one, two and three are making sure we successfully merge Plum Creek and get to the bottom-line all the benefits from that merger. And as we indicated earlier, we made a lot of progress, but still have more to do. So, that is our primary focus.","As we move forward, we will look for opportunities to grow our company. We think our biggest opportunities will probably be in Timberlands. With that said, if we can find appropriate acquisitions in Wood Products, especially if it's close to our timber base, those are opportunities we would look at from a bolt-on perspective. And we'll continue to identify opportunities for that as we move forward.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners","Makes sense. And just clarify, you mentioned you preferred if it's close to \u2013 if the mills will be close, I guess, to the Timberland assets, but you would be open to do separate transactions, let's say, lumber mill that's not a part of a bigger operation with Timberland as well.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","I'm not sure I understood your question. Say that again?","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners","Sure. I think you mentioned you would be open to acquiring some wood product asset that may not be close to Timberland assets. Is that correct? So, you'd be...","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Well, we would factor in everything in terms of potential bolt-on acquisitions. It would probably be more attractive if it was close to our Timberland. But would we' necessary rule it out if it wasn't near our Timberland? Probably not. But, again, our Timberland base most sawmills, for example, would be more than likely aligned with our Timberland base.","Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, Doyle, Russell and Beth.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Really strong result in Wood Products. I think the pricing that everyone tracks public benchmark price is up a lot. Your own realizations seem to lag it maybe just by a little bit. I was wondering if there's a little bit of a timing lag on recognizing some of the market prices. Maybe pre-sell some volume a little bit ahead of time. Is that the case and is that something that we should just expect going forward? And could you kind of quantify how much of a lag there might be?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. So, there clearly is a lag and especially in strong markets like we had in the first quarter. With extended order files the lag tends to be maybe, if anything, a little longer than normal. But what I would tell you as we've moved into the second quarter, prices have continued to improve. As I indicated earlier, current prices for OSB more than 10% \u2013 ARC (50:19) realizations are up more than 10% versus the first quarter average. And we've also seen a nice improvement in lumber prices with quarter to-date lumber prices up roughly $30 versus the first quarter average. So, you're exactly right. There is a lag, but it is ultimately realized and the lag is a little longer when you're at the situation where you have extended order files, which is a good thing.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks for the help there. Just sticking with Wood Products, really good engineered wood product volumes. Just wondering if any of that, in your mind, had to do with pre-buying ahead of the price increases that are out there in the market for the spring? And just wondering if that would have been a factor in the strong volumes.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","I think that may have been a small factor. I think it was more driven by what we've seen on the housing front, Brian, but I can't tell you there wasn't any pre-buying. But as we move through the second and third quarters I indicated earlier, we will fully capture the 7% to 10% price increase that's being put in place.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then switching gears, you made some comments at the Investor Day back in December about the dividend just kind of reevaluating the payout ratio and how you and the board would think about it going forward. It's been a while since we've gotten a change in the dividend. Just wondering about your updated thoughts on it and timing and how that strategy is coming together.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Sure. So, as we've consistently said, we are committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. With 90% of our assets in Timberlands and a significantly improved cost structure for Wood Products. Our go-forward cash flow will be much more stable than it's been historically. We continue to work with our board on the appropriate payout ratio and the timing for increasing the dividend going forward. And as you would expect the board factors in many things when considering the appropriate dividend level, including the pace of improvement in housing, Southern saw logs and Wood Products as well as the benefits from our internal initiatives for operational excellence and operational synergies. So, that's how we're currently thinking about it.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And in terms of timing, is there a particular meeting within the year where the board takes it up or pay special attention to it?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","We have no specific cadence in terms of our dividend review.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Just one last one for Russell, if I could, on the \u2013 the working capital seemed a little bit \u2013 like a little bit of a bigger use of cash than historical. Maybe that's due a little bit with the Plum Creek in there, but I know that had to do with the taxes coming out of the Cellulose Fiber sale. But just wondering about your thoughts on for the full year how you think working capital will be a source or use of cash or maybe flat?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","I would expect it to be pretty consistent with the prior years. You're right. We did have probably an increase in working capital just because of the addition of the Plum Creek lands. We have inventory builds in the North, particularly in Montana, which would mean you'd see an increase in some working capital in the first quarter which we saw. But I wouldn't expect anything out of the ordinary for the remainder of the year.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Doyle Simons for closing remarks.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","As I understand, that was our final question.

On the call, this morning, are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.","Devin Stockfish","Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported a full-year net loss of $76 million or $0.10 per diluted share driven by a previously reported $0.47 non-cash pension settlement charge. Excluding special items, our full-year 2019 earnings totaled $285 million or $0.39 per share. For the fourth quarter, we reported a GAAP loss of $14 million or $0.02 per diluted share.","Excluding net charges of $37 million for special items, we earned $23 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the quarter. Throughout 2019, all of our businesses executed well despite significant headwinds from sluggish housing activity in the first half of the year, persistently challenged commodity prices and continued global trade uncertainty.","I\u2019m extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2019, which included achieving record low controllable manufacturing cost in our lumber and oriented strand board operations, capturing over $100 million of operational excellence improvements, delivering the highest EBITDA ever from our real estate energy and natural resources business, delivering a 61% premium to timber value from real estate sales, strategically optimizing portions of our Northern timberlands portfolio, for total proceeds of nearly $450 million, reducing our pension obligations by $1.5 billion, and returning over $1 billion of cash to shareholders.","Before I dive into our fourth quarter business results, let me set the stage with some brief remarks on the housing market. The improved pace of U.S. housing activity that emerged during the third quarter continued steadily through year end. Building activity in December was particularly strong. For the year, U.S. housing starts totaled 1.29 million, a 3% improvement, compared with the year ago.","Looking forward, economic fundamental support continued growth in U.S. housing activity. Real wages and household incomes are increasing. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, household formations are at levels well above the historical average, mortgage rates remain extremely favorable at 3.6%, Homebuilder sentiment is at the highest level since 1999. The inventory of new and existing homes for sale is low and builders continue to shift more products to serve the significant demand for affordable housing.","However, notwithstanding these positive demand fundamentals, we do expect the upside on housing will continue to be governed by many of the same supply-side challenges that we faced for a number of years. These include labor availability, lot availability, and regulatory burdens that make it more difficult to bring affordable housing to market.","As we enter 2020, unadjusted housing starts have exceeded 1.3 million on a run rate basis for eight of the last nine months, a sign that supply-side infrastructure can support this level of increased activity. Our outlook is for continued modest growth in U.S. housing. For 2020, we anticipate just over 1.3 million starts with the improvement driven primarily by additional single-family activity.","Turning now to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts five through seven. Timberlands contributed $85 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items and $158 million to adjusted EBITDA. Western Timberlands EBITDA increased $14 million, compared with the third quarter. Average sales realizations for domestic and Japanese export logs increased and road and forestry expenses were seasonally lower.","In the West, fourth quarter weather was milder than normal and log supply remained above average due to favorable logging conditions. Domestic demand remained steady through the quarter as Western lumber pricing improved and mills took limited holiday downtime. In our export markets, our average log sales realizations to Japan increased slightly, compared with the third quarter, while log sales volumes were slightly lower.","Although Japanese housing starts have moderated somewhat following the recent increase in the consumption tax, the effect on our key post and beam end-market has been minimal. Post and beam starts were down only 1.5% year-to-date through November and demand for our logs remained solid. In addition, a reduction in Canadian log exports to Japan is driving some Japanese saw millers to seek additional U.S. log supply.","In China, the market for U.S. logs weakened in the fourth quarter as abundant competition from salvaged European spruce logs continued to pressure pricing downward. Total log inventories at Chinese ports increased 6% during the quarter and ended the year at a relatively balanced 3.7 million cubic meters. However, the share of European spruce has continued to grow. Through November, European logs comprised about 17% of China's year-to-date softwood log imports, compared with only 3% in 2018.","Our fourth quarter China export realizations decreased, compared with the third quarter and sales volumes declined. Although demand for our China export logs continues to hold up fairly well, we're choosing to flex volume to the domestic market to capture higher margin opportunities. Compared with the year ago quarter, our total Western log export revenue decreased significantly due to lower sales realizations and volumes in China and Japan.","Moving to the south, Southern Timberlands EBITDA decreased $6 million, compared with the third quarter. Southern log supplies tighten briefly in October, due to wet weather, but normalized quickly thereafter with more favorable operating conditions. Mill inventories remained well supplied through the fourth quarter and our average log realizations decreased 1%.","Fee harvest volumes declined 3%, compared with the third quarter. Although we had hoped to fully catch up on thinning activity postponed during the unusually wet conditions in early 2019, we were unable to complete all of the activity during the fourth quarter. On the export side, we continued to operate our Southern log export business at minimal volumes, due to the ongoing 25% Chinese tariff on Southern yellow pine logs.","Comparing overall Southern Timberlands fourth quarter results with the year ago quarter, EBITDA decreased by $4 million, due to lower fee harvest volumes and higher road costs. This was partially offset by higher average Southern saw log realizations.","Northern Timberlands EBITDA decreased $1 million, compared with third quarter and $3 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. The harvest volumes decreased due to the sale of our Michigan timberlands, which closed in November. Average realizations decreased slightly.","Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, charts eight and nine. Real Estate and ENR contributed $22 million to fourth quarter earnings and $37 million to adjusted EBITDA. For the full-year, the segment generated $274 million of EBITDA, an increase of $10 million from 2018.","Fourth quarter EBITDA was $23 million lower than the third quarter and $53 million lower than a year ago periods, due to the timing of real estate sales. Construction materials and energy royalties also decreased slightly. As expected, the number of acres sold in the fourth quarter decreased significantly, compared with the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2018.","During 2019, our Real Estate sales activity was heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, whereas in 2018, most of our sales occurred in the third and fourth quarters. Average price per acre was comparable to the third quarter and the year ago quarter and average land basis, as a percentage of Real Estate sales, was lower due to the transaction mix.","Wood Products, charts 10 and 11. Wood Products contributed $60 million to fourth quarter earnings and $110 million to adjusted EBITDA. I am very pleased with our fourth quarter Wood Products performance as our teams continue to display an unwavering focus on achieving operational excellence and an industry-leading cost structure. Our results include meaningful operating performance records in each of our four Wood Products businesses.","For both the fourth quarter and full-year 2019, our Lumber and OSB businesses delivered the lowest controllable unit manufacturing costs in our history. Engineered Wood Products reduced controllable spending by over $11 million on a full-year basis and Distribution delivered its highest fourth quarter EBITDA ever.","Compared to fourth quarter 2018, Wood Products EBITDA increased $44 million or over 65%, despite flat lumber realizations and significantly lower pricing for OSB. Compared with the third quarter, EBITDA decreased $13 million as seasonally lower sales volumes were partially offset by record fourth quarter cost performance in Lumber and Oriented Strand Board. EBITDA for Lumber decreased $6 million, compared with the third quarter.","Seasonally lower sales volumes and slightly higher cost for Western and Canadian logs were partially offset by lower controllable manufacturing costs. Although lumber prices continued to trade in a narrow range during the fourth quarter, pricing for many products did recover slightly as stronger housing activity generated incremental demand and channel inventories remains generally low.","On average, the framing lumber composite increased 3% in the fourth quarter, compared with the third. Our average lumber realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Our production mix is more heavily weighted to wide width Southern yellow pine, which saw a 9% decrease in published pricing.","Our Lumber sales volumes decreased 4%, compared with the third quarter and our production volume decreased slightly as we took some additional downtime for maintenance and capital projects. Fourth quarter EBITDA includes $4 million of charges for countervailing and anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. Compared with the year ago quarter, Lumber EBITDA improved by $37 million, due to lower unit manufacturing costs, lower Western log cost and modestly higher sales volumes.","OSB EBITDA improved $6 million, compared with the third quarter. Slightly improved realizations and slightly lower unit manufacturing cost and fiber cost more than offset a 2% decrease in sales volumes. Fourth quarter OSB pricing generally mirrored that of Lumber. The benchmark OSB composite price increased 6%, compared with the third quarter. Our average realizations increased 1% as the length of our order files creates a lag between published and realized pricing.","Comparing our fourth quarter results to the year ago quarter, OSB EBITDA decreased by $12 million. Average sales realizations for OSB decreased by 14%, but this was significantly offset by lower unit manufacturing costs, higher sales volumes and slightly lower fiber costs. ","Engineered Wood Products EBITDA decreased $14 million compared with the third quarter. Sales volumes for both solid section and I-Joists decreased seasonally and dealers and builders sought to minimize the year-end inventories. Although our overall operating rate decreased, unit manufacturing cost improved slightly.","Average sales realizations for I-Joists increased by 1%. Average realizations for solid section products decreased by 1% due to seasonal mix. Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA improved by $15 million, due primarily to lower fiber and unit manufacturing costs. Distribution EBITDA totaled $8 million for the fourth quarter. This is $2 million lower than the third quarter as seasonally lower sales volumes were partially offset by lower warehouse and delivery costs.","Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA increased by $6 million due to higher sales volumes. This improvement is partially attributable to an operational excellence initiative to upgrade the business' product mix.","I\u2019d like to turn now to operational excellence. As a company, we achieved over $100 million of operational excellence improvements in 2019. I am very proud of the hard work, creativity, and cross business collaboration that drilled these results.","Timberlands did a remarkable job in capturing $48 million of improvements, primarily from initiatives to further optimize silviculture, forestry and road activities, reduced costs, and improve log merchandising and marketing to maximize the revenue from every log we harvest.","Wood Products captured $52 million of improvements and has now achieved black at the bottom as we defined it six years ago. Our 2019 improvements in Wood Products came from initiatives in three primary areas; reducing unit manufacturing cost for Lumber and Oriented Strand Board, improving product mix in Lumber and distribution and increasing log recovery across our mill system.","Beyond each business\u2019 individual efforts, we also captured value through initiatives to generate cross business OpEx. Historically, our OpEx focus has been on improved performance within a business segment, but we've also begun to identify opportunities to drive integrated OpEx by increasing collaboration between our Timberlands and Wood Products operations.","The most obvious is further optimizing deliveries of our own logs to our own mills. This year through cross business collaboration, we delivered $7 million of OpEx that improved the margin of both segments.","Our operational excellence program has delivered well over $0.5 billion of company-wide margin improvement since 2014. This is an incredible achievement, but over time, this level of success also means that traditional margin improvement opportunities of this magnitude become harder to capture, so we're taking a fresh look at OpEx and what it means for our company.","As we enter 2020, we are evolving how we define and measure operational excellence at Weyerhaeuser. Operational excellence has been and will continue to be focused on discipline cost management and margin improvements, but we are also expanding OpEx to include activities that drive future value and improve efficiencies across businesses and functions. Our OpEx 2.0, as we're calling it, will include four main components to drive continued improvements across our company.","First is margin improvement. These are the familiar OpEx initiatives focused on improving margin by capturing valuable at both the top and bottom line. Second is future value. These initiatives recognize activities that drive improved value in the future. A good example is working to execute on our targeted thinning reforestation and fertilization programs at the highest levels of quality and completeness.","We know this improves the value of our timberlands over time. Third is cost avoidance. This category is aimed at avoiding future costs or cost increases. Examples might include reducing employee turnover and optimized procurement initiatives. And fourth is efficiency. These initiatives will focus on improvements that enable higher value use of our resources. Examples would include things such as automating manual work or simplifying business processes.","Together, these four categories expand the breadth of OpEx to include every business and function across our company. I'm really excited about the opportunities that OpEx 2.0 creates and the potential it has to further drive our working together culture. In 2020, we\u2019re targeting $50 million to $70 million of additional OpEx improvements from these areas and I look forward to sharing more about our key initiatives as the year progresses.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook.","Russell Hagen","Thanks, Devin, and good morning. Key outlook items of the first quarter and the full-year 2020 are presented on charts 14 and 15 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter, and our Western Timberlands operations demand remains stable throughout the fourth quarter, and mills took advantage of steady product takeaway into January. Log supply is adequate and log inventories remain at reasonable levels.","We expect our first quarter domestic log sales volumes will be higher than the fourth quarter. The seasonally improved demand, we expect average sales realizations will be modestly higher. Western road costs will be lower compared to the fourth quarter as our road work activity slows as we progress through the winter months.","We expect our first quarter Japanese export log sales volumes will increase, compared to the fourth quarter and average log sales realizations will be comparable. Demand for our logs remains solid with additional support from continued disruption of the supply competing with logs coming out of Western Canada.","Our Chinese export log sales volumes will declined in the first quarter and average log sales realizations are expected to be modestly lower in the fourth quarter on softer demand, due to the Lunar New Year and continued competition from the salvage Europeans spruce logs. ","In the South, we anticipate our first quarter fee harvest volumes will be seasonally lower and average log sales realizations are expected to be similar to fourth quarter levels. In the North, first quarter harvest volumes will be lower following the November close of the sale of our Michigan timberlands. Fourth quarter special items include a $48 million pre-tax gain related to that transaction.","In December, we announced an agreement to sell our Montana timberlands for $145 million and recorded an $80 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge in connection with the agreement, which is also included as a special item in our fourth quarter results. The Montana transaction is expected to close in the second quarter and those assets are now listed on our balance sheet as held for sale.","Turning to the full-year 2020, we expect total company harvest volume to be slightly over 36 million tons. We expect our Southern harvest volumes will be comparable 2019 and our harvest volume in the West will be down slightly. In the North, our harvest volumes will approximately be 40% lower than 2019, due to the divestitures of our Michigan and Montana timberlands. Collectively, our Michigan and Montana properties do not generate a meaningful EBITDA contribution to our overall Timberland segment.","In our Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources segment, we continue to see strong interest in real estate across our markets and the Pacific Northwest is particularly active. For the full-year 2020, we expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately $255 million. This guidance incorporates the effects of fewer available real estate acres following the divestitures of Montana and Michigan. We expect the cadence of our 2020 real estate activity will be similar to 2019. We anticipate land basis, as a percentage of real estate sales, will be between 55% and 65% for the year.","For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA for the segment will be nearly comparable to the year ago quarter, while earnings will be approximately $15 million lower. We expect first quarter land basis, as a percentage real estate sales, will be near the high-end of the full-year guidance range.","Across our Wood Products business, our customers expect optimism for the year ahead. Buyers continue to purchase for specific needs and channel inventories are moderate. We anticipate sales volumes for Lumber and Oriented Strand Board will be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter. For Engineered Wood Products, we expect seasonally improved operating rates and lower per unit manufacturing costs in the first quarter.","We expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA for Wood Products segment will be slightly higher than fourth quarter before any benefit from improvement in average sales realizations.","For Lumber, first quarter to-date average sales realizations are $20 higher than the fourth quarter average and current realizations are $25 above the fourth quarter average. Oriented Strand Board first quarter to-date and current average sales realizations are comparable with the fourth quarter average. As a reminder, for Lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. For OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximate $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.","Chart 12 outlines the major components of our fourth quarter unallocated. Unallocated corporate function and variable compensation expense increased, compared to third quarter due to seasonally higher spending and a year-to-date adjustment for incentive compensation. Fourth quarter results also include a small non-cash expense from elimination of profit and inventory and LIFO, compared with an income from this item in the third quarter. Special items in the fourth quarter consist of $6 million non-cash settlement charge related to transfers of Canadian pension assets and liabilities.","In our pension and post retirement plans in 2019, we made significant progress against the series of actions we announced in 2018 to reduce the liabilities associated with those plans, while maintaining benefit security for our plan participants. In the last 18 months, we\u2019ve reduced our future obligations by over $2 billion. The year-end 2019 funded status for our pension and post retirement plans decreased by approximately $200 million, compared to 2018 as a result of a reduction in discount rates.","Discount rates declined by approximately a 100 basis points for the U.S. plans and 60 basis points for the Canadian plans. In 2019, we did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan and we're not required to make any cash contributions in 2020. Cash paid for all of the pension and postretirement plans in 2019 was $45 million. Our required cash payments for these plans will be approximately $30 million for 2020.","Excluding pension settlement charges, our non-cash non-operating pension and postretirement expense was $61 million in 2019. We expect to report approximately $40 million of expense in 2020. The decrease is a reduction \u2013 is a result of the reduction at discount rates.","Turning to our key financial items, which is summarized on chart 13, we ended 2019 with a cash balance of $139 million. Cash from operations during the fourth quarter was $292 million. For the full-year 2019, cash from operations was $966 million. Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $143 million and for the full-year 2019, were $384 million.","Looking ahead into 2020, we anticipate total CapEx will be approximately $360 million, a $120 million for Timberlands inclusive of reforestation costs, $235 million for Wood Products, and approximately $5 million for corporate IT system upgrades.","Investing cash flows for the fourth quarter also included $297 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Michigan timberlands. You\u2019ll also recall that in the third quarter 2019, we paid $302 million to extinguish the debt of a variable interest entity that was established as part of a timber installment sale in the early 2000s. Earlier this month, we received $362 million of cash from the maturity of the related financial instrument. This was the last of these variable interest entities.","Moving onto financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $6.4 billion of total debt outstanding. This included $230 million balance on our line of credit, which was used to bridge the temporary cash outflow associated with the variable interest entity debt maturity. We have no debt maturities until 2021. As you may seen in the 8-K that we filed earlier this week, we refinanced our $1.5 billion revolving line of credit to capture more attractive pricing. The new credit facility has a five-year term that will expire in 2025.","In the fourth quarter, interest expense was $89 million bringing our full-year expense to $366 million, excluding special items. We expect interest expense will be $345 million for the full-year 2020.","I\u2019ll close my comments with taxes. Excluding special items, in the fourth quarter, we reported $2 million of income tax expense. For the full-year 2019, our effective tax rate, before special items, was a benefit of 13%. For first quarter and full-year 2020, we expect a tax expense of 10% to 15% based on the forecasted mix of earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.","Turning to cash taxes, we received $2 million in net tax refund for the full-year 2019 inclusive of a $43 million federal tax refund in the fourth quarter. As previously discussed, we have filed a claim for $90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution and that claim remains in process.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.","Devin Stockfish","Thanks Russell. One year ago, in my first earnings call as CEO, I talked about four near-term priorities to drive value for shareholders. I'm pleased with our execution to-date and our focus on generating superior and sustainable value will continue in 2020 and beyond.","The first priority I highlighted was driving OpEx with a focus on cost and reliability. I'm incredibly proud of our work in OpEx in 2019 and I'm excited about what lies ahead in OpEx 2.0. Second was continuing to drive lasting culture change. We remained focused on the key behaviors that drive success, including accountability and urgency and increasing our focus on innovation across the company.","Third was people development. In 2019, we continued our intense focus on people development and worked to increasingly build our bench of future leaders and key personnel across the organization. And fourth was disciplined capital allocation. We\u2019re committed to our balanced capital allocation philosophy of returning cash to shareholders, investing in our businesses, and maintaining an appropriate capital structure.","In 2019, we continued to deliver on each of these capital allocation priorities. We returned over a billion dollars of cash to shareholders. We invested over $380 million in disciplined capital expenditures to sustain and further improve our businesses, and we took steps to maintain an appropriate capital structure and support our investment-grade credit ratings by reducing our future pension liabilities.","Entering 2020, I'm encouraged that the U.S. housing market continues to show signs of stronger activity. Although pricing for many of our commodity products remain soft, we\u2019re optimistic that we will see continued improvement as we head into the 2020 building season. Going forward, I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us and we remain focused on driving superior long-term value for shareholders by improving performance through operational excellence, fostering a winning and innovative culture that positions us to capitalize on a range of market conditions and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation.","And with that, I\u2019d like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. ","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, good morning. This is [indiscernible] sitting here for Brian.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks for taking my questions. Yes, if we could just go back for a second, Devin, to the comments that you have mentioned around Lumber and OSB, I think you had mentioned a little bit of a lag coming throughout some of the OSB pricing, can we expect that, you know, even holding everything equal to accelerate a little bit as we go through the first quarter just based on some of the gains that we saw exiting 4Q?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, you know, we saw pricing come up a little bit in 4Q. There is little bit of the dip, now it started to come back up. So, as Russell mentioned, quarter-to-date, our OSB realizations are flat relative to the fourth quarter. That being said, you know, certainly I think the market sentiment is that the housing activity is going to continue to improve. We\u2019re seeing a lot of optimism out there. And so, you know, we would anticipate that as we get closer to the 2020 building season and that gets in full swing, we\u2019re going to see some uplift on OSB pricing as we get into the quarter.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, just on the Lumber side, Russell, like you called out is going to be about $20 higher on average. I think current price is about $25 above the fourth quarter average, which is actually a little bit better than I would've expected just looking at the composite. Is that a function of a little bit of a lag as well coming through the income statement? Or is that more just a function of, you know, some of the mix shift, you know, within the product grades that you guys produce?","Russell Hagen","Yes, that would be more attributable to the mix shift of what we produce in our Lumber operations.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks guys.","Devin Stockfish","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. ","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Devin. Good morning, Russell. ","Devin Stockfish","Good morning, Mark.","Russell Hagen ","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde ","Devin, I wondered \u2013 is it possible to get some sense for where you see the land sales per year over the next three to five years if we exclude kind of Northern Timberlands?","Russell Hagen","Sure, Mark. This is Russell. So, as we noted, we\u2019re going to bring down the real estate EBITDA a little bit from this year, from 2019. It\u2019s really two things that are happening in there. The first is on the Energy & Natural Resource side. We had a couple of one-time type transactions. We had a small asset sale, and then, we had some recoveries on a royalty audit. And then, we\u2019re also factoring in less HBU sales coming out of that Montana and Michigan properties. ","You know, the Michigan properties are sold. Montana, we\u2019re expecting to close in the second quarter of this year. And so, you know, with that \u2013 that gives us that $255 million number for 2020. Kind of on a run rate basis, I think that $250 million to $255 million is a reasonable number for the run rate for that business. You know as we\u2019ve stated in the past, our goal is to structure that total AVO program in the pipeline so that we have a sustainable business over time so.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then, just as a follow-on, I\u2019d like to just kind of step back and think about sort of leveraging your franchise. You know with the global will focus on sustainability and carbon capture only going up, any thoughts on ways to kind of both leverage your expertise, but also the strong kind of social and environmental reputation that Weyerhaeuser has?","Russell Hagen","Yes, absolutely Mark. I would say tell you that's top of mind for us. As you know, there has been a lot of momentum around, you know, wood-based building for one, but also, you know, as we see more and more companies talking about, you know, becoming carbon neutral or carbon negative. Our view is, you know, practically speaking that's going to be very hard to do without looking to the forest and our ability to sequester carbon. And so, you know, I think that is getting a lot of discussion, a lot of talk in the industry. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very focused on.","You know, candidly it\u2019s in the early stages of figuring out what the mechanics for that market are going to look like. You know there's a private market piece to that. There\u2019s a regulatory piece to that, but we\u2019re staying very focused on it. You know clearly I feel pretty comfortable in saying no organization in the history of America has planted more trees than Weyerhaeuser company. So, that is an area where we have deep expertise and I think there may be a role for us to play. So, we\u2019re keeping a very close watch on that and we\u2019ll look for an opportunity to participate in a profitable way as that develops.","Mark Wilde","Would that include kind of structures beyond just outright ownership of timberland?","Devin Stockfish","You know, I think we\u2019re at a state right now, Mark, where we\u2019re really looking our all different kinds of opportunities. So, I think at this juncture, I wouldn't foreclose any of those options.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Very good. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Devin Stockfish","Thanks Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. ","Collin Mings","Thanks. Good morning, everyone.","Devin Stockfish ","Good morning, Collin.","Russell Hagen","Good morning.","Collin Mings ","First for me, just can you elaborate on your full-year outlook for the export markets and harvest plans in the West, how much of the downtick in harvest this year represents just a continued normalization of volume versus the response to some of the headwinds that you alluded to in the prepared remarks about the European sourced wood and other things impacting the Asia markets?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, let me start with the Western harvest levels. Now, really to understand what's going on in the West, you have to go back to our Longview Timber acquisition, and you\u2019ll recall that when we did that deal, one of the benefits of that transaction was that they had a significant amount of over matured timber in their portfolio. And so, for several years after that acquisition, we were intentionally bringing that harvest level or harvest age down, which increased our harvest levels in the West.","Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve really been on the tail-end of that. And so, as we roll into 2020, you know, that volume that we\u2019re anticipating in the West, which is, you know, down around 3% versus 2019, you know, that's what I would expect all else being equal to be the harvest levels for the next several years before it starts coming up again. And so, that's really the answer on the harvest. Now, you know, frankly you can flex up or flex down a little bit depending on market conditions, and we do that from time-to-time, but, you know, the 2020 harvest schedule really is kind of that normalized harvest level in the West for the next several years.","You know, speaking to the export markets, and I\u2019ll start with China, you know, really last year, for most of the year, even though, you know, there was more European salvage wood coming into the market, I would say, for the first three quarters it wasn't having a material impact on our export volumes to that China market out of the Northwest. We really did see in the fourth quarter that European salvage wood started to have an impact in the China market, and we really started to see that impact, you know, our pricing certainly as we got deeper into the fourth quarter.","You know, as we think about the magnitude of that European salvage wood going into the market and you combine that with what is traditionally a pretty slow time of the year with the Lunar New Year holiday in that market, and you also have the dynamic of the coronavirus and so, you know, I would expect the China market for us out of the Pacific Northwest is going to be choppy for a little while. The Japan market, you know, frankly, remains solid for us.","You\u2019ve seen housing starts dip down just a little bit, but the key market for us, as I mentioned earlier, is that post and beam market, and that's held up pretty well and you combine that with some of the challenges from the Canadian log exports, we\u2019re still seeing good volume and sales activity into the Japan market this year. ","Collin Mings","Thank you for all the detail there, Devin. Just switching gears to kind of OpEx 2.0, can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on where you are targeting the $50 million to $70 million just across the four different buckets you outlined? Specifically, how much would maybe fall into that margin bucket and that efficiency bucket?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, you know, I think we\u2019re still in the early stages of rolling this out to the organization, but what I would say is, you know, going into the year, I would still anticipate the majority of that is going to come from that margin bucket, the future value, efficiency and cost avoidance are new pieces of that program. And so, we do think that that will pick up steam as we roll it out to the organization, but I would say sitting here right now, most of that $50 million to $70 million for year-one is going to come out of the margin bucket.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then, switching to Russell, can you just may be touch a little bit more on the AVO process and where that stands, again, recognizing that is fluid, but there was also a number of large sales in 2019? Are there any other large transactions that you are going to be pursuing in kind of the foreseeable future? Or you feel like a lot of the heavy lifting as far as the non-core asset sales is complete for at least for now?","Russell Hagen","So, I\u2019ll talk to the AVO and then I\u2019ll talk to kind of your second question on large transactions. You know, the AVO process, as you\u2019re aware, that\u2019s a \u2013 really an evergreen process. So, we\u2019re constantly evaluating our timberlands to determine, you know, for the best owner of that particular tract or if we can capture a higher value by selling it through our AVO process. So, as we\u2019ve noted, we have about \u2013 you know, at the beginning of the year, we had 1.6 million acres identified in the AVO process that we would take to market over the next 10 to 15 years. You know as I stated earlier, our goal is to have a sustainable business over time.","So, as far as large transactions, you know, I\u2019m not going to comment on our \u2013 on kind of our future expectations related to large transactions, but you know, I'll reiterate, you know, even on the AVO process, we still look even on a broader basis across the portfolio and make sure that the timberlands that we own are returning the highest value and we get a good return on assets. And so, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past, we have sold out of markets that are not strategic to us for the long-term, but I think as we look at our portfolio today, we have no immediate plans.","Collin Mings","Thank you both. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Devin Stockfish","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Mark Weintraub with Seaport.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. Two follow ups really. The first, thank you for that information on the Western harvest, by the way, that\u2019s completely consistent with the presentation you did back in December 2016, where you show exactly as you laid out. That same presentation, it shows that the Southern harvest would likely be increasing during the [2017 through 2026 time horizon] and I realized maybe there are some sales of acreage, etcetera perhaps, but what\u2019s the outlook for the Southern harvest relative to the levels we saw in 2019 and what you seem to be suggesting for 2020?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, Mark, you know, and those are always fluid, you know, through the real estate programs. You get puts and takes here and there. You know, we're not in a position right now I think to give public guidance on the long-term other than to say, you know, in 2020 for the South, we\u2019re looking at comparable. You know, we do have a little bit heavier mix to fiber for 2020, but I \u2013 you know it's going to be pretty consistent within the range that we have in 2020.","Mark Weintraub","And maybe it\u2019s not a fair question on a spot moment, but is the typo \u2013 is there any reason why the general direction you would have been expecting a couple years ago wouldn't still be applicable today?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. I think, you know, over time certainly as we have new generations of seedlings come ready for harvest, you\u2019d expect the volumes to go up over time. So, you know, directionally I don't think anything has changed. You know the timing of it, you have a little bit of up and down on any particular year to basis, but directionally over time, I don't think anything's changed.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And on the European spruce salvage wood, any intelligence at this point as to how long this issue is likely to be with us?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. So, you know, I\u2019ll tell you what I do know and then what I don't know and I'll start with what we think we know, which is, you know, unlike what we saw with the mountain pine beetle in British Columbia, the spruce beetle in Europe seems to leave that wood salvageable for a much lower period and I think the general consensus that\u2019s building is, you know, one to three years on the stump is really as long as it's viable after you see that damage. The question that's harder to answer frankly is, you know, when is the infestation going to abate. And so, I don't know that we have a definitive view or if anyone has a definitive view on when that damage spruce beetle wood is going to stop growing across Europe.","And so, you know, I do think our view is we've seen the geographies where you have that impacted wood acting speedily to try to get out in front of it and salvage as much of that timber as they can, but as a practical matter, there are limits on how much you can do that. So, you know, it's hard to say how long it's going to last when you really start seeing the spruce beetle die off. I think it will be a limited time period after that when you should see the volume start to slow down. ","Mark Weintraub","And so, is it fair to surmise recognizing lots of uncertainty here that it\u2019s probably going to be with us for a couple of years, but then at some point in time, you end up having less wood coming from Europe than even prior to the infestation beginning, is that how to think about it?","Devin Stockfish","That\u2019s correct. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re viewing it. You know we\u2019re going to \u2013 I think this is going to be with us for, you know, a year or two, but, you know, as you say, it's important to remember when that volume goes away, it\u2019s going to have to be filled in from somewhere else. And so, when you have that significant amount of wood that goes out of the system, it is going to change kind of the global supply chains for log supply.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you.","Devin Stockfish ","Yes, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover","Thanks, good morning, everyone. ","Devin Stockfish ","Good morning.","Russell Hagen ","Good morning.","Steve Chercover ","So, first question, on your website, Montana is included in the Western US acreage, but the volume is evidently coming out of the Northern fee harvest, so is that because the log prices in Montana are closer to Northeast values?","Russell Hagen","You know, Steve, when we actually put together the regions, at time of the merger, we had put that Montana property in that Northern region. And so, we\u2019ve always reported that Montana property in the Northern region and then Washington and Oregon in the Western region. It is a different, you know, product, a little different pricing, so that\u2019s just how we set it up at the time of the merger.","Steve Chercover","Okay. So, from a financial standpoint both of \u2013 all that land is Northern. So, I wanted to get a sense on the impact then of \u2013 the financial impact on the sales, would it be fair to say that given the aggregate sales price of $445 million, the EBITDA was around $20 million. Is that [indiscernible]?","Russell Hagen","No. I think in the last call what we had mentioned is full-year 2018 was about $19 million and you\u2019ll see full-year 2019 at about $15 million, so we would expect that Montana and Michigan to be about half of that number.","Steve Chercover","Okay, thanks for that. And just one other quick one, can you elaborate what you mean by innovation? Is it new product development in wood products? Or is it along the lines of log optimizations by end-market?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. You know, I\u2019d say the majority of that is operational innovation. So, that's things like leveraging technology within the mills or out in the woods to drive down log and haul cost, to optimize how we build roads, to, you know, mechanized things in the mills. That\u2019s the majority of it at this point. You know we do \u2013 in our Wood Products business, we do product innovation as well, but when we talk about the majority of the innovation work that we've done here over the last year or two has really been more around operational innovation.","Steve Chercover","Got it. Okay, thank you both.","Devin Stockfish","Thank you.","Russell Hagen","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul Quinn","Yes, thanks very much. Good morning guys.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning.","Russell Hagen","Good morning.","Paul Quinn","Hey, just have a question around CapEx and thanks for the detailed break down into the buckets, but that $235 million you\u2019re spending on Wood Products maybe if you could highlight some of the bigger project? And is there any volume gains that you expect to get over time on some of these projects going forward?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. You know with the $235 million, which is down about $15 million from 2019 and partially that's just a reflection of the fact that as we finish up on the Dierks and Millport, capital projects were \u2013 which were much larger in scale, we just have a larger number of smaller activity in the CapEx bucket across Wood Products. And so, I don't have anything, you know, significant to highlight of the, you know, Millport or Dierks magnitude. It\u2019s really just a lot of all are CapEx projects that are really focused on, you know, driving down cost, improving reliability, and really driving efficiencies in the mill set. You\u2019ll get some incremental around the margins volume pick up with some of those, but, you know, the volume increase really isn\u2019t the primary focus of our capital programs at present.","Paul Quinn","Okay, thanks for that. And then, just maybe I \u2013 just \u2013 trying to understand what\u2019s going on in Timberlands transactions, haven't seen that many transactions. We\u2019ve had, you know, interest rates go up in 2018 and then come down 2019 and 2020. I suspect that\u2019s had some kind of effect on valuations, maybe you could just help me understand what\u2019s going on in the market?","Russell Hagen","Sure. This is Russell. You know on 2019, based on kind of our listing of all the transactions, we\u2019re expecting to hit about $1.8 billion and we really didn't see any big deals like we saw in 2018. We saw probably four deals in 2019 over $100 million, and then, remainder were small and medium deals. So about 3 million acres looks like it's going to trade in 2019, so that's about 2%, 2.5% of the investable market.","That seems kind of on par with what we've seen over the last few years. I think as we look into 2020, I would expect we would break that $2 billion transaction value number. And when you take the Poke deal, and then, the recent announcement we made on the Montana deal, you add about $800 million, and so, it's pretty strong start of the year given we\u2019re in January. ","As far as timber values, I would say they remained strong even with the soft product pricing in 2019. We really didn\u2019t see big value swings in the timberland values and I think that reflects more of the longer term nature that the investors have in this space and companies have in this space. So, you know, we\u2019re still seeing a strong flow of capital to good deals and the right deals and quality timberlands remain in high demand. Yes, and as we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re in a pretty advantage position. We have timberlands in every major wood basket in the United States and we have the opportunity to see every transaction and so. You know we\u2019re active, but we\u2019re also very disciplined in our acquisition strategy.","Paul Quinn","Thanks for the help. Good luck.","Devin Stockfish ","Thanks.","Russell Hagen ","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes in the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip Dillon","Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the details. You know, as you look at the long-term future, Japan's population obviously is shrinking and obviously there are other parts of Asia where demand could certainly get better for your timber. How do you think about those long-term trends? I mean have you done some work on where you think five, 10 years from now you'll see both of, you know, Japan and other Asian markets, especially as it really has a big impact on your Western Timberland profitability?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, absolutely. We do spend a lot of time doing analytics around that and, you know, with respect to Japan, you're absolutely right. The demographics are such that the population is declining and that is clearly going to have an impact on housing over time. You know, I think a couple things that may mitigate the impact on us however or again, you know, our focus is primarily that post and beam market and I think that is going to hold share and pick up share of overall housing starts in Japan over time. And so, I think the impact in us will be less than on kind of the stick frame.","The second thing I would say is, you know, just like in the United States and Europe, Japan is looking for opportunities to do more commercial and multi-story buildings out of wood. And so, I think there's an opportunity to pick up share on that front as well to mitigate some of the impacts from population decline on housing. But you're right, in a broader sense, you know, Japan's population is not growing. There are other economies across Asia where we do see growing populations. And so whether you're thinking China or India or some of the other Southeast Asian markets that are experiencing growth, we\u2019ve spent a lifetime on the ground in all of those markets.","We have, you know, in China in particular a pretty strong customer base. And so, you know, one of our focus areas is to continue to grow market in China and ultimately other markets for some of those higher end Douglas fir products, and, you know, we think over time, we\u2019ll make good progress on that.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. ","Mark Connelly","Thank you. If we assume that the labor issues in construction persists, do you think we\u2019re going to start seeing builders more aggressively embrace either prefab components or some other labor reduction? Or is there enough other issues like lot availability that they just don't have enough incentive to change the way they operate yet?","Devin Stockfish","Well, I do you think that you're starting to see some of the builders, particularly the larger builders, embrace panelization, off-site construction activities and I do think that trend will continue. There are limits on how high that can go, but I do think we've reached a point where, you know, the labor constraints have caused many of the builders to really start to look for other options to mitigate that challenge.","So, I do you think you're going to see that grow. The labor availability I think still remains one of the biggest challenges for the builders in both, you know, just meeting the construction needs, but also with the affordability pace. And so, I do think that they're going to continue to look for ways to mitigate those labor challenges.","Mark Connelly","So, is there an opportunity for Weyerhaeuser in that to get involved in more of that process?","Devin Stockfish","You know, I think in the near term, you know, the biggest opportunity for us is to stay close to those in-customers and the builders and various folks throughout the channel that are doing that work. I think our biggest opportunity short-term is just to be a key supplier making sure we understand, you know, what the needs are in those panelized construction activities and be a good solid partner for them. I don't anticipate us getting into panelized manufacturing here in the near term. You know longer term, obviously, we\u2019ll continue to watch the market and if our view changes on the ability to create value in that space, you know, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily rule that out, but I don't think that's a short-term priority for us.","Mark Connelly","Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Just one other question, with all the supply distortions and issues we had in the South last year, do you think private landowners are caught up on the land they wanted to sell? Or is there still a backlog there [indiscernible]?","Russell Hagen","Yes, this is Russell. Pardon me.","Mark Connelly ","Sorry, I said land. I meant stumpage.","Russell Hagen ","On the stumpage side. You know I would say that probably the markets were a little slower last year as far as getting contractors and broker dealers out onto those non-industrial private lands. I think that's what you're referring to.","Mark Connelly","Yes.","Russell Hagen","So, we don't have a real clean gauge on what those volumes are, but I would expect that, you know, that will still be an area of focus for the non-industrial privates probably coming into this year and maybe the following years.","Mark Connelly ","Okay, very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our last question will come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","John Babcock","Hi, good morning. It is actually John Babcock on the line for George. Just wanted to thank you for taking my questions. Just starting out, I was wondering if you could talk about which products are likely to see the incremental benefit from kind of this new OpEx set up. And also, you know, if you could kind of give some weighting as to, you know, which product lines that might be helpful too.","Devin Stockfish","Yes, you know I think just at a high level, you know, we would anticipate it\u2019s kind of going to be evenly split between Wood Products and Timberlands. you know I think one of the differences that we\u2019re looking at from OpEx 2.0 is we\u2019re really looking to expand it and how we measure it beyond just the businesses defined opportunities even at a functional level, increase the level of cross business OpEx that we\u2019re trying to drive. You know, so that may -- you know that may change how the buckets are allocated a little bit around the margins, but going in, we would anticipate that would be kind of half-and-half Wood Products and Timberlands.","John Babcock","Thank you. And then, can you review the key point as to, you know, why the Montana timberland sales made sense from both the strategic and valuation standpoint?","Russell Hagen","Sure. This is Russell. There's two things I guess I would point out on that transaction. You know the first is, you know, over the last number years, we've been very active in capturing value on those lands. We\u2019ve done conservation sales, higher and better use sales. You know, we\u2019ve also done some timber transactions. So, we really have a lot of opportunities to understand the market and kind of with the future value that land would be to us. So, the second is, when we go through our evaluation process, it\u2019s very detailed and robust.","So, we look at a number of things when coming to evaluation on a particular property and we look at the markets, we look at stocking levels, age class, growing cycles, PC mix, you know, cost inputs. Those are all taken into consideration when we assess the value, but also when we assessed fit for our broader portfolio strategy.","So, you know, based on our experience in these markets and in our expectations and what we\u2019ve achieved as far as capturing value on the portfolio today, we are very comfortable with how that sale fits into our broader strategy and we\u2019re very pleased with the price we\u2019re receiving for the timberlands.","John Babcock","Yes, thank you. That\u2019s all I have.","Devin Stockfish","Alright. Well, I believe that was the final question. So, thank you to everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser Company.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth L. Baum - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.","On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $130 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.9 billion. Our third quarter results include after-tax special items of $129 million, primarily related to previously announced charges for product remediation.","Excluding these special items, we earned $259 million, or $0.34 per diluted share for the third quarter. This is an improvement of over 20% compared with second quarter 2017 and 50% higher than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $569 million, 12% more than the second quarter and over 30% higher than one year ago.","I am very pleased with our third quarter operating performance. Employees across the company worked together to overcome a variety of weather-related challenges and each of our businesses delivered strong operating results including another record quarter for Wood Products adjusted EBITDA.","We also continue to deliver on our efforts to simplify our operations and strategically optimize our Timberland portfolio by completing the sale of our Uruguay operations for over $400 million and then October redeeming our ownership interest in the Twin Creeks joint venture and announcing an agreement to sell 100,000 acres of non-strategic Southern Timberlands for $225,000 per acre. We have also eliminated over 80% of the cost formerly allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business and remain on track to achieve the full $35 million of reductions by year-end.","Before I discuss our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. The U.S. housing market continues its upward trajectory. Although September housing starts weakened sequentially as hurricane suspended construction activity, single family starts rose 6% year-over-year in September and are up over 9% year-to-date. With construction labor temporarily drawn to the repairing model activity to support hurricane recovery efforts, we now expect total housing starts of approximately $1.2 million in 2017.","With continued favorable housing market fundamentals including solid single-family permit activity, strong builder confidence, rising employment and wages, and consumer confidence at 13 year highs, we continue to anticipate steady improvement in the housing market for several years to come.","Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $131 million to earnings before special items compared with $135 million in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $220 million. Western Timberlands delivered $111 million third quarter EBITDA, $13 million lower than the second quarter but $2 million more than a year ago. Fee harvest volumes declined 16% compared with the second quarter.","Mandatory state fire restrictions limited working hours for our Washington and Oregon crews in July and August and forced us out of the woods completely for up to two weeks in September. This year's Western fire season was extremely severe, but we experienced no material damage to our timberlands. All Western Timberlands employees did an outstanding job of proactively assessing fire risk and rapidly deploying resources as needed, and less than 1,000 of our 2.9 million Western acres were affected.","The severe fire season limited log availability, driving strong Western domestic market conditions throughout the quarter. Mill inventories remain tight and pricing for domestic logs improved moderately due to continued steady demand. Export demand also remained favorable, with higher log sales volumes and realizations across all markets. In Japan, year-to-date housing starts have risen 1% through August and post-and-beam starts are up 2%. Our customers log and finished product inventories are relatively low and demand for our logs remains solid.","In China, demand is steady and pricing strengthened as customers competed against strong demand from U.S. domestic buyers. Log inventories at Chinese ports were stable throughout the quarter and remain within a normal range.","Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $95 million to third quarter EBITDA, $4 million more than the second quarter. Fee harvest volumes increased compared with the second quarter but were modestly lower than planned as most Southern regions lost a few production days due to hurricane activity. We experienced no material damage to our Southern lands and our employees and contractors did an excellent job of safely staging equipment to avoid damage, and enable crews to resume operations as quickly as possible.","Overall Southern market conditions improved during the third quarter as wet weather limited log availability, and Southern sawlog realizations increased slightly compared with second quarter. Our average log realizations were comparable to second quarter as third quarter included a higher proportion of pulpwood due to seasonal thinning activity. Forestry cost increased slightly.","Northern Timberlands contributed $4 million to EBITDA, $2 million more than the second quarter. Fee harvest volumes increased seasonally, but were less than planned as mandatory fire restrictions curtailed harvest activity in Montana for nearly six weeks. Average realizations declined due to mix. Timberlands continues to make strong progress on its operational excellence initiatives and is well positioned to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for 2017.","Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real estate and ENR contributed $47 million to third quarter earnings, an improvement of $24 million compared with second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA doubled to $74 million. The average price per acre sold was lower than second quarter, as third quarter included a large sale of lower value Montana acres.","Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $241 million to third quarter earnings before special items, an increase of $3 million compared with second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved $4 million to $278 million. EBITDA for lumber totaled $117 million, $10 million lower than the second quarter.","Sales volumes declined approximately 4% as we were forced to curtail operations at our Princeton, British Columbia mill for over a month due to a nearby forest fire. Log cost for our Canadian and Western mills also increased. These factors were partially offset by a 2% increase in average lumber sales realizations.","Although log availability was challenging in the West due to fires and in the South due to extremely wet weather, our Timberlands and Wood Products teams work together to develop creative solutions and keep our mills running. Our Western operations expensed no log-related downtime in the quarter, and we lost only a few operating shifts across our Southern lumber system.","OSB contributed $102 million to EBITDA, $15 million more than the second quarter and nearly $40 million more than a year ago. Average sales realizations improved 11% compared with the second quarter. Operating rates and sales volumes declined slightly due to a small increase in planned maintenance downtime.","Engineered wood products contributed $50 million to EBITDA compared with $52 million in the second quarter. Manufacturing costs increased due to rising fiber prices for fiber, resin and OSB, and seasonally higher maintenance. This was largely offset by improved sales realizations as we captured most of the remaining benefit from price increases implemented during the first half of this year.","Distribution contributed $12 million to third quarter EBITDA, $1 million lower than the second quarter, but $5 million more than third quarter 2016 despite direct hurricane activity in several of our markets. Our Houston, Atlanta and Jacksonville employees did an exceptional job of developing and implementing plans to keep our associates safe and resume operations as fast as possible following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. All three sites fully rebounded from storms with negligible damage and resumed normal operations within several days.","Each of the Wood Products businesses is on track to achieve their respective OpEx initiatives, and we remain confident we will deliver collective benefits of $55 million to $75 million from this segment in 2017.","I will now give a brief update on remediation efforts for our Flak Jacket product. We are absolutely committed to doing the right thing to take care of our customers and resolve this situation as quickly as possible. As of yesterday, remediation was complete or underway in over 80% of the affected houses. We expect the vast majority of the work will be completed by year-end with a significant portion of the costs covered by insurance.","I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. Through most of the third quarter, Canadian softwood lumber imports were subject to preliminary combined countervailing and antidumping duties of 25% to 30%.","On August 25, the countervailing duties which were assessed at approximately 20% for most producers were statutorily suspended pending the International Trade Commission's final determination of injury. U.S. continues to collect preliminary antidumping duties which are assessed at approximately 7% for most producers.","The Department of Commerce is collecting and evaluating additional information to support its determination regarding final countervailing and antidumping duty levels. We expect that determination to be released no later than November 14. We anticipate the collection of countervailing duties will resume around year-end following the ITC's final determination regarding material injury to U.S. producers. The U.S. coalition continues to work closely with the Department of Commerce, and we remain hopeful we will be able to negotiate a quota-based agreement.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the fourth quarter as presented in chart 12 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million higher compared to third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we anticipate fourth quarter fee harvest volumes to be higher than third quarter as we plan to make up most of the third quarter volume loss due to summer fire restrictions.","We anticipate domestic sales realizations will increase in the fourth quarter as demand remains solid and mills looked to build inventories in advance of winter weather. Japanese export log sales volumes will increase modestly compared to third quarter volumes while average sales realizations are expected to be slightly higher compared to the third quarter supported by continued solid demand in the Japanese housing market. Chinese export log volumes and average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. Western road spending was delayed in the third quarter due to fire restrictions. Spending in the fourth quarter will increase as we expect to complete the deferred roadwork by year-end.","In the South, we expect slightly higher harvest volumes as we make up for volume not harvested in the third quarter due to hurricanes and wet weather. We anticipate average sales realizations for the fourth quarter will be comparable to third quarter results. Forestry spending in the South is expected to increase as we deferred activities from the third quarter into the fourth quarter due to wet weather. We also expect hauling costs will increase as we compete with hurricane recovery efforts, which is increasing demand for truck transportation.","In the North, we anticipate fourth quarter sales volumes and sales realizations to be comparable to the third quarter. As Doyle mentioned, on October 12, 2017, we announced the redemption of our ownership interest in the Twin Creeks joint venture and the termination of the management agreement, which will occur at year-end. The Twin Creeks activity was reported in Other Timberlands and will no longer be included in our results starting in the fourth quarter.","Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to significantly increase as compared to third quarter as the fourth quarter is when we typically expect the largest portion of our real estate transactions to close. We continue to see strong HBU interest in activity across our markets, although transaction volumes in several Southern markets have paused temporarily following hurricane activity. We currently expect approximately $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources business in 2017.","Turning to Wood Products, we anticipate fourth quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to third quarter. Strong demand and low inventories throughout the supply chain have led to historically strong October pricing for lumber and OSB. Overall, we expect modestly higher quarter-over-quarter lumber and OSB sales realizations, and slightly higher engineered wood product sales realizations. Sales volume for lumber and OSB will be comparable with the third quarter.","In addition, we expect a slight increase in log cost for our Western lumber production compared with the third quarter. We expect the decrease in engineered wood products sales volumes in the fourth quarter as well as higher input costs and increase per unit manufacturing cost due to planned seasonal and maintenance downtime.","Chart 11 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of nearly $500 million. Cash from operations during the quarter was $323 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $97 million. And we continue to expect our full year capital expenditures to total approximately $435 million, $300 million for Wood Products, and $135 million for Timberlands. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is historically the highest quarter of capital spending. Investing cash flows for the quarter also included $403 million of proceeds from the sale of our Uruguay operations.","Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with $6 billion of debt outstanding. During the quarter, we completed the refinancing of our $550 million term loan which was scheduled to mature in 2020, replacing it with a new $225 million term loan maturing in 2026 and prepaying $325 million.","In addition, we paid down a scheduled bond maturity of $281 million during the quarter. Interest expense was $98 million in the quarter, a slight decrease from the second quarter due to a lower average balance of debt outstanding that resulted from the debt pay-down during the third quarter.","And now, I'll turn it back to Doyle and look forward to your questions.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Russell. I am proud of our third quarter performance as employees across our businesses and functions once again worked together to overcome challenges and produce strong operating results. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering continued operational improvements and capturing the full benefit of market conditions to drive value for our shareholders.","With that, we would like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question from the line of Mark Weintraub of The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Just one sort of maintenance fee type one. The $20 million in other in the unallocated items, was that reversal of LIFO or what was that $20 million?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Mark, this is Russell. That $20 million is really related one-time gains of sale assets and some operational true-ups, so we wouldn't expect that to occur in the fourth quarter.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Any single significant one or multitude of smaller items?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Really it's multitude of smaller items. We sold some surplus offices and we had some true-ups on some gain calculations.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And any updated thoughts on Southern saw timber pricing and the outlook for next year. It does seem there's been an acceleration of capacity announcements for additional lumber. And just wanted to get your updated thoughts on where that supply-demand balance in saw timber is and when an inflection point might conceivably be reached and we get some improvement in pricing?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah, Mark. And we do think there's some potential for some pricing traction as we enter 2018, really driven by four things. Number one, as we mentioned, housing demand continues to grow and we are constructive on housing as we move into 2018. Secondly, as you just highlighted, more capacity is being added, and I'm particularly encouraged by number of recent announcements, including GP announced a greenfield mill in Talladega and said they are evaluating potential additions in Georgia, Texas or Mississippi, all of which would be good locations. Canfor said they are going to increase their Southern production by 300 million board feet and they're evaluating a potential greenfield mill in the South.","I think this week's announcement of Potlatch and Deltic getting together and their intent to significantly increase lumber production. West Fraser's purchase of Gilman and their plan to increase capital spending, our 300 million board feet of additional capacity at Dierks and Millport that we've talked about. And all of that is on top of about 1.2 billion board feet of additional lumber capacity that's happening in 2017. So, all of that is good on the demand side.","The other thing I would point out \u2013 or two other things I'd point out is the Softwood Lumber Agreement. We do fundamentally believe there's going to be less lumber coming in from Canada, either as a result of final duties or hopefully a negotiated agreement. And then the final factor is we're really encouraged by the development of the Southern export markets. We are now shipping to India out of Charleston, South Carolina. We're shipping to China out of the Wilmington, North Carolina. We're continuing to work to develop exports out of other ports including some in the Gulf South. And while it's still early on that, those volumes as we've previously said could be equivalent to a small mill in the 2018 timeframe. So, we think all of those factors are coming together. And as I've said, we are hopeful that we could see some pricing traction on Southern sawlogs beginning in 2018.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","That's super helpful. And lastly tying into that, as you think about the dividend is that mostly going to be determined by what you're expecting to happen in timber profitability? Or the strength that we've had in Wood Products, is that enough that it really does factor into your willingness to move sooner rather than later on the dividend degrees of magnitude?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Sure. So, let me give you some thoughts on that. Yeah. We are as we've said committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. And going forward, the board will continue to regularly review the dividend in light of a full range of external market conditions as well as our internal improvement.","As you very well know, our largest asset is our Southern Timberlands, and we expect the biggest driver for a substantial dividend increase, will be improving pricing for Southern sawlogs as we just talked about, as that will generate a sustainable and growing earnings stream that provides strong support for the dividend over time.","With that said, there may be opportunities for incremental increases before that occurs. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thanks a lot.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I had a question on the OSB market. Prices have obviously rocketed up following the hurricanes. Can you give us a little color in terms of what you're seeing in the OSB market right now in terms of pricing and demand?","And then, in terms of your ability to meet customer demand in 4Q, I think you said sales volumes in 4Q for OSB would be similar to 3Q. I think, normally, those volumes kind of fall seasonally. If you're running involves (24:01) kind of floppish sequentially, is that you're just running at higher operating rates or are you deferring maintenance or debottlenecking some capacity? Just any kind of color you can give on OSB market and your ability to meet customer demand would be helpful?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. So, you're exactly right. OSB markets have been very strong. And I would tell you current realizations for Weyerhaeuser are approximately $40 above the third quarter average, and that's been primarily driven by just underlying strong demand and thin inventories.","Anthony, as we look into the fourth quarter, nothing customary what's going on there. As we said, we did take a little bit of downtime in the third quarter for maintenance. We'll take a little bit in the fourth quarter, but we're not doing anything to try to adjust from a market perspective. That's just how the maintenance fell during the year.","But we continue to be optimistic about OSB markets. As we all know, we are moving into a little bit slower seasonal period, so that may have some impact. But we continue to be constructive on OSB markets as we move through the fourth quarter and into next year.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, you announced the Twin Creeks exit earlier this month. Can you remind us why that didn't fit Weyerhaeuser's portfolio versus when Plum Creek entered that JV? And then, when you think about the opportunity to acquire timberlands, are you seeing compelling opportunities in the South, any specific regions, and is valuation an obstacle?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","So, Anthony. This is Russell. As far as Twin Creeks, you're right, that was originally formed by Plum Creek with institutional investors, and then Silver Creek was the manager of kind of the overall relationship. We did close on that transaction last April. Weyerhaeuser had the property management requirements for that, and then we retained a 21% equity interest.","As we look at our 13-million-acre portfolio today and the strength of our balance sheet, we really don't need a structure like that to continue to grow the business. When we had originally \u2013 or when we had closed in April, we shortened the timeframe from the original 15 years that was negotiated by Plum Creek down to three years, with the intent of having a transition out of the venture, and we had the opportunity to exit the venture a little early, and so we took that opportunity.","As far as acquiring timberlands. Go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. No. Just from here on out, in terms of interest level and opportunities in the South, how do you characterize it?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Sure. We see strong timber pricing in the South. And fortunately, we're in every wood basket in the Southern market. And so we have an opportunity to see really everything that's coming into the market and then everything that's adjacent to us in those markets. So if we see an opportunity to acquire that fits our portfolio and creates shareholder value, we'll pursue that.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. I'd like to actually, Russell and Doyle, just come back on that last question. I thought a couple of quarters ago that you were suggesting the real focus was on the integration of the two companies rather than acquisitions. Is that view now shifted as you get deeper into the integration of the two companies?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. Good question, Mark. And we're about 18 months into the integration of the two companies. I can tell you at least from my perspective, it has gone very well. We still have some work to do, but most of the hard lifting is behind us. As you know, we exceeded our original synergy target and continue to make improvements by implementing the best practices from each company. So as we look forward, we would consider potentially \u2013 potential acquisitions.","With that said, we're going to be very disciplined, Mark, as we move forward. As Russell said, we are in every major market in the South. We have a good presence in the West. So, we don't feel compelled to grow because we are in every market, so we will be very disciplined, and look for opportunities where we can clearly create value for our shareholders through timberland growth opportunities.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. And then, Doyle, just kind of turning to that Southern Lumber issue because you're correct. You pointed out a number of these initiatives that are out there, and from what we understand in the market, there's actually even more behind that potentially. Are you guys looking at any potentially a greenfield or the acquisition of more lumber capacity? Or indeed, what would be your view sort of overall on kind of growing the Wood Products portfolio?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. And so, as we look at potential growth of the company, as we very consistently said, we think our biggest opportunities will be in timberland. With that said, we would absolutely look at what I would call bolt-on acquisitions in the lumber business especially if it met up with our strategic footprint on our timberlands.","In terms of growing capacity, I think our bigger opportunities, Mark, will be by investing in our existing mills, things like Dierks and Millport, as opposed to building a greenfield mill. As we look at the return opportunities from those two options, we think that's the best approach for Weyerhaeuser going forward.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Very good. I'll turn it over, Doyle. Good luck in the fourth quarter.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Hi, guys. Good morning, and thanks again for the details.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, George.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","How are you doing? I just want to pick up on the lumber capacity question that Mark keyed up. So, as I recall, Dierks and Millport add 8%-9% to your capacity over the next couple of years, and I remember there's one project comes on this year, and then the other one comes on next year. Can you correct me if I'm wrong in any of that? And what ability do you have to flex your existing capacity beyond this project in the 400-million board feet you're getting from it?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. So, you're right in terms of the timing. Dierks is in the process of coming on now. We'll see the benefit of that in early 2018, and then Millport is later in the year and into 2019. In terms of flexing our existing mills, George, the \u2013 we will continue to work on that. Part of OpEx, of course, is increasing the productivity and the reliability of those mills. And I would tell you we should be able to do that 2% to 3% on an annual basis, and we'll continue to focus on that going forward.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And, Doyle, on that front, you don't need to add shifts to get there, correct? That's just through improving the reliability, in theory, if you needed to. Even though, I know it's not necessarily a good thing from a safety and operating standpoint. You could add later shifts in the workday or a third shift or something to that effect. Would that be a fair assessment?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","That is a fair assessment. The 2% to 3% is just by running our mills more reliably. As you know, we're spending capital at our mills so that helps in some ways to run our mills more reliably. And that does not include any additional shifts.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. One question, can you let us know where currently realizations in lumber are versus your third quarter average?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. As I mentioned, OSB's current realizations are up $40 versus the third quarter, and lumber is up $15 to $20 versus third quarter levels.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Two more, and I'll turn it over. One thing \u2013 if we look at the timber outlook for exports, to Asia in particular, the next several years, are there any specific points that give you encouragement?","And the question behind the question is, obviously, you're still largest in terms of your exports to Japan. Japan has been kind of a flat to declining market for U.S. exports, I believe, over time. And Japan has been growing its ability to supply its own timber over time as well. So, key points of optimism, if any, in terms of the Asian export market opportunity, considering what's been going on with Japan?","And then, lastly, SG&A, it looks like you're more or less plateauing there after really a very good performance early in the OpEx program. Is there anything left to do there? Thanks. And welcome back, Beth, as well.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. We're all glad to have Beth back, so thanks for that comment. In terms of Japan markets, George, as you know, the big driver for us in Japan is post and beam construction. As we said, that is up roughly 2% year-over-year. That for post and beam construction, they need \u2013 the Japanese need the Doug Fir that we are able to produce and supply. And as you look forward, most projections have overall housing in Japan as you said flat, but post-and-beam construction continuing to grow and we are, by far, the largest supplier to Japanese saw-millers of the Doug Fir that's needed for the post-and-beam construction.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","And then as far as SG&A, as we mentioned, we've achieved $125 million SG&A target and that was related to the costs associated that we're going to remove from the Plum Creek integration. So, we're very pleased that we achieved that target, and then as Doyle mentioned, we're 80% into the $35 million of the SG&A cost related to what we call the stranded costs related to cellulose fibers. So, our $160 million target, we feel we'll meet that target by the end of the year.","Going into 2018, we'll have a continued focus on SG&A. Our OpEx efforts in our manufacturing in the timberlands. We have a very similar mindset as it relates to SG&A. So, that's always an area that we will have a lot of focus on and looking for opportunities to improve and reduce those costs.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks, Russ. That's very helpful. Good luck in the quarter.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","You're next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Collin.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","First question from me, just going back to Mark's question earlier, maybe I'm posing a little bit differently in terms of the dividend policy adjustment to 85% of CAD over the cycle and again the prepare remarks about housing. Just more specifically, Doyle, where do you think the company and how does the Board think about Weyerhaeuser \u2013 where Weyerhaeuser is in terms of the cycle, early, middle, late innings? Just given that there's some moving pieces between the housing outlook, wood product pricing, how do you characterize that in terms of what inning we're in?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. I still think we've got a lot of runway in front of us in terms of housing, Collin. As you very well know, housing, it's historical average, about $1.5 million in starts. This year, we think we're going to be at $1.2 million. So I would say we're in the early to maybe mid-innings in terms of overall \u2013 the overall cycle because, as we all know, it's ultimately going to be driven by housing. And also, as we said in our remarks, we think for a number of years, housing is going to continue to improve. So lots of runway in front of us.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then switching to \u2013 thinking about CapEx and again in context of where we are in this cycle. I know, Doyle, in the past, you've kind of talked about some of the capital that has been put into the \u2013 really to the company on couple different fronts, and maybe seeing that kind of peak at this point in the cycle. Is that still consistent with your thinking or just going back to some of the prior questions about the opportunities that you see across the businesses, could maybe there be \u2013 maybe a longer runway of elevated CapEx, just given kind of the cash flow you guys are throwing off right now and maybe some of the opportunities?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. Collin, what I would tell you is we \u2013 our CapEx this year is going to be roughly $435 million, $300 million in wood products and $135 in timberlands. We're still working with the Board, but we would anticipate a similar type number in 2018. And then as we've also said, we think over time, we would see that start to tail off in our wood products business as we complete the projects that we're focused on and deliver on our OpEx initiatives and make our wood products business where it will be black at the bottom. And just to remind everybody, we believe we'll be roughly 85% of the way there by the end of this year.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. I'll turn it over. Thanks, Doyle. Bye.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Collin.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Gail.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","In your comments in terms of the fourth quarter, you mentioned repair and remodel, perhaps stealing some thunder from new home construction, and I'm just wondering kind of how you think that plays out as you move into 2018 because I presume we're not going to finish kind of all that repair work, and labor seems to be pretty tight in the homebuilding side?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. I think if you look at repair and remodeling markets overall, Gail, and I said \u2013 directly to your question, we continue to be encouraged there and those are up probably 7% to 8%. The remark we made or I made was regarding the hurricane activity and what we've seen in some markets is the labor that would normally be used to be building new houses is fixing houses that were damaged as a result of the hurricanes. I think we'll continue to see some draw from that as we move into 2018. However, some of the houses that were damaged were completely damaged and those will in fact be new houses that will show up in the housing starts number as we move into 2018.","As you know, there's normally a tail on the amount of time it takes to completely recover from hurricane efforts and especially in Houston I would tell you I think that that's going to be somewhat of a tailwind in those markets through 2018. But there's no doubt labor continues to be the biggest constraint whether it's in the overall single family construction or finding labor available to work on the repair of the homes that were damaged from the hurricanes.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. And just again kind of similar question, kind of looking past fourth quarter into 2018, but do you expect any material after effects from the fires in D.C.? And I think one producer yesterday said they're starting to compete a little bit in the U.S. with Canadian wildfires. Just how extreme do you think that might be over the next couple quarters?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","I think it clearly had an impact as we talked about in the third quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, that seems to be normalizing. So, other than the ultimate effect it's going to have on the availability of logs in Canada, which were already being impacted, of course, by the southern pine beetle, I don't see any specific impacts as we move into 2018 and beyond.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. But it was kind of that log availability that I was trying to get some insights into.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Sure.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","And maybe I missed it, but your comments on kind of the OSB outlook, I don't think you really addressed the new supply coming on and just if you could talk about how that fits into your outlook relative to current incredibly strong realizations there?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. So, as we \u2013 as I said, we continue to be constructive on OSB markets as we move forward. With that said, clearly, there is additional capacity coming online, and we'll see exactly how that comes online and what the timing is. One thing we know about OSB capacity is it's pretty lumpy in terms of coming online. So, I think there will be some disruptions and impacts on pricing as the OSB capacity comes online over the next couple of years.","Frankly though, we're going to need \u2013 we, as an industry, are going to need some additional OSB capacity as housing continues to grow. So, there won't be an exact match, of course, between supply and demand and the timing thereof. But if you look \u2013 if you assume housing is going to continue to grow and then you look at the incremental supply that's going to come online, those should be fairly well matched. There will be some timing issues, as we all know, as we work through that.","Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question if from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Just a question on the balance sheet. I think the leverage is down now. Net leverage is almost to 3 times. And it sounds like after you got the Twin Creeks proceeds, then you have, it sounds like, higher EBITDA sequentially in the 4Q. You'd probably be down, closer to that 2.5 times range to exit the year.","So, I'm wondering if you've had any change of thoughts on where that leverage should sit and just kind of general thoughts about redeploying all the cash flow from the Uruguay sale. I know a lot of that was to pay down debt, but that obviously reduces the net leverage. Just any thoughts on the \u2013 where the leverage should go from here and whether it's the dividend or share repo or acquisitions kind of where you would sort of prioritize putting incremental cash to work now?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Sure. So, Brian, as we've stated in the past, our target net debt-to-EBITDA is 3.5 times. You're correct. We're now below that, and that's a function of we had some debt pay-downs this year. We're down to $6 billion of debt, and then we've had growth in EBITDA. And so, that's favored the ratio.","So, as far as going forward on the proceeds, we'll look at the proceeds and we'll do our capital allocation program and really allocate that capital in the best way possible to create shareholder value. But that's something we continue to work with the Board on going forward.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","But Brian, I do think it's important to note that our financial priorities have not changed, continue to be consistent and, first and foremost, is returning cash to shareholders primarily through growing dividend, but also share repurchase. So, that's number one on the list.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's great. And then just on the Wood Products, it's obviously great performance with the run-up in product pricing, but also a lot of work on the OpEx side. I think last year you got about $65 million of OpEx savings this year that's sort of the midpoint of what you're targeting I think. And just \u2013 I know you want to get the 2017 savings in before you start to think about 2018 too much. But could we be in for another year in 2018 where there is something in that ballpark in terms of OpEx savings?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. We, as you would anticipate, are still working on that, Brian. But I would tell, I would \u2013 we would anticipate something in a similar ballpark. And as I mentioned earlier, by the end of this year, we're going to be 85% of the way to being what we call black at the bottom, and assuming we get a similar type number and have a similar type target in 2018 and achieve that target, we would be close to 100% of the being black at the bottom by the end of 2018. So, that's how we're thinking about things, are encouraged by the progress we made, know there is more work to do. And we're also encouraged by the fact that now mostly ideas are being bottom up driven, rather than top down driven, and that's also a very positive development for our company.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That sounds great. Yeah. Combined with the cellulose fiber stranded cost removal sounds like a pretty good uplift from cost takeout there. And then, just on the \u2013 one last one on the Flak Jacket remediation, just trying to think about how the cash impacts of all this, as it sounds like you've spent $190 million in the quarter, and maybe there's some more to come in 4Q. Just wondering if you got any insurance proceeds yet or maybe the timing on when you'd expect to get that sort of can you kind of think about the impact to cash flows starting from October and going forward?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. Brian, what I would tell you is we expect to receive the reimbursements in 2018 and are very confident on our claim, and we will break those out on a quarter-by-quarter basis as those come in so everybody can track it.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. And, Brian, I would add, we've actually spent $60 million in the quarter. That's the cash expenditures.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. That helps. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Thanks. Doyle, you said that the Southern land didn't get much damage from the weather. Do you have a sense of other people's Southern land? People we've been talking to don't seem to see a lot of damage in general.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. I would agree with that, Mark. And talking to some of our competitors, I think, unlike some previous hurricanes where you've been around a long time as I have, there was extensive timberland damage. I think that was mostly avoided with these two hurricanes. So, I think from an overall timberland perspective, we were very fortunate as an industry.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Just one more question. On the real estate acreage that you sold, could you give us a rough sense of how much of that was stepped-up land versus not stepped-up?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","We'd have to get back to you on the details, but a lot of the transactions that were closed in the last quarter were in the Montana area. And so, that property would have been stepped up.","Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.","Okay. Super. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of James Armstrong with Armstrong Investment. Please go ahead.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Good morning, and congrats on a good quarter.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","First question is your Western log realizations, as you pointed out, are up really nicely year-over-year. Assuming a more normal fire season next year, do you expect the same pricing trend or should log prices stabilize a little bit more as we go into 2018 in the West?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. So, we're really encouraged by what we see out of the Western markets. I think there's no doubt that the fire season helped on a temporary basis. But as you look at the domestic markets, the log decks were \u2013 are thin coming out of fire season. I think more importantly from a domestic market, California housing continues to be very robust. Those permits are up 17%. And we think California is going to continue to kind of outpace the market because it lagged the market for so long. So, from a domestic side, we think demand is going to be strong. We are also, as we look into 2018, encouraged by what we see from export markets, both Japan and China. So, we're optimistic about Western log markets as we move into 2018.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Okay. That helps. Switching gear to Wood Products. You've addressed a lot of the questions. But do you have any insight on your customers' inventory levels? Have any of your customers really been able to rebuild inventories, or are they still tight after all the hurricane events and other \u2013 in the strong market?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah. What I would tell you is customer inventory levels continue to be lean. Now, I would anticipate as we move into a slower seasonal period, Thanksgiving and Christmas and the winter months, you would start to see our customers have the opportunity to rebuild inventories but currently, inventories continue to be lean.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Doyle, my first question has to do, and I apologize if this was asked, but if you could talk a little bit about plywood. I know it's not a big business for you, but there's been some bumpiness with imports. And as I think about OSB and the fact that there's less and less substitutability or at least in practice, are you seeing anything that might cause plywood to maybe recouple with OSB, or at least be stronger than it's been in recent years notwithstanding that the last month, few months have been good?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Chip, we don't see anything that's fundamentally changed in those two markets. As you know, we've all watched them together over the past many years in the substitution from plywood to OSB. But as we look forward, we don't see anything fundamentally changing in that relationship.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then the second question is when you look at your distribution of cash, Doyle, and I know you talked a bit about this already, but there seems to be some reluctance to, I guess, to create a steady component of the dividend from Wood Products, and obviously, because of the cyclicality. But how do you wrestle with the fact that it's making so much money now and could continue to? And how do you balance between a stable dividend and distributing cash during periods of very strong Wood Products results, which frankly could persist for a while?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Chip, I'm not sure I would agree with the reluctance comment. What I would tell you is we very purposefully raised our payout ratio from 75% to 85% over the cycle to reflect the fact that we think we have raised the floor on our Wood Products operation due to the significant change we made in our cost structure. We will continue to work closely with our board on the appropriate dividend level going forward, factoring in Wood Products markets and the fact that we're optimistic on Wood Products markets as we said earlier and also, factoring in what we're seeing on the Timberland side. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And quickly for Russell. I don't know if you gave us the specific guide on the real estate EBITDA for the fourth quarter, but if you could just let me know that and what basis we should expect it would be?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","So, on the EBITDA, we're going to be at about $250 million. And then the basis...","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","For the year.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","For the year, excuse me. So, for the year, $250 million. And then on the basis, we would expect about 40%.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And that's for the year as well?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Correct.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And everyone, we have time for one final question. And it comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, Doyle, Russell and Beth.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Paul.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","Hey. Two questions. One on Timberland portfolio. You guys have done a number of things in the quarter \u2013 in the past, selling Uruguay, redeeming Twin Creeks, selling $100,000 in the U.S. South. What can we expect going forward here on your portfolio? And I'm specifically thinking about the North, which historically hasn't been part of the Weyerhaeuser portfolio?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","And so, Paul, what I'd tell you and what we've consistently said is we're constantly reviewing our overall Timberland portfolio. We do feel good about the moves we made, both through Uruguay and Twin Creeks, as Russell said earlier, to focus and simplify our portfolio. But we'll continue to look for ways to create value for our shareholders going forward, whether that's through potential acquisitions or potential dispositions from a portfolio perspective.","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then, maybe just a question on softwood lumber. Canadian companies seem pretty pessimistic on an agreement. In fact, West Fraser went as far as to say that Coalition seems unwilling to negotiate. I don't want you to get into negotiation on the call. But just from your perspective, what's stopping the agreement at this point?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","I'm not sure anything is necessarily stopping an agreement at this point, Paul. As we said, we continue to be hopeful that we will be able to reach an agreement with the Canadians. We're working very closely with the Coalition and the Department of Commerce. We fundamentally believe that a quota-based agreement is the best option going forward for all parties involved because of the certainty and the simplicity that it brings to the tables. So that's how we're thinking about it and we'll continue to pursue and hopefully be able to reach an agreement with the Canadians going forward.","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. Best of luck with that and your financials going forward. Thanks.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Paul.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","As I understand it, that was our final question. I just want to end by thanking everybody for joining us this morning and, as always, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Weyerhaeuser third quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Beth Baum","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.","On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. Weyerhaeuser delivered strong financial and operational performance in 2017. I\u2019m proud of the team work, dedication and creativity our employees displayed throughout the year, as they work together to accomplish goals, overcome challenges and deliver strong results.","In 2017, we increased full-year adjusted EBITDA by 31% to nearly $2.1 billion; generated over $1 billion of Wood Products EBITDA, the most since 2004; captured nearly $140 million of operational excellence improvements; grew Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources EBITDA by nearly 30%; completed the asset value optimization process for Western Timberlands; delivered a 55% premium to timber value from real estate sales; exceeded our merger costs synergy target by 25%; and fully eliminated $35 million of costs formerly allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business.","We also further simplified and optimized our portfolio by divesting our Uruguay operations, redeeming our ownership in the Twin Creeks joint venture, and selling 100,000 acres of Southern Timberlands for collective proceeds of over $700 million.","Finally, we increased our dividend for the sixth time since 2011, consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders through a growing and sustainable dividend. These accomplishments are reflected in our financial results.","For the full-year 2017, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $582 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, on net sales of $7.2 billion. This represents a 40% improvement in full-year earnings from continuing operations.","For the fourth quarter, Weyerhaeuser earned $271 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.8 billion. Fourth quarter results include a $37 million after-tax benefit from special items. Excluding special items, we earned $234 million, or $0.31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. This is more than double our earnings for fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $551 million, 38% higher than one year ago.","Before I discuss our business results in more detail, let me make a few comments regarding the housing market. The U.S. housing market finished the year on a solid note, as strong demand and favorable weather in many areas enabled building activity continue \u2013 to continue late into the year.","Total annualized housing starts averaged $1.25 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of almost 7% compared with the third quarter. For the full-year 2017, U.S. housing starts totaled just over $1.2 million. As expected, growth in single-family starts was strong, while multi-family activity remained volatile.","Single-family housing starts rose approximately 8.5% compared with 2016. Approximately 71% of total starts were attributable to single-family homes, compared with 67% one year ago. This mix shift is very beneficial for Wood Products demand.","Entering 2018, housing market fundamentals remain favorable. Millennials are becoming more active in the market and homeownership among households headed by someone under age 35 rose to 36% in the fourth quarter from 34.7% a year earlier. Builder confidence is holding strong at levels comparable to prerecession highs. Permit activity is healthy. Single-family permits increased 9% for the full-year 2017 and total permits averaged over $1.3 million in the fourth quarter.","Economic growth remains solid, employment and wages continue to rise and consumer confidence remains historically strong. Although constraints on labor and lot availability may provide some guardrails for the rate of building activity, our builder and dealer customers see significant opportunity to serve continued pent-up demand and are optimistic for a strong 2018. For 2018, we expect single-family housing starts to increase by nearly 10% with total starts approaching $1.3 million.","Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 4 to 6. Timberlands contributed $166 million to earnings before special items, $35 million more than the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $252 million. Western Timberlands delivered $140 million of fourth quarter EBITDA, $29 million more than the third quarter and $39 million more than a year ago.","Fee harvest volumes increased 14% compared with the third quarter as favorable logging conditions and strong production by our harvest crews enabled us to catch up on volume that cannot be harvested during the severe third quarter fire season. Western domestic market conditions were strong throughout the quarter, as underlying demand remained steady and mills rebuilt log decks depleted during the third quarter fire season.","Pricing for domestic logs increased throughout the quarter. Per unit logging and hauling costs increased slightly due to higher contract trucking rates and additional high elevation logging.","Turning to our export markets. In Japan, prices rose steadily throughout the quarter, as Japanese demand remained solid. Log and lumber inventories for our Japanese customers remain relatively low and they are running at high operating rates. Log sales volumes were comparable to third quarter and stronger takeaway was offset by timing of shipments.","In China, demand for our logs remains steady and pricing strengthened as customers competed against strong demand from U.S. domestic buyers. Log inventories at Chinese ports declined slightly during the quarter and remain within a normal range.","Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $101 million to fourth quarter EBITDA, $6 million more than the third quarter. Demand improved as mills resumed normal operations following third quarter weather events and our fee harvest volumes increased 6%, compared with the third quarter as we caught up on production days lost during hurricane activity. Average sawlog and pulpwood realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Unit transportation costs increased slightly due to higher fuel and trucking rates.","Northern Timberlands contributed $9 million to EBITDA, $5 million more than the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes increased as we caught up on Montana harvest, they cannot be accessed, while mandatory fire restrictions were in place. Average realizations improved due to mix.","Finally Timberlands fourth quarter results include a $99 million non-taxable gain on the previously announced sale of 100,000 acres of Southern Timberlands for $2,025 per acre. This is reported as a special item. The quarter includes non-earnings contribution from operation of the Twin Creeks joint venture due to redemption of our ownership interest.","Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, Chart 7 and 8. Real Estate and ENR contributed $50 million to fourth quarter earnings, $3 million more than the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $13 million to $87 million. Fourth quarter transaction volume was slightly weaker than expected, as some activity paused due to buyer uncertainty regarding the several budget and tax policy.","The average price per acre sold increased compared with the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales included a greater proportion of Southern acres, while third quarter included a large sale of lower value Montana acres.","For the full-year 2017, the Real Estate business sold just over 97,000 acres, or approximately 0.7% of our land base. Real Estate significantly exceeded its 30% targeted premium to timber value, capturing an average premium of 55% in 2017.","Wood Products, Charts 9 and 10. Wood Products contributed $221 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items, compared with $241 million in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $258 million for the fourth quarter and over $1 billion for the full-year 2017. This is the highest annual EBITDA since 2004 and over $150 million more than EBITDA from 2005, when we operated almost double the number of facilities and production volumes were over 60% higher.","EBITDA for lumber totaled $116 million comparable to the third quarter and more than double a year ago. Average sales realizations for lumber improved 4%. This was offset by higher log cost for our Western and Canadian mills and a 5% decrease in sales volumes, as shipments from our Canadian mills were delayed due to weather-driven disruptions in rail transportation.","OSB contributed $104 million to EBITDA, $2 million more than the third quarter and $58 million more than a year ago. Average sales realizations improved 2% compared with the third quarter. This price improvement was largely offset by 6% decrease in sales volumes, again, due to issues with Canadian rail transportation. Resin costs also increased.","Engineered wood products contributed $34 million to EBITDA, $16 million lower than the third quarter, but $8 million more than a year ago. Sales volumes declined seasonally and manufacturing costs increased due to higher prices for OSB, fiber and resin.","Distribution contributed $5 million to fourth quarter EBITDA, compared with $12 million in the third quarter. This business focused on managing cost and product margins and performed well in what is typically a seasonally challenging quarter.","Fourth quarter results for the Wood products segment include a pre-tax charge of $50 million for remediation for our Flak Jacket product. This charge reflects higher than expected labor costs, resulting from the strong demand for home remediation services following Hurricane Harvey and Irma.","As of yesterday, we have completed remediation in 99% of the affected houses. We continue to expect a significant portion of the cost will be covered by insurance.","I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. On December 7, the U.S. International Trade Commission issued its final determination, affirming material injury to U.S. lumber producers. Final countervailing and anti-dumping duties became effective on December 28. These collective duties are assessed at approximately 20% for most producers.","Fourth quarter results include a $9 million net pre-tax benefit from an adjustment for the final applicable periods and rates associated with the countervailing and anti-dumping duties. Final duties will remain effective for a minimum of five years unless reduced upon appeal by NAFTA or the WTO.","Although Canadian producers have initiated appeals to both bodies, we expect the process will extend for several years before the panels reach a decision. The U.S. coalition continues to work closely with the U.S. Trade Representative, and we remain hopeful, we will be able to negotiate a quota-based agreement.","Chart 12, operational excellence. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our Timberlands and Wood Products business achieved almost $140 million of operational excellence improvements in 2017. Timberlands delivered standout performance, significantly exceeding its $40 million to $50 million target. The business captured $66 million of operational excellence improvements, primarily from merger-related operational synergies.","Wood Products captured $71 million of operational excellence at the high-end of its $55 million to $75 million target. Lumber and OSB met their targets with improvements of $21 million in lumber and $20 million in OSB.","Engineered wood products and distribution exceeded their targets capturing $16 million and $14 million of improvements, respectively. Although we have captured almost $500 million of operational excellence improvements since 2014, we have more opportunity to improve our relative performance in each of our businesses.","In 2018, we are targeting OpEx improvements of $40 million to $50 million in Timberlands and $40 million to $60 million in Wood Products, including $20 million to $25 million in lumber, $5 million to $10 million in OSB, $10 million to $15 million in engineered wood products, and $5 million to $10 million in distribution.","Finally, we fully delivered on our commitments to eliminate the $35 million of costs formally allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business by 2017 year-end. Identifying and capturing these cost reductions require collaboration across corporate functions and operating segments and I\u2019m proud of the team work that enabled us to achieve this goal.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook.","Russell Hagen","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the first quarter is presented in Chart 14 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to fourth quarter earnings before special items.","In our Western Timberlands operations, we anticipate continued strong realizations and favorable domestic demand. We expect harvest volumes to decrease modestly compared to the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter included additional volumes that were deferred from the third quarter because of fire restrictions.","Japanese export log sales volumes and average sales realizations are expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter. We are seeing continued strong demand in the Japanese housing market combined with low-channel inventories, which is providing strong price support. Chinese export log volumes and average sales realizations are expected to decrease modestly compared to the fourth quarter on seasonally softer demand due to the Lunar New Year.","In the South, we expect seasonally lower demand and sales volumes, and we anticipate average sales realizations for the first quarter will be comparable to the fourth quarter. We also expect higher fuel and trucking costs. In the North, we anticipate first quarter sales volumes will decrease, while sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter.","Full-year 2018 harvest volumes for the South and the North are expected to be comparable year-over-year. In the West, we expect harvest volumes to decrease slightly compared to 2017, as a result of our previously announced exit from Twin Creeks joint venture, we will no longer have harvest volume to report in the category titled Other.","Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter. In Real Estate, we typically closed fewer transactions in the first and second quarter of the year, as recreational buyer traffic slows during the winter months. The summer and fall months are the most active selling seasons with the large portion of sales closing in the second-half of the year.","We expect Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter to be comparable to the first quarter of last year. We expect approximately $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources business in 2018. Land bases as a percentage of Real Estate sales should be between 40% and 50% for the full-year 2018.","For Wood Products, we anticipate first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the fourth quarter earnings before special items. For Lumber, we expect average sales realizations will be slightly higher. For OSB, we expect the average sales realizations will be lower quarter-over-quarter. Engineered wood products sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter.","We recently announced price increases of 6% to 12% for engineered wood products, which we will begin capturing in the second quarter. Sales volumes and operating rates are expected to increase quarter-over-quarter for all product lines, as we typically have lower production in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and maintenance downtime.","Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. For the fourth quarter, the decrease in earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter are driven primarily by an increase in non-cash charges related to intercompany profit elimination and LIFO inventory adjustments, as we rebuild depleted log inventories in our export yards and wood products mills during the fourth quarter.","In addition, fourth quarter unallocated items include pre-tax special items of $42 million of insurance reimbursements for environmental remediation costs incurred in prior years and $14 million of Plum Creek merger and integration costs.","Following the successful completion of the merger, we do not anticipate additional merger integration costs in 2018. For our pension and postretirement plans, the year-end 2017 funded status decreased by $138 million compared to 2016, as a result of a decrease in discount rates. Discount rates decreased by approximately 60 basis points for the U.S. plans and 20 basis points for the Canadian plans.","We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2017, and we are not required to make any cash contributions in 2018. Cash paid for all other pension and postretirement plans in 2017 was $78 million. Our required cash payments for these plans 2018 will be approximately $60 million. We expect to record approximately $100 million, or $25 million per quarter of non-cash, non-operating pension and postretirement expense in 2018.","Chart 13 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $824 million. Cash from operations during the fourth quarter was $354 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $160 million and for the full-year 2017 are $419 million.","Looking ahead to 2018, we expect total CapEx will be approximately $420 million, $300 million for Wood Products and $120 million for Timberlands. Investing cash flows for the fourth quarter also include approximately $108 million of proceeds from redeeming our equity interest in the Twin Creeks joint venture and $203 million of proceeds from selling $100,00 acres Southern Timberlands to Twin Creeks.","Moving on to debt. We ended the quarter with $6 billion of debt outstanding. Interest expense was $96 million in the fourth quarter. We expect interest expense will be approximately $380 million in 2018.","Moving on to taxes. Following the enactment of the federal tax reform, we benefit from the lower federal tax rate on the earnings generated by our taxable REIT subsidiary. These earnings will now be subject to federal tax at 21%, rather than the prior 35%. The new law does not affect our REIT status, or the provisions that allow us to pay capital gain dividends to our shareholders. Further, we do not anticipate any limitations on our interest deductibility.","In our fourth quarter results, the net tax adjustment was included in special items. The adjustment is primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets, following the reduction in the federal tax rate. We currently expect our 2018 effective tax rate will be between 11% and 13% based on the forecasted mix of our earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.","Russell Hagen","Thank you, Russell. 2017 was a strong year for Weyerhaeuser as we successfully completed our merge integration, further focused our portfolio, delivered improved financial performance across all our businesses and returned cash to shareholders by increasing our dividend.","Going forward, I\u2019m extremely optimistic about 2018 and our ability to continue to improve performance through operational excellence, fully capitalize on market conditions and demonstrate disciplined capital allocation to drive value for shareholders.","And now, I\u2019d like to open the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first questions is from line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead.","Mark William Wilde","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Mark.","Russell Hagen","Good morning, Mark.","Mark William Wilde","Just to start off, I wondered if you could talk just a little bit about the markets, because we\u2019ve gotten off to a much stronger start than I would have expected here in January in all of these Wood Products markets. How do you read what\u2019s going on here?","Doyle Simons","Yes, Mark, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m encouraged by what we see in the Wood Products market. If you look at lumber markets, you\u2019ve got growing demand from housing going up, and as I said, optimistic about what we\u2019re going to see in 2018. I\u2019m encouraged that the millennials are showing up, also anticipate strong repair remodeling markets. You\u2019ve got lean inventories. You\u2019ve got high operating rates. You\u2019ve got less lumber coming in from Canada and that was down roughly 5% in 2017 versus 2016, and now, we\u2019re moving into the stronger building season.","So encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in lumber markets. Likewise in OSB, clearly have growing demand, driven by the same things I just outlined again, lean inventories, high operating rates. Now, we all know there\u2019s new capacity coming on. But I think, this industry should be able to absorb that capacity assuming demand continues to grow, which it will.","Now there will be some volatility and lumpiness as that new capacity comes online. But the other thing about the new capacity, Mark, as you very well know, it takes \u2013 normally it takes longer to bring up new capacity, especially when you\u2019re bringing up capacity of mills that have been down for an extended period of time. So overall, pretty optimistic about what we\u2019re seeing.","And then, of course, in engineered wood products, as we mentioned, we have announced a price increase of 6% to 12%. And we think in terms of that, we all should \u2013 we\u2019ll start to realize that in the second quarter and by the end of second quarter probably have half of that, or maybe a little more that we will realize by the end of the second quarter. So overall pretty optimistic about wood products markets.","Mark William Wilde","Okay. And then just as a follow-on question. Well \u2013 but this Western log market just is also surprisingly strong. I wondered, if you want to put any more color behind that? And also, is there any effect from the weakening in the U.S. dollar?","Doyle Simons","So, Mark, as you said, Western log markets have been very positive. We continue to be encouraged about what we see in those markets. Domestically, you\u2019ve got the strong demand and pricing improvements, and Japan continued solid demand low inventories. We anticipate higher prices and volumes in Q1 versus Q4. Post and beam construction was up, which is the key driver for us, I present in in 2017 versus 2016.","And in China, we\u2019ll have a little policy here as we go through the Lunar New Year. But if you just look at 2017 versus 2016, log exports were up from the U.S. to China up over 10% and we can \u2013 we expect continued strong markets. Overall, it\u2019s a weaker \u2013 as we said a strong dollar is bad for Weyerhaeuser, or weaker dollar is a positive for Weyerhaeuser. So if the dollar does weaken, net-net that will be a positive for us overall in these markets.","Mark William Wilde","Right. Thanks, Doyle. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Randy Toth","Good morning. This is actually Randy Toth sitting in for Anthony.","Doyle Simons","Good morning.","Randy Toth","We\u2019re hearing a lot of commentary from companies that we cover in regards to freight tightness and labor tightness. I just want to know how you guys think that might impact you in the 2018?","Doyle Simons","Yes, we like other companies are in fact seeing that type of tightness, as we mentioned in the fourth quarter, a real impact on wood products earnings as a result of transportation issues, specifically in rail out of Canada, but also in trucks out of Canada. And one mill, for example, that we have in Canada, shipments from rail were delayed by over two weeks and one much better from a rail perspective.","So as we move into 2018, we think that will continue to be a headwind in terms of availability, but more so increasing rates, both on the truck and rails side. And we\u2019re going to work really hard to offset that through our operational excellence initiatives in 2018.","Randy Toth","Okay, thank you. And then can you talk a little bit about timber exports out of the U.S. South. I know, they grew quite a bit in 2017 although off a small base. How much are you guys participating in that, and do you think that growth is sustainable?","Doyle Simons","Yes. We are participating in that and it\u2019s a key initiative for us. What we would tell you is, while you\u2019re right, it is off a low base. We anticipate that in 2018, our shipments could be three times higher than they were in 2017. And our best guess now is the takeaway that will go into export markets would be the equivalent, just to try to dimension it a small sawmill in the U.S. and what they would use.","So you\u2019re right. It\u2019s off a small base, but growing. We\u2019re spending a lot of time and resources developing that market and are very optimistic about that market long-term.","Randy Toth","Okay. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","Everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details. Congratulations on the year Doyle and Russell. I guess, the first question I had, maybe piggybacking off of Mark\u2019s earlier question. So where do you see your customers log decks at present in the West? And overall, if you had mentioned, I\u2019d missed it. Where do you see lumber inventories overall in the channel? Do you think things are more or less back to normal? Are they still below normal in terms of average inventory levels, any thoughts that would be helpful? And I had a couple follow-ons?","Doyle Simons","Yes. So if you look at lumber inventories, they are pretty lean across the entire system. If you look at log decks in the West, as you know, they got very, very low during the fire season. They have started to rebuild. I would say, they\u2019re kind of somewhere between low and normal, but log decks are being rebuilt in the West.","George Staphos","Okay. And Doyle, one question I had for you. On that subject, are wood margins high enough do you think across the market in the West present demand destruction on Western log? So in other words, are you seeing a sufficiently strong lumber prices out there and demand to keep pulling Western logs?","Doyle Simons","Yes. The answer is yes. The \u2013 we have not seen any \u2013 what you would call value destruction from that pricing and demand continues to be strong. Where the competition is occurring is between domestic logs and Chinese logs, because as prices have run up, those are competing directly against each other. And the beauty of our system is, we\u2019re able to play that and thin logs to where we can create the most value.","George Staphos","Okay. Two last questions, I\u2019ll turn it over. One segueing off that comment and then comment just on OpEx. So one thing that we noticed in the deck and as always, we appreciate the detail. The Chinese export log revenue seemed to drop a bit more sequentially 3Q to four 4Q than it did last year just eyeballing it. And you mentioned, there\u2019s further sequential drop off in the first quarter coming up because of Lunar New Year, which didn\u2019t seem to have as much of an effect last year.","Is there something else going on in China that we should be mindful of, or that you\u2019re maybe guarding against as a kind of a what-if. And then in terms of OpEx, congratulations on the performance there. What gives you confidence, I guess, four years into the program that with all the work you\u2019ve done in OSB and lumber that there\u2019s still more in the tank in 2018? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter.","Doyle Simons","George, in terms of what\u2019s going on in China, it\u2019s pretty simple that the reason it\u2019s down in the fourth quarter versus third is the strength in domestic markets. And as I\u2019ve just mentioned, we can swing back and forth. And as domestic markets have continued to improve, we are selling more to the domestic market and less to China. It has nothing to do with a falloff in China, as I mentioned, actually log shipment overall to China were up. And I mean, from an industry perspective, we\u2019re up 10%.","George Staphos","Yes.","Doyle Simons","And we\u2019ll get through this Lunar New Year and you never know what impact that will have, but we continue to anticipate strong demand in China in 2018.","In terms of OpEx, as mentioned in the earlier comments, we\u2019ve made good progress. We have made good progress in 2017, but there\u2019s much more opportunity in front of us. But the reason I\u2019m so encouraged by what\u2019s happening in OpEx is, when we first started this program three or four years ago, it\u2019s very top down-driven.","Now what\u2019s happening is, it\u2019s bottom-up driven. Our employees are out working in the mills, are out working in the Timberland every day are finding additional opportunities to drive OpEx improvements, that\u2019s how we\u2019re defining winning, that\u2019s how people are being compensated.","So encouraged that we will be \u2013 can able to meet or exceed the targets that we\u2019ve laid out in 2018. Although, as you\u2019re exactly right, it does get harder. We\u2019ve got most of the low-hanging fruit and you did see the numbers in Wood Products come down slightly in 2018 versus 2017 which is indicative of that, but encouraged by the opportunities that we have in 2018 and confident we will meet those targets.","George Staphos","Thank you very much. Good luck on a quarter.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Russell Hagen","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","Hey, good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.","Doyle Simons","Good morning.","Russell Hagen","Good morning, Collin.","Collin Mings","Just to start for me. Just given the growing flexibility offered by the balance sheet, just maybe talk a little bit more about how you\u2019re approaching external growth on the Timberland front this year, especially just given the recent termination of the Twin Creeks JV?","Russell Hagen","Yes, Collin, this is Russell. As far as how we look at the timber markets, we have 12.5 million acres in the United States and we\u2019re in every major wood basket. And we have a team that really all they focus on is timber valuations and making sure that we understand kind of the relative values in the market.","So we see everything coming on to the market. And if there\u2019s an opportunity that fits within our portfolio and we can create shareholder value, we\u2019ll take a hard look at that. But we always approach this in a very disciplined manner. Again, our goal over the long-term is to continue to grow the business and increase shareholder value. But we\u2019re going to do it very disciplined.","Collin Mings","Okay. Any sizable transactions out there kind of in the pipeline, or anything on that front?","Russell Hagen","There\u2019s a couple of transactions that I think will carry over into 2018 that were kind of in the pipeline in 2017 that didn\u2019t close. But beyond, probably what\u2019s in the broader news and what\u2019s available, I don\u2019t see anything else meaningful.","Collin Mings","Just sticking with the kind of capital allocation just on the debt maturing this year, Russell, do you plan to pay that off with cash and recognizing it, it\u2019s still early, but you got pretty meaningful maturity in 2019 at a pretty high-cost, just how are you thinking about the debt maturity here just when you\u2019re still well below your kind of targeted debt to EBITDA number?","Russell Hagen","Yes. So let me take that in a couple of steps. The first is, we do have $62 million maturity that we actually paid off yesterday and that was a pretty high coupon rate about 7%. We paid that off with available cash, because it really wasn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t make sense to go and refinance such a small maturity.","As far as our $1.8 billion, I think that you\u2019re referring to are the future debt maturities. We have a lot of flexibility around that and we\u2019re well positioned from a balance sheet standpoint to address that when it comes up, but we don\u2019t see any concerns with that.","As far as our leverage ratios, you\u2019re correct. We are \u2013 have a target leverage ratio of 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA and that\u2019s really over the cycle. So in some years, we\u2019re going to be a little lower and some years we\u2019re going to be little higher. Right now, we\u2019re a little lower and that\u2019s a function of \u2013 we have paid down some debt and restructured some debt, but we\u2019ve also had improvement in our EBITDA.","So we see that. We\u2019re in a very comfortable position, and it provides us with a lot of flexibility should an opportunity arise and we want to go tap the capital markets.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then one last one for me just as far as on the Timberland guidance. Just given the strength particularly on the West just given log pricing momentum there that would start 2018, can you maybe just quantify how much we should expect in terms of the downtick in harvest volumes? I think in the prepared guidance remarks, you suggested that the West would be down and the North and South would be flattish year-over-year. But again, at least, in the first quarter which seem to imply a pretty meaningful year-over-year decline in the Western volume. So just how should we quantify that?","Russell Hagen","Sure. So, first, big picture. We\u2019re harvesting on a sustainable level. So in the West, as we mentioned at our Investor Day last year, the harvest will decline modestly in 2018, and that\u2019s really a function of working through the older age timber on the Longview acquisition. And so we\u2019ll see the harvest level, level out starting in 2018 and then we\u2019ll see moderate growth in that in 2023.","Collin Mings","Okay. And should we think about any other noise seasonality as it relates to those harvest volumes?","Russell Hagen","Coming into the first quarter?","Collin Mings","Just in the West in general, yes?","Russell Hagen","Yes. So in the West, we\u2019re going to have some seasonally lower volume in the West.","Collin Mings","Okay. I appreciate the color, guys. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire","Hi, good morning, guys.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Maguire","A couple of times, you mentioned some negative impact from rail and trucking issues in Canada in the Wood Products segment. I just wonder if there\u2019s any way you can size that? Is it like a $5 million or $10 million hit to EBITDA in the quarter, or more immaterial than that?","Doyle Simons","You\u2019re talking about in the fourth quarter?","Brian Maguire","Yes, in the fourth quarter?","Doyle Simons","Yes, Brian, it was a significant issue in the fourth quarter, and it was primarily due to just the lack of trucking in Canada. As I mentioned, at one of our mills, shipments were delayed for \u2013 I said trucking, I mean, rail. So let\u2019s back up. So we\u2019ve got rail and truck issues, both of those were a problem in the fourth quarter. For example, one of our mills, shipments were delayed for a full two weeks due to rail issues, primarily due to the extremely cold weather in Canada.","With that said, because of the surge in \u2013 demand in the fourth quarter for trucks, trucking availability was also a problem. So I would say, the \u2013 it was a probably $10 million to $15 million hit in the fourth quarter. Part of it was due to higher prices, but more so, we just couldn\u2019t ship the volume, because there wasn\u2019t rail or trucking available and that primarily happened in the month of December.","Brian Maguire","Okay, that helps. And then it sounds like 1Q maybe seeing some similar disruptions, maybe not just in Canada, but in the South, I know down here in the Gulf states, we\u2019ve had a lot of these winter storms we don\u2019t normally have. Just wondered if there\u2019s going to be an impact maybe in the Southern logs or Southern Wood Products that you\u2019re seeing so far in 1Q?","Doyle Simons","I think in 1Q, it\u2019s going to be more just higher cost as opposed to just not being able to ship. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, I do think rail and trucking will be a headwind, as we move into 2018. We\u2019ve not seen the disruptions in terms of availability that we saw in the month of December. But we do have higher rates going in and just both in truck and rail. We\u2019re about currently 60% truck, 40% rail. We will be shifting more to truck when possible just because as we look at the options that\u2019s the better one as we move forward.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Just one on Southern log prices. It\u2019s sort of an area we start off thinking, maybe this will be the year we start to see a little bit of tension in the market and prices start to pick up. And since it\u2019s Groundhog Day today, I thought you maybe could give a little bit of an outlook on how you think that prices could go this year, if it\u2019s going to be more of the same, or do you think maybe by the end of the year we could start to see some upward tilt on those prices?","Doyle Simons","Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Brian, and I appreciate the color. Let me tell you how we\u2019re thinking about it. And we do think there\u2019s some potential for some pricing traction in 2018, and let me tell you why. Number one, it all comes down to housing demand, as I said, continues to grow. And we\u2019re quite optimistic that housing will continue to grow and we\u2019re especially encouraged about what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the millennials finally starting to show up in the market and frankly, that\u2019s what\u2019s been missing.","We also expect a strong year from repair remodeling and are projecting that to be up roughly 7.5%. Maybe even more importantly than that is that, there is a lot of capacity being added in the South, as you know. It seems like every week, there\u2019s an announcement of new capacity that\u2019s being added, or at least being considered.","In terms of the numbers, about 1 billion board feet of new sawmill capacity came online in 2017. There\u2019s another 2 billion board feet slated to come online in 2018 and 2019, and another 1 billion board feet on top of that, that\u2019s currently under consideration. Just to put that in perspective that\u2019s on a base of about 20 billion board feet in the South, so that\u2019s a big increase. And to your point, we already are starting to see some benefits in certain markets, where additional capacity has come online.","The third part of this is, of course, on the supply side and there is less lumber coming in from Canada, I think, that\u2019s going to continue either as a result of the final duties, or negotiated agreements. Just to put that in perspective, that number went down from 33% in 2016, down to 30% in 2017. And as you look at just absolute lumber shipments from Canada, those were down over 5% in 2017 versus 2016.","And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re very encouraged by development of Southern export markets. We\u2019re going to ship three times as much in 2018 as 2017, and as I mentioned, that should be equivalent to a small mill. So I think, all of those things are going to start to come together, and we are hopeful that we will start to see some pricing improvement as we move through 2018.","Brian Maguire","Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, again.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steven Chercover with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Steven Chercover","Thanks, and good morning.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Chercover","So you gave us a little update on your views on Southern log pricing. And I just wanted to understand, if you could \u2013 for your specific projects that Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama, how they\u2019re going to kind of ramp up over the course of next year? So what\u2019s the timeframe?","Doyle Simons","Yes, great question. So if you look at the two projects \u2013 our two big projects, let me start off by saying, just overall the capital that we\u2019re spending in our lumber operation should increase our productivity 2% to 3% a year. On top of that, the two projects, number one is Dirk\u2019s, Arkansas, that will start up this summer and as an additional 80 million board feet of capacity. And then our Millport mill, which we\u2019re rebuilding will start up in early 2019, and that\u2019s an additional 215 million board feet of capacity. So that\u2019s on top of the 2% to 3% that we\u2019re getting through the additional capital that we\u2019re spending.","Steven Chercover","Okay, great. And then one on the softwood lumber file. The recent \u2013 I \u2013 and then I recognize the big difference between airplanes and lumber. But does the ITC ruling between Bombardier and Boeing have any impact on softwood lumber file, because I mean, the Canadians are certainly trying to link it in the NAFTA talks?","Doyle Simons","Yes. So we don\u2019t think that has any impact on the discussions. We, as I said earlier, remain hopeful. We\u2019ll be able to reach a quota-based agreement. And frankly, negotiations are temporary sidelined due to the focus on NAFTA. But we would believe those negotiations will remain separate from the overall NAFTA discussions.","Steven Chercover","So I don\u2019t recall if you\u2019ve ever specified what the actual volume limit would be with 30 billion board feet, or 20 billion board feet from Canada?","Doyle Simons","In terms of the limit based on what Steve? I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand your point.","Steven Chercover","Sorry. Well, I guess, if there\u2019s a quota that it\u2019s a volume limit as opposed to a market share limit so?","Doyle Simons","Now the quota that we have been discussing and again, it\u2019s still being negotiated would be a percentage, whatever it\u2019d be 25, 27, 29, whatever the number may be, that\u2019s the way the discussions have gone. It\u2019s not a hard limit on volume, it\u2019s a percentage quota.","Steven Chercover","Okay. Thanks, Doyle.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. First, just wanted to follow-up on the color you\u2019re giving, particularly on the lumber capacity in the U.S. I thought that was very interesting and helpful. You had mentioned 2 billion board feet in 2018 and 2019, I assume that was in each year, just wanted to clarify that?","Doyle Simons","That was the total for 2018 and 2019. And then on top of that, Mark, we\u2019re not factoring in the, as you know, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s been saying, okay, we\u2019re going to do this, but the ground has not been broken and that\u2019s another 1 billion. So if you look at total 2018, 2019, it could be up to 3 billion.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, okay. So I think, you said another 1 billion in 2020, and that was what you\u2019re referring to?","Doyle Simons","What I meant to say, Mark \u2013 yes, here is what I meant to say is 1 billion in 2017, 2 billion total in 2018\/2019 with the chance that there could be another 1 billion on top of the 2 billion in 2018\/2019 and that\u2019s to your point would probably show up in 2019, maybe some of that in 2020.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. Thank you. And in curiosity, do you have handy a view on outside of the U.S. South? What net capacity change in North America over that timeframe might be?","Doyle Simons","Mark, I don\u2019t have those numbers here in front of us. I think, there will continue to be potential capacity that could happen in the West. In Canada, as we all know, I think, if anything their capacity going to shrink because of the lack of fiber due to the pine beetle situation.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. And then shifting gears to real estate, two question. So you provided $250 million EBITDA estimates for 2018. I was hoping to get any preliminary indication on likely cost basis. And maybe just any color around that as well, given that that\u2019s only a little bit higher than this year and maybe I misremember. But I had thought the expectation was that that number would likely be going up, as you had finished some of the reviews during 2017?","Doyle Simons","Yes. So let\u2019s talk about that. So what happened in 2017 is and we came in a little lower than 250 guidance, is there ended up being no federal dollars that were allocated for conservation projects. This is the first time in many, many years, where no money has been provided to the various federal agencies for conservation projects.","And just to give you a sense of the magnitude, that directly impacted two deals, that would have generated approximately $40 million of EBITDA in 2017. As we move into 2018, we\u2019ll see \u2013 we\u2019re hopeful that that happens. But our guidance is based on there being little to no federal dollars that are put in place. So that\u2019s the fundamental shift as we look forward into 2018 chance, there\u2019s some upside there, but that\u2019s the number that we\u2019re comfortable with assuming no federal dollars. In terms of the\u2026","Russell Hagen","Yes, Mark, this is Russell. As far as bases, we\u2019re guiding to about 40% to 50%.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. And just, Russell, just one clarification. I assume, when you had talked about there being a couple things in the pipeline on Timberland side that was an,industry or was that a Weyerhaeuser specific comment?","Russell Hagen","No, it\u2019s industry.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Thank you.","Russell Hagen","Thank you for that clarification, Mark.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly","Thank you, Doyle. Some of our\u2026","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Connelly","Good morning. Some of our clients tell us that they see hurricane rebuilds taking away from overall construction activity, because too much of the available labor in those markets is shifting away. Can you give us your thoughts on that and what do you see \u2013 how you see that the sort of labor construction thing playing out this year, because you\u2019ve got a bigger [Multiple Speakers] assumption?","Doyle Simons","Yes, there\u2019s no doubt that labor is the constraint. And as we talked to all of our customers, that\u2019s the one thing we hear over and over. I think in some of the select markets, as you had indicated, some of the labor that would normally be used for new housing is being used for, call it, repair and remodeling as a result of the hurricane.","So I think that will put a little bit of a damper on housing in those markets, maybe in the near-term. Longer-term, there\u2019s a number of houses, as you know, that were completely destroyed. So those will end up in new housing. So I think, limited impact from hurricanes in terms of new housing starts in the short-term. Long-term, as we know, it always takes longer to rebuild from these things. But net-net, I think, that\u2019s just going to be another positive for housing as we move forward.","Mark Connelly","Absolutely. Just one more question. On the operational excellence thing, I\u2019m sorry to keep coming back to it. But the shift to bottoms-up opportunities, is this sort of a new leg of opportunity there? Are you going to start to tell us the operation excellence as targets are going up again? I just wonder if you could give us\u2026?","Doyle Simons","Yes, it\u2019s a great question. As I said, if you look at over the last four years started off very top down driven low-hanging fruit. Now it\u2019s moving more into the things that are tougher but it\u2019s being bottoms-up driven, because frankly, I\u2019m not smart enough to figure out what the new things are that we can do, but our folks are.","So, in terms of the size of the opportunity, we\u2019ll continue to identify those on an annual basis. I don\u2019t think, they\u2019ll be going up substantially. My best guess is, they\u2019ll remain at these levels for at least the next couple of years and then we\u2019ll go from there.","Mark Connelly","It\u2019s a good problem to have. Thank you.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Gail Glazerman","Hi, good morning.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Gail.","Russell Hagen","Hi, Gail.","Gail Glazerman","Can you give some color on where your Lumber and OSB prices are currently versus the fourth quarter average? And was there anything kind of mix, or timing-related that helped drive your pricing up not necessarily to it is relative to in the months trend?","Doyle Simons","Yes. So what I would tell you is, on the current and these are quarter-to-date realizations versus fourth quarter, Gail. Just to give you a sense, Lumber is about $10 higher, OSB is about $50 lower, because as we know, we had a big run off. I would say, both Lumber and OSB are trending in the right way. And as we move towards the building season, as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, we anticipate that trend will continue.","In terms of OSB pricing, Gail, and I think you\u2019re talking about the fourth quarter. I would tell you, there\u2019s a couple of things. Number one is, as you look at it versus the indexes, there is a lag that we have. And so, when things are going down, ours don\u2019t fall as quickly, so that\u2019s part of it. And then just, as you also know, we have some premium flowing product, which helps skew it in a positive way as well. So I would say, those are big \u2013 two big things.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Thank you. And on the Southern log exports, can you just remind us to what extent the destination markets overlap with where you\u2019re shipping from the last?","Doyle Simons","Yes. The good news is there, they don\u2019t overlap at all. Now, let me clarify that. We\u2019re sending to China and India. So of course, we do send out the West Coast to China, but these are going to different ports and for different uses than our Western log.","So there\u2019s no the term I use cannibalization of logs that are coming from the South into China versus the West. So some of them are to new customers in China, some of them are to existing customers, but that are either going into different ports, or and all of it is for different uses than the Western logs are being used for.","Gail Glazerman","Okay, helpful. And just one last one. In terms of Western log market, do you have any perspective how much extreme weather, both in terms of the winter last year with all the snow and rain, as well as the dry summer might have supported pricing, and if we got kind of more normal weather as we move through the summer, what your outlook might be?","Doyle Simons","Gail, there\u2019s no doubt that the weather in 2017 was kind of a catalyst to get prices \u2013 well, prices are moving for the weather, but for prices to continue. I will tell you though, weather has stabilized. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to be very encouraged by what we see in the West and that\u2019s primarily from a demand perspective. Japan continues to be solid. China is strong.","In domestic markets, primarily driven by California, and as you know, California was slower to recover now. California is going permits, they are up 15% in California and we think that trend is going to continue. So, whether it\u2019s going to cause some volatility. But if you just look at overall supply and demand, I feel it\u2019s pretty good in the West.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. Thank you.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Good morning, Doyle.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Dillon","Thanks for all the information. One sort of couple of big picture questions. One is, could you just tell us, in your view, as you look at OSB and plywood, there has been decades of substitution out of plywood into OSB. And I guess, have we reached a point where there\u2019s very little substitution, meaning that all the use of plywood is basically in specialty areas, or in extreme cases, do you think several points of those markets could switch back and forth?","And then I had a second question, if you could just talk a little bit about with the obvious high margins that lumber mills, I believe, are making in the South, in particular, and again that might get crimped in some point in the future, as you mentioned, as demand goes up for logs. Would it ever make sense for Weyerhaeuser to consider acquiring sawmills, just given that you would own them immediately and maybe it would be cheaper than building?","Doyle Simons","So Chip, on the OSB plywood substitution, you\u2019re right, I mean, we\u2019ve seen that trend over, over many years. I think, it\u2019s kind of in balance now. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be some temporary shift. But overall, I don\u2019t see any fundamental shifts back and forth between OSB and plywood.","In terms of lumber mills in the South, as you said and you\u2019re exactly right, very high margins there. As we have consistently said, we would look at growing our Wood Products business on a go-forward basis. We think our bigger opportunity is in Timberland, but we will look at growing Wood Products business. I think, lumber would be a business that we would be interested in growing, especially if it tied in with our overall strategic footprint from a Timberland perspective.","In terms of how we would grow, number one is, doing projects like Dirk\u2019s and Millport. And then secondly, would be exactly what you said in finding acquisition opportunities, where at a value, where we think we \u2013 at a price where we think we could create shareholder value.","Going and building greenfield mills is probably not a step that we\u2019re going to take. But we would be very interested in sawmills to acquire assuming again, we could do it at a price where we could create value over the cycle. You can assume that the margins that are currently in place are going to stay that way forever.","Chip Dillon","Gotcha. And we hear a lot about the overgrown situation in the South, too much inventory, and you\u2019re giving some reasons why that could be alleviated in the near-term. But every county in the Southeast isn\u2019t the same. And could you maybe point out where you \u2013 where we should look for early indications of return in sawlogs, maybe particular states or parts of states that you kind of look for?","Doyle Simons","Yes, I\u2019ll just give you one example. There\u2019s a couple of new mills that have started up kind of along the Arkansas, Louisiana border. And as I mentioned earlier, we are starting to see some benefit in some of those areas, where you\u2019ve seen some of this new capacity startup.","So that\u2019s an example of where we are starting to see some benefit and some potential pricing tension in that market, and there\u2019s a lot of markets like that across the South. The good thing about Weyerhaeuser, as you know, we\u2019re just about in every markets. So as that starts to happen, we will participate in that pricing tension.","Chip Dillon","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Today\u2019s final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Quinn","Great. Thanks. Good morning, Doyle and Russell.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Paul.","Russell Hagen","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Quinn","Just had a couple of quick questions. One on the labor issue side, whether you\u2019re seeing contractor inflation. Your contractors coming back to you and asking you for significantly more money, because they\u2019re having issues with getting labor on their side of the \u2013 harvesting \u2013 on the timber side?","Doyle Simons","We are starting to see a little bit of that. It\u2019s much more prevalent on the transportation side than on the actual logging side. But we are seeing \u2013 starting to see a little bit of pressure on their logging side, as well as we move forward. And as I said, I think, inflation, there\u2019s labor inflation or truck inflation, it\u2019s going to be a headwind for us as we move into 2018. And we\u2019ll just kind of work really hard to offset that through our operational excellence efforts.","Paul Quinn","Okay And then just turning to. U.S. South exports, what are your, and I might have missed this, but what are you looking at the Indian market and how do you view that market going forward?","Doyle Simons","Yes. The Indian market is \u2013 so as I mentioned, we are focused on two markets, China and India. India is currently the smaller of those markets. Unlike China, where we had a presence, this is a new presence, but we\u2019re spending a lot of time on the ground there. And we\u2019re encouraged by the opportunity that we see, and I\u2019ll tell you there\u2019s a lot of interest in that market. So, we\u2019re still in the early stages, but encouraged and think that\u2019s a market that has real opportunity to grow as we move into 2018 and beyond.","Paul Quinn","Great. That\u2019s all I had. Best of luck, guys.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Russell Hagen","Thank you.","Doyle Simons","As I understand it, that was our final question. Let me end by thanking, everybody, for joining us this morning. And as always, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Weyerhaeuser fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Q2 2012 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Kathryn McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations. Ms. McAuley, you may begin.","Kathryn F. McAuley","Thank you, Nicole. Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Second Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides for this call can be found at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.","Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","As summarized on Chart 1, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter 2012 net earnings of $84 million or $0.16 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Earnings for the second quarter include after-tax gain of $37 million from special items. These items are detailed in Chart 2, a GAAP reconciliation of earnings before special items. A gain of $33 million or $0.06 per share for postretirement plan amendments, no further gains are anticipated from these benefit changes which were effective June 30; and a gain of $4 million or $0.01 per share for the sale of properties. Excluding special items, the company reported net earnings of $47 million or $0.09 per diluted share.","To provide a better understanding of business operating results, during the second quarter, we began reporting the elimination of intersegment profit on inventory and the LIFO reserve as part of unallocated items. Previously, these amounts were reported in the business segments. For consistency, segment contributions to pretax earnings for first quarter 2012 as well as prior periods have been adjusted to reclassify these amounts as part of unallocated items. These adjustments are detailed on Chart 14. There is no change to Weyerhaeuser's consolidated net earnings for first quarter 2012 or prior years.","Next, turning to our business segments. My comments reviewing the second quarter of 2012 refer to changes from the first quarter of 2012 for all segments, beginning with Timberlands, Charts 3 and 4. Timberlands contributed $77 million to pretax earnings, $7 million more than in Q1. Fee harvest volume seasonally increased in the West and South. In the West, log prices declined nearly $5 per cubic meter as the domestic -- as domestic volumes comprised a higher proportion of sales. Domestic log demand was strong. Third-party volumes increased 19% and domestic log prices rose 2%. Japanese log volumes increased. Japanese log prices were slightly lower. The log export mix shifted towards China where volumes were higher and price is lower. Southern sales volumes increased and log prices rose 2%. Logging costs were higher in the West due to more cable logging on steep terrain, and silviculture costs were lower in the South.","Wood Products, Charts 5 and 6. Wood Products contributed $36 million to pretax earnings, $49 million more than in Q1. The second quarter included a pretax gain of $6 million on a property sale. Lumber price realizations increased $39 per thousand board feet or 13%. Lumber volumes also increased 13%. OSB price realizations rose $17 per thousand square feet or 9%. OSB volumes were 14% higher in Q2. Engineered wood products declined 6% for TJIs and 2% for solid sections. TJI volumes rose 25% from very low level, and solid section increased 9% also from a low level. Log costs slightly increased from Q1, and other manufacturing costs were flat.","Cellulose Fibers, Charts 7 and 8. The pretax contribution from Cellulose Fibers was $36 million, $12 million less than in Q1. Average pulp price realizations were flat in the quarter due to mix. There were 27 days of maintenance downtime in Q2. Manufacturing issues and the timing of shipments reduced pulp sales volumes 5%. Downtime increased costs and reduced productivity.","Real Estate, Charts 9 and 10. The pretax contribution to earnings from Real Estate before special items was $15 million, $23 million more than in Q1. Single-family home closings seasonally increased 46% to 508 homes in Q2 from 349 homes in Q1. Home closings increased 11% from the same quarter last year. Gross margins increased to nearly 20% in Q2 from 17% in Q1. The average home closing price was $374,000, nearly flat with Q1. The closing price declined 4% from the same quarter last year due to mix.","Unallocated items, Chart 11. The foreign exchange loss was $8 million in Q2 due to a weaker Canadian dollar. This was a $14 million swing from Q1. As discussed earlier, the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO, formerly reported at the segment level, is now recorded in unallocated items.","Now I will turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us this morning. On this call, I will provide you with a perspective of our quarterly results.","Overall, I'm very pleased with our performance during the quarter. All of our businesses were profitable. Importantly, business improvement initiatives within our Wood Products segment are yielding clear results above and beyond those realized from an improving housing market. Our aggressive actions to improve performance are beginning to show the strength of our businesses and to position us to capture the full benefit of the market recovery as it unfolds. Our work is not yet done, and we will continue to focus on improving our performance to capture the full value of our businesses.","As you know, U.S. housing is very important to us as it affects 3 of our 4 businesses: Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate, which I'll be referring to as WRECO. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter last year, we've been experiencing a gradual improvement in the housing market that extended through the spring selling season this year and is continuing into the third quarter. Last quarter, we reported a 30% increase in our WRECO sales year-over-year. Our momentum continued to build through the second quarter, and at the end of the quarter, year-to-date WRECO sales are up 38%.","During our first quarter call, I noted that we had not yet seen a significant effect on our Wood Products sales due to the time lag between new home sales and starts. Now it's clear that sales by WRECO and other builders earlier in the year, together with improved sales activity in the second quarter, are resulting in increased starts across the country, boosting demand for Wood Products. Improved demand for Wood Products is in turn increasing domestic demand for logs from our Timberlands. Housing construction is on a path to return to long-term trend levels necessary to meet the needs of a growing population and household formation, although we're well aware that the recovery is still somewhat fragile.","Now I'll comment on the performance in each of our businesses in the second quarter. In Timberlands, our earnings improved 10% over the prior quarter. Harvest levels were up 5% overall, somewhat more in the West than the South. Third-party sales volumes increased for both domestic and export customers. Third-party domestic sales volume increased 16% as a result of increased demand related to housing activity as well as seasonal pickup in the West. Export volume grew a healthy 6% during the quarter, with a shift in mix among our 3 primary markets: Japan, China and Korea.","Japan continues to be by far our largest and most stable Asian market, representing over 75% of our export volume during the quarter. Log sales volume to Japan increased 5% to meet demand driven by increased Japanese housing starts. Log shipments to China had slowed in the latter part of 2011 and early 2012 after significant increases in 2010 and early 2011. We were not expecting much recovery from China until the latter part of this year, but we were able to capture better-than-expected demand during the quarter, leading to a 44% increase quarter-over-quarter. Though a much smaller percentage of our export activity, this increase in volume to China helped to raise total export volume and offset a decline in Korea shipments.","In Wood Products, we had a strong quarter as a result of improved market conditions and our improvement initiatives. This was our best quarter since 2006 point 2. EBITDA was $63 million for the quarter, up $80 million compared to last year. Sales volumes for all products increased quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year. Production rates increased across all product lines in response to increased demand, allowing us to capture production efficiencies.","The good news for our Wood Products business is that there was a spring this year, as buyers returned to the housing market and builders followed through by increasing housing starts. Our improvement during the quarter was of course helped by increased housing activity, but we're also seeing the payoff of improvement initiatives across our business. These initiatives have resulted in increased revenue from new products and new markets and reductions in cost to production and operations.","Year-to-date, earnings in this segment have improved $103 million from last year, more than half of which is attributable to our business improvement efforts. While we still have more work ahead of us to improve our competitiveness, we've made great progress and we're better positioned than ever to profit from improving market conditions that will come with the housing recovery.","Shifting to WRECO. We had a solid quarter, with earnings from land sales and single-family operations. Though our overall community count is down slightly from 1 year ago, year-to-date closings are up 4% and sales are up 38%. Our backlog is up 53%, which will lead to a continuing increase in closings in the third and fourth quarters. Further signs of market stabilization are a 39% decline in our unsold inventory from 1 year ago and a firming of house home prices across most of our markets. Prices for new sales in June were 5% higher than 1 year ago. I know that you like to have a bit of color on what's happening in our markets, so here are some highlights of our sales activity during the first half of the year.","Southern California, Las Vegas and Arizona were some of the markets hardest hit during the housing recession, and each are beginning to rebound. Our sales have more than doubled in Arizona. In Las Vegas, our sales are up over 60%, and in Southern California, sales are up nearly 20%. In the Seattle area, sales are up over 40%. Houston has been a steady market for us throughout the housing recession, and sales there are up nearly 20%. And in the Maryland and Virginia suburbs of Washington D.C., sales are up over 20% and we're underway with our first project in nearby Richmond, Virginia.","Based on our own WRECO experience, our message is that the housing market conditions continue to improve as fundamentals stabilize and confidence begins to build.","My final business comments relate to our Cellulose Fibers business. Demand for our Cellulose Fibers products held steady during the quarter. Planned maintenance and some unanticipated operational issues, which are now resolved, led to lower production levels during the quarter. With the exception of these onetime operational issues in this quarter, this business has been operating extraordinarily well. We continue to make progress during our planned shutdowns to make changes that will allow us to transition to an 18-month maintenance cycle. During the quarter, we received regulatory approval at our Longview mill to move to an 18-month cycle.","And now I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss third quarter outlook, as well as our financial highlights.","Patricia M. Bedient","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everybody. We anticipate continued improvement in our overall operating results in the third quarter as compared to the second. The comments regarding the outlook for the third quarter are summarized on Chart 12, and I'll begin my remarks with Timberlands.","In the West, export realizations are expected to be slightly lower. Export prices and volumes to China are expected to increase, which will result in a heavier mix to China, which lowers the overall export realization. Log exports to Japan remain strong but continued to be affected by the weak euro, which underpins the competition from European laminated lumber. Western domestic log prices are anticipated to weaken in the third quarter compared to the second, as more seasonal volume is marketed by smaller private landowners. Costs for road maintenance are expected to be seasonally higher but will be partially offset by lower fuel costs.","In the South, realizations for logs are likely to be somewhat lower with a heavier mix to pulpwood. Fee harvest volume should increase seasonally, although the increased income will be offset by higher silviculture spending. Minerals revenue will be slightly higher. Nonstrategic land sales are expected to increase. Overall, third quarter Timberlands income is expected to be comparable to the second quarter results.","In our Wood Products segment, we expect third quarter sales volumes to be flat to slightly down compared to the second quarter. Sales realizations may soften seasonally, especially for lumber, although overall channel inventories remain thinly stocked. Log costs are projected to increase in Canada, be flat in the South and lower in the West. We expect the Wood Products segment to be solidly profitable in the third quarter, although earnings may not be as strong as second quarter results. As Dan mentioned, our business improvement initiatives have resulted in much stronger performance. We continue to focus on driving improvements in our operating results in addition to taking advantage of the market recovery.","In Cellulose Fibers, pulp prices are expected to experience downward pressure as the weak euro and the uncertain international economic environment persists. We expect pulp sales volumes to increase, offsetting the effect of weaker prices. Pulp production is forecasted to increase, as there is only one maintenance outage in Q3 versus 2 in the second quarter, and reliability is expected to improve. As a result, maintenance cost is also expected to be lower. Costs for chemicals, energy and fiber are all expected to decrease, although freight is expected to increase slightly. Overall results in our Cellulose Fibers segment should be substantially higher in the third quarter compared to the second.","In our Real Estate segment, single-family home closings are expected to improve by over 25% from 508 in the second quarter to approximately 640 closings. The higher closings reflect seasonal increases as well as the stronger home sales from earlier in the year, which are now making their way into home closings. Average prices are expected to decline slightly due to mix, while gross margins are expected to approximate 20%. Selling costs will likely increase due to higher closing volume.","Earnings from single-family operations are anticipated to increase in the third quarter as compared to the second. Earnings in the second quarter included $12 million from land and lot sales. It's possible that the third quarter could also include some land sales, but the amount and timing is difficult to forecast.","Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. We ended the quarter with cash of $861 million, an increase of $133 million since the end of the first quarter. Capital expenditures in the second quarter totaled $75 million. This brings the total for the first 6 months of this year to $139 million including reforestation. Major capital projects include a pulp converting facility in Poland, replacing of operators at our pulp mill in Grand Prairie, Alberta, Canada and a fiber line upgrade at our Columbus, Mississippi pulp mill. We still expect total capital expenditures for the year to approximate $290 million.","During the third quarter, we expect to spend approximately $180 million for debt maturities and approximately $110 million for interest, which includes semiannual payments. As can be seen from Chart 13, our debt maturities for the next 5 years total approximately $600 million, well below our current cash balance. In addition, we have a $1 billion line of credit with no borrowings outstanding.","In summary, we have very strong liquidity, improved operating performance and a strengthening housing market, all of which should enhance future cash flows.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions.","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Patty. The housing recovery looks and feels real. We've continued to make improvements across all of our businesses, and I'm encouraged, but not satisfied, by the progress we've made.","We're focusing on what we can control, improving our operating performance and our relative competitiveness. We're well positioned to take full advantage of the long-term economic recovery that lies in front of us.","And now we welcome your questions and your comments. Kathy?","Kathryn F. McAuley","Nicole, will you please open the floor for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions, and one maybe a little more strategic. Was there -- can you quantify any landfill and mineral income that you saw in the second quarter in Timberlands?","Daniel S. Fulton","With respect to minerals income, minerals income were roughly flat quarter-over-quarter, Gail. What we saw was a decline in income from our gas properties and some of our hard mineral properties, offset by increases in revenues from oil shale activity in the Tuscaloosa basin, where we have property. With respect to dispositions, dispositions were, on a quarter-over-quarter basis, relatively flat.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just strategically thinking about it, last year, I know you talked about seeing a material change in your homebuilding business with the talk around the fiscal debt dealings debate. And I'm just wondering, is your sense this year with the fiscal close to be kind of looming that the market would be more resilient as that rhetoric kind of ramps up? Or do you have any fear or worries from the trends that you're seeing that we could repeat what happened last year?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, last year, we did see a setback in market confidence surrounding the debate about raising the debt limit, and it had a real impact on consumer confidence and housing sales. This year, there has been a lot of discussion. Just I think last week, Fed Chairman Bernanke was in front of Congress talking about those very same issues. At year end, we have an expiration of the Bush era tax cuts. We have the congressionally imposed sequestration process that will take over at the beginning of the year if nothing is done, and then we have a longer-term challenge around fiscal policies. So we are concerned, and that was fundamentally the message that Bernanke had to Congress. We risk an upset in the economy if we're not able to deal with those issues. The good news for us this year is that the housing market seems to be shaking off. That concern at this point in time, given the numbers that we reported this morning and the year-over-year activity, we're encouraged, but I think we still have confidence issues to deal with among homebuyers and in the general public because it not only affects home sales, it affects retail sales and overall employment.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just maybe one last one on China. I'm surprised to hear that you're kind of ramping up your volumes given what we've heard from some others. Someone suggested yesterday that perhaps inventories were starting to build up in China again. Can you just give a little bit of color there?","Daniel S. Fulton","Our experience has been that inventories were building late last year and early this year, which is when we saw the significant falloff in volume as well as some pullback in price. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we had been assuming that we would see a pickup come back in the latter part of the year. And in fact, we're encouraged to see the opportunity to increase our export activity more towards the end of the second quarter. So we've been developing strong relationships in China. The customers appreciate the quality of the logs that we're shipping and the dependability of our entire logistical chain. And we expect that, that activity will increase over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A couple of questions on Timberlands. The first is Southern sawlog prices have obviously been depressed for a number of years. And with the strength that we've seen in lumber and housing starts picking up, are you seeing any of that strength kind of flow back to the stump? And what is that kind of lag that you would expect between strength in lumber and strength in sawlogs?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, it ultimately does flow back. In the South in particular, we are more dependent on domestic demand as compared to our position in the West where we have export markets. We have had some recovery in pricing. As Patty mentioned in her remarks, as we go forward to the third quarter, we see average realization declined. But that is more of a mix issue as we expect to be selling more pulpwood. In general, in the South, you want to look at U.S. housing recovery and that's what's going to translate into timber values.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then in the West, you referenced lower expected export log realizations in 3Q. And is that purely a mix issue as well? Or apples-to-apples, are you seeing some deterioration of export prices into July?","Patricia M. Bedient","Really, Anthony, that's more of a mix issue. So we'll have more volume as a percentage going into China. Our Japan volumes continue to be very strong. Japan has an uptick in their housing starts this year based upon the very low mortgage rates that they have, but also some concern about consumption tax increases a couple of years out. So as well as rebuilding from the tsunami, which we haven't seen a lot of yet but appears to maybe starting to make its way in. So it really is more from a realization perspective the fact that there is more mixed going into China on a relative basis. But all of those volumes are still pretty strong.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one last quick one. In engineered wood that you saw volumes rising sequentially but it really looks like prices kind of fell a little bit sequentially. And I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about what you're seeing in solid section in TJIs, and if you're seeing any kind of pickup in that business.","Daniel S. Fulton","We have seen a pickup in volume as housing starts begin to recover. As we've explained in the past, our engineered wood relies more heavily on new construction as compared to our OSB business and our lumber business, which has a much broader mix of markets. And so the volume pickup is, we would believe, is related to the early stages of housing recovery. With respect to price, there is still -- there are lower operating rates in that industry than in lumber and OSB to competitive marketplace. And we are seeing some signs of some pickup in pricing as we move into the third quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to maybe pick up on Anthony's question. In terms of operating rates within your other wood products business, could you comment at all in terms of where you stand? And are there any areas that are still troubling to you, x EWP, which you already covered?","Daniel S. Fulton","During the second quarter, our operating rates for lumber business were in the high 80% range, up quarter-over-quarter from the first quarter. Our OSB business is operating in roughly the low 80s, George. Engineered wood business, overall, still less than 50% if we include a couple of facilities, which have been indefinitely curtailed. As we look at the operations that we are manufacturing in today, we'd be in the 50% range. So we've got a lot of room to flex up. I'm not concerned about our ability to respond to increased demand because we do have the ability to, especially in lumber, add some shifts. And we've been pleased with the uptick in productivity.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Dan, I'm not sure that we would be able to actually model it, but just to understand, if we continue to see progress in, obviously, the housing markets and therefore the product markets for you, holding price constant, should we see the same level of incremental profitability with that improvement in volume and utilization rates in wood and OSB? Or in theory, might you see actually an incrementally higher rate of profit dollars as demand comes in? And why or why not?","Daniel S. Fulton","We have a lot of cost inputs, George. And so it is a function of not just log costs but also energy costs, chemicals. But as we increase volume, we do enjoy operating efficiencies. And so we fundamentally have covered fixed costs. We need to cover variable but there should be a corresponding uptick in margin, assuming that input costs are held constant.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. So what I'm hearing from you is basically, holding those constants, your incrementals will stay basically at the same rate as long as volume keeps moving up. I guess the last couple questions I had for you, one, why are you seeing a mix towards pulpwood in the South since we're seeing an improvement in housing since hopefully that would be driving higher sawlog prices -- or demand, I should say? And then to cellulose fibers, would it be possible to parse out what the, if you will, exceptional factors were in the second quarter that hopefully don't recur in the third quarter, what the profit dollars associated with that -- those items were?","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, George. I'll take those. I think from the standpoint of a little more mix of pulpwood in the South, we have our spending that goes on as well. So I don't think there's any type of big change driven by pricing in those 2. But more of just the silviculture regime of a little more thinning volume. In terms of pulp, to help you a little bit of getting from the first quarter to the second quarter, or from the second quarter to the third, as I said in my remarks, we have just one outage in the third quarter compared to 2. And we had about 27 days of downtime in the second quarter. So let's just say we have half of that, so about $14 million. And as I've said in the past, maintenance expense runs, for just the maintenance costs itself, about $1 million a day. So we should have $14 million less in just maintenance cost. And in the second quarter, we also finished up a couple of things from the first quarter shut. So maybe maintenance cost itself is around $14 million, $15 million less quarter-over-quarter. Then we also have the increased productivity as a result of producing more pulp, which is similar in amount. And then as I mentioned in my remarks, we'll also have a little lower chemical and fiber costs. So all in all, I would expect that profits in the third quarter should be roughly twice what they were in the second quarter.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Two things. Patty, you didn't sound as optimistic about land sales next quarter as I might have expected. Are you seeing a meaningful pickup in conversations with builders who are short of land as we talked about a year ago? And I'm just curious how that opportunity looks to you now versus a year ago.","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes, Mark. We do continue to have land sales that we do market. It really was more a function of not optimism about it, but the ability to really tell you what the amount and timing of those will be. So we are still in the market with -- as you know, we have a longer pipeline than most of the other builders. So it wasn't a comment about optimism. It was really more a comment about the forecast of timing and the amount of those.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Okay. And one more question. Just on fluff pulp, are you still selling primarily to the same customers? I'm trying to get a sense of whether the new capacity that's coming is just lowering prices or whether there's also a customer reshuffle going on as well that's going to impact you.","Daniel S. Fulton","Mark, we've not had any significant change in the customers. In fact, the customers that we work with rely on us. They need our product and we're part of their growth plans, not just in the U.S. but also in the global market. So we have not experienced any significant shift in customers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","First question is for Patty. Are there going to be any changes that you anticipate next year? And maybe you can give us some magnitude in your pension funding based on the highway bill provision.","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, Chip. As you referenced, Congress did pass an amendment along with the highway bill in June, which basically changed the way that the discount rate was computed for purposes of determining minimum pension contribution funding. So we had disclosed that we would have about a $60 million contribution due no later than the middle of September 2013 for our U.S. qualified plan. And based upon the legislation, we don't believe that, that contribution will be needed.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And then on a separate note, I'm having a little trouble, maybe I just missed something that's different about you guys, but I'm having trouble seeing the doubling of income in pulp. All the numbers you gave add up, but we left out price. And we've been seeing an unusual situation where softwood has been, if you will, softer than hardwood prices. And so I didn't know how that came into the mix.","Daniel S. Fulton","Chip, what we've got going from the second quarter to third quarter is, as Patty mentioned, lower maintenance, more up-time because we don't have the same number of scheduled maintenance shutdowns. We also encountered, as we noted, some operational issues during the second quarter that impacted our volume by about 5%. Those were onetime issues. They've been resolved. And so as we look forward into the -- going from second to third quarter, we recover that 5% volume, plus we add volume that we lost during the second quarter related to our annual shutdowns.","Patricia M. Bedient","We also had a little more in-transit inventory at the end of the second quarter for pulp on the water that didn't close out in the second quarter that will come into the third. So weaker pricing basically just gets offset by the increased volume in terms of that's why you don't see that adding up in the numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So first of all, on Wood Products, clearly a very solid quarter there. But just looking at your price realizations, if my numbers are right, I think you sold lumber for $58 more per thousand board feet relative to last quarter, would imply that just from the lumber pricing, you should have seen that type of pickup in the EBIT. And is there anything going on, on the cost line in that Wood Products business that held back the pricing leverage that, I think, you should have seen in the second quarter?","Daniel S. Fulton","No, there's nothing significant there. We had a slight uptick in log costs during the quarter but not significant. Manufacturing costs quarter-over-quarter were about the same. So the increase that comes through in Wood Products generally is a combination of all of our products.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. Is any of the log costs linked to the lumber price in the Wood Products business?","Daniel S. Fulton","No. We don't have a tie-in arrangement or indexing. The logs that are purchased by our Wood Products business are purchased at market prices from internal sources or external sources. And so there is no indexing. Some of our competitors have started to move to that. We are not doing it.","Patricia M. Bedient","Alex, as you think about the leverage, we did see significant leverage in the lumber business as well as the OSB business. So in terms of getting those numbers through in the second quarter, those certainly came through. We did not see the same kind of improvement in engineered wood and our distribution business. So that's probably the piece that you're missing.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, Patty. And then just on the commentary around seasonally lower profitability certainly makes a lot of sense in the context of lumber prices always seasonally softening in the third and through the fourth quarter. But if we were to hold the lumber price constant where it is today, how should we be thinking about the profitability level in Wood Products in the third quarter?","Patricia M. Bedient","I would say that if prices stay constant that you would see because volumes, we're saying, are flat to maybe slightly down a little bit. We took a little bit of downtime in the southern lumber system Fourth of July holiday. But I would say that results will be similar to the second quarter. And we hope that's the case, Alex.","Alex Ovshey Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, same here. And just on WRECO, a number of the home builders have been taking reversal to tax valuation allowance, so that had been established through the very deep recession in housing. Can you just remind us how much of the book value in real estate was written down through the downturn and whether there's an opportunity for you to be able to do that as well?","Daniel S. Fulton","We do not have the same situation as the public home builders because that fundamentally is their only business. And we file a consolidated return, and so we didn't have the same tax effect that they would have had.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","First question I had, it looked like there was about $100 million worth of land in lot sales in the second quarter. Is it possible to get some sense of where and why on that?","Daniel S. Fulton","The land and lot sales during the quarter were primarily related -- this is a WRECO question, I assume.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, it is. Yes, yes, yes.","Daniel S. Fulton","So that was the sale of Cross Creek Ranch, which we actually talked on the last call, but the closing took place in the second quarter. So that was a master plan community that we had developed in Houston. We sold that property, and so that's what was going through the WRECO books. We booked income on that. As part of that transaction, what we did is we actually -- the benefit of that was not only bringing cash back to our balance sheet so that we can redeploy it elsewhere, but we capitalized on the value that we had created and also established a relationship with the buyer where we have the opportunity to buy lots from that same buyer, not just in Cross Creek in the future but also other properties.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. That's helpful. Second question, Patty, the tax rate in the quarter was a little bit higher than we would have expected, especially if you back out the Timberland earnings. Can you give us a little more color on that?","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes. As you really think about the tax rate, Mark, probably the easiest way to get there is, at the way that we compute the rate is, as you mentioned, on our REIT Timberland earnings we won't pay any tax. And so we look at the tax rate for our TRS earnings, in this case year-to-date it's a TRS loss. So if you take our year-to-date earnings, which are on Chart 1 of the package, so you have -- and exclude the special items, you've got about pretax earnings of about $200 million and back out the interest expense, which is around $170 million. So you end up then with a TRS loss of $115 million, give or take. And then if you back out all the tax on the special items, and those are also delineated separately for you on Chart 2, you'll get to a tax rate for the quarter on that -- or year-to-date on that computation of a little over 20%. And our year-to-date effective rate -- or effective rate for the TRS for 2012 is just under 23%. So that'll get you pretty close in the ballpark. So I don't know how you did your computation but those would, if you take that, back out the Timberland earnings, back out the special items and the tax effect of the special items, you'll get to just almost that 20%.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then the one other question. Dan, I noticed on the announcement around the forest capital sale a couple of weeks ago, that they specifically pulled out about 0.25 million acres of gas and oil rights down in Louisiana. And I know that you've got, I think, over 1 million acres in Louisiana, as well as about 600,000 or 700,000 up at Arkansas and some more over in Texas. Have you guys looked carefully at what you think the potential value of mineral rights across the South is? Because I think all of your land pretty much has mineral rights.","Daniel S. Fulton","All of our land -- I mean, I can't say 100% we have mineral rights on every single acre of property. But in fact, we have mineral rights on more property than we own across [indiscernible].","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes, that's what I thought.","Daniel S. Fulton","So we have roughly 7 million acres of mineral rights as compared to roughly 6 million of Timberland. We do have properties in the South, in the areas that you've discussed. Some of our properties are in the Haynesville Shale area, which we have talked about in the past and where we have active leasing activity and drilling activity. And what we do, just to remind everybody on the call, is generally we'll enter into operating leases with exploration companies. They spend the capital to develop the resource, and then we have a royalty interest that we receive over time. So our income stream is a combination of front-end leases and royalties. We also have land in the Tuscaloosa oil basin, which is subject to a lot higher level of interest right now, because oil is more attractive to the industry than shale gas. But we manage those properties aggressively. We are actively monetizing those properties. We have had a historic practice of not selling those rights but rather retaining them and monetizing them with annual steady income, which we happen to favor. I cannot put a value on all of our mineral rights, and I specifically can't give you a number for what our properties would be worth in that region other than to say that we've got active leases, we've got active exploration going on, and it becomes a fairly steady part of our Timberlands' P&L.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","And are you -- how satisfied are you that you're really kind of -- you're maximizing value right now, I guess? Or is it -- how far along are you in the process of you think of really understanding exactly how much value you've got and then extracting it?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, we know what we have. One of the things that has emerged over the last 5-plus years is the development of new technology. So frac-ing. That opened up the shale gas opportunity, not just for us but really for the entire United States. And then we're seeing that same technology used in the oil shale basin. So what we do is we enter into highly -- leases with highly qualified operators. They develop the resource. If they are successful, then in fact, we receive those royalties over time. So I'm confident that we know what we've got. I'm really optimistic about the potential future income stream from those properties. And I'm very encouraged about what the development of those resources mean for this country. We are fast becoming energy-independent, and that's a good thing for us generally as a country. And we'll also -- we're already starting to see the impact on some on-shoring of jobs because of low energy prices.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","One quick technical and then one bigger strategy. On the unallocated, since you changed the accounting, should we still be using a $20 million to $25 million, or does that actually go up a little bit?","Patricia M. Bedient","Over the course of the year, Mark, it will basically pretty much wash out. It will maybe be a little bit higher this year as we build inventories. A lot of that reduction comes from -- when we sell from one segment to the next, we sell at market price. But for anything that's less than inventory, we have to back out that intercompany profit. So the reason that we brought it into the unallocated segment was really to give you a better view of what the stand-alone business results were by segment. So as you think about our Wood Products business, for example, in the first quarter where we're building inventory, they would be unduly penalized and then they would get that back when they sold that inventory later in the year. So to take that noise out of the system, that's really why we pulled it out of the segments and put it into unallocated, so you could track it very easily from one to the next. But I would expect that as the year progresses, that will likely stay at a pretty low level, and then you'll see another piece come back in the first quarter of 2013, similar to the larger amount that you saw in the first quarter of this year. The other thing, Mark, that really jumps around in that segment, you can see it there as well is the foreign exchange. So the unallocated number really increased over what our guidance typically would have been because of the change in the currency, Canadian dollar. So that was a $14 million negative swing quarter-over-quarter.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","And then on the dividend, you've articulated how, over the course of time, you expect to pay out roughly 75%, et cetera. And now things are getting better. Are you likely to view where the dividend should be on a looking kind of a trailing of what you have achieved, or is it more an outlook of where things seem to be going? Because obviously we're at a point where, hopefully, things are getting better. And are you going to likely be proactive on the dividend or more reactive?","Daniel S. Fulton","Mark, I don't want to get ahead of our board on this one. You articulated our policy very well. So we set the dividend at a target range of 75% of our funds available for distribution over the cycle. We are focused, as we set the dividend, not on looking back but looking forward. And so what we are looking at as we review the dividend level is our future earnings potential, our view of market conditions. We take into consideration the certainty or the level of volatility in forecasts. And those are the areas that the board focuses on as we look forward. So I would say, really quick answer, we're not looking back. We're looking forward. And we are targeting that 75% over the cycle. So we're looking forward to seeing our earnings and cash flow increase, and we're looking forward to the opportunity to increase the dividend.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered, but I did have one on engineered wood products. You kind of touched on it. But the fact that prices fell when -- especially for I-beams when the input, the flanges and web stock were rising, just is troublesome. So is it just too much production, or is there anything else?","Daniel S. Fulton","I would simply observe that it's market pricing by a range of competitors. And I can't comment beyond that. As I said, we are starting to see some increase as we move into the third quarter. But I've got nothing else to add.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Got it. And then just -- you only have one sawmill left in British Columbia, and I should know this. But is Princeton on the interior? Are you having significant issues with sawdust that's very fine?","Daniel S. Fulton","We are not. We're very -- we've had some significant issues -- the industry has in British Columbia. A lot of speculation about the sawdust, and is that or is that not related to beetle wood. We do not have that problem. Our mills, we believe, are operating safely. They've been inspected closely by all appropriate authorities, and so it has not been an issue for us.","Patricia M. Bedient","And Princeton is in an area, Steve, that is less affected by the mountain pine beetle than most of the other B.C. mills on the [indiscernible].","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Yes. I was kind of interested because of those 2 catastrophic events and wondering whether I guess the province was putting incremental scrutiny, I suppose, on your practices.","Daniel S. Fulton","They've inspected, and we've gotten a good report card.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Two quick questions. On the Timberland side, you mentioned that you'll have some -- I may have missed it before, but some nonstrategic sales in the third quarter. Can you just remind us what the total acreage is that you would still classify there as nonstrategic?","Daniel S. Fulton","It's actually a very small percentage of our acreage, Josh. We include that number, I believe, in our fact book. It's certainly less than 10% overall. And so when we talk about nonstrategic, we identify what's core, what's not. We do not have significant acreage that we would consider to be nonstrategic.","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the homebuilding side, it looks like capitalized interest moved up pretty decently this quarter. Is that more directly correlated with the backlog and the home closings? Or is that more reflective of increased community count?","Daniel S. Fulton","I can't answer that question.","Patricia M. Bedient","So Josh, could you ask your question one more time?","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes. The capitalized interest on the home -- on WRECO.","Patricia M. Bedient","On the rollout of capitalized interest?","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just the absolute amount of capitalized interest. Is that -- I mean, it went up fairly significantly this quarter. Is that more reflective of additional backlog and closings in the quarter, or does that have to do more with future community count and...","Patricia M. Bedient","I think most of that is a result of the Cross Creek sale. So it was a large sale that took place in the second quarter, so we also had to roll out the capitalized interest with it at the same time. So that's more of an aberration of the size of that sale more than anything else.","Daniel S. Fulton","So Josh, the rollout occurs as we have closings, not as we have sales. And you made the comment about backlog, and just to be clear, it happens as we roll out as we have closings. So over time, as closings go up, you'd see that number move.","Well, I would like to thank everyone for your attendance today and for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser Company.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Beth Baum","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2018 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our Web site.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our Web site.","On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.","Devin Stockfish","All right, thanks, Beth. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As most of you know, this is my first earnings call as Weyerhaeuser CEO. I'm surely honored to be taking on the leadership of this great company.","I'm going to open this morning with a discussion of our financial results, then Russell will talk about outlook, and I will wrap up with a few comments on the vision and strategy going forward, and my focus area is for 2019.","This morning Weyerhaeuser reported full-year net earnings of $748 million or $0.99 per diluted share on net sales of $7.5 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $891 million or a $1.18 per share, an improvement of 2% compared with 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was similar to last year at slightly over $2 billion.","For fourth quarter, we reported a GAAP loss of $93 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. This loss was driven by a previously-announced non-cash charge following completion of a lump sum offer that reduced our U.S. pension liabilities by over $660 million. Excluding special items, we earned $70 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the quarter. I'm proud of the fourth quarter and full-year performance as our teams delivered strong results through a full range of market conditions, capitalizing on the upside and effectively managing the downside.","In 2018, we generated over $2 billion of EBITDA, including $1 billion of Wood Products EBITDA for the second year in a row. We grew EBITDA from our real estate, energy, and natural resources business by nearly 10%. We captured over $40 million of OpEx improvements in our Timberlands business. We delivered a 65% premium to timber value from real estate sales, significantly exceeding our 30% target. We return nearly $1.4 billion at cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we initiated a series of actions that reduced our pension liabilities by over $2 billion. This includes the annuity purchase transaction that we announced earlier this week.","In a moment I will dive into our business results, but first, let me set the stage with some brief comments on the housing market. Much has been written about the slowdown or pause in U.S. housing during the second-half of 2018, and what it make signal for the year ahead. As interest rates and home prices continue to increase in the back-half of the year, it became apparent that many potential buyers were staying on the sidelines due to concerns about affordability. This dynamic persisted through the fourth quarter, exacerbated by increased volatility in financial markets, the threat of a government shutdown, and extremely wet weather that limited construction activity in parts of the U.S. south.","However, notwithstanding a slower back-half of the year, we again experienced year-over-year growth in the U.S. housing market in 2018. Through November, single-family and total starts were up 4% to 5% compared with 2017. Expenditures for repair and remodeling, which comprises about 40% of lumber demand are up over 7%.","Looking forward to 2019, fundamental economic data remains very supportive for U.S. housing. Real wages are increasing, employment continues to rise with unemployment at the lowest level since 1969, and job growth in key housing markets continues to be strong. These trends plus favorable demographics are driving the highest levels of household formation in 15 years. For 2018, household formations are expected to total approximately 1.5 million.","On balance, housing remains affordable by historical standards. Mortgage rates have decreased approximately 50 basis points since early November, and builders are actively adjusting amenities and floor plans to target a more affordable price point. Additionally, are current inventory of homes for sales is low. All of this, points to continued growth in U.S. housing. For 2019, we anticipate total starts of approximately 1.3 million, with the improvement driven primarily by increased single-family activity.","Turning now to our fourth quarter business results, I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts five through seven. Timberlands contributed $107 million in the fourth quarter earnings and $188 to adjusted EBITDA. This is lower than the previous quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower realization for Western logs. Western Timberlands EBITDA declined $27 million compared with the third quarter, as seasonal increase in our fee harvest volumes was more than offset by a 10% decrease in average logs sales realizations. Road cost increased slightly as we took advantage of favorable weather to complete road building activities deferred earlier in 2018.","In the Western domestic market, average realizations declined as lumber mills entered the fourth quarter with high log inventories and a number of mills took extended holiday downtime or temporarily curtailed operations in response to low lumber prices. As the quarter progressed, log supplies across the system declined seasonally, and supply has come back into balance with demand.","In our export markets, Chinese construction and infrastructure activity remains strong. Log inventories at Chinese ports declined by over 20% during the quarter, and ended the year below normal at 209 million cubic meters. Our export log volumes increased as customer demand normalized after China implemented a 5% tariff on our Hemlock and Douglas fir export logs in the third quarter. Average realizations declined slightly.","In Japan, post-and-beam housing starts ended 2018 essentially flat with the year ago, and demand for our customer's products and our logs remains solid. Our export log sales volumes to Japan increased compared with the third quarter due to timing of shipments, and average log sales realizations declined moderately. Overall, our fourth quarter export revenue was comparable to last year, with slightly higher sales volumes in both Japan and China, offset by slightly lower average realizations.","Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands EBITDA increased $9 million compared with the third quarter. Fourth quarter weather was very wet across our southern ownership. This limited log supplies resulting in lean mill inventories and slightly improved log pricing. Our average southern log realizations decreased slightly compared with the third quarter due to mix as we harvested a smaller average fee size during the quarter. Fee harvest volume increased due to additional stumpage sales. Although stumpage is a small portion of our sales volume, we look to capitalize on opportunities when we can capture a premium over delivered log margins.","Forestry expense was also slightly lower as we deferred some activity due to wet weather. On the export side, southern log export volumes decreased due to a full quarter of China export tariffs. Average realizations for southern export logs were roughly flat. Demand has been stable since the tariffs were imposed in late August and our southern pine logs continue to be assessed at a 25% rate. On a full-year basis, our southern export log volumes increased nearly 50% compared with 2017, despite a partial year of tariffs. Although the tariff significantly reduced the amount of volume coming out of our southern export business, we look forward to growth there as trade tension ease eventually. Comparing overall Southern Timberlands results with the year-ago quarter, EBITDA declined due to lower harvest volumes and slightly higher harvest in whole cost.","In 2018, we harvested a smaller portion of our volume during the fourth quarter. Northern Timberlands EBITDA was $2 million more than the third quarter and $3 million less than the same period a year ago. Fee harvest volumes increased seasonally in most areas. Average realizations decreased modestly due to mix as we harvested a smaller proportion of hardwood grade logs in West Virginia due to extremely wet weather.","Real estate, Energy, and Natural Resources, charts eight and nine. Real estate and ENR contributed $44 million to the fourth quarter earnings and $90 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA was $4 million higher than the third quarter and $3 million higher than a year ago. For the full-year, the segment generated $264 million of EBITDA, up $23 million from 2017. The number of acres sold in the fourth quarter decreased significantly compared to the third quarter that was comparable to a year ago. Average price breaker was much higher than the third quarter, and also higher than a year ago, due to the geographic mix of property sold.","Approximately 85% of the acres sold in the fourth quarter were located in the West and the South, whereas in the third quarter, over half of the acres sold were in Montana, where timberland prices are regionally lower. Average land basis as a percentage of real estate sales was lower than third quarter, but higher than fourth quarter 2017. As a result, the segment's fourth quarter contribution to earnings was $8 million more than the third quarter, but $6 million lower than a year ago.","Wood Products, charts 10 and 11; Wood Products contributed $26 million in the fourth quarter earnings and $66 million to adjusted EBITDA. Earnings and EBITDA were significantly lower than third quarter in the same period last year due to lower realization for lumber and OSB. EBITDA for lumber decreases $112 million compared with third quarter. This was almost entirely attributable to lower average realizations. Lumber prices declined through the month of October, stabilized in November, and remained largely flat through year-end, as the pause in housing activity and early winter weather in the East reinforced the normal seasonal reduction in lumber demand.","The framing lumber composite averaged 26% lower in the fourth quarter compared with the third, and our average realizations decreased $103 per 1000 board fee or 21%. Our lumber sales volumes decreased 7% compared with the third quarter as we took some downtime for completion of capital projects and operated at a reduced shift posture at certain mills around the holidays.","Although our cash cost for Western and Canadian logs declined during the fourth quarter, there was a minimal benefit from these lower log costs in fourth quarter financial results due to cost accounting. Much of the lumber we sold in the fourth quarter was manufactured using logs purchased in the third quarter and early fourth quarter when log prices were higher. As a result, our cost of sales mostly reflects these higher log costs. We expect to realize most of the benefits from lower fourth quarter log costs in our first quarter results.","Fourth quarter EBITDA includes $4 million of charges for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. Comparing our fourth quarter results with the year-ago quarter, average sales realizations for lumber was significantly lower. Log costs were higher, and manufacturing costs increased slightly.","OSB EBITDA decreased $46 million compared with the third quarter due to lower average realizations. Fourth quarter OSB pricing generally mirrored that of lumber, and our average realization declined $69 per 1,000 square feet or 21%. Fourth quarter sales volumes were comparable to our lower-than-normal third quarter as our third quarter sales volumes were limited by a scheduled outage to replace the press at our Grayling Michigan mill. The outage extended for mid-July through late-October, and the mill returned to full production by year-end. Comparing our fourth quarter results to the year-ago quarter, average sales realizations for OSB decreased 25% and sales volumes decreased 5%. Fiber costs were slightly higher, and manufacturing costs increased slightly due to additional outage days.","Engineered wood product's EBITDA decreased $22 million compared with the third quarter. Sales volumes for both solid section and I joist decreased seasonally as construction activity softened and dealers and builders start to minimize year-end inventories. Unit manufacturing costs increased due to lower operating rates. Average sales realizations for I joist increased by 2%, as we captured the final portion of our 2018 price increase. Average realizations for solid section products decreased by 3% due to mix, as we sold a greater proportion of industrial products.","Compared with the year-ago quarter, higher average realizations were more than offset by lower sales volumes and slightly higher manufacturing costs. Distribution EBITDA decreased $1 million compared with the third quarter. Sales volumes declined seasonally. This was mostly offset by slightly lower warehouse and delivery costs and a small insurance reimbursement related to the previous wild wire damage at our Redding, California facility. Compared with the year-ago, EBITDA decreased slightly due to lower sales volumes.","I would like to now turn to operational excellence. Collectively, our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses achieved $44 million of operational excellence improvements in 2018. This brings us to over $540 million of total improvement since we began this program five years ago. Timberlands achieved its $40 million to $50 million target capturing $42 million of improvements in 2018, for a cumulative total of $214 million. In 2018, the majority of OpEx improvements in timberlands were attributable to initiatives to reduce logging and hauling costs, and improved log merchandizing and marketing to maximize the revenue from every log we harvest.","In Wood Products, we had some challenges with OpEx this year. Although the business has captured $329 million of cumulative improvements, it delivered only $2 million of OpEx in 2018. On our third quarter call, we noted that the business had a lot of work to do to get to its 2018 OpEx target. And unfortunately we were not able to make up ground in the fourth quarter. The business did made good progress on improving fiber recovery, but we were not able to capture as much benefit as we had hoped from our other three focus areas.","Our initiatives to increase mill reliability were hampered by an unusual amount of downtime for severe weather through the year. We did not capture enough cost reduction opportunities in light of the inflationary headwinds during the year, and we weren't able to realize the benefits from capital projects completed later in the year as ramped up several of those projects more slowly than planned.","Obviously, we are disappointed by these results. We need to execute against our OpEx initiatives regardless of markets or weather conditions. So, no excuses. The good news is that we know the improvement opportunities are out there. We have a strong track record of achieving OpEx improvements in this business, and we have solid plans in place to capture these opportunities next year.","In 2019, we are targeting $80 million to $100 million of additional OpEx improvements. This includes $40 million to $50 million from Timberlands, and $40 million to $50 million in Wood Products. I'm confident that we have the focus, tools, and expertise to achieve these targets, and I know there are significant opportunities beyond that to continue improving our relative performance in each of our business.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook.","Russell Hagen","Thanks, Devin, and good morning. The outlook for the first quarter and the full-year 2019 are presented in charts 14 and 15 of the earnings slides. In Timberlands business, we expect our first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately 10% lower than the fourth quarter. This reflects normal seasonal variations in harvest volumes as well as the effect of the decline in Western log prices that occurred in the fourth quarter.","In our Western Timberland operations, we expect first quarter average sales realizations for domestic and export logs will be moderately below the fourth quarter average and harvest volumes will be lower. This will be mostly offset by a significant reduction in road and forestry spending and seasonally lower log and haul costs. As we move to lower elevations in the winter months.","Domestic log supply has come into balance with demand in the West. The log deck inventories are at more normal levels. Japanese export log sales volumes are expected to decline due to the timing of shipments, we're seeing continue to strength in the Japanese housing market, particularly in the higher end post-and-beam construction and favorable demand for logs from our Japanese customers.","Average sales realizations for Chinese export logs are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter and volumes to be lower on seasonally softer demand due to the Lunar New Year. In the South, we anticipate seasonally lower","fee harvest volumes. Average sales realizations in the first quarter are expected to be similar to the fourth quarter. In the North, we anticipate average sales realizations for the first quarter will be higher while harvest volumes will be seasonally lower.","Turning to the full-year 2019, we expect total company harvest volumes will be comparable to 2018 at approximately 38 million tons. We expect first quarter earnings and adjusted for our real-estate and energy and natural Resources segment will be approximately 10 million higher than the fourth quarter driven by our real-estate operations. Our buyer traffic typically slows during the winter months we saw a very strong real-estate activity in the fourth quarter, which allowed us to pursue a handful of additional transactions that we will close in the first quarter.","Combined with continued strong interest in the west and the south, we're anticipating first quarter earnings that will be stronger than we would normally see for this time of year. We speak land basis as a percentage of real-estate sales will be approximately 50% for the first quarter. In our energy and natural resources operations, we anticipate that royalties will be seasonally lower in the first quarter.","For the full-year 2019, we expect approximately $260 million of adjusted for real-estate Energy and Natural Resources segment, land basis as a percentage of real-estate sales to be between 40% and 55% for the full-year 2019.","Wood Products, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter. Market prices for lumbers stabilized late in the fourth quarter and it began to rise. Sale orders are improving as we entered the spring building season. Current and first quarter to-date average sales realizations are $10 lower than the fourth quarter average. However, prices are approving and market dynamics are favorable. Our builder customers are expressing optimism about the spring selling season.","As a reminder, every $10 change in lumber realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. As Devin mentioned earlier, we anticipate a substantial improvement in western and Canadian log cost in the first quarter. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to improve with higher production volumes as we move into the spring building season. Our newly expanded dirt sawmill was commissioned in mid-October. The mill's capacity is 80 million board feet larger and will continue ramping up for full production throughout 2019.","For oriented strand board market price is stabilized late in the fourth quarter and current first quarter to-date realizations are approximately $30 lower than the fourth quarter average. As a reminder, every $10 change in OSB realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. We will have full quarter of production at our grayling Michigan mill after completing our plan, press replacement and start.","In the first quarter, we anticipate seasonally higher sales volumes and operating rates for oriented strand board. Sales volumes for engineered Wood Products are also expected to increase in the first quarter. We anticipate unit manufacturing costs will be lower than the fourth quarter.","Chart 12, outlines the major components of our unallocated items. Excluding special items, net contribution to earnings improved by $35 million. This was primarily due to a non-cash benefit from elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory and LIFO resulting from reduced log inventories. Year-end adjustments for lower employee benefits expense and foreign exchange gains were also favorable compared to the third quarter.","Fourth quarter pretax special items include the $200 million non-cash pension settlement charge and a $13 million gain on the sale of a non-strategic asset. For our pension and postretirement plans, the year-end 2018 funded status improved by $1 billion compared to 2017 driven primarily by a higher discount rates and a $300 million voluntary cash contribution in the third quarter.","Discount rates increased approximately 70 basis points for the U.S. plans and approximately 20 basis points for the Canadian plants. Cash paid for pension and postretirement plans in 2018 was $381 million, which includes the $300 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified plan.","In 2019, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified plan. Our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $50 million including the fourth quarter settlement charge our non-cash, non-operating pension and postretirement expense was $72 million in 2018. We expect to record approximately $60 million of expense in 2019.","As we announced earlier this week, we purchased a group annuity contract to transfer approximately $1.5 billion of Weyerhaeuser's U.S. pension assets and liabilities to an insurance carrier. The purchase was funded with assets from our U.S. pension plan. In connection with this transaction, we expect to recognize non-cash, pre-tax pension settlement charge of approximately $450 million in the first quarter of 2019.","Now I like to update you on our key financial items, which are summarized on chart 13, we ended the year with the cash balance at $334 million. Cash from operations during the fourth quarter is $292 million. For the full-year 2018, cash from operations was $1.1 billion. As we think about funds available for distribution. It's important to consider that in 2018 cash from operations included the $300 million voluntary cash pension contribution and approximately $100 million net spend for product remediation.","Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled a $144 million and the full-year total for 2018 was $427 million. We expect total CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $400 million, $120 million for Timberlands inclusive of forestry reforestation costs and $270 million for Wood Products and $10 billion for plan corporate IT system investments.","Turning to financing activities, we repurchased 11 million shares of common stock in 2018, including 2.8 million shares or $75 million in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had $135 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We'll use this on an opportunistic basis in conjunction with our overall capital allocation strategy, we will report on our progress each quarter.","Moving on to debt, we have one scheduled maturity in October 2019 for $500 million of 7 and 3-8s notes, which we plan to refinance. In the fourth quarter, we paid $209 million to extinguish the debt of a variable interest entity that was established as part of a timber installment sale in the early 2000s. We will receive $253 million cash in the first quarter when the related financial investment matures. We did the quarter with approximately $6.3 billion of debt outstanding. This includes a balance on our line of credit, the portion of which was used to bridge the temporary cash outflows associated with the variable interest entity, debt maturity.","During 2018, we've reduced our cash balance as part of an intentional transition to move to a more efficient cash management strategy. Going forward, we expect to use a revolving credit facility to support temporary working capital needs. In the fourth quarter, interest expense was $97 million. We expect interest expense will be approximately $360 million for the full-year 2019.","Moving on to taxes in the first quarter and full-year 2019, we expect the tax rate will be between 14% and 16%, excluding special items.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Devin. I look forward to your questions.","Devin Stockfish","All right, thanks, Russell. Over the past few months, the main question I've had as I've talked with our employees, our customers, and our investors is what can we expect under your leadership? For those of you that know me, you know that I worked closely with Doyle for a number of years. I believe strongly in the fundamental strategy we have in place and that framework will remain the same. We will continue to drive value for shareholders by focusing on portfolio, performance, and disciplined capital allocation. We do need to continue to evolve how we implement that strategy to ensure that Weyerhaeuser maintains a competitive advantage and delivers superior returns for investors. We remain focused on improving our operational performance, our financial performance, and our ability to attract and retain talent.","So, as we think about near-term priorities, my 2019 focus areas will be as follows: first, driving OpEx, with a particular focus on reliability and cost. As I mentioned we're targeting $80 million to $100 million of improvements across the company this year.","In Timberlands, we're continuing to focus on reducing cost and driving efficiencies across our entire harvesting, hauling and road building, operations, and maximizing the value of every log that we harvest and sell. In Wood Products, we're bringing all of our manufacturing expertise together in a unified effort to take our reliability to the next level, which is the single biggest opportunity across our manufacturing portfolio. And in both businesses, and across the organization, we're driving a focus on our customers to serve them better and identify further OpEx opportunities in the supply chain. My second priority is around culture.","We've made incredible progress on our journey to create a culture of urgency, accountability, courage, simplicity, and innovation, but driving lasting culture change is an ongoing effort, and we can't let up. So I'll be focused on continuing to reinforce and improve on the cultural progress that we've made. In particular, we'll be placing some additional emphasis on discipline focused innovation, which I strongly believe is a key to Weyerhaeuser's long-term success. My third area of focus is people development.","People are our most important asset, and we need to accelerate our efforts on development and building bench strength across all levels of the company. I strongly believe that this will be a competitive advantage for our company in the years to come. And my final area of focus is disciplined capital allocation, which remains critical to driving value for our shareholders. Our priorities for capital allocation have not changed. First, is returning cash to shareholders, this will occur primarily through a dividend that is sustainable and grows over time as well as through opportunistic share repurchases as appropriate. Second, we will continue to invest in our businesses.","In Timberlands, that means primarily civil culture and roads. And in Wood Products, it's high return projects that drive down cost and improve reliability. We'll continue to evaluate growth opportunities primarily in Timberlands, but we'll be very disciplined as we evaluate options in this regard. As you know given our significant land base, we're not compelled to grow and we will only pursue opportunities that clearly drive value for our shareholders. And our third capital allocation priority is maintaining an appropriate capital structure including a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating.","As you can see Weyerhaeuser's priorities and positioning are not significantly changing. My near-term focus remains on executing on our strategy in building on Weyerhaeuser's strong foundation. This is an incredibly exciting time to be assuming the leadership of Weyerhaeuser. It's a strong company with outstanding people and terrific assets. Our fundamental strategy is in place, and we will continue to improve the company by focusing on our portfolio, our performance, and disciplined capital allocation. I'm really excited about the opportunities that we have to take this company to the next level and deliver long-term value for our shareholders.","And with that, I'd like to open the floor to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone, good morning. Devin, congratulations and welcome to the call, thanks for taking my question and for all the details. First question I had is on Wood Products, and I recognize it's real hard, especially, in an environment like the current one and the one we've been in the last few months to put a finer point on significantly increased EBIT or EBITDA for this segment, and 1Q versus 4Q, but if you could give us some parameters on it, it would be great. If you can't, could you tell us what's already sort of baked in to the sequential improvement from things that are under your control or should be there from you know, lower log costs, any inefficiency that hits you from Grayling being out of the mix, those sorts of things as we think about 1Q versus 4Q?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, George, and as you know it's really hard to quantify overall EBITDA at this point just because of the volatility that we've seen in pricing primarily on lumber and OSB. So hard to quantify there, but as we think about rolling into Q1, there are a few things that I think are really going to be tailwinds for us. So first of all, when you think about what happened in Q4 on the lumber side, you know, we saw lumber prices come down a lot faster than log prices. And so for the majority of the quarter, we were really working through higher cost inventory from logs that we purchased in Q3 and early Q4 and so it takes time for you to work those through the system.","So heading into Q1, we'll be operating off of a lower log cost. So that's one thing. Second thing is just around operating rates. You know, those did come down a bit in Q4 and so we would expect those to be better in Q1. We'll have the full Grayling for full Q1. So that will be a benefit as well. And so overall -- and we do think we have some good tailwinds just on those things that are within our control. Additionally, although it's hard to quantify on the pricing side as you're probably aware, we have seen a pickup in lumber prices here just over the last several weeks and so feel like we're getting some momentum on that front as well.","George Staphos","Okay. But on the things that are tailwinds, is there any way to size the effect of the inventory benefit from logs or the Grayling startup in terms of 1Q just to have some sort of building block, and if you can't that's fine but I figured I'd try one more time.","Devin Stockfish","Yes, so I'd say in the log cost, that's probably $10 million to $15 million, and Grayling's about $4 million.","George Staphos","Okay. Thank you for that. Second question I had is, you know, there was some ticking down in EWP pricing, and you went through the reasons there. It's not like most of that was a mix in terms of industrial and solid section. We had heard in the trade that there was some private-label business that maybe shifted away from you. Was any of that in your mix or pricing effect, or is that -- if you buy the premise of that comment, was that sort of immaterial? And then my last question, I'll turn it over. In the South, there's a fair amount of storm wood, obviously from the third quarter storms, a lot of that is in Florida, does that have any kind of effect on when you expect Southern prices to lift or is it immaterial at this juncture? Thank you, and good luck on the quarter.","Devin Stockfish","Yes, thanks George. So with respect to the EWP question, you have customers move around from time to time in the overall mix, that's not really material for Q4 for us. We have a strong customer base so not terribly impactful for us. With respect to the storm damaged wood, I think when you talk about the local geographies where you had some of the damage, there may be some downward pressure here over the spring time period as they salvage some that wood. Those are geographies that we don't have a significant amount of ownership in those areas, so I don't think it'll impact us terribly. But you will see some increase in volume coming into those local markets as they salvage that damaged wood.","George Staphos","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Devin, congratulations on taking over.","Devin Stockfish","Thanks, Mark, morning.","Mark Wilde","Good morning. I wondered, just to start off, from your own distribution operations, what is your sense for kind of building products inventory in the channel right now?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, when you look across the system, our view is that inventories are pretty light. You know, you'll have pockets where it might be a little over in certain geographies, but on balance, really across the system, we think that the inventory channels are lower than normal.","Mark Wilde","Okay. And then on the OpEx, you called out Timberland, you called out Wood Products, you didn't call out kind of real estate or the distribution business, I wondered if you can give us any color there?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, Mark, so a couple of things, on the real estate business, really, we measure OpEx slightly differently there. And so for us OpEx in real estate is really about generating value over and above the timber value at the acre. And so our target is generally around 30%. In 2018, we delivered well in excess of that. So that's how we measure OpEx in the real estate business. And for distribution, We Put That in with Wood Products, so that's included in all commentary around Wood Products OpEx.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right. And then, is it possible going forward, that we could maybe get a little more color on where the real estate land sales take place and sort of value that you achieve there? It just seems like it's an important piece of the puzzle, right now. And just in terms of helping us understand what's going on in the markets, I think a little more granularity would be helpful.","Russell Hagen","Hey, Mark, this is Russell. I think as you're well aware there's not a lot of real estate sales happening up in the north right now, and so those markets tend to be very quiet until things thawed out and we really get into the late spring and summer season. So as you noted in the third quarter we had a large transaction coming out of Montana, and that's usually when we see transactions coming out of those northern properties in that third and fourth quarter.","Coming into the first quarter, we're going to see more transactions out of the South, and then the west. And those markets are actually still -- you know, have been pretty active. They were really strong coming out of the fourth quarter, and we'll pick up some additional transactions in the first quarter.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right, very good. I'll turn it over, thank you.","Russell Hagen","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari","Good morning. Just following up on George's question about the sequential earnings improvement from 4Q to 1Q in Wood Products you know, understanding your OpEx performance in this segment was below expectations last year, is there any reason to think that that $40 million to $50 million in OpEx in Wood Products might be a little front-end loaded or is that just kind of redistributed throughout the course of the year. And then just switching gears a little bit, a lot of your public competitors were taking pretty significant market downtime in 4Q, just wondering if you could talk generally about operating rates in the quarter, and if you took sort of similar moves or slowbacks?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, with respect to OpEx, I wouldn't say that that's going to be frontloaded to the first-half of the year. Really, we look at that 40 to 50 over the course of the full-year and are very optimistic that that's achievable, and we'll get that value.","With respect to downtime, you know, as you know our primary strategy in Wood Products is to have low-cost operations. And that positions us to run when it may not make sense for others. And if you think about Q4 in particular, when you see the lumber prices coming down much faster than log prices, that does create some noise while you're working through some of that higher cost inventory, but I think as we have got that log price down to a more normalized level coming out at Q4, I think, we're well-positioned. We did take a little bit of downtime primarily just for capital projects in Q4 and adjusted shift postures in a few locations around the holiday time. But generally speaking, we were running in Q4.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful. And then just on Timberlands, I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of transactions, both in terms of just kind of land available, demand, evaluations. It seemed like last year, we saw one kind of big transaction in the South it came in a little bit of a lower dollar per acre, maybe skewed kind of the average prices a little bit lower. Have you seen any kind of meaningful changes in terms of valuations of Southern Timberlands and again, availability and demand?","Russell Hagen","Yes, so, this is Russell. First, I'll talk about kind of the transactions, then I'll talk about the valuations. As far as the transactions, you know, 2018, we saw about $4.5 billion of transactions, and there were two large transactions, the southern transaction you talked about, that's Cato [ph] transaction, then we had the PotlatchDeltic deal. And so if you removed those we had about $2 billion of transactions kind of coming through the system. And that's probably kind of an average year anywhere from $2 billion to 3 billion, and then once in a while you get a larger transaction to skew that a little bit.","So the overall transaction flow is still pretty strong. As far as valuations are concerned, again, it's difficult to do a comparable analysis, unless you really understand kind of what are some of the constraints on the lands you know, fiber supply agreements can cause some constraints and then also stocking levels, location to markets, et cetera. And so, looking at the values, it really is important to understand what are those impediments to value relative to what we'd consider a prime plantation or a strong industrial Timberland value.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. Very helpful, I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. Just two things, you mentioned that builders are making adjustments. The one thing that we didn't see a lot of in the last big housing downturn was big changes in square footage to affect price points. Do you see any indication that builders are doing any of that or changes that might affect the -- even the engineered lumber component in a house?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, you know, I think it's a little earlier for us to have a definitive view on that, it's really just anecdotal. I think it's logical to assume that you may see some small reduction in square footage as people go after those lower affordability price points. But I think on balance from an overall wood usage perspective, it's much better to have more building to hit those affordability price points, so that you can get housing starts up to where the demand level sets.","Mark Connelly","Make sense. Okay, and just one more question we've all been sort of watching the sawmill capacity in the U.S. South. Do you see that getting pushed back now that things are a little more uncertain?","Devin Stockfish","I really don't and when you look at the available wood baskets across North America, the South is really the low-cost wood basket and so I think as we continue to see some challenges up in BC around fiber supply, I think we're going to continue to see that capital get put into the U.S. South because that will continue to be the low-cost wood basket for the foreseeable future.","Mark Connelly","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Good morning, and welcome to the call Devin.","Devin Stockfish","Thanks. Good morning.","Chip Dillon","Yes. First question is, as you think about the, OpEx improvements beyond '19 and normalized capital spending. I know that as part of the culture change, you've seen the headquarters shift in the last five years, you've completed the transformation of getting the business where you want, and importantly, you all were doing quite a bit of work to get to zero, I guess breakeven at the bottom and a lot of that's already been done, so my question is, as we go out beyond '19. And we look at '20 and '21. I know it's early days. What are your thoughts about what you normally can get, is it 80 to 100 in an OpEx improvement, and does CapEx need to stay at that $400 million level to get there?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, so let me have -- I'll answer the capital question first as we've said, our plan has been, we've been spinning $300 million a year, the last several years, we're dropping that down to $270 million this year in Wood Products, it'll probably be comfortable next year. And as we work our way down to a more normalized call it $250 million level, so that sort of what we think is kind of a long-term run rate for capital spend in the Wood Products business.","With respect to OpEx, we're certainly going to go after the 80 to 100 this year. It's a little early for me to try to quantify the exact amount beyond that but I am very confident that we'll get through 2019, we will get these OpEx numbers and there's still plenty to get as we continue to focus on cost and reliability throughout the system. So","I wouldn't want anyone to take the belief that after 2019, we're done with OpEx. It's really become cultural on the organization. So I would anticipate us continuing to drive OpEx improvement well into the future.","Chip Dillon","Okay, that's helpful. And you gave us some numbers before about how log inventory specific -- particularly in China, I think you said they felt 20% in the fourth quarter and are below normalized levels. Do you see any signs that they are coming back to market I know just about everything they buy, they just stopped buying it in October and they're certainly find that they're running out of things hoping one example where local market prices have moved up a little bit? I just didn't know if you'd seen any return to the market from China?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, it's hard to say at this particular time of year just because as you head into the Lunar New Year, the demand dynamics change just a little bit in terms of takeaway. I'll tell you our expectation, just given what we hear on the ground is that, coming out of the Lunar New Year, we're going to see continued strong demand. And so, we would expect starting from the lower inventories, you're going to see a good demand pole as we get into the spring season.","Chip Dillon","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","Thanks. Good morning, Devin. Good morning Russell.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning.","Collin Mings","First question from me, just on the $500 million of debt maturing this year just can you update us on how you're thinking about the term and potential pricing as it relates to the refinancing?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, as I mentioned, that matures in October, that's 738 debt, so it's a little higher coupon rate, I would say we're pleased with kind of where interest rates are at and we'll be looking at all kind of options as we take that and ","go to the market to refinance that but I think we'll have a clearly a more favorable coupon rate than what we are retiring.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then, just moving on to the guidance as far as the 1Q guidance for the Timberland, on a year-over-year basis, I mean, is the expected drop in adjusted EBITDA, just driven primarily by the decline in western market prices, or is there some other factors just when trying to compare that against the I think the 268 that you posted in 1Q '18?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, it's primarily log prices.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then, just sticking kind of with Timberland on that front, on the west coast, it sounds like on balance, you believe kind of log pricing in the region is bottoming, Is that fair? And then, just specifically related to the Japan market in the prepared remarks, you referenced just kind of the decline on pricing for those logs? Does that just reflect less favorable supply demand dynamics in the region overall, or is there something else in particular as it relates to the Japan market you're seeing?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. So with respect to your first question, yes, I think that is fair, we've seen that bottom out, would expect to see some upward momentum as we get into the spring building season. With respect to Japan, that trades at some premium to domestic prices. And so, those two are correlated and, not necessarily always one-to-one, but there is a correlation. So when you see domestic pricing come down in the West, you'll typically see that the realizations for the Japan logs comedown as well. So it's really just more tied to the domestic market pricing than it is to demand in Japan.","Collin Mings","Okay, very helpful. One last one here from me, just any update on insurance recoveries related to the Flak Jacket product issue?","Russell Hagen","Yes, this is Russell, we completed the remediation of that last year and we're very confident, we'll get recoveries under the insurance and we're working with our insurance carriers.","Collin Mings","Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll turn it over.","Russell Hagen","Thanks.","Beth Baum","Do we have another question?","Operator","Yes, sir. Next question comes from a line of Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Kurt Yinger","Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning, Kurt.","Kurt Yinger","I wanted to jump back to the Timberland's guidance. You know, obviously you have a tough comp there from a log pricing standpoint in the West. And it should be tough again in the second quarter. It looks like but I mean, how do those sort of dynamics play out on a full-year basis? Do you think just given the big year-on-year decline in the first quarter?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, so again, it's hard to fully predict what log prices are going to do over the course of the year. What I would say is when you think about the Western System, it's a very tension wood basket. And so, as we see prices rising in the spring with lumber and we see the building season pickup, our expectation is that you're going to see log prices follow. And so, we would anticipate if we have another good year in U.S. housing, which we fully expect and you're going to see log pricing continue to trend up over the course of the year, but again, hard to quantify.","Kurt Yinger","Okay. And then, my second question was, you reference some of the regional cost differences for sawmills, could you maybe talk a bit about your own margin differential for mills in the South versus, maybe the U.S. Western Canada?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, so I don't know that we necessarily quantify that in specifics, but I can just tell you directionally, clearly with the South, the log costs are lower than they are in the Western Canada. And so, the margins in the Southern business are going to be better than they are in the Western in the Canadian lumber business.","Kurt Yinger","All right, thanks.","Devin Stockfish","Yes. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. One, I was just trying to flush out a little bit more. So it sounds like west coast log pricing is largely going to be a function you're thinking of what happens to U.S. housing or how important our developments in Asia do you think to what transpires to the West coast log pricing?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, so obviously in the west, the export business is a much bigger portion of our overall sales than it is in the south. And so, it's really multiple things it's what happens with U.S. housing and how does that impact lumber but also the demand out of Japan and China and to a smaller extent Korea. So, all of those things go into the overall demand signal in the West. And it's, a as I said, a very tension wood basket. So when you get increased demand in any of those, it can pull pricing up across the system.","Mark Weintraub","And if I understood correctly, Japan really hasn't been an issue on the demand side. China, it sounds there seems to have been -- what you believed there was that draw down of inventory. But I think you referenced that you thought that Chinese construction and infrastructure activity was still strong which I thought was interesting because there certainly been other commentary maybe not quite as bullish on that. So lot similar color there. But that sort of made it seem that it was the U.S. housing market that had been the biggest delta of life, but correct me if I am wrong.","Devin Stockfish","Yes. So couple of things, so on the Japan side, the demand has been solid. We are still seeing solid demand from the Japanese market for a higher quality Japan logs. The pricing and that was the comment earlier -- the pricing came down just a little bit. But that was really more driven by there is a correlation to domestic pricing. In China, what I would say is that we are seeing solid construction activity and good demand pull.","When you think about over the last half of 2018, we did see a bit of a dip when the tariffs were originally put in place. That had largely normalized at least from a demand and volume perspective off of the West Coast for us as we got into the fourth quarter. And so, we are still expecting the overall volume to China to be comparable to prior quarters in that business at this tariff level still seems to be solid.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. And then shifting gears, looking at your timberland operation, it's notable that the northern timberlands don't contribute a whole lot of EBITDA especially relative to if one were to look at comp valuations et cetera kind of the implied valuation of the business would have been. And so kind of the question is, is that a good fit for a publicly-traded timber REIT where it's not generating a whole lot of cash flow at least relevant to what would based on comp be potential valuations?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. What I would say that is we are always looking for ways to optimize and improve our timberland portfolio. That's true really across all regions and all geographies. And so to the extent that we can find opportunities to improve the overall value of our timberland assets and drive better returns that's something that we are always looking at. And so that's work that has been going on, and work that will continue to go on into the future really just around -- trying to optimize and improve the overall timberland's portfolio.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, thank you.","Devin Stockfish","Thank you.","Operator","And today's final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Qinn","Yes, thanks very much. Morning, Devin. Morning, Russell.","Devin Stockfish","Good morning.","Russell Hagen","Good morning.","Paul Qinn","Hey, I was a little surprised over the drop in Wood Products EBITDA, especially on the lumbar side down $112 million especially given that you've got over 55% of your capacity in the U.S. South and prices there it didn't drop as much as other places. Maybe you can give us some color as what you saw on the West specifically with Doug fir and Whitewood? And then what are you seeing in the recovery because I have definitely seen in Canada, but it seems to be more muted elsewhere over the last couple of weeks?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. I think if you look at the lumbar business, a helpful comp is Q4 2017 because we had overall similar volumes. And really when you look year-over-year, the vast majority of the drop in EBITDA is related to price. So remember for every $10 per MBS that's about a $11 million of EBITDA. And when you think about particularly in the West as you saw lumbar prices come down pretty quickly, log prices come down at a much slower rate. And so, what that creates is a bit of a noise in the system as the log prices catch up to lumbar prices and you have to chew through some of that higher cost inventory. And so, that's really a big driver of what you saw happened in Q4 2018. If you normalize and you kind of go back to that Q4 log cost of Q4 2017, the profitability would have been similar.","Paul Qinn","Okay, then we have seen a pick-up in lumbar prices, what's holding back OSB?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, I mean as you know the lumbar market and the OSB from a supply-demand dynamic are just a little different. You'll see lumber come on a come off a little bit more quickly in response to demand signals. OSB is a little bit more lumpy. What we would expect is that over the course of the year, you're seeing some additional OSB capacity coming online and we believe that over the course of 2019 the demand will catch up to that, and will be more or less on balance, but probably come up a little bit more slowly than you're seeing lumber prices come up.","Paul Qinn","All right, that's all I have. Thanks a lot, guys.","Devin Stockfish","All right, thank you.","Devin Stockfish","All right. I believe that was the last question. So, thank you everyone for joining the call today, and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining the Weyerhaeuser fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22663":["Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) Q4 2014 Earnings Conference Call January 30, 2015 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Denise Merle - Senior Vice President, Human Resources, Investor Relations","Doyle Simons - President and Chief Executive Officer","Patty Bedient - Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President","Beth Baum - Director, Investor Relations","Analysts","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets","Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research","Mark Connelly - CLSA","Gail Glazerman - UBS","James Armstrong - Vertical Research Partners","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup","Operator","Good morning.

[Operator Instructions]. Thank you and I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Denise Merle","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2014 earnings. On the call with me this morning, are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Denise and good morning everyone. As we enter 2014, we embark in the journey here at Weyerhaeuser to grow at truly great company. As we said at that time, the three primary levers we are pulling to drive shareholders, our portfolio performance and capital allocation. Over the past year, we've made significant progress. Specifically in 2014, we'd divested our home building business to become a focused forest product company, achieved our 2014 operational excellence targets and improved earnings from our continuing operations before special items about 22% to $700 million or $1.25 per diluted share compared with $572 million or $0.99 per diluted share in 2013.","In addition, we increased our dividend by 32%, authorized a new $700 million share repurchase program and within five months completed nearly 30% of that authorization. Through these actions, we demonstrated our commitment to delivering shareholder value and our total share of return for the full year of 2014 exceeded 17%.","Included in these full year results are the strong fourth quarter operating earnings we reported this morning. We out earned $166 million or $0.31 per diluted for the fourth quarter. Our net sales from continuing operations of $1.8 billion excluding special items, we are into $145 million or $0.27 per diluted share an increase of 31% compared with the year ago quarter.","Special items for the fourth quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to post-retirement health plan and restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions. I'll begin the discussion of our businesses performance with some brief comments on housing. Housing starts showed continued improvement in the fourth quarter, albeit at a modest rate. U.S. housing starts totalled just over $1 million for 2014, an improvement of approximately 9% compared with 2013.","We are confident that housing markets will continue to strengthen in 2015 at accelerating employment growth; strong consumer confidence, low mortgage rates and initiatives to improve mortgage availability should support increased household formation. We anticipate over $1.1 million housing starts for 2015. Let me now turn to our business segments starting with timberlands, Chart 4 to 6.","Timberlands contributed $143 million to fourth quarter earnings compared with a $136 million in the third quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes increased as we were able to access tracks that had limited operations during the third quarter's fire season. Average realizations for Western logs rose due to tighter domestic markets and a favorable export log mix.","Japanese demand remained solid during the quarter. Chinese demand slowed and prices for Chinese export logs declined. Although Chinese inventories decreased during the fourth quarter, they remained above normalized levels and the weak Rouble improved the competitive position of Russian logs.","Operational excellence initiatives to drag each log to its most profitable customer contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. [indiscernible] acquisition contributed $44 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter. This acquisition has been fully integrated into our Timberlands operations.","In the south, fee harvest volumes rose and average realization increased compared with the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings included $3 million from disposition of non-strategic Timberlands, a decrease of $16 million compared with the third quarter. Our Timberlands business met or exceeded all of its operational excellence target for 2014 including $194 million of EBITDA from the Longview acquisition against the target of $175 million to $185 million, $29 million of synergies against the target of $20 million and over $20 million of operational excellence improvements.","We anticipate an additional $20 million to $30 million of operational excellence improvements in 2015 in this business. I will turn to wood products Chart 7 and 8. Wood products contributed $56 million in the seasonally weak fourth quarter down from $105 million in the third quarter. Earnings for the segment were comparable to the fourth quarter 2013 as benefits from our operational excellence initiatives offset a 13% year-over-year decline in average OSB realizations.","Wood products EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2014 totalled $86 million compared with $135 million in the third quarter. In lumber, EBITDA totalled $65 million average price realizations declined approximately 4% compared with the third quarter. Log cost of western and southern mills increased and per unit manufacturing cost rose due to seasonally lower production volumes.","In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared with the third quarter due to a 4% decrease in average realizations. Engineered wood products reported fourth quarter EBITDA $14 million, a slight increase in average sales realizations was more than offset by seasonally lower sales volumes and higher fee manufacturing cost due to reduced production volume.","EBITDA for the distribution business declined $6 million compared with the third quarter, but improved by $5 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2014, the wood product segments achieved over $100 million of benefit from operational excellence initiatives including delivering on our commitment to improved EBITDA and engineered wood products and distribution about $30 million to $40 million in each business.","We've made good progress, but much more work remains to be done, as we continue our focus on operational excellence in 2015. We have committed to deliver an additional $25 million to $30 million of operational excellence from our lumber business, $10 million to $15 million from OSB, $15 million to $20 million in engineered wood products EBITDA and $20 million to $30 million of EBITDA from distribution.","Let me know turn to cellulose fibers, Charts 9 and 10. Cellulose fibers contributed $87 million to earnings, an increase of $28 million compared with the third quarter. Fluff pulp markets remain strong in the fourth quarter and average pulp price realizations increased. Maintenance cost at our liquid packaging board facility declined substantially and production increased volume completion of extended outage that occurred primarily in the third quarter.","As anticipated, liquid packaging board realization declined in the fourth quarter due to a temporary shift in mix, as we restarted the facility. Shipment volumes for that product also declined as result of slowdown associated with the West Coast port labour disputes.","The Cellulose fibers business finished the year with strong operational performance with several mills setting annual records for uptime, productivity and quality. The business generated nearly $30 million of operational excellence improvements in 2014 and is targeting another $25 million to $30 million in 2015. As I wrap up this morning, let me touch briefly on SG&A. At the end of 2014, we had achieved our $75 million run rate reduction targets.","Moving forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to simply and reduce cost to ensure that we have the appropriate cost structure require to win. I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook.","Patty Bedient","Thanks, Doyle. Good morning, everybody. The outlook for the first quarter of 2015 is summarized on Chart 12. I will begin with discussion with Timberlands. Fee harvest in the left is anticipated to increase seasonally. Western domestic prices are expected to move higher and we are shifting supply into those markets.","Japanese volume will likely decrease due to the softer overall Japanese housing demands and seasonal weather conditions. Sales realizations for China logs are expected to decrease somewhat, but the impact softer prices is being partially offset by lower freight cost. Inventories at Chinese ports have been declining; the take away has not yet been strong enough to bring balances to normal levels.","Demand is not expected to tick up until after the lunar holiday. Logging and road cost should decrease in the quarter, as the results of harvesting lower elevation sites and less road construction activity. In the South, we expect fee harvest to decline seasonally. We anticipate slightly stronger pricing, although realizations will likely be flat due to a somewhat smaller log size.","Earnings from non-strategic land sales are anticipated at around $10 million compared to $3 million in Q4. We expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be significantly higher than the fourth quarter and up slightly from the first quarter of 2014. In wood product, we anticipate higher sales volumes in Q1 compared to Q4 due to seasonal improvement and demand slowly improving housing markets.","Fee increase in single-family starts, which improves by almost 8% in December on a seasonally adjusted basis compared to a year ago, is a positive sign. Channel inventories are very lean so assuming a more normal strain [ph] buildings season we should see uptick in pricing.","Prices in lumber and OSB however have decreased since year-end, but we expect realizations to improve as we progress further into the first quarter. Average realizations for engineered wood products are anticipated to decrease slightly due to product mix. However this decrease should be more than offset, by higher sales volumes. Log costs are expected to increase while manufacturing unit cost should be lower on higher production volume.","Resin cost should also decrease as a result of low oil prices. Overall, we expect earnings in our wood product segment to increase significantly in the first quarter compared to the fourth. In cellulose fibers, day supply of global softwood inventory has increased to 31 days as of year-end, which is above normal levels. The combination of a stronger dollar and the usual seasonal slowdown in demand is likely to negatively affect full pricing.","We also expect to incur higher maintenance expense this quarter as our largest fluff mill takes it plants maintenance shutdown. Sales realizations for liquid packaging are expected to increase this quarter compared to Q4, due to a more normal sales mix. The problems encountered as a result of the West Coast port slowdown have continued into this quarter.","So far this quarter, we have scheduled 13 days of downtime at our Longview liquid packaging board facility due to the port situation. Although negotiations are underway with the federal mediator the issues have yet to be resolved. In addition to downtime, we are also incurring additional dollars for increased freight and warehousing.","We expect overall earnings in cellulose fibers segment to be significantly lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and likely more comparable to the first quarter of 2014. Chart 11 shows the detail of unallocated items. Earnings in Q4 were negatively affected as unallocated items increased by approximately $23 million in Q4 compared to Q3.","The largest increase was the change for profit and inventory in LIFO, which accounted for $14 million of the difference. Higher share-based compensation as a result of the increase in the stock price during the quarter accounted for an additional $8 million of the difference. Referring to Chart 13, I will catch on some overall financial comments.","Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $304 million. Major uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $124 million dividend payments for preference and common stock of $174 million and share repurchases of approximately $80 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to just over $200 million or approximately 30% of our current authorization.","We ended the year, with total shares outstanding approximately of 524 million shares down from approximately 584 million at the beginning of the year. The divestiture of our home building business in the third quarter of last year resulted in retiring approximately 59 million shares. Total capital expenditures for the full year of 2014 including reforestation was $395 million for 2015, we are expecting expenditures in the range of $480 million to $500 million consistent with the guidance we gave at our investor meeting, this past December.","I'll now wrap up with an update on the status of our retirement benefit plans. The unfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans and post-employment retirement plans increased by approximately $820 million as of the end of 2014 compared to 2013. This increase in unfunded status was primarily driven by the implementation of new mortality table and decreasing discount rate.","The updated mortality table accounted for approximately $400 million of a deficient increase. And the majority of the remaining change was due to decreasing the discount rates by approximately 80 basis points for both the U.S. and Canadian plants. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2014 and we don't anticipate any cash contributions for that plan in 2015.","Cash paid for other pension and post-retirement benefits in 2014 was $101 million. We expect total spending in 2015 to be approximately $90 million. Our primary contributions in 2015 will again be for our Canadian plants for approximately $40 million with the remainder going to pay for benefits under our supplemental pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, none of which are separately funded.","Chart 15 details pension and postretirement benefit plan expense from continuing operations by segment. For 2014, the full year net to zero. Pension and post retirement plan expense for 2015 is estimated to be approximately $40 million. The increased expense is driven by the adoption of the new mortality table and decrease discount rate. Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and I look forward to your questions.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Patty. In 2014, we demonstrated our commitment to driving shareholder value by improving performance through operational excellence and returning cash to shareholders. As we enter 2015, our priorities remain unchanged. We remain relentlessly focused on driving operational excellence to the fully capitalized on our improving markets and deliver value to our shareholders and wit that; I'd like to open up the lines for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] your first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.","Patty Bedient","Good morning, Mark.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde","I wondered, if the two of you could talk a little bit about the impact of FX move across your overall portfolio, you made a couple of references to this in the commentary already this morning.","Doyle Simons","So, Mark let me talk generally about the effect of the stronger dollar across our businesses and then, Patty to fill in any of the details, but just generally you know stronger dollars generally is not a positive for Weyerhaeuser in terms of Japanese logs, what we seen is the demand is not been affected by the strong dollar as I referenced and Patty referenced in our comment, but if it continues, it could have potentially affect our price.","In terms of Chinese logs, what's happened there, weak Rouble is making Russian logs less expensive than U.S. logs that of course reduces the price that the Chinese are willing to pay. Now with that said, as you very well know there is a practical limit on just how much Russia can provide and the other thing, we are at prices are not at desirable levels. We are able to redirect some of our logs to domestic markets there, in those domestic markets are holding up very well.","In terms of wood products, the Canadian lumber mills are benefitting from the higher margins on shipments to the U.S. overall and then on Cellulose fibers as Patty alluded to the strong dollar at this point is not effected demand, but we do anticipate lower prices due to considerable pressure from Fluff pulp's customer primarily in Europe and currently India's K prices are under some pressure.","So that's kind of the big picture impact of what's happening because of the stronger dollar.","Patty Bedient","Sure, the only other thing that I would add, I think Doyle really went through all of the businesses, I would just call your attention to Chart 11 that I talked to in my comments and you notice there, that there is an FX loss both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, that's really a function of U.S. Dollar denominated debt that it held by our Canadian subsidiaries.","So as the Canadian Dollar depreciates as it did, again the fourth quarter that takes more Canadian Dollar pay off that loan, so that's what generates both of that loss there. Now as you look forward into Q1, the Canadian Dollar to-date, I think has depreciated even more than it did in the fourth quarter, but that would be driven ultimately by whatever the exchange rate as of the end of the quarter.","Mark Wilde","Okay and Patty if I could ask just one follow-on, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about sort of that big cash position you're sitting on, at the rationale for holding so much and kind of tied with that, how you think about the completing the remaining share repurchase authorization, you have about $500 million out there, yet.","Patty Bedient","Yes, so we are very committed to completing that authorization and we have a little under $500 million left to go, the other thing I would say, is that we think, we should have a cash balance somewhere between $300 million and $500 million. So we do have significant cash yet to create additional value for shareholders and we'll be talking about that, as we go into 2015 and have been discussing that, but I really don't have anything more to add. In terms of what we would use that for, other than just to reiterate that our priorities for capital allocation are first and foremost concerning cash to shareholders, investing in our businesses and maintaining our appropriate capital structure and to that end, I should probably add that.","In January, we did receive an upgrade in our investments rating to BBB from BBB minus from S&P. So I think our capital structure is in good shape.","Mark Wilde","Okay, very good. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey good morning, this is actually John Babcock [ph] sitting in for George. How are you doing today?","Doyle Simons","Good, how are you this morning?","Unidentified Analyst","I'm doing very well, I just I know you talked a little bit earlier about the performance improvement and for as far as, Doyle if you could discuss, how everything is going on in that front, especially in 4Q and additionally are there any segment performance goals that are looking more difficult to achieve than when you presented back in December.","And then lastly and the with the G&A expense reduction the fourth quarter, what was that ultimately focused?","Doyle Simons","Yes, so in terms of OpEx targets, we continue to make progress in fourth quarter, 2014 and ended up essentially in line with what we laid out at our December, 9 presentation. So we're encouraged by the progress, we continue to make. In terms of 2015, as we specifically laid out on December 9, we think there is a lot of additional opportunity. We identified $20 million to $30 million of additional OpEx opportunity in Timberlands, another $20 million to $25 million in lumber, $10 million to $15 million in OSB.","In ELP, here again the targeted is improving. EBITDA and that's $15 million to $20 million of EBITDA improvement in $20 million to $30 million of EBITDA improvement in distribution business and then $30 million to $35 million in cellulose fibers. So overall, very encouraged by the progress we're making, but still as I mentioned in my comments still a lot of work to do in front of us, but we are very focused on getting that to bottom line in 2015.","Regarding your SG&A comment, our question if you will re-ask that, so make sure I'm more responsive to your question.","Unidentified Analyst","I was just wondering, it looks like G&A expense to come down in the fourth quarter and I was just wondering ultimately, what drove that?","Doyle Simons","When we laid out our SG&A target back at the end of 2013, we said it would take a balance of 2014 to get it fully implemented. So we continue to make progress in the fourth quarter and about end of the fourth quarter, we were at the run rate of above $75 million in terms of our SG&A targets.","So encouraged by the progress, we made there and as I mentioned we've achieved that target, but we'll constantly be looking for opportunities to make sure we had the appropriate cost structure going forward.","Patty Bedient","You know, actually as you look at Q3 to Q4. Q4 is up over Q3 and that's really just a function of some of the timing that happened with year-end as well as the additional item in unallocated as I spoke about share-based comp etc., but as Doyle said we feel very confident about that $75 million reduction run rate.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, good. Thank you for the colour there and then next, I guess before I pass it on, I was just wondering on the cellulose fibers front. First of all, it looked like liquid packaging realizations were down a little bit in 3Q and I was wondering, if most of that was seasonal nature or if there is any impact ultimately from the port disruption and then on top of that, how are the mills performing on the 18-month payment schedule?","Patty Bedient","Well, as it relates to the liquid packaging realization, the decrease in the fourth quarter wasn't driven by the port disruption. It was driven by the fact that we had, we were bringing up Longview liquid packaging as a result of the extended outage that we had in Q3. So it's just a little mix of lower grade board in the start-up of that facility coming up from the outage.","You'll see in Q1 as I referenced in my comment that the tails realizations will increase in the first quarter more consistent to where we were on the more normal sales mix. So the fourth quarter decrease is really just a mix issue from the start off the machine.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great and then on the maintenance schedule briefly.","Patty Bedient","Yes on the 18 month schedule we are on track fully implemented for that. You know it will vary from year-to-year as 18 months, but we're pretty much on schedule to do that. As I mentioned, our largest fluff mill goes down this quarter. So that's our maintenance outage that we have in the Q1.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks for the colour. I'll get back in the queue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you was hoping to get a bit more colour on your encouraging comments on wood products prices expected to go higher as the quarter progresses and maybe, it's just kind of contextual, why they had been weak quarter-to-date and what you think and what degree of confidence, do you have, indeed they're going to turn?","Doyle Simons","Mark as you know predicting prices is always difficult, currently as we alluded to lumber prices are down slightly versus the fourth quarter average and OSB prices are down about $5 versus the fourth quarter average. We in talking to customers understand that, inventory levels are very lean. We also believe as we said, the housing is going to continue to improve. So our thought is as we move into closer to the stronger seasonal period that we will see a rally in lumber and OSB prices as we move throughout this quarter.","So our comments to your point, our prediction regarding significant improvements in earnings in wood products in first quarter versus fourth quarter are dependent on pricing, but we do believe our crystal ball tells us that, we will see higher prices as we move through the quarter in wood products, but time will tell.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you and do you have any view as to what's been frustrating prices of late, there is some weather related issues or is there, just I mean, obviously seasonally it's not a great time, but any added colour you might have that anything unusual going on or just part of the seasonal process?","Doyle Simons","I think it's mostly the seasonal process, Mark. You know there have been some weather related events I don't need to tell you all, the north you all lived through one earlier this week. So I think there have been some isolated weather incidents, so far we haven't had the type of weather overall, that we had last year first quarter.","So I think it's mostly seasonal, I think it is, some people being very conservative on their buying as I said, inventory levels throughout the system are very lean and that's part of why we believe that prices are going to rally because as demand does pick up, as we get to closer to this spring building period.","We believe it's not to take a lot of pick up and demand to have an impact on pricing moving forward.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, that necessarily don't make sense and just lastly, as you think about the dividend this year. Can you kind of remind us, what the key metrics you'd be looking at that would determine any action you might want to take on the dividend later in the year?","Doyle Simons","Yes, let me just make a general comment about the dividend, you know it goes back to our overall leverage we pulled in and we clearly understand that the capital allocation is a key lever to driving shareholder value. You know as we've consistently said over our number one priorities in terms of capital allocation returning cash to shareholders through growing and sustainable dividend.","As you know, we increased our dividend by over 30% in 2014 and I'll just tell you, we'll be working with our board later this year to determine the appropriate dividend level going forward. We have given general and I reference it as general guideline of 75% of that over a cycle in terms of dividend level, but again that's just a guideline but we do in fact understand the importance of growing our dividend and that's something we intend to do, continue to do going forward.","Mark Weintraub","And would it be fair to say, that you'd consider 2015 at least the way it looks out to be, not an above average year given that housing is still at fairly depressed levels or?","Doyle Simons","Yes, that's a fair comment. I mean, as we said we anticipate housing this year will be north of 1.1, but that's still a long way from kind of average 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6. So I would agree with your commentary.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question.","Mark Connelly","Thank you, two things. Doyle. First, how are you thinking about the relative value of U.S. versus non-U.S. Timberlands acquisitions? And then secondly, as you think about the targets you're setting for wood products for 2015 is the emphasis different than it was in 2014. I'm just curious because you achieved a lot so fast in those businesses and I'm wondering, if you got to do something different to get to next layer up.","Doyle Simons","So Mark in terms of the relative value of U.S. versus non-U.S. timberlands you know as we've said before, we look at all opportunities to grow our Timberlands both domestic and non-domestic. I will tell you, I think our bigger opportunity is going forward probably be in the U.S. we will look internationally I think one things we would be sure and do when we look internationally is, risk adjust based on the international exposure and we'll continue to that going forward.","As you know, we have a very good plantation position in Uruguay. Those trees are we have a very good team there, those trees are very well positioned and growing really fast and those markets continue to develop over there, but as I tell you, we'll look both, but I think our bigger opportunities to grow our timberlands will be domestic going forward.","In terms of our wood products, operational excellence targets. Mark, thanks for the comment. We did made good progress in 2014, but if that's it. We still got a lot of work to do in that business. Now I'm not going to tell you, it's going to be easy. Yes you continue to make progress on these. You kind of got some of the low hanging, so you've got it remain very focused on delivering that to the bottom line, that's why we set very specific targets and have very specific plans on how we're going to get there, both from the sales perspective as well as the cost perspective.","So we are very focused on pulling every lever that we can pull to continue to drive OpEx improvements in the wood products business and are confident, we're going to reach the targets that we set out in 2015, but your point. I mean, it will get harder as we move forward, but I'm confident that we have the team and the focus to accomplish the goals that we set forth.","Mark Connelly","Thank you.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Gail Glazerman","Hi, good morning.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Gail.","Patty Bedient","Good morning, Gail.","Gail Glazerman","I guess, just could I go back to some of the comments about currency and how that might flow into some of the market. Have you seen, can you give any sense of magnitude to the shift that you might have seen in Russia and maybe more detail. Have you seen any signs of Canadian lumber and being redirected from China into the U.S. then if so, any concerns if that might affect some of the western market?","Doyle Simons","Gail, as you would expect it's hard to know exactly what's happening in Russia situation. Clearly we are hearing and seeing that there is more logs coming from Russia into China. I think most of that's in northern china, as I understand it. So I think depending on what happens to rule that something, that continue but as outlined there are some practical limits based on just how much you can comment just on the infrastructure challenges, that Russia has had historically and we believe, will continue to have going forward. Patty, do you have any thoughts on the Canadian question and any redirects some lumber coming from anything going to China that's been redirected otherwise?","Patty Bedient","I think that is something that, is happening we haven't seen a big company lumber volumes overall again. So I think the extent that we'll see it more as bringing building season continue. So it will be something that will impact us going forward. We do have some Canadian operations ourselves as well and Gail, you referenced the western prices, I think that's also Canadian lumber coming in, puts pressure on the U.S. South as well, but so far it's not been, a huge piece.","Gail Glazerman","Okay, can you give any insights on to how your oil and gas income might be impacted by the recent collapse in oil prices?","Doyle Simons","And so let me give you a couple of sensitivities to that, I think we've done some work on that exact issue. So as you think about oil and gas prices and specifically oil prices going down there is some give and take as you would expect, but as we think about sensitivity specifically to diesel prices and how that slows through, I would tell you that we think there's probably $4 million to $5 million benefit in our earnings in fourth quarter, 2014 as a result of lower diesel prices and that's probably $2 million to $3 million in Timberlands, a $2 million in Timberlands, $2 million in wood products and maybe a $1 million in Cellulose fibers.","Going forward, we would tell you that every roughly $0.10 decline in diesel prices flowing it through the system would result in somewhere in the $5 million benefit again with the relative ratios kind of like outlined earlier in terms of various businesses. So in annual basis, every $0.10 reduction in diesel prices will have a bottom line $5 million impact.","Now, there are some offset as you just alluded to, one of them is, we continue to face increasing base rates for trucks and rail carriers as those continue to be tight, so that will somewhat offset some of the benefits, I just outlined and then to your point. If oil prices remained at the levels that they're currently, it will take a little time, but that would have a negative impact on our mineral income going forward. Just how much is hard to know, we haven't seen a big impact so far, but again if oil prices stay, 50 or south of 50 that would have some impact going forward as we continue to look at ways to maximize the value from our mineral resources.","Gail Glazerman","Okay, thank you and just one last quick one. Patty, can you spot us or give us any perspective on how much pulp maintenance will be in the first quarter?","Patty Bedient","I think that will have an additional in the fourth quarter somewhere, I would expect around $10 million to $15 million in additional maintenance expense. We'll have some decrease as a result of the effect of less productivity because of maintenance. You know as I said, as you think about the overall earnings for the pulp segment or say about fiber segment, it's a little difficult to project.","So we try to give you a little more colour in that, we said it would be significantly lower than the fourth quarter, but probably comparable to the first quarter of 2014 which I think was somewhere a little bit north of 50, maybe 54.","Gail Glazerman","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question.","James Armstrong","Good morning, this is James Armstrong sitting in for Chip.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, James.","Patty Bedient","Morning, James.","James Armstrong","First question is, in wood products with oil prices down significantly. How much impact have you seen in resin and chemical cost so far and could you remind us of the cost buckets for that business?","Doyle Simons","Yes, so James the sensitivities that I just outlined for Gail, that we just outlined for Gail in terms of diesel prices includes the improvements in resin, but you're exactly right that's where the biggest opportunity is in terms of the lower oil prices is in the resin that we buy for OSB and ELP businesses. So the biggest component of what I just outlined is prices as oil prices move down, resin prices are moving down and the sensitivity I gave earlier is making the correlation between diesel and resin and then flowing that through to the bottom line.","James Armstrong","Okay, that's also lot and then switching gears. Any chance to retire debt in the next year, I was just wondering if there are any lockups or what's going on the?","Patty Bedient","Sure as you think about the debt, we don't have any maturity due until 2017 and for us to retire that debt in terms of premiums we would have to pay really don't make it very economics to do that, depending upon the issues, it's probably premium of somewhere between 75%, 30% slot. So we do continue to look at it, but it doesn't really seem to make a lot of sense to us at this point.","James Armstrong","Perfect and then lastly, could you just give us a update on what you expect the 2015 tax rate to be?","Patty Bedient","Sure, the tax rate always is dependent upon the mix of weak income which the tax rate is zero and GRS income which is be somewhere around 33%. So there are two things that drive that, one is rate overall which is dependent upon the mix, but we would expect that we'd beat somewhere around 18% to 20%.","James Armstrong","Okay, that helps. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Linton [ph] with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, thanks good morning.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Tyler [ph].","Unidentified Analyst","I was just wondering, in the west for Timberlands I know it's still early, but do you think domestic demand at this point is still strong enough to offset the weaker demand that you're seeing sort of the export markets as this time?","Doyle Simons","As we talked about at least in the first quarter, we anticipate that we will have higher earnings in Timberlands and clearly a component of the higher earnings versus the fourth quarter Tyler [ph] our higher price and that's primarily due to domestic prices being higher as you just alluded to and some mix issue. So we'll see how it plays out going forward, but as we said domestic prices are in good shape and we think that it continue, we'll just have to see what happens in terms of, I think the biggest challenge as we talked about in the Chinese markets will get through the lunar holiday, as we talked about inventory has come down and not back to where normal is, but they have come down. So our guess is, those markets will stabilize in the second half of the year as well.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay then I was, in terms of your export log volumes. I guess China has slipped they had been kind of pulling around 30% of your volumes and they were around 25% this quarter. Is that anything, is that like a deliberate effort on your part just given the weakness over there? Or really that's just function of demand from China has just slowed lot more than the demand, slowed out of Japan?","Doyle Simons","I would say both, Tyler [ph]. I mean part of it is, we have seen a little bit of fall off in demand in China as we alluded too, but we also made the conscious decision to redirect some of those log domestically because of the strong prices that we're seeing on the west coast. So it's the combination of both things.","Unidentified Analyst","Got you and I think it's finally engineered wood products side, I think you've had two quarters of pretty significant production declines. Have these been more sort of temporary cuts and do you think volumes are little bit down more towards the level that \u2013we saw in the first half of 2014 or dipping in the volumes to kind of grow more in line off of this lower base, any thoughts on that going forward?","Doyle Simons","Yes, I think the declines one of them was kind of, it happened because of the second or third was, as we put in a price increase and moving some volume forward to the second versus the third and then the follow-up in the fourth quarter from our perspective was purely seasonal. So as we move into the stronger seasonal period first quarter and then second quarter, we would anticipate a nice rebound in volumes in our engineered wood products business.","Unidentified Analyst","Very great, thanks so much.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question.","Paul Quinn","Yes, thanks very much and good morning.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Paul.","Paul Quinn","Yes, just two easy questions today. Just one is, you referenced opportunities in Timberland in North America, just wondering if you could comment on that competitive landscape out there, whether you're looking at bigger things or smaller things?","Doyle Simons","Yes, so as you know it's been pretty active in terms of activity in both the south and the west. In terms of the competitive landscape, I still think there is a lot of money out there that is looking to invest in this asset class. In terms of the way we look at it, our key criteria or we clearly are looking for opportunities that generate appropriate returns and cash flow both short-term and long-term.","We look for opportunities where we can strengthen our access to strategically important markets for us or move into new markets, that we may not be in although we are in most markets, as you know. Also looking for opportunities where we can get synergies and I think Longview is a very good example of where we were able to do some things to get some mix synergies and then finally to your point.","We are looking for scale opportunity. Now that doesn't mean, we won\u2019t do some small deals and we're always in the market doing some small deals, we're really looking for some scale opportunities to continue to grow our timberland, if we can find those right opportunities going forward. So that's kind of the way, we think about it.","Paul Quinn","Okay, great and then turning over to the SoftWood Lumber Agreement. One of your competitors on a timber REIT side, this week said that he talked to Softwood Lumber Agreement served its purpose and really no longer needed. I'm just wondering what Weyerhaeuser's position is, are you happy with the current agreement, do you want to see higher import duties or is it the latter that no longer needed?","Doyle Simons","Yes, I wouldn't say some type of agreement is no longer needed. As you know, as we've talked about, the agreement set to expire later this year. I can tell you there is a lot of discussion from folks on both sides of the border discussing options for renewing that agreement and also to tell you that we are very actively involved in those discussions.","Paul Quinn","Okay that's all I had, thanks a lot. Thanks.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with your question.","Anthony Pettinari","Hi, I've a question on cellulose fibers. Given we've seen a slowing of emerging market economies and a very strong dollar. I was wondering, as we start the year putting aside the west coast port issues. Are you seeing any change in customer buying behaviour or any slowing of demand for fluff and then a related question. You have a competitor who's talked about converting a fair amount of new fluff capacity next year and I think you've debottlenecked some capacity as well.","I was just wondering, how you're thinking about the fluff supply-demand balance over the next year or so?","Patty Bedient","Sure, Anthony. You know as it relates to demand for the product. Demand has continued to be very strong having said that, I think that we will likely have some downward pressure potentially on price, just given what's happening with the economies in Asia as well as just currency flows. So far we've been very pleased with the demand outlook for fluff, it is thus continue to grow, but depending upon what's happened with some of those developing economies, we could see some softening a little bit there, but really haven't seen it after a point.","As it relates to conversion, I wouldn't want speculate too much because it will take some time for any conversion to come in to place and then it will just be a function of what the overall market is at that point in time. One thing I would say is that, as we talked about before, the higher quality fluff product which is where we play primarily does have a consumer product companies like Procter & Gamble who are pretty picky about the quality.","So not only does it, it take time to actually do the conversion to the product, it also takes time to qualify that product. So it's something we are watching very carefully and being very thoughtful as we go forward, but the current state is that the demand, which is pretty solid.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's very helpful and then maybe just switching to wood products. You\u2019ve made some very impressive performance improvements in distribution this year or last year. I think you referenced to $20 million to $30 million improvement target for 2015. Can you drill down a little bit on the kind of the leverage you're going to pull to drive that EBITDA improvement and distribution this year and can you talk a little bit about the strategic importance of distribution as part of the broader wood products portfolio?","Doyle Simons","Yes, so in terms of the leverage that we're going to pull. There seems to be the same levers that we pulled in 2014, it's just continuing to be focused on that. As Cathy Slater talked about it in our December 9 presentation it's really a focus on what we call the five S's which is sourcing, selling, stocking, storing and shipping. So it's basically the blocking and tackling of making sure we're continuing to do things to drive down our cost structure where it needs to be and then making sure we are doing things on the sell side to maximize the profit margins of what we run through our distribution system.","In terms of how we think about distribution as I've said before \u2013 that\u2019s a business where frankly we've underperformed for a number of years. We needed to show that we could make dramatic improvements in that versus in terms of overall EBITDA improvement and where we stack up competitively. We started to do that in 2014, but still a lot of work remains to be done in terms of how we think about it going forward, that's business we need to show that we can win by out-executing the competition and generate returns well in excess of our cost of capital over a cycle and that's what we are focused on doing currently.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Doyle Simons","Great. Thank you. Okay, so I understand it that was our last question. So I would just like to end by saying, thank you everybody for joining in this morning. More importantly thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.","Patty Bedient","Thanks everybody.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference c all.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session.","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Krista Kochivar, Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Krista Kochivar - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.","On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer, and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Krista, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $24 million or $0.03 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding after-tax special items of $188 million, we earned $212 million or $0.28 per diluted share. This is more than 1.5 times the earnings from continuing operations we reported in second quarter 2016, and an increase of about 27% from first quarter 2017.","After-tax special items for the quarter include a $147 million noncash impairment charge related to the sale of our Uruguay operations, a $31 million charge for Flak Jacket remediation, $8 million for softwood lumber duties and $2 of merger-related cost.","Adjusted EBITDA totaled $506 million, an improvement of 23% compared with second quarter 2016 and over 11% compared with first quarter 2017. Each of our businesses delivered strong second quarter operating results with Wood Products leveraging improving markets and ongoing operational excellence initiatives to achieve record adjusted EBITDA in the quarter.","In addition, in the quarter, we announced the pending sale of the Uruguay operations, completed the asset value optimization process for our Western timberlands, and eliminated roughly two-thirds of the $35 million of costs formerly allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business, and continue to expect to eliminate the remaining cost by the end of the year.","Before covering our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Housing starts continue to move higher. After a robust start to the year, the pace of starts slowed early in the second quarter before picking back up again in June. Year-to-date, total housing starts are up approximately 4% and single-family starts are up 8%. Leading market indicators remain favorable. Employment and wages are rising, consumer confidence continues to be strong, and mortgage rates decreased from first quarter levels. Single-family permits are up 9% compared to last year and we are seeing especially strong single-family building activity in California and in the South. We expect total housing starts of approximately 1.25 million in 2017.","Let me now turn to our business segments. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands' contribution to earnings before special items was $135 million, $13 million less than the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $222 million. Western Timberlands delivered $124 million of second quarter EBITDA, a decrease of $9 million compared with first quarter but an increase of $10 million compared to a year ago.","The market for Western domestic logs remained strong in the second quarter, supported by robust building activity in the West and low mill inventories. Log supply remained tight as record rainfall in the Pacific Northwest continued throughout the second quarter. Domestic log sales volumes and realizations increased slightly compared with the first quarter and road and forestry costs increased seasonally even though we deferred some of the projects as a result of the wet weather.","Turning now to our export markets, in Japan through May, total housing starts increased 2% compared to the prior year, while post-and-beam starts were up 4%. Our log sales volumes decreased slightly due to the timing shipments and average realizations were comparable to the first quarter. In China, market conditions remain favorable and log sales volumes and average realizations increased compared to the first quarter. Log inventories at Chinese ports declined slightly again in June and remain within a normalized range.","Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $91 million to second quarter EBITDA, $5 million lower than the first quarter which benefited from seasonal seedling sales. Fee harvest volumes increased slightly compared with the first quarter and average log realizations were unchanged.","Northern Timberlands contributed $2 million to EBITDA, a decrease of $6 million compared with the first quarter as fee harvest volumes declined seasonally due to spring breakup. Average realizations were higher as a result of a mix shift to a greater percentage of hardwood.","The Timberlands business made good progress on its operational and excellence initiatives in the second quarter. Regional teams continue to implement best practices for harvesting and transportation. Optimizing wood flows over a larger footprint allows our teams to minimize cost and increase realizations. The business remains on track to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for 2017.","Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $23 million to second quarter earnings and $37 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $6 million compared with first quarter but improved $9 million compared with the second quarter of last year. During the second quarter, our real estate team completed the asset value optimization or AVO process review on our 2.9 million acres of Western timberlands. The AVO process identified approximately 365,000 acres where we expect to capture our targeted premiums to the underlying timberland values. We will bring these properties to market over time including some in the second half of this year.","Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contribution to earnings before special items was $238 million in the second quarter, an increase of 38% over the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved $67 million to $274 million, an increase of 32%. EBITDA for lumber totaled $127 million, $28 million more than the first quarter, due to a 7% increase in average sales realizations and a 5% increased in lumber sales volumes.","EBITDA for OSB totaled $87 million, $21 million more than the first quarter and more than double the second quarter of 2016. Average sales realizations increased 12% and sales volumes were comparable to the first quarter. All of our OSB mills ran extremely well again in the second quarter.","Engineered wood products contributed $52 million to EBITDA, an improvement of $15 million over the first quarter. Average sales realizations increased for all products during the second quarter. We also captured a larger percentage of the February price increase in the quarter than we are originally anticipated. Distribution EBITDA totaled $13 million, an increase of $5 million compared with the first quarter and an increase of $4 million compared to the second quarter of last year. The distribution business remains focused on margin improvement and controlling operating and selling cost.","Each of the Wood Products businesses is making good progress on their respective OpEx initiatives through the first half of the year. We continue to expect collective operational excellence benefits of $55 million to $75 million from this segment in 2017.","I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. On June 26, the Department of Commerce announced preliminary antidumping duties on Canadian lumber producers. For most producers, the duty will be approximately 7%, and will also be assessed retroactively. The antidumping duties are additive to the countervailing duties which were announced at the end of April. Combined, these duties average between 25% to 30% for most producers.","The government will continue its investigation through the remainder of the year as the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission collect and evaluate additional information in support final determinations of the duties and the level of material injury to U.S. producers. These determinations are expected later this year. The U.S. Coalition [U.S. Lumber Coalition] continues to work closely with the Department of Commerce and we remain hopeful we will be able to reach a quota-based agreement.","Before I turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook, let me touch on the Flak Jacket issue we disclosed last week, as well as an update on capital allocation. Regarding Flak Jacket, our top priority is to take care of our customers and their customers. We're working proactively to quickly implement solutions and remediation is already underway or completed in over 100 houses. We've halted all production sales and shipments of these products and we are collecting unused products from our customers. We are absolutely committed to doing the right thing and resolving this situation as quickly as possible.","Finally, capital allocation. Since converting to a REIT in 2010, we have communicated a target pay-out ratio of 75% of our funds available for distribution over the cycle. Following the merger with Plum Creek and the divestiture of our Cellulose Fibers business, it is clear to us and to our board that Weyerhaeuser's cash flow profile is significantly different than it was in 2010.","After divesting of our home building and Cellulose Fibers business, doubling our timberland holdings, and significantly improving the cost structure of our Wood Products operation, our cash flow is more stable and predictable. Considering these factors, we have determined that the company no longer requires the level of retained cash flow implied by a 75% pay-out ratio and we have made the decision to increase our target pay-out ratio to 85% over a cycle.","Going forward the board will continue to regularly review the dividend in light of a full range of external market conditions as well as for internal improvements. We expect the biggest driver for a substantial dividend increase will be improving pricing for Southern saw logs, as that will generate a sustainable and growing earnings stream to provide strong support for the dividend over time.","Now let me turn it over Russell to discuss our third quarter outlook.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in chart 12 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be slighter lower compared to second quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we anticipate slightly higher average sales realizations, with fee harvest volumes expected to decrease modestly compared to the second quarter.","Japanese export log volumes will increase, while average sales realizations are expected to be slightly higher compared to the second quarter, supported by continued strong demand in Japanese housing market.","Export log volumes to China are also expected to increase, with slightly higher average sales realizations. Third quarter domestic log sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the second quarter, with lower sales volumes.","Western road spending was deferred due to record wet weather in the second quarter. Spending in the third quarter will increase as we expect to complete the deferred road work in addition to our typical summer road activities. Logging costs are expected to be slightly higher in the third quarter, because we tend to log in higher elevations during the summer.","In the South, we expect higher harvest volumes if the weather improves from a very wet second quarter. We anticipate average sales realizations for the third quarter will be comparable to second quarter levels. Silviculture spending in the South is expected to increase due to seasonality as well as weather-related deferral of activities from the second quarter into the third quarter. In the North, we anticipate third quarter sales volumes to be significantly higher than the second quarter, as we move past the spring breakup season.","Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to nearly double in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and continue to ramp up in the fourth quarter, which is when we typically expect the largest portion of the real estate transactions to close. We continue to expect over $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources business in 2017.","Turning to Wood Products, we anticipate third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to second quarter. Strong demand and low inventories throughout the supply chain have led to continued strong July pricing for lumber, OSB and engineered wood products. Overall, we expect comparable quarter-over-quarter lumber sales realizations and slightly higher OSB and engineered wood product sales realizations. Sales volumes are expected to be consistent in lumber and engineered wood products with a slight decrease in OSB.","Looking at chart 10, unallocated items. The $26 million favorable variance in earnings before special items compared with the first quarter is primarily the result of a $14 million reduction in non-operating pension and other post-retirement benefit costs. In the second quarter of each year, we finalize prior year-end estimates. And as a result of this work, we now expect to record approximately $15 million per quarter of unallocated non-operating pension and post-retirement expense for a total of $60 million in 2017. Our total anticipated cash payments for pension and post-retirement remains unchanged at $70 million for all of 2017 with no funding required for our U.S. qualified pension plan.","Chart 11 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $701 million, an increase of $246 million from the first quarter. Cash from operations during the quarter was $489 million, an increase of $454 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $87 million. We continue to expect our full year capital expenditures to total approximately $435 million, $300 million for Wood Products and $135 million for Timberlands.","Moving on to debt. We ended the quarter with $6.6 billion. Earlier this week, we completed refinancing of our $550 million term loan, which was scheduled to mature in 2020, replacing it with a new $225 million term loan maturing in 2026, and prepaying $325 million in cash.","In addition to this refinancing, we also have a scheduled bond maturity of $281 million in August of 2017. Interest expense was $100 million in the quarter. The repayment of the August maturity, which has an interest rate of 6.95% will reduce interest expense by approximately $20 million annually. We anticipate full year 2017 tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the forecasted mix of earnings from our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and look forward to your questions.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, Russell. Looking forward, we are extremely well positioned to continue to capitalize on the improving housing market and remain relentlessly focused on driving value for our shareholders through operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation.","And with that, I'd like to open up the floor for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Southern log prices were flat quarter-over-quarter. I think that's first quarter since 2015 that prices weren't down sequentially. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in Southern log markets, are you seeing price stabilization or improvement, or was that just mix? Any kind of additional color you could give there would be helpful.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Sure. Anthony, and what we're seeing in the South is, just as you said, flat saw log pricing. At this point, we do not expect any significant improvement in saw log pricing in the third quarter. We would anticipate it would be flat with Q2. But as we move forward, we do see some potential for some pricing traction as we enter into 2018. If housing demand continues to grow, as you very well know, there's more capacity that's being put in place in the South. The Canadian share of U.S. lumber market, we believe, is going to decline due to either the duties or hopefully a negotiated agreement.","And the other thing I would tell you that we're encouraged about is that the export markets out of the South are starting to grow and, in fact, we recently signed a contract for weekly shipments to India. We are also sending weekly shipments to an existing Western customer in China. So we think that has the potential to grow over time. So all of those things we think will ultimately lead to improvement in Southern saw log prices as we move forward.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And understood it's a probably very relatively small amount, but is it possible to quantify export shipments out of the South or maybe where you think they could be by the end of the year?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah, so like I said, we're encouraged. It is a small amount at this point in time but we think over time it could grow to 400 to 500 containers a week, which would be, just to give you a sense, equivalent to a small sawmill. So that will make a difference in the marketplace.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then just following up on the quota. There have been press reports the DOC might be near a quota that would cap Canadian share at 27% or 28%. I was just wondering if you could give any more color about your preference for a quota versus continuation of duties, and just striking the right balance between resolving the issue quickly but also making sure that your concerns and the Lumber Coalition's [U.S. Lumber Coalition] concerns are adequately addressed?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah, and as we've said, Anthony, the U.S. Coalition continues to work very closely with the Department of Commerce and we remain hopeful we'll be able to reach a quota-based agreement and we like the certainly of a negotiated agreement. However, as we've also said, we want the right agreement. And if we don't get that, we'll let the process continue to play out in terms of the duties. So, again, a lot of discussions going on. We continue to be hopeful of a negotiated quota-based agreement which we think would be the best outcome.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Hey, good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Gail.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","I guess just staying on the Softwood Lumber Agreement, I guess the preliminary duties phase out in August and there could be a gap between final duties, just how do you expect \u2013 any sense how customers might react to that?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","That's a good question, Gail. As you very well know, we've seen a improvement in lumber prices that's \u2013 so let me say it this way, the overall trend in lumber prices that we've seen, we think has ultimately been driven by supply and demand. And that's due to the fact that inventories are lean and demand continues to be strong. On top of that, we've seen that exacerbated a little bit by the fires over the past few weeks.","The way I see it, the uncertainty around the SLA has driven the volatility in pricing but the overall pricing trend has been driven by fundamentals of supply and demand. As the countervailing duty goes off in August, I think we'll continue to see volatility in pricing as that happens. Exactly how that will play out, we'll just have to wait and see, but again encouraged by the underlying supply and demand dynamics. And we're just going to have to see how the SLA plays out going forward and specifically what impact that has at the end of August when the CVD lapses for a short period of time.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","All right, thank you. And can you give a little bit of perspective, I guess Southern Yellow Pine was weaker than SPF, and just how you see that relationship building over the next couple quarters?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah, so you're exactly right, those kind of got out of sync during the quarter. I think there were a number of drivers of that, part of it was the duties that have come into place, part of it was FX, and with the Canadian dollar strengthening versus the U.S. dollar. And then of course the fires that have impacted BC over the past few weeks. So I think all of those things resulted in the relative change in SPF to Southern Yellow Pine. I think going forward, you'll see the normal gap that we've normally seen between those come back to normal as those factors play out.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","All right. And just to go to the guidance, you mentioned, I think, that you expected a little bit of improvement in Japanese log prices in 3Q, is that correct? And I'm just curious because I thought log volumes showed a little bit of pressure in June. I'm just wondering if you could give a little more color on the competitive dynamics you're seeing in Japan?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Sure, and as we said in our comments, we continue to be encouraged by what we see overall in Western log markets, and domestic markets demand continues to be strong, primarily driven by what we've seen in the California market. In Japan specifically, to your point, post-and-beam construction continues to grow at about 4%. And in the third quarter, we do anticipate kind of steady demand and potentially slightly higher prices in the third quarter. So, that's how we see Japan. And then China, as you know, inventory continues to be in very good shape, 3.5 million cubic meters, and there we expect higher volume and slightly higher prices in the third quarter as well. That's how we see the export markets.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. One just really quickly one. You mentioned that you're doing one just really quick one. You mentioned that you're doing weekly deliveries to a customer in the China out of the South, is that cannibalizing the business that you have from the West at all?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Business out of the West is very strong right now, as I just indicated, and in fact, total log imports into China from the U.S. are up 35% year-to-date. So, the amount that we are sending into China is an existing customer, but it's both a growth in overall volume as well as displacing a little bit out of the West. But we're fine with displacing a little bit out of the West based on the strong markets that we see in China.","Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research","Okay. Thanks so much.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Good morning. Wanted to follow up a little bit on the change in the dividend policy and the tying to Southern saw log pricing over the long-term. Should we understand by that that there could be modest or moderate increases in the divided prior to the recovery in Southern saw log pricing? And then you can get bigger ones when there is visibility on that recovery or is it that there really likely wouldn't be any dividend increases until you saw that recovery?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Mark, as we've said, the board's going to continue to review the dividend. It's going to consider all conditions, external market conditions as well as internal improvements and things we're doing. As you very well know, our largest asset is our Southern Timberlands, and very purposeful, we've said we expect the biggest driver for a substantial dividend increase will be improving pricing for Southern saw logs. Because that's what's going to ultimately generate a sustainable and growing earnings stream that would provide additional strong support for the dividend over time. So that's the way we're looking at it and the board is looking at it.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And I realize this is a really tough one. But do you have any \u2013 what's your perspective on the potential timing of that recovery in Southern saw timber pricing now versus where your thought process would have been previously? And what drivers are \u2013 are there any meaningfully different drivers? And I realize you addressed this in some of your preliminary comments, but any additional color you could give would be welcomed.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Sure, Mark. And we continue to expect improvement in Southern saw log pricing as we move forward for all the reasons that I highlighted. Housing demand continuing to grow, we're encouraged by what we see there. Continued investment in the South and even yesterday or whatever it was, the announcement of a acquisition by one of our Canadian friends in the South and believe that they will spend additional capital to ramp up production there.","We'll see whether we get a quota or the duties stay in place, but that's going to be helpful. And then, again on the margin, we talked about in the export market. So hard to tell exactly when, but we think as we move into 2018 as housing starts grow to north of 1.3 million, that we could reach the inflection point where we start to see some improvement in Southern saw log prices.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just lastly, curious why do you prefer quotas over duties?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","So, Mark, the reason we like the quotas versus the duties, is it's simple, it's effective, and we think it'll allow the U.S. industry to grow to its natural size. Now, with that said, if we can't get the right agreement in place, we can make the duties work as well. But we just like the certainty of having a duty in place. Everybody understands exactly what that is, and then go forward based on that.","Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Doyle, good morning, Russell.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Mark.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Doyle, let's just come back to that Softwood Lumber Agreement one more time. I'm just curious, if we don't get a deal in the next few weeks, and then we're in a point where we've reopened these NAFTA negotiations, is that going to kind of preclude getting a deal done on lumber until NAFTA is redone?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Mark, it's hard to answer that question, because we don't know exactly how that's going to play out. I do think if the SLA gets drug into NAFTA that could prolong our ability to reach a negotiated agreement, but there's just a lot of uncertainty exactly how the SLA will interplay with NAFTA at this point.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","You have a guess on your side? I mean, I think we're all kind of scratching our head.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","I don't. Yeah, and I wish I could provide more clarity, Mark, but we're kind of scratching our head too just because it's just an unknown.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. The second question I had, Doyle, I know you guys have been very focused on kind of integrating Plum Creek. I'm curious as to whether you think you're at a point where you might start to look at some meaningful acquisitions. There is a lot of timberland that's potentially in the market over the next year or two.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Mark, as we've consistently said, our priorities number one, two and three have been the integration of Plum Creek. We've made very good progress on that, and I'm pleased with where we are. As we move forward, we would potentially look at timberland acquisitions but, as we've also said, the beauty of our portfolio is we are very well positioned and we don't have to grow anywhere. So with that said, we can be very, very disciplined in looking at potential timberlands acquisitions. If we find opportunities that we think will drive shareholder value, that's something we would consider. Otherwise, we'll just continue to focus on what we can do internally to continue to drive improvements in our overall performance and shareholder value.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","All right. That's fair. Last question I had, Doyle. Just any more color on options around fireproofing on the I-joists, the thing that I think Flak Jacket was an attempt to deal with?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Mark, right now \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Well, I was just going to say, and I'd also like to get a sense if I could about how big, how many markets that that really is an issue in right now, because I think a lot of this is state-by-state regulation?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","It is state-by-state regulation, Mark. And our focus right now, as you would anticipate, is making sure we're doing everything we can with our customers to resolve the situation with Flak Jacket. As we move forward, we'll be determining how we want to proceed on any future product that would have this fire retardant material.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, fair enough. Good luck in the second half of the year, Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good morning, Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Chip.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah, I had a question just on \u2013 first question is, a few weeks ago, we saw that one of the large privately held wood products companies is announcing an engineered wood facility in South Carolina. And I know you've seen a great improvement in your results in that business, but my perception is that's mostly internally driven, not really market driven. So what are your thoughts about that? Do you think the market can handle that addition to capacity?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","You know, Chip, and thanks for making your comment on the internal improvements and clearly part of the improved performance in WP has been internal improvements. But with that said, those markets are also improving. As you very well know, we put in a price increase. That was in February. We saw a significant benefit of that in second quarter. We'll see a little bit more benefit from that in the third quarter. And I just give that background to say as housing continues to improve, we as an industry will need some additional capacity.","Now, how that matches up when this mill comes online and it will take a while to get this mill online. As you very well know, startup takes a while. How that meshes with where we are exactly on housing starts remains to be seen, but as housing continues to improve and gets to 1.4 million, 1.5 million, 1.6 million, whatever the number is, there will be additional capacity that will be needed in engineered wood products.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And I don't know, either you or Russell, what are your thoughts about the \u2013 you mentioned that obviously the board is going to think about how to approach the dividend in terms of the ongoing rate. But you know it's interesting, obviously the saw timber tie-in in the South makes total sense because saw timber prices of course tend to be a lot more stable than wood products. But you still have this great Wood Products business that's doing very well. Now, I know other companies, one specifically for years has practiced sort of a variable dividend. And then there is another one who yesterday said that they are considering that, just because that is obviously more appropriate given the volatility you have there. Would that be something that you personally would consider or recommend to the board as an override to the ongoing quarterly dividend in years or periods where the wood business is particularly strong?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah, this is Russell. As Doyle said, our objective is a growing and sustainable dividend over time. Clearly, the Wood Products business is performing well. We are pinned on Southern saw log as being the catalyst. However, we would take into consideration depending on where the market is at, but our primary focus is growing a steady dividend over time.","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A.D. [D.A. Davidson] Please go ahead.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks, good morning.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","I recognize it was a wet spring here in the West, but it sure has been hot and dry in the last month, so are any of your Western lands now operating under harvest restrictions? And is that incorporated into your Timberlands guidance?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","It's a good question, and you're right, it was a very wet spring and now, at least where we live, we haven't seen rain in a month or so. So, at this point in terms of Washington and Oregon, nothing is under a fire restriction at this point in time, but as we all know, that could change quickly as we move forward. So basically, what's incorporated, Steve, in our guidance is kind of what I would call a normal fire season, if there is such a thing. If that changes, you could see further restriction or further tightening, I would say, of log markets in the Pacific Northwest. I would mention in Montana, we do have restrictions in place and no logging at this point in time is allowed after 1 PM.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah, I kind of thought we might be going to Hoot here soon. Okay.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you very much.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","It very well could happen.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of James Armstrong with Armstrong Investments. Please go ahead.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","The first question I have is as land sales pick up in the back half of the year, will there be much change in the mix or will realizations per acre be similar to the first half of the year? Just I noticed that realizations were up nicely in the first half.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","James, this is Russell. As Doyle mentioned, we completed the Western analysis for our AVO or asset value optimization. And we're very pleased with those results and so we'll see some of those acres coming into the market in the second half of the year. As we indicated, third quarter will be double second and then we'll see a ramp-up in the fourth quarter. Those properties will have a higher value than the Southern or the Northern properties. So you may see a change in the average per acre value coming through the program.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Okay, that helps. And then on EWP, switching gears, you mentioned that you had more price realization in the second quarter than you expected, could you comment on how much you expect to get remaining in the third quarter? And will that be it for the February price increase or will some bleed into the fourth quarter?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah, so in the second quarter, we realized about 70% of the price increase which, as we mentioned, was higher than we originally anticipated. In the third quarter, we would anticipate an additional 20% and then the balance, the 10%, to show up in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of how we see it playing out.","James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research","Perfect. Thank you very much.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning, guys.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Just following up on the use of cash line of questions. Looks like you have a balance sheet that's up to about $700 million of cash, and you should get some proceeds from the Uruguay sale soon. Just wondering how share repurchases might fit into the capital reallocation strategy? And as you're contemplating where to move the dividend in a sustainable way, if share repurchases could be a solution to \u2013 a little bit of a release valve for some of that cash that's building up on the balance sheet?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Sure. And as we've consistently said in terms of our priorities for capital allocation, first and foremost is returning cash to shareholders. That'll be primarily through a growing and sustainable dividend. But Brian, as we've indicated, we're also open to share repurchase where appropriate and, as you know, we currently have a authorization of $500 million in terms of share repurchase.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And then one \u2013 I see you chose to exclude the $11 million duties from the Wood Products adjusted EBITDA. I just wonder in the thought process there, if you guys are viewing that as a one-time thing in nature, maybe because they'll lapse at the end of August or they'll eventually be replaced by a quota? And then maybe could you clarify, is that $11 million tied to the actual lumber sales in the quarter or was there some impact from 1Q sales due to the retroactive nature of the duties?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","So, Brian you're \u2013 this is Russell \u2013 correct, we did put that as a special item and there's two components. One is the retroactive countervailing duties and then the go-forward countervailing and antidumping duties. And so we do view those as pretty unique relative to the overall lumber operations and that's why we put it in the special items. And then you're correct, it will drop off in August 28, until there is an actual final determination and then the duties are reinstated. So it'll be a little lumpy coming through if we put it into the operations.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And if we were to think about what an actual, theoretically if the duties did stay at the current levels, and actual expense in the quarter would have been something closer to $6 million or $7 million instead of the $11 million?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah, probably $6 million to $7 million.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And the one last one from me, we've seen a big move in the Canadian dollar in the last couple of weeks and months. Could you remind us the impact to your earnings, every $0.01 or so move in the $1 might have? And then thinking beyond just the translation impact, any impact you might expect on trade flows from that? And historically have you seen Canadian imports of lumber dry up a little bit and a little bit more production shift to the U.S. when this has happened?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Yeah, we noted that the change in the relationship on the FX for the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, but we've been operating in a relatively strong dollar environment and we don't really see material impacts on those interquarter shifts. So we really don't look at what is the impact on a per $0.01 shift on that. So we don't think there'll be a material change in the inflows, it'll really be a primarily driven by the SLA and then also some of the restrictions resulting from fires up in Canada.","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks very much.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Yeah, thanks very much. Morning, Russell and morning, Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, Paul.","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Morning, Paul.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Just thanks for the updated pay-out ratio that you targeted $0.85, I understand the catalyst is on Southern log price movement. Just on that question, we had a lot of deferrals in the U.S. South following the recession in 2008 to probably 2014, just wondering what your assessment is of the current growth versus drain in the overall South? Are we harvesting more than the trees are growing down there, and when do you think we'll start to see some tension in the market?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Paul this is Russell. As we look in the South, again as Doyle mentioned, with continued strength in the housing market and continued increase in production, we're definitely seeing some rebalancing in some wood baskets. And I expect that as we continue to see the housing market recover and less Canadian volume coming into the U.S. market, we'll see those pensioned (44:22) over time. But it's not consistent across the entire South, but we're definitely seeing some benefits, particularly in the Atlantic South where those markets are starting to tension.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just on the guidance, when you guys for Q3 when you're guiding for Timberlands to be slightly down, is that like a 5% number and then one of the things that surprised me was the lower fee harvest volumes expected in the West and what's the result of that?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","So, in terms of the guidance we said slightly so I would say that 5% or less in terms of what that would mean in terms of dollars. And then in terms of the lower harvest in the West that's primarily due just to timing. As you know, a lot of what we call farmer wood comes on the market in the quarter, which can have a negative impact on pricing. We tend to back off during that period of time and then capitalize when pricing tends to be a little bit better.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, just on this potential Softwood Lumber deal, I'm pretty aware what happens in Canada on this side. Just it seems like a black box in terms of the Coalition's acceptance of the deal. Maybe you could give us some broad strokes, is that a two-thirds vote requirement and is that on a volume weighted basis for lumber producers in the U.S.?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","So, Paul, what I would tell you is the Lumber Coalition continues to be very united in terms of the approach on the Softwood Lumber Agreement, and is united behind, as we mentioned earlier, a quota-based agreement. So, I think if a deal can be negotiated that works for both sides, that's something that the U.S. Lumber Coalition would in fact support.","Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","All right. That's all I had. Best of luck.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with the Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Good morning, George.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","How're you doing? If I had one last quick one on SLA, recognizing that it might not be something you really want to get into. But just for the record, what do you think the odds are that, as there has been some speculation, that there might be an agreement before the NAFTA discussions begin middle of next month. And to the extent that you can comment at all, has there been a significant narrowing in your view of the bid-ask spread in terms of the quotas that both sides have seemingly wanted to apply?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","George, as you know, there have been a lot of discussions and negotiations between the parties, and what I would tell you is we do in fact remain hopeful that some type of framework can be agreed on before we get into this NAFTA issue. Trying handicap it would be just pure speculation. But again, we do remain hopeful, and we think some progress has been made.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. No, Doyle, that's actually quite helpful. Thank you for that. Russell, quick one for you. Remind me the basis for the land sales the rest of the year, what should we be modeling for, for the segment?","Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.","George, I'd say the basis is probably 40% to 50% for the full year.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then, back to the question of supply coming into the market, and recognizing, one, that it's ultimately good for the Timberlands business and hopefully the Southern business in terms of saw log pricing, and pulpwood pricing, and then also that your view is going to be ultimately that housing growth will absorb the capacity coming on.","There has been a lot of capacity announced, as mentioned earlier, you have the EWP facility going up in Southern Carolina. You have the lumber projects in South Carolina and Northern Carolina, Florida, and you have an OSB announcement of a restart, I think today. Which of those markets do you feel have the most ability to absorb the oncoming capacity? And which would give you maybe a little bit of caution in terms of the absorption rate, at least initially, and why and why not? Thank you, guys, and good luck in the quarter.","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","Thank you, George. And what I would tell you is going from the ones I think have the most ability to absorb to where it may be a little lumpier in terms of absorption, I would say first is lumber. I think this additional lumber capacity is going to be needed and it's going to be absorbed without significant disruptions or potentially any disruption to the market. EWP, I talked about. We talked about it a little bit earlier, and we think as housing continues to grow, additional EWP capacity is going to be required and that capacity that's been announced is still quite a bit out in terms of when that will come online.","And then finally OSB. As we know, OSB tends to come on in big chunks and I think clearly we need additional capacity, the industry probably needs additional capacity as OSB markets are tight and housing continues to grow. And we'll just have to see how that production phases in. One thing I would note is new mills, it always takes longer to start them up than most people factor in. And then some of these are restarts of mills that have been down for a very extended period of time. It will take some time to ramp those up as well. So that's how we think about the additional capacity that's slated to come online.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then on that latter point, Doyle, you'd say six months to a year in terms of the startup curve for an OSB mill restarting?","Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.","That's probably as good as any, George.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Doyle R.

Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides for the call can be found on our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. ","Joining me this morning are Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","Additional information has been added to the analyst package and web slides. This includes EBITDA and operating margin data as well as business-specific metrics. In the web slide package, the charts and tables have been redesigned. I will note some of the graph changes as we review first quarter results. ","Corporate and Other has been renamed Unallocated to more accurately reflect the nature of these items. Chart 13 details unallocated items. We hope these changes help you in your analysis of Weyerhaeuser. ","As summarized on Chart 1, this morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter 2012 net earnings of $41 million or $0.08 per diluted share on net sales of $1.5 billion. Earnings for the first quarter include aftertax gains of $32 million from special items. A GAAP reconciliation of earnings before special items can be found on Chart 2. This table now details special items on a pretax and an aftertax basis. ","The special items for the first quarter are: a gain of $34 million or $0.06 per share for a postretirement plan amendment; a gain of $8 million or $0.02 per share for income tax settlements; and a charge of $10 million or $0.02 per share for restructuring, impairments and other items. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $9 million or $0.02 per diluted share. ","Turning to our business segment discussion. My comments reviewing the first quarter of 2012 refer to changes from the fourth quarter of 2011. This will be the same for all segments. Beginning with Timberlands, Charts 3 and 4. The graph on Chart 4 had been redesigned. The West and the South are now on separate charts, each graphing third-party log sales versus realizations. Graph on intersegment log sales, West and South, and fee harvest volume, West and South, have also been excluded. Timberlands contributed $71 million to pretax earnings, $1 million more than in Q4. Income from operations increased $13 million. This increase was primarily due to lower equipment and road maintenance cost in the West. This increase was largely offset by a $12 million reduction in earnings from the disposition of non-strategic Timberland. Western log sale volumes were flat. Third-party sales volumes declined 6%, primarily due to fewer log sales to China. Log exports to Japan, however, have increased. Japan accounted for 78% of log exports in Q1 versus 68% in Q4. ","Exports to Korea, a small market, also increased. Price realizations for logs in the West declined less than $1 per 1,000 cubic meters. Price realizations for logs exported to Japan slightly increased. Southern log sales volumes were flat. Third-party sales decreased as internal sales increased due to strong Southern yellow pine lumber demand. The combined fee harvest volumes of the West and South rose 2%. ","Wood Products, Charts 5 and 6. Chart 6 has been reorganized into 4 product graphs of price and volume. First quarter operating income improved $39 million from fourth quarter. Sales volumes and price realizations increased across all product lines. Operating rates were higher. Lumber volumes were up 9%, and lumber prices increased 5% or $15 per 1,000 board feet. ","Oriented strand board volumes were up 9%. Price realizations rose 14% or $24 per 1,000 square feet. Engineered wood solid section volumes increased 16%. Solid section price realizations were up 3%. Engineered wood TJI volume was 7% higher. TJI prices increased 2%. ","Manufacturing costs were lower due to more mill uptime and product throughput. Freight expense increased largely due to higher shipment volumes and an increase in fuel costs. ","Cellulose Fibers, Charts 7 and 8. Pulp sales volumes and price realizations are on the same graph on Chart 8. The pretax contribution to earnings from Cellulose Fibers decreased $90 million in Q1 from Q4. Average pulp price realizations declined 9% or $76 per air-dry metric ton. Pulp sales volumes decreased 4%. Q1 had 2 scheduled annual maintenance outages totaling 27 days of downtime. There were no scheduled maintenance outages in Q4. Due to the scheduled downtime, maintenance costs increased significantly, and pulp production volumes were 5% lower. ","Real Estate, Charts 9 and 10. Chart 10 contains graphic representations of the metrics formally presented in a table format. The pretax contribution to earnings from Real Estate declined $49 million from fourth quarter. First quarter is seasonally the weakest quarter of the year for single-family home closings. In Q1, single-family home closings declined to 349 from 582 in Q4. Closings were 4% lower than a year-ago first quarter. The average home sales price was $376,000, 6% lower than in Q4 and 10% below the first quarter of 2011. ","Gross margins decreased to 17% from 25% in Q4. The gross margin was 22% in Q1 2011. Price and margin declines were attributable to mix. The cancellation rate dropped 10% from -- dropped to 10% from 18% in Q4. The cancellation rate was 12% in the year-ago quarter. ","The backlog increased from 429 single-family homes in Q4 to 777 homes. However, the average price of single-family homes in the backlog has decreased to $371,000 due to mix. The backlog at the end of the first quarter last year was 611 single-family homes. It was $1 million in land and lot sales in first quarter. Land and lot sales were $19 million in the fourth quarter. ","Other items. Unallocated items for the first quarter include a net pretax gain of $52 million from changes in retiree health care benefits, and changes of $14 million for impairment, restructuring and other items. ","Finally, I would like to remind you, on May 10, we will be holding our Annual Analyst Meeting at the Sofitel in New York City. You can register for this event on our homepage at www.weyerhaeuser.com. And now, I would like to turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Kathy. And good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. As I begin, I want to start by reflecting on my remarks from our 2011 year-end earnings call. At that time, when we provided our outlook for the first quarter, we highlighted 3 major external forces that we believed could affect our 2012 financial performance: one, the pace of housing recovery; two, weakening log demand from China, offset by continuing strong demand from Japan; and three, softness in pulp prices related to high inventories worldwide and economic uncertainty in global markets. We emphasized that we were focused on improvement across all business segments in areas that we can control. Though cautious about economic conditions, we stated we were prepared to flex up to meet increased demand if markets improve more rapidly. ","Let me first provide an update on these 3 external forces. First, housing. During the first quarter, the signs of improvement in the U.S. housing market that began to emerge late last year continued. On our call in early February, I told you that we were basing our 2012 plans on 665,000 total U.S. housing starts, 445,000 single-family plus 210,000 multi-family. We considered this to be a conservative assumption, and I shared that we were planning cautiously given the uncertain economic environment as well as our experience in 2011. I said that once we were further along into the normal spring selling season, we would have a better idea what to expect for the year. So today is a good time for a status report.  ","As we approach the end of April, we've seen continued improvement in U.S. housing. As a result, we have increased our forecast for U.S. starts by an additional 8% from 665,000 to 720,000. The forecast assumes 500,000 single-family and 220,000 multi-family starts. This would be nearly a 20% increase over 2011 levels. ","The increased sales activity experienced by WRECO and other builders during the first quarter does not have a significant effect on first quarter results for our businesses. This is due to the time lag between new orders, permits and then starts. The sales activity does, however, provide some indication of what we can expect for the balance of the year for our Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate segments. ","Second, Asian markets. In the fourth quarter, we reported slowing demand from China for logs. We anticipate a continued weakness in Chinese demand in the early part of 2012. However, we expected that the demand from Japan, by far our largest export market, would increase and it did. ","Third, we expressed concerns about softening pulp prices. We felt the effect of this softening in the first quarter. Today, softwood pulp index pricing appears to be stabilizing. ","Now let me provide some comments about the performance of each of our business segments during the quarter. In Timberlands, harvest volumes were up slightly in both the South and the West, despite some difficult weather conditions in the West. As expected, Chinese demand for logs slowed. Our export volumes shifted to a richer mix of logs to Japan where we have strong long-term presence, offsetting the decline in Chinese demand. ","In Wood Products, performance improved compared with last year and sequentially as compared with last quarter. We are seeing results from our ongoing improvement efforts across the entire segment. Sales volumes were up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Much of our increased volume is coming from new market initiatives. These include sales and new geographies, increased lumber exports and increased repair and remodel sales. ","Later this year, we should begin to see increased volume for all product lines tied to the improved spring housing sales I mentioned earlier. Our volume increased resulted in higher operating rates across all product lines, a welcome and much needed improvement. Higher operating rates reduced per unit manufacturing costs and contribute to our improved profitability. Though we're still not where we want to be, the combination of these improvements narrowed our operating loss significantly compared with last quarter. ","In WRECO, closings for the first quarter were slightly lower than 1 year ago as a result of a lower backlog as we entered the year. As Kathy reported, margins for the quarter were lower primarily as a result of mix. Mix has affected by margin variability across markets by the relative share of closings from our respective markets and, in some cases, by the relative share of closings from attached and detached product. In the first quarter, we had a higher percentage of closings from lower margin and lower price markets, such as Phoenix, as compared with a higher margin and higher price markets of San Diego and Washington DC. As both a builder and land developer, the sale of land and lots through other builders is an integral part of our long-term strategy. On average, land sales represent about 10% of our revenue, but the timing of land and lot sales can be a bit uneven throughout the year, as Kathy noted in her comparison of land and lot sales in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. ","Earlier this month, we successfully closed the sale of a master-planned community in Houston that Patty will discuss in a her outlook remarks. ","The positive news for WRECO and perhaps for the overall market is that our traffic is up, cancellations are down, and sales per community increased by 32%. The result was a 30% increase in first quarter sales over last year. Sales increases during the quarter were the strongest in Arizona, Las Vegas, Puget Sound and Houston, and weakest in Southern California. This increase in sales resulted in an encouraging increase in our backlog, up 27% compared with 1 year ago and up 80% from year end. ","In Cellulose Fibers, we expect a significant decline in earnings compared to the fourth quarter as a result of lower prices and expense-related to schedule annual maintenance shutdowns. During the quarter, our mills ran well and came up on time after our scheduled annual shutdowns. The shutdowns were successfully conducted with no recordable safety incidents. Some of the work accomplished during these scheduled shutdowns will help us move towards our goal of increasing the length of time between major shutdowns to 18 months rather than every 12 months. This transition will occur over a several year period. ","As we enter the second quarter, worldwide inventory levels have fallen to more normal levels, and prices are increasing. And now, I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss second quarter outlook as well as provide financial highlights.","Patricia M. Bedient","Thanks, Dan. And good morning, everybody. We expect improved operating results from each of our business segments in the second quarter as compared to the first. The outlook for the second quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. ","Beginning in the West, export volumes are expected to be flat to the first quarter with realizations softening only slightly. China markets are not anticipated to improve until the second half of this year. And Japan market realizations could be slightly lower in the second quarter due to ongoing competitive pressure from European supply, as a result of a weaker euro compared to the yen. Domestically, in the West, sales, volumes and prices should increase compared to the first quarter, resulting from a slight seasonal pickup in demand. We expect Western fee harvest volumes to increase approximately 5% to 10% compared to the first quarter. ","In the South, log realizations are anticipated to be flat, and fee harvest volumes are expected to increase approximately 5% as a result of seasonal demand. We anticipate a seasonal increase in silvicultural costs in both the West and South, and fuel costs are expected to remain high. Overall, we estimate that earnings in the Timberlands segment will be approximately 10% higher in the second quarter compared to the first. ","In Wood Products, we expect increased revenue in the second quarter compared to the first. Volumes are anticipated to increase approximately 10%. Average sales realizations in lumber are estimated to be approximately 5% higher. Realizations in our other product lines are mixed but could be somewhat softer in the second quarter compared to the first if the price trends of last year repeat, although OSB realizations thus far in the quarter are stronger than Q1. ","Overall log costs are expected to increase slightly during the quarter. Log costs in the West and Canada should be higher but modestly lower in the South. Manufacturing costs are estimated to be lower due to improved operating rates. Freight spending will increase due to higher shipment volumes and increased fuel costs. We expect continuing improvement in our operating results in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. We anticipate approximately breakeven performance for the second quarter. Given these expected results, Wood Products would generate around $30 million of EBITDA. While the performance in this segment is not yet where we expect it to be, breakeven is a significant improvement over the $53 million operating loss we incurred in the second quarter of 2011. ","In Cellulose Fibers, average sales realizations for pulp are anticipated to increase modestly in the second quarter compared to the first, due to improving market conditions and tightening supply. Worldwide inventory levels have decreased due to significant shipments to China and spring annual maintenance shut. As of the end of the first quarter, the supply of softwood inventories stood at a low of 29 days. ","Maintenance expense is estimated to increase in the second quarter due to some carryover expenses from the 2 mills, which had annual maintenance shut in the first quarter. In addition, we will have similar scheduled maintenance costs for the mills scheduled for their annual shut in the second quarter. ","Outages this year are slightly longer than typical in order to complete capital projects focused on cost reduction, and to position the mills to begin the process of transitioning to an 18-month frequency and planned maintenance outages as Dan mentioned. We expect overall earnings on our Cellulose Fibers segment to be approximately 10% higher in the second quarter compared to the first. ","Moving onto our Real Estate business. As Dan discussed, we continue to see slowly improving housing demand. Closings in our single-family homebuilding business are expected to improve by over 30% from 349 closings in the first quarter to approximately 460 in the second quarter. This increase reflects a normal seasonal pickup in addition to the slightly improved market. Average prices are estimated to decline approximately 4% due to mix, while gross margins are expected to increase slightly but remain under 20%. Selling expenses will increase with the additional closing volume. Earlier this month, we closed on the sale of a large land parcel in the Houston area, known as Cross Creek Ranch. The sales price for this transaction was $100 million, and it is expected to contribute about $10 million to earnings in the second quarter. Including the earnings from this sale, we expect that our Real Estate segment will generate a slight profit in the second quarter. ","Now I'll wrap up with some overall company financial comments. Please turn to Chart 12 for this discussion. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of almost $730 million. Cash from operations in the first quarter was negative $60 million. This reflects increased working capital of $148 million in our Forest Products businesses for the typical seasonal working capital build, primarily in our Wood Products and Timberland businesses. ","In addition, the first quarter included the cost of scheduled annual maintenance on our sale of Fibers business. The first quarter was also the seasonally weakest quarter of the year for our Real Estate business as compared to the fourth quarter, which is typically our strongest quarter for cash generation. ","Capital expenditures for the first quarter were $64 million. We expect spending to increase in the second quarter compared to the first. Major projects with second quarter spending include a pulp-converting facility in Poland, a fiber line upgrade in our pulp mill in Columbus, Mississippi, and an evaporator upgrade at our pulp mill in Grand Prairie, Alberta, Canada. We expect capital spending, including reforestation, to be around $290 million for the full year. ","Our near-term debt maturities for the next 5 years are also shown on Chart 12. As you can see, we have total maturities of approximately $610 million, well below our existing cash balance. In addition, we have a 4-year credit facility for $1 billion with no borrowings outstanding. We continue to focus on controlling costs across the company. This includes a relentless effort to lower our SG&A costs. As shown in our income statement, SG&A in the first quarter of last year was $172 million compared to $150 million this year, a reduction of $22 million. This emphasis on cost reduction should result in even greater leverage as we began to experience a housing recovery. ","Now I'll turn the call back to Dan, and I look forward to your questions. Dan?","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Patty. In summary, we're encouraged by our performance during the quarter. We continue to focus on improving our financial results with current market conditions. The performance of our Wood Products segment during the quarter is evidence of this progress. The increasing housing demand that we are now experiencing, if sustained, will give us the opportunity to flex up to meet profitable demand in our Timberlands, Wood Products and Real Estate segments by increasing harvest levels, wood products production and home construction. Continued firming of pulp pricing will position us for improving results from our Cellulose Fibers segment. We remain committed to safely improving our overall performance, and we're well positioned to take full advantage of opportunities that emerge from an improving market. And now we welcome your questions.","Kathryn F. McAuley","Nicole, would you please open the floor for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My first question is around Chart 10 and WRECO. And it's encouraging to -- obviously, the lower cancellation rates, the buyer traffic picking up. The one interesting -- one of the interesting data points here is the price in your backlog, which has been trending lower. And I guess, my question here is how much of this is cyclical from what you see, Dan? Or are there any secular implications that we should take away from the declining price in the backlog that could impede the recover ultimately in WRECO and profitability when we finally see more and more closings and starts?","Daniel S. Fulton","The primary reason for the decline in the price and backlog, George, is answered by mix. So as I mentioned in my remarks, we had mix issues across our various markets. We have higher-priced product, for instance, in San Diego and the Washington DC area, lower-priced product in places like Phoenix. And what we've seen over the last 3 to 6 months that is reflected in our backlog is a recovery in sales in some of those lower-priced markets, ahead of what we're longer term expecting to see coming from, let's say, Southern California. So we had a very significant increase in activity, for instance, in Arizona, not just in the last quarter but really going back probably 6 months. And Arizona generally is a lower-priced market. Those are lower margins. And so that's also impacting our margins. So it is more of a mix issue. ","We also had, for instance, in Washington DC, which is a higher-priced market, a period of time where we had a heavier shift to multi-family. So we're in some larger master-planned communities. And for example, in some of those master plans, we have a requirement to build affordable housing as part of the entitlement process, those are lower-priced units. And so that would affect both the margin that you see falling as well as sale price. So it is more a function of where the homes are. And for instance in some markets, we are beginning to be able to pass through price increases. So I think that most of the price decline due to the softness of the market is behind us, and there'll be some choppiness as mix shifts as we come out of this. And we'll try to keep you informed, so that there's no surprises.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. The related question, and I have one last follow-on. Would it be fair to say then, given the ultimate lag in trend and materializing your performance, the recent improvement in pricing that you could see single-family margins more or less close to where they were last year in the back half, should we ultimately get to better than breakeven, better than marginal loss in WRECO in the second half in single-family? And then the second question I had, totally different topic in terms of Cellulose Fibers. Relative to the rest of your portfolio and what you're trying to build within Weyerhaeuser, because obviously you've done a great job of improving your returns here, but it still remains a very cyclical and capital-intensive business from where you sit right now, why you think that Cellulose Fibers is still a good business to maintain the portfolio for Weyerhaeuser for your shareholders?","Daniel S. Fulton","To your question of WRECO in the balance of the year, yes, we will return to profitability. What happens in the first quarter is that it is our lowest quarter for closings. And so we end up in a loss position fundamentally because of G&A. And as the volume picks up through the year, then you'll see those break into profitability. As Patty mentioned, we expect to be profitable in the second quarter. And then through the balance of the year, we'll be delivering the homes that we have sold earlier in the year, so we'll have the margins from those sales come through the P&L. So we would certainly expect that to recover. ","In terms of what the margins may be in the balance of the year, we had good visibility today for second quarter margins. It gets a little bit fuzzier as we look at third and fourth quarter because we -- some of the closings that will occur in third and fourth quarter will be from sales that we haven't even entered into yet. ","With respect to Cellulose Fibers in your portfolio question, we believe that the Cellulose Fibers business is a good fit for our portfolio. We are a strong competitor in the fluff business in particular, where we have very strong relationships with growing global customers. What the Cellulose Fibers business does for us is it gives us really terrific global exposure because about roughly 2\/3 of our sales are for customers outside of the U.S. And so we believe long-term trends or demand for fluff are very positive. And the relationships that we are building with our customers that are growing give us confidence that we will be able to maintain profitability and grow with them. Patty mentioned when she was talking about projects that we're spending money on this year in our CapEx, the Poland facility, so that's a conversion facility that will give us increased product to sell to key global customer as they expand into Europe and North Africa. And we believe that we're a strong competitor in that business, and it's a good fit for us.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I guess just to start, can you talk a little bit more about the West Coast export markets, and I guess just the level of trend, was it getting worse as you moved through the first quarter? Or was it picking up in terms of, I guess, the Chinese market particularly? And are there any sort of numbers you can put to it in terms of the change in your export volume to China?","Daniel S. Fulton","You were breaking up at the very end of your question, Gail. Could I just ask you to -- sorry.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure. Are there any numbers that you can -- the last part was, are there any numbers you can put to in terms of the change in your volume to China either year-over-year or sequentially, and just generally give a context on what the trends were like moving through the quarter and to the second quarter?","Daniel S. Fulton","So our overall export volumes were slightly off in the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter. That's fundamentally a China statement. As I mentioned, we had a significant slowdown in exports to China starting in the fourth quarter continuing into the first quarter, and that caused a shift in mix. So in very round numbers, that 80% of our export volume went to Japan, 10% Korea, slightly more than 10% going to China. Now we go back to the fourth quarter, those numbers were sort of mid-60s for Japan. China had actually grown to be 25% of our export volumes. So we are returning to more typical mix. Our long-term market continues to be Japan. Those are higher quality logs. That's our most valuable resource that we're exporting off of the West Coast, and we see that demand continuing to be steady. And it has been growing. We are well positioned to sell into the China market as we did last year, because of the location of our lands and the advantage facilities that we had to ship off the West Coast. So longer term, we continue to expect the export to be a significant part of our activity. Off the West Coast, Japan will continue to be our major market, but we will take advantage of opportunities to serve longer-term customers in Korea, to build market share in China and also to take advantage of opportunities that are beginning to emerge in some other export markets beyond those big 3.","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes, Gail, to your specific question about -- in the first quarter, we saw coming out of the fourth quarter a lot of inventory in China and into the first quarter, and some of that was also due to some of the Chinese government policy, which we are starting to see some signs of monetary easing by the Chinese government. So that's encouraging. In terms of the impact going into the second quarter, we don't see a lot of pickup, but we see some of that inventory being worked off. So that's why in my comments, I focused primarily on the second half of the year in terms of the resurgence of Chinese demand. We don't see a lot of that impact of it happening in the second quarter, but rather that inventory continue to be worked down.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. Would these comments hold generally for the lumber exports? I think you have some exposure to that out of Canada going into China. And if so, is there any risk, or are you seeing signs of some of that being repatriated?","Daniel S. Fulton","I'm sorry, I'm going to have to ask you to ask that question one more time.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure. I mean, do those comments hold for lumber as well? And if so, are you seeing any signs of volumes that might have gone to China previously kind of being repatriated in North America?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, we've been -- we have been shipping some lumber to China out of Canada. And actually, on a year-over-year basis, our export volume to China out of Canada roughly doubled. They have, as you know, the wood that goes to China is used for industrial purposes, concrete forms and packing and crating, at least as it relates to softwood. So the Chinese government did impose, try to control to try to slow down growth, to try to slow down some real estate development. We would expect that activity to start to recover. We will continue to take advantage of that opportunity as it exists. In our lumber business, out of Canada, once again our primary customer is -- has been Japan. And that's a higher quality wood than is going to China. But we'll take advantage of the opportunities as they present themselves. We are -- in our Wood Products business, we are exporting lumber. We are also starting to export some amount of OSB and engineered products into Asia also.","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes, Gail, I really think as it relates to our lumber exports, as Dan said, similar to logs. Japan is a much more important market for us because most of our lumber production comes out of Alberta. It's not as affected by the beetle damaged wood as some of the other producers. So we produce and export more to Japan of a higher J-grade than probably other producers that you might be hearing from.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just 2 quick ones. The guidance for Timberlands in the second quarter, does that include land sales, or would land sales be additive or subtractive to that?","Patricia M. Bedient","We don't forecast land sales because they are lumpy. But I can tell you based upon what we see right now that we wouldn't see a big difference in the second quarter compared to the first. But as we've talked about in the past, that can move around. But as we sit here today, it doesn't make a big difference quarter-over-quarter.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And Patty, is there any guidance for the unallocated items? I think in the past, you talked about maybe $80 million for the year. You're well below that in the first quarter. Would you expect that to normalize, or is there any change structurally there?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, what we tried to do on the Chart 13 was really give you what makes up that. So as you think about walking down that chart, the unallocated corporate functional expenses, I wouldn't see that changing significantly throughout the year in terms of the quarter impact. The unallocated share-based comp does move around because that's tied to, for the most part, the volatility in our stock price. ","Pension and postretirement costs, probably pretty stable. Foreign exchange gains, that's the result of changes in primarily the Canadian dollar on our intercompany borrowings. So those would be the primary items as you think about. So as the foreign exchange Canadian dollar, if that moves around, that will impact that number. Just roughly, I would say, probably $0.01 change makes about a $3 million-ish, give or take. And it's also a function of the currency fluctuation as well as the level of borrowings inter-company, how that goes on through year-to-year or quarter-to-quarter. And then on share-based comp, probably about $1 movement in the stock price is roughly $1.5 million to $2 million, so maybe that will help you to calibrate throughout the quarter.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just that other segment, because that was a pretty swing quarter-on-quarter for the year?","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes. That's just really made up of a bunch of little things. There's a whole list. That's why wouldn't call out anything separately there. Other is a bunch of $1 million or $2 million kind of unique items quarter-over-quarter.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. But would -- is the fourth quarter kind of a more normal number, or is it just completely random?","Patricia M. Bedient","It's kind of random, I would say. It's probably somewhere between that $2 million and $7 million number.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Kurt Schoen - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","This is Kurt Schoen filling in for Mark. So you noted earlier that there was a pickup in the lower-priced housing market which, I guess, also happened to be the hardest hit market. Given your heavy exposure there, do you expect your housing segment to recover quicker than the overall industry? And will this dynamic alter your allocation of resources or strategy going forward?","Daniel S. Fulton","I don't expect that it changes our strategy long term. So what we're seeing is, housing is a regional business. And we do have different value propositions in each market. I talked about the recovery in demand, particularly in Arizona. That happens to be a market that has good positive employment growth. I think on the last call, I noted that last year, there were nearly 100,000 housing transactions in the Phoenix market. So that market seems to have recovered just as we're starting to see some recovery in Florida. We're not an active builder there, but investors have come in and picked up excess inventory, and so the market is now starting to recover. So the lower-priced markets where we operate, Phoenix, we're seeing strong recovery. I noted Las Vegas in my comments. Las Vegas is coming off a rare variable base, but we did see a pickup on a year-over-year basis. Sales in Las Vegas [indiscernible] transactions are starting to occur. We had 2 new openings in Las Vegas, actually higher-priced product that sold very well. So it's not simply people that are looking for foreclosed homes that are buying homes. The markets are starting to recover. So I don't expect our strategy to change in any of our given markets. We will allocate capital in order to provide lots to be able to build those homes, part of that working basis. But I don't see any significant shift longer term for us in our value propositions in markets or in the longer term mixed results.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just curious, Dan and Patty, as you think about sort of a housing upturn and how it will affect your different Wood Products businesses, can you help us think about sort of where you think you have the greatest leverage to increase volumes in Wood Products?","Daniel S. Fulton","Yes. So our primary products in our Wood Products business are lumber and OSB and engineered wood products, which we split between our TJIs in our solid sections. Lumber has throughout the cycle maintained a somewhat higher operating rate because there are multiple outlets for lumber. As we see the market pick up for housing, you would expect to see lumber pick up along with the appropriate level of starts. OSB is a product that is more heavily weighted to new construction, but we have some industrial uses, and we have been expanding our activity in the R&R market. So as you see a pickup in activity, that should translate very quickly into OSB. That has had a somewhat lower operating rate than lumber because we've had fewer outlets for that product. In the engineered business or TJIs in solid sections, that's fundamentally a new construction product, either for single-family or multi-family. And so that probably has the most significant, immediate impact as the activity picks up either for singles or multis. That product goes into both, and so we have the most leverage on the upside coming from that business because we've got the lowest operating rates today, Mark, in that product line. And then there are -- there's still an issue out there as to the mix between singles and multis, and what the appropriate square footages are for each of those. But I think the most significant upside in those 3 product lines and a pickup in housing would be seen in the Engineered business because we've got the lowest operating rates, and so much more ability to increase production there. But you'll see it in all product lines.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, all right. Maybe when you're out here, it would be -- I would like to get a little update on sort of what your building products distribution business looks like right now because I know you've made a lot of changes. A couple of other questions for today, though. Can you give us, Dan, just a sort of a rule of thumb in your Real Estate business about sort of profit that you make from homebuilding, versus profit that you make from the gain on the underlying land?","Daniel S. Fulton","I can't do that because it varies by market and by project. And let me give you an example, Mark. And probably the 2 extremes would be Houston, Texas, where historically we have purchased auctioned lots from land developers. So fundamentally, the primary profit and margin that you see in Houston comes from homebuilding. We do, as you know, have some land development activity down there, but roughly 2\/3 of our homes in Houston are built on lots that we purchased from others. The other extreme would be San Diego, where we've got a long land position in a market that is very difficult to obtain entitlements. And that's the nature of why we have a longer land position there. And so the margins that come from our San Diego homes are a lot higher and clearly, there's a significant component of that, that relates to the land. But I can't give you a rule of thumb across all markets because every market is different. And quite frankly, every project has some unique history to it as to who owned the land and how long it was owned and whether it was ours or someone else's.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And then the last question I had, Dan, was just on sort of offshore Timberlands. I noticed the pricing continues to be pretty low down there in Uruguay. I'm just curious as to whether that's because that's kind of timber that doesn't have a whole lot of outlets right now. And then I'm also interested in whether you want to expand offshore timber, whether it's more in South America or more maybe over in Asia.","Daniel S. Fulton","Our offshore timber is really located in 2 markets. As you know, Uruguay is our largest position. We have roughly 345,000 acres. And then we've got a small joint venture in Fujian province in Southern China. That's about a 50,000-acre partnership. We are growing out the timberland in Uruguay. We started with rings land and planted it. It is now moving to a stage of harvest maturity. We're growing primarily to a soft timber regime in that market. We have one manufacturing facility, it's a plywood mill that we built where we are producing plywood. And I think it's an area of the world. Quite frankly, it could use some more conversion facilities in order to monetize the timber that is growing there. So we're well situated with our plywood mill. We've seen some improvement in performance out of that. That mill originally was built with the thought that the market would primarily be South Eastern U.S. And it just turned out because of the U.S. housing downturn, most of that product is being sold throughout South America and increasingly Mexico, with some outlet into Europe for higher-grade tropical panel replacement. So that's all the color that I can add. At this point in terms of expanding Timberlands ownership, our focus is, is U.S., it's not global for a variety of reasons. We know the U.S. the best, and U.S. is one of the few markets in the world where you can own the fee, which is important.","Patricia M. Bedient","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","When you look at the progression of Southern fee harvest levels, they just go up, and you mentioned they're going to go up again in the second quarter. But I just noticed they went up every quarter last year and further in the first quarter. And I know obviously from years past, you've talked about having greater ability or greater growth that you would harvest in the future. But it's up, I guess, roughly 25% year-over-year and with more to come. I would like to know sort of what's driving that, and sort of how we should think about the harvest there going forward.","Daniel S. Fulton","We have -- prices have been relatively steady in that marketplace. We made a conscious decision, Chip, to increase the amount of third-party sales. So that was a market where historically most of the logs went to our own mills. We felt that we needed and wanted some diversification, and so we've consciously increased sales to third parties. They're roughly 20% to 25% of our Southern harvest. And then this year with the increasing lumber prices and some recovery in U.S. housing, we are flowing more of those logs to our own conversion facilities to take advantage of the increased activity or increased prices in lumber. So it's been a conscious decision on our part to increase harvest because we have profitable outlets for the logs.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And secondly, on just the tax rate. If you, your forecast is sort of, as you've given us the numbers, is roughly correct, and maybe you mentioned this and I missed it, what should the tax rate be in the quarter, and what would be your sort of range that you would use for the year? And I know it's a moving part based on how much Timberland contributes, but is there any kind of rule of thumb you can give us?","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, Chip. Let me maybe walk through a couple of things that could help you as you go forward. So as you mentioned, it is sensitive to the mix of REIT income versus TRS income and, of course, we don't provide for any tax, corporate tax on the REIT income. So as you think about the TRS income, which is primarily the income from our manufacturing businesses, Cellulose Fibers, Wood Products and our WRECO subsidiary. But also remember that the interest expense is at the TRS as well. So as we look forward for this year for the rate on the TRS results, we are looking at an effective rate of about 25%. And if you look at the first quarter, and now these are just broad rules of thumb, but if you looked at the first quarter and said take the contribution to pretax earnings and exclude the special items and then take away the Timberland earnings and take away the interest expense, you'd get a TRS loss of about $83 million. And then again if you exclude out of the tax benefit the impact of the special items, which you can get from Chart 2 in the package, you'll get about a 25% rate for the first quarter, and we would see that 25% rate being the effective rate for the year, again, depending upon what the ultimate mix of income is. That 25% is lower than what the U.S. statutory rate is because of the mix of U.S. versus non-U.S. earnings.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And I guess, if I heard you correctly, you would -- basically the REIT income, the Timberland segment income is fully nontaxable, in another words, all of the expenses whether it'd be unallocated or interest will be almost all allocated to the TRS.","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes. So all of the interest expense is at the TRS. As it relates to Timberland results, there are pieces in both, but most of the Timberland income is at the REIT level. So if just as a broad rule of thumb, if you take the Timberland income away, you get pretty close.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. So there should be probably no tax expense in the next quarter then?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, there won't be any cash taxes if that's what you mean. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a follow-up to Gail's question on China. Understanding that we've seen slow activity in the first quarter and you expect some pickup in the second half of the year, when you look at kind of the full year 2012, would you expect Chinese log and lumber imports to be kind of up year-over-year or down or sort of roughly flattish, or how should we think about that?","Daniel S. Fulton","At this point, I don't think we have enough visibility, Anthony, regarding the second half. All of our intelligence suggest that it should be picking up the second half. 2011 was such a strong year in terms of exports to China. I would be surprised if our volume would for the full year be equivalent to what it was in 2011, but I really can't speculate.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And you talked about other export markets are cultivating markets outside of Japan, China, Korea. Can you talk a little bit about that or give us some color there? I know that some of your competitors have maybe talked about exporting out of the South into the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Do you have plans there, or is there any kind of opportunity that you can give us details on?","Daniel S. Fulton","I don't have specifics that would provide a lot of guidance for you. We are exploring opportunities for other markets in Asia, both off the West Coast and to some extent out of the South. We are engaged in some initial activity and shipments into the Mediterranean from the U.S. South, and not only for logs but limited extent to lumber. And so we are exploring opportunities both in the West and the South. We've never been really an exporter out of the South. We're very limited, but we are finding some opportunity given that we are growing high-quality sawlogs, and Southern yellow pine and given the size and the nature of the \"clear\" wood in those logs, they become attractive for some other markets, and so not enough specific to give you much help but we are in fact -- got some pilot activity both other countries in Asia as well as in Europe.","Patricia M. Bedient","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","A couple of quick questions. First of all, I appreciate the color on China log volumes. Do you have a longer-term view on the opportunity? Could it be a 10-billion square foot or sorry -- yes, board foot market on a sustainable basis maybe in 5 years or so?","Daniel S. Fulton","I can't speculate. We do see growing demand. They have -- if you just look at their GDP, they are going to need fiber for a lot of purposes. The big breakthrough for China would be if we started to see some increased activity in wood frame construction. Canadian Wood Products Council has been leading that initiative for some period of time, and that will be very significant if that were to occur. We expect the activity to increase over time. They also pull logs from New Zealand. Russia, we talked about a lot, it's a question. But the West Coast is very well situated to supply China. And we would expect that given the growth over time, it'll become a more significant market for all of us in North America.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then switching gears, it occurs to me that multi-family residential is going to lead the housing recovery not just because of government mandates. So are you in a position to build multi-family yourself, or do you sell the land to builders with more expertise in that area?","Daniel S. Fulton","Multi-family is a broad category, so it captures attached housing generally, some of which is for sale and some of which is rental. So we build a limited amount of multi-family in primarily townhouse structures. We've always been active in the Washington DC market, for instance. In Maryland and Virginia, we build townhomes. And we have the ability to build multi-family. We've done it in the past. We are not an apartment developer, but we have the ability and have in the past built for sale attached housing that would be low rise. Generally, when we have land in a master-planned community with multi-family, we sell it to a multi-family developer. And so when we report land sales in some cases we had some last year, we're selling to apartment developers. For our business model, we prefer for sale housing rather than rental. And so it would be a significant change for us to jump into that business. Actually, I'm more bullish on single-family starting to show some recovery.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I hope you're right. And then, final quickie. You referred to TJIs a couple times, Dan, as opposed to iLevel. So is this a reversal in the brand strategy, or you're just calling them what the market calls them?","Daniel S. Fulton","That's a strategy that we reversed last year. So we had been going to market under the umbrella of iLevel for all of our Wood Products. And last year, we made a determination to revert to our strongest brand, which is Weyerhaeuser and the Trus Joist brand. In the marketplace, everyone calls them TJI's units, they're not ours probably. It is a -- we got the leading brand in the business, and we're building on that and taking advantage of it. So we're going to market under the Weyerhaeuser name and under the Trus Joist name because we believe that's our strength and that's the reputation, and quite frankly, our customers tell us that, that's what they prefer.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I think that's true. I think TJIs are like Kleenex and Xerox. That's what people call them.","Patricia M. Bedient","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Pulp maintenance expense, if you could just tell us what it was in the first quarter. And I think you said it'd fairly similar in the second quarter, and then does it pretty much go away in the third, fourth quarters for this year?","Patricia M. Bedient","We'll have a similar amount of maintenance in terms of costs compared to the first quarter with the exception of a couple of the mills, one which had in their maintenance shut that carried over into the second quarter for a day or 2. And then one of our mills were actually finishing up some power boiler expense, so the mill is up and running, but we're finishing up some maintenance there. So I would expect that quarter-over-quarter, we'll be up in maintenance somewhere around $5 million to $10 million, probably closer to $5 million when you look at quarter-over-quarter. In terms of the total maintenance in the first quarter for Cellulose Fibers, I think we were somewhere around low 20s for maintenance costs. And then you have to add on top of that the lost productivity, some a little bit of additional chemicals, et cetera. I don't have the exact number for that, Mark.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Okay. And does that -- do you have any maintenance schedule for the second half of the year?","Patricia M. Bedient","Yes. We'll have a similar amount of maintenance in the second quarter, and we had 2 mills down in the first, so about similar in the second quarter to the first quarter. So we'll have some maintenance, but it'll be much less in the second half. Most of it will be done in the first half.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Can you talk a little bit more about your pulp mill capital projects to get the maintenance downtime a little bit more extended? I know you said that was the reason for some more prolonged shutdowns this year. Is that actually anticipated to be completed by the end of the year, and 2013 will have that extended maintenance schedule? Or is that more of a 2014 event?","Daniel S. Fulton","The transition to that extended schedule will take place over likely a 2- to 3-year period. The scheduled annual maintenance that we have today is not focused on that transition. It is normal maintenance that we need to do for the safety and longevity of our equipment. But we are taking advantage of those annual shutdowns in order to make some incremental changes and improvements that would allow us to accomplish this transition, so it will be a 2- to 3-year period.","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And you mentioned in your prepared comments that you had seen volumes picking up in Japan might be a little bit weaker in the second quarter. Was that just Japanese economy get a little bit better, or is that a post-earthquake rebuild, or maybe some combination of the 2?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, as it relates to what's happening in Japan, we saw an increasing amount of activity late in the year and first quarter was relatively steady. We expect Japan to maintain, perhaps pick up a bit. We're not seeing any significant earthquake rebuild activity that's driving increased volumes. Some of that may be happening, but it's not obvious to us. We anticipated that the rebuild would take some period of time because of the need to initially rebuild infrastructure. The initial response in Japan was focused on temporary housing. That's been accomplished. That was mostly modular. And there was -- some amount of wood product involved in that but not significant amounts. The areas that were most hard hit by the tsunami and the earthquake were rural and not have heavily populated. And so most of the rebuild activity will be longer term. And we expect not to see anything like we did, Josh, in response to the Kobe earthquake, which was a heavily urbanized area, and a lot of rebuilding had to take place over the 2- to 3-year period. So I'm sure it had some incremental volume over time, but it's not terribly significant.","Patricia M. Bedient","Josh, just to be clear in terms of the second quarter outlook, we said that volumes would be pretty much flat. It's just the realizations we  said that might soften somewhat, and that's really more of a currency statement in terms of competitive pressure from European supply because of the weaker euro. So our volumes to Japan should be very stable in second quarter.","Patricia M. Bedient","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a follow-up on the earlier question on price declines in your backlogs of WRECO. That's sort of consistent with sort of smaller home sizing and lower percentage of single-family houses and sort of, I guess, less bells and whistles on houses overall. The question is, do you see that as a cyclical or a structural shift to the market?","Daniel S. Fulton","The mix shift that we're seeing is primarily related to geography, Paul. We've been through a period where over the last 2 to 3 years, we had some decline in square footage, and certainly a lot of the upgrades had disappeared from these homes. But interestingly, in a market-by-market basis, we're seeing some increased activity in higher-priced homes. So in Phoenix where we've had terrific sales, we are not a first-time buyer of product there. We sell second -- first-time move-up, second-time move-up. ","In the Puget Sound area, our Quadrant operation has actually moved its price point up and is providing really a higher quality, more amenitized house than they were 4 or 5 years ago. Our most recent openings in Las Vegas have been higher-priced homes, 4-car garage, price range $350,000 to $400,000, plus or minus. So that's not to say that's happening everywhere but in our own mix, the primary factor ends up being where that house is, and where the sales are occurring as we start to look at the relative percentage of where our sales are coming from or where the closings are coming from in any one period. We've seen that shift and so, plus or minus 5% of total closings. We saw on a quarter-over-quarter basis, a percentage of our closings dropped 5% in San Diego, went up 5% in Phoenix. And those kinds of shifts will be enough to throw off the weighted average of either margin or price. So it gets a little bit complicated to have a broadbrush explanation for what's going on. We are not seeing a rush to the bottom in terms of price or removing amenities. In fact, I think what's happening now is there had been a lot of foreclosed houses on the market. People that are coming into new home sales offices are looking for a home that is more customized, that probably has more features and it meets their needs much more closely than buying -- trying to buy a foreclosed house either from a bank or in an auction. And we view that as being very positive.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Well, pretty interesting answer. Just last question on Japan housing in your leverage there. If I take a look at housing stats, they're sort of down 8.1% annually over the last 5 years. Wooden has held up a lot better, down 3.5%. Are you guys taking market share with your sort of growing export to Japan?","Daniel S. Fulton","Can you restate the question? I don't think I understood.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","If I look at Japanese housing starts, I see a downtrend over the last 5 years. I would say wooden starts has held up a lot better. Your business seems to be holding pretty steady that suggests that you're taking market share. Have I got that right?","Daniel S. Fulton","I believe our customers are taking market share.","Patricia M. Bedient","As you think about who we export to, Paul, we're exporting. Most of our product is export of logs and certainly, our customers in Japan especially our largest customer's taking market share.","Daniel S. Fulton","Okay, let me just provide one minute of wrap-up comments here. I want to thank everybody for your questions and your comments.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to Kathy McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations. The floor is yours.","Kathy McAuley ","Thank you, Carmen. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's First Quarter 2014 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com, our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found at our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website.","On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer. Now, I will turn the call over to Doyle. ","","Doyle Simons","","Thank you, Kathy and good morning everyone, earlier today we reported first quarter net earnings of a 183 million or $0.31 per diluted share on net sales of 2 billion. Excluding special items we achieved solid first quarter net earnings of a 153 million or $0.26 per diluted share as our businesses delivered strong operating results despite unusually severe winter weather throughout much North America in the quarter. Special items in the quarter included a gain resulting from an amendment to a post retirement health care plan, a gain on sale of a non-strategic asset and restructuring charges associated with our previously announced SG&A cost reduction initiative. ","I will begin this morning with a few comments on the housing market and overall economic conditions before turning to a discussion of our business results. The unusually severe winter weather dampened market momentum early in the year and housing starts in January and February declined slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with year ago levels. As the winter weather is moderated markets are improving, in March single family housing starts increased to 635,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, 2% higher than a year ago. Single family also comprised a greater percentage of total housing starts in March, compared with February. ","Prices for existing homes are 13% higher than last year, and fundamentals of job growth and improving household formation support our expectation for continued recovery in the housing markets. Although the weather\u2019s disruption experienced during the past few months has slightly diminished the overall housing outlook for 2014, the market consensus continues to forecast significant growth compared with 2013 and we are planning for approximately 1.1 million starts including over 700,000 single family starts. Globally Chinese demand for our logs and pulp remains strong as the pace of orders rescinds following a normal seasonal slowdown associated with the Lunar New Year. ","Orders from our Japanese customers weakened slightly at the conclusion of the first quarter due to uncertainty regarding the effect of the increased consumption tax. However Japan remains a very strong customer for our logs and we expect that demand will remain generally solid overall.","Let me now turn to our business segment starting with Timberland, charts three to five, Timberlands had an outstanding quarter, contributing a 164 million to earnings, an improvement of more than 20% compared with last quarter, demand for western logs was strong in the quarter and prices rose in export and domestic markets. Operating margins improved due to higher harvest volumes and our operational excellence initiative. The strong performance of our western Timberlands business also reflects increasing benefits from the Longview timber acquisition which contributed 53 million of EBITDA in the quarter an improvement of 18 million from the fourth quarter. ","In the south, log prices rose modestly, continuing the slow upward trajectory we observed in the fourth quarter. Wet weather resulted in lower southern sea harvest volumes as well as reduced silviculture spending. First quarter earnings from disposition and non strategic Timberlands are usually minimal and as expected, dispositions declined to 4 million in the quarter. Excluding dispositions, the segment earned a $160 million. This is the highest quarterly Timberlands\u2019 earnings excluding land sales since the second quarter of 2006. ","Wood products, charts 6 and 7. Wood products earned 64 million, an improvement compared with the fourth quarter despite the effect of severe winter weather. Weather resulted in reduced sales volumes for most products as demand stalled and transportation challenges related to Canadian rail car and trucking availability made it harder to deliver products to our customers. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter improved to 93 million, compared with 88 million in the fourth quarter. In lumber, EBITDA improved by 17 million. This improvement is primarily attributable to increased lumber sales realizations which more than offset lower sales volumes and higher western log cost. ","Operating rates improved and the business did a good job of controlling cost in the quarter despite weather related disruptions. In OSB, EBITDA declined by 10 million, as our prices fell by 3% and sales volumes declined by approximately 5%, manufacturing cost rose slightly as the business incurred higher energy and maintenance cost as a result of the extreme weather. ","EBITDA for engineered wood products fell slightly compared to the fourth quarter due to cost associated with the startup of the Evergreen Alabama mill, and EBITDA for the distribution business improved by a $1 million despite a significant number of lost days due to weather related closures. Operational excellence efforts for all our wood products businesses remain on track and we expect to see additional benefits as the year progresses. ","Cellulose fibers, chart 8 and 9, cellulose fibers contributed 54 million to earnings down from 65 million in the fourth quarter, despite the harsh weather, the mill system ran very well in the first quarter, average pulp price realizations rose as markets tightened due to lower levels of supply. ","Energy costs were higher as a result of the weather and pulp sales volumes declined due to timing of shipment and Canadian transportation issues similar to those that affected our wood products businesses. As expected, maintenance expenses also rose due to an increase in a number of scheduled annual outage days. ","Real estate \u2013 charts 10 to 12. WRECO contributed 12 million to first quarter earnings, down from earnings from four special items of 71 million in the fourth quarter. First quarter earnings included 2 million from land sales. The first quarter is typically the weakest quarter for our real estate business and home closings declined seasonally, this is partly offset by an 8% increase in average prices and lower selling expenses due to the decreased closing volume. ","Gross margins were approximately 21%. During the first quarter we made significant progress against our SG&A initiative to reduce costs by 75 million by 2014 year end. We incurred 18 million of restructuring charges in the quarter primarily for severance as efforts to simplify and streamline our processes and operations reduce our staffing needs, we are highly confident we will achieve our target run rate by year end 2014. ","I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our second quarter outlook.","","Patty Bedient ","Thanks Doyle, and good morning everybody. Although the housing market has gotten off to a slow start in 2014, we expect to see demand pick up as we move to the quarter. The harsh winter weather has now dissipated and the strength of underlying market fundamentals should begin to yield better results in the second quarter. The outlook is summarized on chart 14 and I\u2019ll begin my comments with Timberlands. ","In the west, export prices are expected to soften somewhat but overall, demand and prices remained at favorable levels. The effect of the increased consumption tax is causing Japanese demand to weaken compared to the first quarter. However we expect that volumes to China will increase in the second quarter as activity returns to pre-holiday levels. Demand from domestic sawmills is also anticipated to increase as home building picks up, although prices will likely be somewhat softer. We expect increased log and haul costs as we begin to harvest sites with higher elevations and longer hauling distances. Silviculture costs are also expected to increase. ","In the south we expect pricing to continue its slow but steady upward direction. Volumes are expected to increase slightly offset by higher silviculture costs. Dispositions of non-strategic land sales will be higher in the second quarter compared to the first with anticipated Q2 sales at approximately $20 million which will be substantially completed by the end of this month. Including the effect of these land sales, we expect that second quarter earnings in the Timberlands segment will be comparable to the first quarter. ","In wood products, we expect that the seasonal pick up in home building will result in increased sales volumes across major product lines resulting in improved earnings in all businesses. Lumber sales realizations have softened thus far in the quarter, however they should stabilize as demand improves throughout the quarter. OSB prices appear to have bottomed out and we anticipate slightly improved realizations for the second quarter compared to the first. ","Demand in engineered wood products is improving and we expect higher sales realizations during the quarter. In addition, our Evergreen Alabama plant is scheduled to begin shipping commercial product, high choice and microlam in May. ","In our distribution business, customers are continuing to express signs of optimism and channel inventories are still at relatively low levels. On the cost side of the equation, we expect lumber manufacturing cost to improve with the higher production volumes and log cost will likely increase marginally due to seasonally higher log cost in Canada offsetting favourable variances in the west and south. OSB manufacturing costs are expected to remain flat as the positive effect of higher productivity is offset by slight increases in resin in some planned annual maintenance downtime.","Engineered wood products manufacturing cost should improve especially for veneer cost, which were negatively impacted by adverse weather in the first quarter. Cost should also decrease as our Alabama plant moves from start-ups to production next month. Weather related transportation issues should moderate now that the extreme winter weather conditions are behind us. We anticipate overall earnings in our wood product segment to increase significantly in the second quarter compared to the first depending on the strength of the spring building season.","Sales realizations in our Cellulose Fibers segment are expected to continue to improve. Global softwood pulp inventories were below normal at the end of the first quarter. Liquid packaging realization should also improve primarily due to higher grade mix. We expect lower energy and fiber cost given more favourable weather conditions compared to the first quarter. Maintenance costs are also expected to be slightly lower this quarter. Earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment should increase significantly in the second quarter compared to the first.","We expect improved results in our Real Estate segment as we move into the seasonally stronger second quarter and weather improves. We expect to close approximately 650 single family homes in the quarter, up from the 508 closed in Q1. We anticipate higher average home prices with margins similar to the first quarter of around 20%. Selling cost will increase due to the higher closing volume. Earnings from land and lot sales are also expected to improve moderately compared to the first quarter income of $2 million. Overall earnings in our Real Estate segment are expected to increase in the second quarter compared to the first.","The earlier announced combination of our single family home building business with TRI Pointe Homes is on track and we anticipate closing just after the end of the second quarter. The decision of whether to distribute the shares using a spin or split will be made by the Weyerhaeuser Board likely later this quarter. We remain excited about the benefits of this transaction which should create an even more powerful homebuilder with additional long-term growth potential.","Now, I would like to refer you to chart 13 and make some comments regarding unallocated items. As discussed in our earnings release three special items in the first quarter accounted for $49 million of pre-tax earnings. These items included a restructuring reserve of 18 million for our SG&A and R&D cost reduction initiative that we announced in December. Most of the first quarter reserve is for severance for identified personnel reductions across the company. The majority of these reductions are taking place over the remaining quarters of this year. As a result, very little benefit is in the first quarter operating result.","We expect additional restructuring expenses of approximately $10 million to $15 million as we complete the overall cost reductions and we expect to achieve our targeted run rate by the end of this year. Special items also included a benefit for $45 million for one quarter of the amortization of the reversal of liability associated with the postretirement amendment. We expect each quarter of this year to have a similar amount. ","The final special item was a $22 million gain related to the sale of nonstrategic property. Unallocated G&A expenses for the first quarter as shown on chart 13 totalled a positive $1 million. The change when compared to the fourth quarter is primarily the result of income from changes in share based compensation which is driven by the change in order in stock price well as a shift from unallocated pension expense to pension credits due to the performance of the pension assets and a change in the discount rate. Unallocated function expenses were also somewhat lower than normal.","I\u2019ll wrap up with some overall financial comments and I\u2019ll refer you to chart 15 for these comments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $780 million down from the $835 million at yearend. The first quarter is typically our lowest cash generation quarter due to the seasonal build in working capital as well as lower housing market activity. Cash flow from operations was $109 million which included income tax related receipts of approximately $60 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $65 million and we expect total expenditure for the year of approximately 400 million. Our long term debt was unchanged from yearend and we have not maturities until 2017.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Patty. I am pleased with our first quarter results as we delivered strong operating performance despite unusually severe winter weather, significantly increased EBITDA from our Longview Timber acquisition and took actions against our commitment to reduce SG&A cost. We are beginning to realize the initial benefits of our operations excellence efforts and I look forward to sharing additional progress with you as the year progresses. We are relentlessly focused everyday on growing a truly company by driving superior operational and financial performance to increase cash flow, grow our dividend, and generate additional shareholder value.","With that comment, I think, we will open it for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research Group.","Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group","Thank you. Congratulations on a very good quarter. You ended the first quarter with 780 million of cash and I believe you\u2019re going to have some more cash coming in as part of the TRI Pointe acquisition as well. Can you give a sense as to what you think is the necessary or the right amount of cash from a longer term basis to run the business that you would tend to want to have recognizing where the first quarter might be different than a different quarter? What order or magnitude? What type of cash level do you typically like have to run the company?","Patty Bedient","Good morning, Mark. It\u2019s Patty and I\u2019ll take that one. I think as we think about the cash balance, there are a number of considerations to think about. One of course is where we are in the cycle and we believe we are still in the early innings of the homebuilding recovery, but also what we need for our working capital to support the increased activity. ","The other thing of course is what is the level of liquidity? And we have very good liquidity. One of the things I didn\u2019t mention was that we have our line of credit for $1 billion that we have no borrowings outstanding. So as we look at cash going forward, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate that we would need the level of cash that would be indicated by the $780 million that you\u2019ve referenced at the end of the first quarter as well as additional receipts from the TRI Pointe acquisition.","The other thing that we will not have going forward of course is the cash generated from income from WRECO, so that\u2019s the other offset to that. So a lot of things that go into that number and so those are the things that we are looking at in terms of what is the best use of that cash going forward to build shareholder value.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark Connelly - CLSA","Thank you. Doyle, as we think about operational excellence, should we expect there to be any meaningful impact in your Timber rotations or your harvesting plants in general. Obviously Longview has caused me to have some optimization, but if we leave Longview out of it, is there a meaningful effort that\u2019s going to change in the way you\u2019re managing your Timberlands?","Doyle Simons"," ","Mark, we\u2019re applying our operational excellence within lands across our entire company including Timberland both the Legacy Timberland as well as the Columbia Timberland what we called Columbia Longview Timberland. And just as an example Mark, I would say that in this quarter while we clearly benefited from the higher volume and prices in the quarter, part of the strong quarter in Timberland was a result of the operational excellence initiative that we have put in place specifically in logging and trucking cost improvement and merchandising. And also making sure we get the right log to the right customer to capture the full value. ","So we\u2019re looking across through an operational excellence lens across all of our businesses including Timberland. And while I can\u2019t speak specifically to the exact impact on the harvesting and that type of thing, I can tell you we have already started to see improvement in our timberland operation as a result of our operational excellence initiatives and a little bit of that showed up in the first quarter.","Mark Connelly - CLSA","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and just one thing. It sounds like you\u2019re going to see the log shift towards China away from Japan a little bit overall year-over-year. What\u2019s happening to the China margins? You\u2019ve talked about improvement in some of your China margins in past quarters. Is this shift going to push the overall margin down or are we seeing China pick up?","Patty Bedient","So, Mark, this is Patty. As we think about China, the difference in margins I would say come from some softening in Japan, so as you know, a grade mix that goes to Japan is a little richer grade mix. That also in terms of their competition for that log goes into the overall volume that goes into Asia. So we expect the China margins will see some pressure in terms of just the overall amount and I think I referenced that in our outlook comments, but from a perspective of overall demand from China, we believe that will continue to stay strong. And then as we go forward and get more of the pickup in housing domestically, that domestic log, saw log competes with the China demand, so those two will put tension on each other in terms of the pricing.","","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merill Lynch.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merill Lynch","Thanks. Hi guys, good morning. Congratulations on the progress. I guess first question on RICO, what would be your interpretation for us in terms of the fact that you do have closings now picking up and cancellations down. And in particular, are you seeing, Doyle, a pick-up in the first time home buyer in the market because that seems to be what's been missing here in the cycle, in terms of extending it going forward?","Doyle Simons","George, I agree with you. I think that is what's been missing and for this housing to get back to the 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 level that we've seen historically, we're going to need to see the first time home buyer start to gain some traction. I think we're starting to see a little bit of that, but there's still some challenges in the mortgage market regarding loan availability and the amount that's required to be put down and just the credit scores that are currently required. ","Encouragingly I think we're starting to see a little bit of loosening of some of those standards which I think is healthy and that will prompt more first time home buyers into the marketplace. So we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to start to see more and more first time home buyers stepping into the market and we think that's what's going to take this housing starts to the next level.","Patricia Bedient","Yeah, George, kind of the other things that is just holding back a little bit that first time home builder or buyer is the fact that the FHA limits have also been reduced somewhat, so I think that's putting a little pressure on that marketplace as well, but as Doyle said overall, as we look forward for housing, we're optimistic about what will happen for the rest of 2014.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merill Lynch","Patty, the FHA limits has been a much discussed topic and it's a good thing you are bringing it up. Do you think that that won't be a burden or an in pediment for a year or do you think if you're through a quarter or two down the road, we should have already had the impact of that in terms of demand?","Doyle Simons","Well, I think it's yet to be seen and I think it's one factor in the first time home buyer. I think the other pieces of the overall mortgage availability, as well as just what's happening with consumer confidence and economic activity overall. So, I think if that continues to improve even slowly, but subtly that will overcome some of that pressure that comes from the FHA limits.","George Staphos - Bank of America Merill Lynch","Thanks. My last question and I'll turn it over. Within EWP, can you comment or maybe provide a little bit more granularity on why you feel you're on target with some of your operational improvement programs. And Doyle you mentioned you expect or Patty mentioned you expect sales realizations to be up, I guess marginally in the quarter. Is that because of the tail effect from last year or is that because there's some new price increases in the market? Thanks. And good luck in the quarter.","Doyle Simons","Good question, George. And on ELP specifically, what we saw in the quarter was we had some start-up costs as we mentioned associated with our evergreen, Alabama mill. We also had some weather impacts in the quarter. We, like I said, remain confident that we're going to increase the earnings in that business by $30 to $40 million EBITDA in 2014 compared with 2013. We also to your point are encouraged and confident, we're going to see some price increases and are already starting to see those in the second quarter versus the first quarter, some of that due to mix, but some of that due to just overall improvement in prices as we move into the stronger spring seasonal period.","Operator","Your next question is from the line Gail Glazerman with UBS.","","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS","I guess before I ask my question, Patty, just want to acknowledge the retirement best of luck and I guess we'll have you for another quarter on the call, but thanks for all your help.","Patricia Bedient","Thank you.","Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS","I guess just starting with timber, results were higher than what you might have suggested last quarter and I'm just wondering what surprised you in the quarter, where the upside came from relative to what you might have expected?","Doyle Simons","Gail, we were encouraged by our results in our timberlands business in the first quarter and I would basically point to three things. One thing was we clearly had higher prices as prices strengthened in the quarter versus the fourth quarter that resulted -- as a result we had a little bit higher volumes to capitalize on those higher prices in the quarter. ","The second thing is as I mentioned earlier, we had some benefit from our operational excellence initiatives, specifically in some cost improvement on logging and trucking, and also did a good job of merchandising and what I mean by that as I mentioned earlier is getting the right log to the right customer at the right time to fully maximize the value. ","And then third and importantly, we saw a really nice improvement from our Longview acquisition in the quarter. As I mentioned or as we mentioned, that was up approximately $18 million from the prior quarter. We saw about 6 million of synergy benefit or let me put it this way, in terms of the synergies from Columbia, we are at a run rate as of the first quarter about 6 million a quarter, which would translate into about $24 million of synergy benefits on an annual basis. And as you know that\u2019s well ahead of our original target of 20 million in synergy. So those are the three buckets that contributed to the Timberlands improvement in the quarter versus the prior quarter and maybe versus some expectations.","Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank","Okay and I don\u2019t suppose you could quantify the operating excellence contribution there?","Doyle Simons","As we\u2019ve said before, Gail, we will quantify that on an annual basis because it will be lumpy. But, I will tell you, it did have an impact in -- a significant impact, I guess, it depends on how you define significant, but it did have an impact on the bottom line in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter.","Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank","And can you talk about maybe the weather impact in the quarter both potentially, if you can quantify what it might have done to you and just maybe taking a step back and what it might mean for the market for instance, lumber seems to have accrued up in Canada. Are you starting to see that come back? So if you could just maybe talk about both, I guess, the financial impact and direct impact as well as how you think it might impact some of the markets as everything unfolds in the second quarter?","Doyle Simons","Sure, so let me start off by saying I was proud, we were proud the way our people managed through the tough weather conditions in the quarter. As you know, there was a lot going on. In terms of quantifying the impact, its differential by business as you would expect, but I would say in Timberlands, it was minimal. In our Wood Products business if you look across our Wood Products businesses, the impact by business was somewhere in the $2 to $5 million range per business. ","This had to do with things like closures, and lumber for example, we lost 27 days due to closures and distribution. We lost over 50 days due to weather closures. In addition, we had slow backs, as you know when you have frozen logs in a saw mill you can\u2019t run as fast, so that was part of the issue. We had transportation issues in Canada and in the US. And we even had a couple of mills for a short period of time specifically in one of our OSB Mills we're able to get logs to the mill to run. So those were some of the challenges that we had. Again, I thought our people did a really nice job of managing through that in our Wood Products business.","And then in our Cellulose Fibers business, Gail, the impact there from weather was approximately $4 million, and that was primarily due to higher energy cost and some railcar availability specifically regarding our Grand Prairie Mill. ","In terms of going forward, most of these issues we think are behind us. There we still have transportation challenges that we'll work through specifically in Canada as you talked about, but all-in all we think most of it's behind us and we\u2019ll be able to work through it as we move through the second quarter.","Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And just from the market perspective any worries that production build up in Canada as the transport issues unwind will have an impact on the market, is that why you\u2019re looking for fairly muted lumber prices in the quarter?","Patty Bedient","So, Gail, I think as we referenced, our realizations thus far in the quarter were softer. I think that likely part of that is due to that issue, but I think now we see them starting to stabilize and think they will move up from this point. So, I think we\u2019ll work through that nicely. Again, it is dependent upon how housing activity comes back, but the underlying fundamentals for housing and now with the improved weather, things look good at this point.","Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank","Okay. And just one last question, can you talk about, I guess, looking at WRICO and the activity you\u2019re seeing there and as it suggests for housing activity more broadly, are you seeing, can you kind of quantify and give examples of any seasonal pick up you\u2019re seeing and also you operate in regions that would have been affected by weather but also ones that probably weren\u2019t? And did you note a difference in trend beyond just the underlying market fundamentals that gives you confidence, some of the sluggishness in housing or a lot of the sluggishness in housing in the first quarter was weather related versus something else?","Patty Bedient","Sure. I think there are a couple of things as we look at our own markets. If you think about our Winchester subsidiary, which is in the Washington D.C. area was really hammered by weather, even the first part of the second quarter hammered by weather, so it\u2019s a little tough to see exactly the impact that weather had, how much of it, but it was significant and we\u2019re starting to see that now come back around. ","I think the other in the first quarter markets that were a little rougher were not surprisingly those that were potentially a little overheated in the prior year and I would reference Phoenix and Las Vegas there. Phoenix is now stabilizing as well so that\u2019s a good thing, California, Los Angeles is doing well and here in the Puget Sound of course, the market did not go down as far as some of the other markets that we had. ","Texas also continues to remain strong, so I think again as we look forward, a lot of that's behind us, I think the other thing that has put a little bit of a dampening effect on the marketplace is sort of a good news bad news, we had some pretty significant price increases over the course of last year and I think that has slowed that a little bit, so we don't have as many closings as we'd like but they're closing at higher prices, so one sort of helps to offset the other one, but as I said before, we are much more excited now about homebuilding as we look forward with this really harsh weather in so many geographies behind us. ","Operator","","Your next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. ","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs","","Can you remind us how much incremental capacity the Evergreen, Alabama plant will add to the EWP business and where your utilization rates will be once that plant starts up? ","Patty Bedient","","You know, in Evergreen, which is, it has started up now and it will be shipping product the first of May, it produces two products primarily, I-joist and microlam and we have about 61 million Lineal feet would be the capacity that we would note for I-joist and about 4 million cubic feet for microlam solid sections. ","In terms of its moving into commercial production now, it won't be operating at full capacity to start with as we move that product into the marketplace. I think overall if we were to discount the Evergreen mill we're operating across that part of the business in engineered wood at around 70% but it's very differential by product line. For example, our microlam product is operating at very, very high operating rates. That's one of the reasons that we're excited about having the availability from Evergreen coming online. ","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs","","Appreciate that detail, Patty and then pulp, there's been recent price erosion on the softwood side in China even though inventory seems to be in pretty good shape. Do you have any thoughts on why we've seen prices move lower in China and any visibility into the pulp price environment in China over next couple of months? ","Patty Bedient","","Well I think as we look at one of the things that puts pressure on paper grade softwood is of course the additional hardwood capacity that is coming online, but China does need softwood to go with the hardwood so I think even though prices may soften here later that we still are feeling good about pricing overall moving up in the second quarter and that would certainly include our fluff pulp price going up as well. ","Doyle Simons","","Yes, Alex if you look at the -- as we mentioned first quarter and fourth quarter clearly fluff prices were up and we anticipate that trend will continue into the second quarter and part of that has been the disruption in the overall supply side of the equation due to the weather but we do think that's going to carryover clearly into the second quarter overall. ","","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. ","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","","Thanks very much, good morning. Just a couple questions on Timberlands exports. My understanding is Chinese log and lumber inventories are actually pretty high right now. I guess a question is are you seeing the same thing and then just on your reference to the consumption tax increase in Japan and the slower refile there. Can you quantify that? Do you expect that down 5-10% in Q2? ","Doyle Simons","","From the Chinese perspective, I think inventories did build a little bit during the Lunar New Year period as I referenced in my comments. We anticipate as that gets behind us that demand will in fact continue to increase in China and that will be helpful in decreasing the overall log inventories in China. ","In terms of Japan, if you look at it historically when there's been a change to the consumption tax, you normally see a little bit of pre-buying and then you see a little bit of weakness as it goes in and then stabilization. And it's hard to tell exactly how that's going to play out this time but our guess is it's going to be a similar type pattern. We probably did see a little bit of pre buying, now we're in the period where there may be a little bit of weakness due to the adjustment to the consumption tax, but long term, we continue to be very encouraged by the demand out of Japan.","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And then just on operational excellence, it looks like you're getting some traction there. Just wondering, if you're able to share at some point in the future your targets, your timing and sort of the CapEx required to get where you want to get to?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. So let me talk generally about OpEx across all of our businesses and I would tell you we're encouraged by the progress that we've made against the targets that we laid out in December. As we previously said we will quantify the benefits on an annual basis but let me give just a little bit of color directionally on some of the benefits that we're starting to see. I already hit on Timberlands a little bit, but clearly part of our good quarter in Timberlands was a result of our operational excellence initiatives. And specifically, as I mentioned earlier regarding cost improvement on logging and trucking and also on merchandising, again making sure we get the right log to the right spot. ","In terms of lumber, our manufacturing costs were lower than the prior quarter. That as you know is the key focus of our operational excellence efforts. I will tell you that was somewhat hampered in quarter by weather, but I can tell you plans are in place to start to really capture the benefits from our efforts there in the second quarter and we're confident we'll see the benefit of that in the second quarter and going forward.","And our OSB business, the reliability, was a challenge our key focus areas, it\u2019s improving our reliability again as we laid out on December 17th, that was challenged during the quarter, due to weather but we start to see an improvement late in the quarter and that improvements continued into the second quarter. And then the other initiative there is to improve our mix of high value products or enhanced products and just as an example there, we're starting to make our flooring product at our Hudson Bay mill. ","In ELP, as I mentioned earlier, we had some weather impacts, but we are confident that we will see the improvements that we've laid out in ELP. And similarly in distribution, where we are there, as I mentioned had over 50 days of closure due to weather in the first quarter, but I can tell you, all of our sites has completed, an extensive analysis of the customers, the products lines, pricing, the warehouse cost and delivery cost and I can tell you one by one those sites are turning to profitability and we are encouraged by what we're seeing there.","In sales Fibers -- we can give you a number of examples of operational excellence but I think the one that I would highlight for the first quarter is we had record production at a number of our mills, despite the very severe winter weather and that's not the case across the board, if you look at what happened in that business overall and when I say in that business, I mean in that industry overall in the quarter, so we did a good job of running those mills, despite the tough weather. And then we talked about SG&A and we're making great progress on our SG&A. I'm confident we're going to get where we need to be. ","So I think the summary is we're on track. We're working hard on this operational excellence every day. We're starting to see some benefit and much more to come and we'll like I said we will update you on an annual basis on exactly where we are versus the targets that we laid out on December 17th.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson","Just two quick questions. First of all, can you just tell us what criteria would determine whether a split or a spin is preferable?","Patricia Bedient","Sure, Steve. As we think about those, we think about the spin as being like a special dividend and the split is more akin to a share repurchase. So if you think about the criteria that you would use for each of those. In addition, one of the things that we look at when we look at the spin versus the split is, of course, in the spin you're just issuing the shares pro-rata to the existing Weyerhaeuser shareholder base. In a split, shareholders are given a choice to exchange their Weyerhaeuser shares for the shares of what we think is a very strong home builder going forward. So the split gives the investor base the opportunity to choose which one. And we think that it has the added advantage of then placing the stock with its more -- its natural investor base. Whereas there may be some people who are Weyerhaeuser shareholders who would say I don't really want to own homebuilding long-term, I want more of a forest products exposure, and so it really is the fact that one is simpler, certainly the spin is much simpler, and the split though a little more complex, does have the ability to place the stock with more of its investor base and it is the split is what we did in when we did the downtown transaction in 2007, although it is a little more complex to execute, it is something we have done in the past.","Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson","It does make sense I guess to get it in the hands of those who want it. From a tax perspective, is one more advantageous than the other?","Patty Bedient","No, there really isn\u2019t any difference from one versus the other.","Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson","Okay, thank you for that. And then the second question was you\u2019ve elaborated on why you remain confident in the housing recovery, so can you just tell us how you position the Wood Products business? Is your operating stance predicated on an 18% increase in starts which is the difference between 2013 and the 1.1 million that you expect or is it based on your order filed from week to week?","Doyle Simons","Well, I would say it\u2019s both of the above. We clearly are matching our supply with our demand but we\u2019re also as we look forward, we continue to anticipate an improvement in housing as we said. So you factor in all of those equations as you look to the future for our wood products business, but I like the way we\u2019re positioned in our Wood Products business. Our focus as mentioned earlier is just running the capacity that we have better. And we\u2019re starting to make improvements in doing just that. And in terms of our overall, if you look at it, any of our mills that we closed have either been started up so which was evergreen or permanently closed. We do not have any mills sitting idle at this point. And like I said, I like where we\u2019re positioned in Wood Products and think we\u2019re very well positioned to fully capitalize on the continued improvement in housing going forward.","Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson","So you\u2019re ready to serve 1.1 million starts but you\u2019re not going to run for practice, right.","Doyle Simons","That is correct.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon.","Chip Dillon","Three quick ones. Good morning, Doyle and Patty, and Kathy. And again good luck to you Kathy as you later this year move on into retirement. I wanted to you ask first on the land sales now that we have a reconfigured Timberland business with the Longview properties, is sort of the second quarter, is that an usually high level land sales you would expect going forward? And I know it's erratic or would that represent kind of a normal level?","Patty Bedient "," ","Well, it is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, sort of historically if you can call it seasonality to it. The first quarter is usually a little lower. The second quarter at 20 million does not involve Longview land sales. So, it\u2019s not that activity is not coming as a function of Longview. So I would say that 20 million probably is more on the high side from a quarterly perspective so that would give you a run rate of around 80, but it\u2019s going be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year really based upon the opportunity that we see. So we look to upgrade the portfolio through the land sales because those are for the most part, exchanges that we are doing. So it\u2019s a function of continuing to look for the best opportunity and that\u2019s why you see the lumpiness, we're not trying to hit it a particular target in any one quarter, it\u2019s really opportunistic.","Chip Dillon","I see and then I guess the second one is, I know in December that kind of the two sub-businesses within Wood Products had sort of need the improvement, obviously our EWP and distribution, and I was wondering sort of when do you get to a point where they need to show the kind of improvement you expect them to versus maybe making of a decision from those businesses? In other words would that be a couple of years or maybe a year?","Doyle Simons","Chip, as we very specifically said on December 17, we anticipate and fully expect both of those businesses or each of those businesses, let me be very clear, each of those businesses to improve EBITDA about $30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013. At this point, we remain confident that that\u2019s in fact exactly what\u2019s going to happen and we\u2019re taking a lot of very proactive steps to make sure that is in fact the case. So that\u2019s the timeline we\u2019ve played out and that\u2019s the timeline we\u2019re committed to.","Chip Dillon","Okay, very clear, and one quick one for Patty. The interest expense for the first quarter at 83 million was a little less than we thought, is that a good run rate to use for that the rest of year assuming nothing big -- well forgetting the -- even with split off, would you assume not to change much?","Patty Bedient","Yes, I think that that should probably be a pretty good. That is net of capitalized interest. So a few million can change quarter-to-quarter depending upon what projects we\u2019re doing, but there shouldn\u2019t be anything particularly different in that number going forward.","","Operator","","Your final question will come from the line of Colin Ming, with Raymond James.","","Colin Ming - Raymond James","","Hey, good morning, just real quick, going back to the question about really the cash balance, in the past you guys have talked about using some of your cash position to continue to grow that Timberland portfolio. Can you maybe just update us on what you\u2019re seeing from your perspective on the acquisition environment and are there, any other deals you guys are looking at on that front.","Doyle Simons","","I would just say, we are constantly looking at opportunities to grow our Timberland base, now we will as we have historically we\u2019ll be very disciplined in doing that and we\u2019re not going to grow just for the sake of growing, if we can find acquisition opportunities like the Longview acquisition where we can drive value for shareholders that\u2019s something we will pursue going forward, so, we\u2019re, as we\u2019ve have been historically and we continue to be, we look at lots of different acquisition opportunities but we will be continue to be very disciplined in the way we approach those going forward.","","Colin Ming \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, thanks Doyle, and then Patty maybe can you just remind us are there any sort of restrictions tied to the proceeds coming from WRECO, the $700 million plus or minus, just given the way that the homebuilder unit was in the TRS and then just the nature of the transaction, are there going to be any near term restrictions related to that incoming cash?","Patty Bedient","","Yes, Colin as you think about that cash, it is unrestricted but as you referenced, it is coming into the TRS, so there are no additional restrictions as a result of it coming from the home building business other than the fact that would be the same as any other cash that is in the TRS in terms of moving at around between the REIT and the TRS but it is totally unrestricted other than that.","","Colin Ming \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, well, can you maybe just remind us like some of the mechanisms to get that, that amount of cash out of the TRS and up to the REIT?","Patty Bedient","","Well one of the things that certainly you can do is dividend cash from the TRS to the REIT, there are limitations as to how much cash can be dividended in any particular year and that\u2019s really a function of the earnings in Timberland business. ","The other thing that you can do, there is no restriction in terms of borrowing cash from the TRS, although you do need to pay interest income on that borrowing from one to the other. Certainly if you want to move cash down you can make a capital contribution, but I think your question is more about moving cash from the TRS up to the REIT, so you can loan it up without restriction, you just have to pay interest income on that down to the TRS.","","Colin Ming - Raymond James","Okay, and then just, you guys referenced in kind of you, I think your 2Q outlook in some of the prepared remarks just about some of the momentum you\u2019re starting to see in the US south as far as log pricing there, can you guys quantify that at all, I mean we\u2019ve kind of heard mixed messages depending upon which specific region you\u2019re in, generally the Gulf south not being as strong but kind of Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas being a little bit stronger, can you just maybe put a little additional color on that, maybe quantify the type of movement you\u2019re seeing in the south.","Doyle Simons","","You know, I would answer that by saying, if you look at 2013, prices in the log prices in the south were up roughly 4%. As we said in our comments and as shown on the slides, prices were up again modestly in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter and what we anticipate is a slow but certain increase in log prices in the south going forward, yes, by quarter by quarter it will vary by region and you\u2019ll see one move up more than the other but overall we are encouraged by the trend that we see and are confident that over time prices will continue to improve in the south as we see housing continue to rebound.","","Colin Ming \u2013 Raymond James","Okay, great, congrats on the quarter.","Doyle Simons"," ","Thank you. ","Okay, as I understand it that was our last question, I\u2019d like to just end by thanking everybody for joining in this morning and thanks for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.","","Operator","","Thank you for joining us today, you may now disconnect."],"22665":["Weyerhaeuser Co.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Weyerhaeuser Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Denise M. Merle - Senior Vice President-Human Resources & Investor Relations","Thank you, Brent. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2015 earnings. On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Denise, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $133 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.8 billion. Each of our businesses delivered solid operating results, as operational excellence efforts helped mitigate the delayed arrival of the spring building season and the continuing challenge of a strong U.S. dollar.","In addition, we returned over $150 million of cash to shareholders in the quarter through repurchase of common shares. Cumulative repurchase at quarter end totaled $610 million, as we near completion of our existing $700 million authorization.","I will begin this discussion of our business results with some brief comments about the housing market. Housing indicators remain choppy and the spring building season was slow to gather momentum in the second quarter as weeks of heavy rain and flooding in the South hampered building activity.","However, markets gained momentum late in the quarter as the weather abated and our outlook for 2015 remains unchanged at approximately 1.1 million housing starts, which represents a 10% improvement compared with 2014.","We continue to be optimistic about the longer-term prospect for housing as rising employment, strong consumer confidence, historically low mortgage rates and signs of increased participation by first time home buyers should support continuing improvement in the U.S. housing market. In addition, builder sentiment in July was at the highest level in 10 years and our customers continue to tell us they expect increased housing activity in the second half of the year.","Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, charts three to five. Timberlands contributed $127 million to the second quarter earnings, compared with $162 million in the first quarter. Lower average sales realizations for western logs and lower earnings from timberlands dispositions more than offset seasonally higher sales volumes.","In the West, export log prices remained under pressure due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. However, export volumes increased substantially, compared with first quarter due to seasonally improved demand from our Japanese and Chinese customers.","Domestic log sales realizations declined throughout the quarter, as log markets remained well supplied due to favorable market conditions in the first half of the year. In the South, fee harvest increased seasonally as we were able to flex harvest settings around the second quarter's extreme wet weather. Average sales realizations for Southern logs were comparable to the first quarter.","Second quarter included earnings of $5 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, a reduction of $12 million, compared with the first quarter. The Timberlands business continues to benefit from operational excellence initiatives and remains on track to meet its OpEx targets for 2015.","Wood Products, charts six and seven. Wood Products contributed $71 million to the second quarter earnings, an improvement of $9 million compared with the first quarter. EBITDA increased to $98 million. Improved sales volumes and reduced operating cost enabled the business to overcome lower average realizations for lumber and oriented strand board.","In Lumber, EBITDA declined $6 million, compared with the first quarter, a 5% decline in average sales realizations was mostly offset by seasonally higher sales volumes, lower Western log costs and operational excellence initiatives to reduce manufacturing cost.","In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $4 million due to a 3% decline in average sales realizations. I was particularly pleased with the performance of engineered wood products in the quarter, as we reported EBITDA of $38 million, an increase of $12 million compared with the first quarter. Sales volume rose seasonally across all product lines and per unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher production volume and operational excellence initiatives.","EBITDA for the distribution business increased by $5 million, compared with the first quarter due to improved sales volumes, higher product margins and lower overhead cost.","Our Wood Products businesses remained relentlessly focused on operational excellence. Lumber and OSB are on track to achieve their 2015 targets. Engineered wood products is tracking significantly above its full-year EBITDA improvement target, up $26 million year-to-date compared with 2014.","And our distribution business has been challenged by the severe weather in some of its key markets in the first half of the year and has work to do to achieve its target. However, this business is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanded building activity we expect during the second half of 2015.","Cellulose Fibers, charts 8 and 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $27 million to earnings, compared with $33 million in the first quarter. Pulp market stabilized during the second quarter as global inventories declined to more balanced levels. Average pulp realizations were down compared with the first quarter.","As expected, maintenance expense increased significantly in the second quarter, as we completed a planned extended outage at our Flint River, Georgia mill. The outage included scheduled maintenance and installation of energy-related capital improvements. The West Coast port disruption resulted in approximately $8 million in lingering logistics costs in the second quarter, but we anticipate minimal effects going forward.","The Cellulose Fibers business made good progress on operational excellence initiatives in the second quarter, including the successful startup of a turbine generator that significantly reduces energy cost at our Flint River mill. This business remains on track to achieve its 2015 operational excellence target.","I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our third quarter outlook.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the third quarter is summarized on chart 13, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.","In the West, sales realizations for export logs to Japan are expected to improve slightly, due to increased housing demand. Although China inventories have decreased from earlier in the year, they remain at above-normal levels, putting continued pressure on prices. Domestic log realizations are anticipated to increase as a result of constrained supply due to fire-related harvest restriction. Fee harvest volumes are expected to decrease accordingly.","In the South, average sales, log sales realizations are anticipated to be comparable to Q2. Fee harvest volumes are expected to increase on a slightly lower grade mix as Q3 typically carries a greater percentage of thinning volume.","Silviculture costs are anticipated to increase both seasonally and because some activities had to be deferred from Q2 as a result of wet weather. Earnings from non-strategic land sales are projected to be around $10 million, compared to $5 million in Q2. Overall earnings in our Timberlands segment are expected to be slightly lower in Q3, compared to Q2.","Turning to Wood Products. Although, lumber and oriented strand board prices have decreased during the month of July, the average sales realizations for this month are still higher than the Q2 averages. We expect prices for both lumber and OSB to increase in the remainder of the quarter from today's level. We anticipate average sales realizations for engineered wood products in the third quarter to be comparable to the second quarter.","Sales volumes are anticipated to be seasonally higher across most product lines. Western log costs are expected to be modestly higher than Q2. We will be taking some annual maintenance downtime in our engineered wood products facilities, which will negatively affect manufacturing costs for the quarter. We expect continued improvement in the results of our distribution business.","Overall, we anticipate that third quarter earnings in our Wood Products segment will be higher than the second quarter, but likely lower than the third quarter of last year.","Moving to the Cellulose Fibers business, global softwood pulp inventory levels decreased during the second quarter, and we were basically in balance at the end of the quarter. However, because the industry typically plans fewer maintenance outages in the third quarter, combined with uncertainty around demand from China, inventory levels could tick up leading to some softness in pulp prices in the third quarter. We expect higher sales volumes to partially offset the potential effect of lower sales realization.","We anticipate substantial cost improvement in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we had 46 maintenance-related outage days. And this quarter, we have only minimal days planned. As a result, we will have lower maintenance expense and higher productivity.","In addition, now that the West Coast port dispute has been resolved, we do not anticipate a repeat of the $8 million negative effect that we experienced in Q2. Overall, third quarter results in our Cellulose Fibers segment should significantly increase, compared to the second quarter and exceed the third quarter earnings of last year.","Chart 10, summarizes the results of unallocated items. Before special items, total cost decreased by just over $60 million. The largest item making up this variance was foreign exchange as the Canadian dollar appreciated from approximately $0.79 at the end of the first quarter to $0.81 at the end of the second quarter. For modeling purposes, every penny in the exchange rate is roughly $4 million on a pre-tax basis.","The other large item was the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. This item is difficult to predict, as it fluctuates based on the level and mix of inventory from quarter-to-quarter. However, we do not expect the change of this magnitude in the third quarter.","Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, beginning with chart 11. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $366 million or an increase of $289 million, compared to the first quarter. In addition to increased earnings, large positive variances included lower working capital, and lower interest payments, compared to the first quarter.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $108 million, bringing our year-to-date expenditures to $197 million. We continue to expect total expenditures for the full year to approximate $500 million. We do not have any debt maturities until 2017 and have no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion line of credit. As detailed on chart 12, during the second quarter, we used $154 million to repurchase our common stocks. And at the end of Q2, we had approximately $90 million remaining under our existing authorization.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Patty. The housing market continues to gather momentum and building activity is increasing, although, it has come this year in fits and starts. Looking forward, we are well positioned to capitalize on its improvement. And we remain relentlessly focused on driving value for shareholders through operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation.","Now, with that, I'd like to open up the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thanks a lot. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Doyle, you'd made a comment, or Patty, that you are expecting lumber and OSB prices to pick up as the quarter progresses. I was curious what informs that view, whether it's a sense of where inventories are in the channel? Is at sense that demand is going to be getting better? What would be the drivers that you are expecting to help us see lumber and OSB start moving in the right direction?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Mark, it's a combination of those factors. As I mentioned in my prepared comments and talking to customers, they continue to be very optimistic about housing activity. In fact, I was talking to Adrian Blocker just this morning. He was with customers as recently as yesterday, and just very optimistic about activity out there. In addition, in terms of inventories, as you mentioned, I would tell you inventories are fairly lean at this point in time.","So, I think what's happened is there's been a confluence of events from the supply side, Mark, as you're very well aware of in terms of the Canadian dollar, and that's resulted in additional volume coming into the U.S. The weakness in the export \u2013 Asian export markets has resulted in an increase coming in to the U.S. That, at a time when we had a delay in the spring building season, all resulted in prices having some pressure on them. I think as demand continues to improve, supply and demand will get back in balance, and hopefully, we will see some improvement in lumber and OSB prices as we move through the balance of the quarter.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. And one quick follow-up. Do you have thoughts on the potential expiration of the softwood lumber agreement and what type of implications that might or might not have for lumber markets as we go forward?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, in terms of the softwood lumber agreement, as we've said previously, this is an important issue to Weyerhaeuser. There's a council of industry leaders that are discussing options for renewing the agreement and Weyerhaeuser is actively participating in those discussions. And we're very hopeful that we can reach an agreement and avoid trade litigation going forward.","In terms of the implications, if it runs out in October, Mark, there's two trains of thought. One is that when that occurs, that additional supply comes on from Canada because there won't be any tariffs in place. But there is also the thought that that will not occur because of the implications that it could potentially have in trade litigations down the road.","So, don't know how to play out. And again, two different trains of thought, and we'll just have to see what happens if we're not able to get a resolution in place prior to that which I think everybody is working towards.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Could you talk about the movement of Western export log prices as you move through Q2 and then into July, and are you seeing any inflection point there? And then maybe just a related question. We've heard a lot about the risk of fires in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. Is that something that's actually impacting prices and volumes right now, or is that just something that we need to kind of keep an eye on in August and September?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, both important issues, and let me address each of those. In terms of export markets, let me break it down by market. In Japan, we saw prices bottom in June and prices have started to move up in July. And this has been due to the improved Japanese housing demand. And to your second question, I'll get into more details on this in just a minute, the lower log supply due to \u2013 primarily due to fire restrictions.","In terms of what we're seeing in China, the log takeaway from Chinese ports picked up in the second quarter, but remains at relatively low levels. Log inventories \u2013 I mean, log inventories moved down to about 3.8 million cubic meters in the second quarter, but has since climbed back up just above 4 million cubic meters. And I can tell you the softwood log imports from all regions into China are down, but as I said, the inventories remain high and we think there continue to be pressure in China in terms of pricing.","Related to that in domestic markets in the West, we think domestic prices are going to rise due to the fire season. And our volumes, as Patty mentioned, our harvest volumes are projected to be down in the third quarter versus the second because of the fire restrictions.","Now, let me turn to the current fire situation. And I can tell you just drive around the Pacific Northwest, it's dry out there. It almost looks like you're in Arizona as opposed to the normally wet Pacific Northwest.","In terms of what's happening, the fire season started earlier this year and at least at this point, it looks like it's going to last longer than normal. If you look at the level of rainfall, it's one of the lowest levels in the last 70 years. And I can tell you most Western acres are currently under either what's called level 2, level 3 or level 4 fire restrictions. These are restrictions that are put on placed by outside regulators.","Just to give you a sense, level 2 requires most operations to cease by 1 PM. Level 3 requires all operations to cease by 1 PM and further restricts certain harvest activity such as using power saws and cables, cable yarding at all times. And then level 4 restrictions are complete ban on entry to the forest. Just a couple of days ago in Oregon, a level 4 restriction was put in place in portions of Oregon. There's not been a level 4 restriction in place since 1988, just to put it in context. And that restriction impacts about 15% of our Western Timberlands.","Now, that can change overnight if we get some rain or temperatures cool down and all those things. But that is the current state. And to your question, we do anticipate lower harvest in the third quarter versus the second as a result of these fire restrictions and we'll continue to monitor them and see how they play out going forward.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Maybe just to add to that a little bit, as Doyle said, the fire restrictions or the fire concern happened earlier in the Pacific Northwest than normal. And people anticipated that this may happen in some of the drier conditions, as you heard us talk about in the second quarter, led many of the mills to, and I'm talking industry now, to put in a few more logs. So, we haven't seen closures of mills at this point because of out of log downtime because they still have some inventory of logs. But I think as we get into August and into the middle of August, we'll see more of that concern, as Doyle said, if we don't get more rain in the Pacific Northwest, which isn't the forecast as we sit here today. I think it'll be something that we'll see more in the month of August than we've seen thus far in July.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's very helpful detail. And then maybe just one follow-up on timberlands. During the quarter, we saw announcements from a few large timber owners that they would put large properties on the market. I wonder generally, are you seeing any change in institutional interest for timberlands? Is it becoming a little bit more of a buyer's market? Are you seeing any trends in prices changing? And is there an opportunity for Weyerhaeuser, as a buyer or a seller, especially in the South?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And so I would say overall, when you step back, Anthony, the amount of activity still is generally low in the South and the West. As you mentioned, there were some facts that came on, became available in the first half of the year. I would say, most of those have some unique challenges that people will have to work through in terms of how they're going to value those. I would say, we expect more activity in the second half of the year, and I can tell you there's still a lot of money chasing deals. So no, I don't see any downward pressure on timberland prices at this point in time.","In terms of Weyerhaeuser specifically, as we've consistently said we're always looking to grow our timberland, but we will continue to be very disciplined and make sure any acquisition that we make meets our appropriate level of returns and drives value for our shareholder. So, we look at everything that comes across, or most everything that comes across. And we are interested in growing but we'll continue to be disciplined.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Gail.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","First, just picking up on a couple of things that have been asked, looking at the Canadian trade situation maybe shorter term tariffs are set to go down fairly significantly in August. Do you have any concerns there that that might put incremental supply in the market and weigh on pricing? If not, it doesn't look like you do, so why not?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. As we alluded to, tariffs are scheduled to go down from 15% to 5% in August. We don't anticipate that that's going to have a big impact on the supply side of the equation but I guess we'll just have to watch it together. But our sense is that it hasn't been a, the 15%, even with the 15% we've seen, we continued to see supply come in from Canada so we don't see, we don't anticipate a significant change when the tariff changes on a monthly basis.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just quickly following up on the view on western logs and the fire restrictions, can you give maybe a sense, I mean have you started to see any tension in the markets at all yet? I appreciate what you are saying that it will play out more in August, but can you give a sense maybe your July pricing versus your second-quarter average? Has there been any movement yet?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It takes a little bit of time for that to flow through, Gail, but I don't think there's any doubt that there is tightness in the market. And that's just going to increase as these fire restrictions continue. So, as we said, as Patty said and I alluded to, both in Japan and in western domestic, we anticipate prices increasing in the third quarter versus the second. And we're starting to see signs of that.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just switching gears to capital allocation, you have obviously exhausted basically 85% of the existing buyback authorization. Can you just give us some thoughts and perspective on how the board might be thinking about incremental allocation dividend buyback moving forward?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so in terms of capital allocation, first and foremost, our number one priority is returning cash to shareholders. As we've said, that's primarily going to be through a growing and sustainable dividend. In addition, we'll look to use share repurchase as a tool where appropriate. As we look forward, we'll continue to work with our board regarding our dividend. I can tell you, as you know, we've constantly raised our dividend over the past few years. And as I said, we'll work with our board to determine the appropriate dividend level going forward.","In terms of share repurchase, as you said, we are approaching the completion of our $700 million authorization, and we'll work with the board on that issue going forward. As we've also said, we think long term the appropriate level of cash on our balance sheet is somewhere in the $300 million to $500 million range, and we are significantly above that at this time.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Just one quick follow-up on that. With the recent share price decline, do you think that's something that the board may kind of factor into its thinking?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think the board looks at lots of factors in determining the appropriate balance between dividends and share repurchase. And that clearly would be a factor that the board would in fact consider.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I just wanted to come back to wood products. Your lumber EWP margins look quite good, especially relative to peers. Can you talk about what you're seeing and what has been the key driver there?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm sorry. I might have to ask you to repeat the question. You're cutting out a little bit on our end.","Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","I'm sorry. I wanted to ask about the lumber EWP margins. They look pretty good relative \u2013 especially relative to your peers this quarter. So I just wanted to understand what has been the key driver and what you are seeing?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, in terms of lumber, we were encouraged by the margins this quarter. And I think what you saw there is a combination of OpEx efforts and lower log cost that pretty much are almost \u2013 completely offset the decline in prices in the quarter. So, we're continuing to make progress on our OpEx, and that is showing up in our bottom line. And we saw some of the benefit of that in the second quarter","Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","That's helpful. And just one more, switching gears to timberlands. Can you talk a little bit about your offshore timberlands in Uruguay and how you think about it?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So we have 300,000 acres of timberlands in Uruguay. It's about half pine and about half eucalyptus. I was down there not too long ago, and very fertile ground and the trees grow very quickly. So, it's been \u2013 we don't have many mature trees at this point. It's still fairly early in the rotation and we're spending a lot of time figuring out exactly the best way to monetize those trees through manufacturing going forward.","Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And that's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Good morning, everyone.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Chip.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Doyle, I would imagine you and Patty, all of you all, are pretty pleased with the engineered wood products result. Would you say it's kind of gotten into the zone of where you were hoping it would be when you embarked on a lot of your initiatives a couple of years ago, and if not, how much further do you think we need to see that improve?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Thanks for your comment, Chip. And we are pleased with the progress that we've made in EWP. But we still have more work to do. But the key three \u2013 three key drivers that we've seen to get us to where we are today is continuing to reduce our controllable manufacturing costs through OpEx, some lower SG&A cost and then growing profitable sales. So, to your question, we are absolutely very pleased, our team they have done a really nice job. But we're not taking our foot off the accelerator. We're going to continue to do things to improve that business going forward.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. And then when you look at the Distribution business, I know it tends to not really \u2013 it tends to always below margin, but sometimes it's hard to know what's going on below the surface. Would you say that's equally along the path as EWP is, or does it still maybe have a little bit further to go versus EWP?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. It clearly has further to go, Chip, versus EWP. So, we are making a progress there. But frankly, we're behind schedule. I can tell you a portion of that was primarily due to some adverse weather we had in some of our key markets like Texas and Denver. But get to our OpEx goals for the quarter, we're going to have to hustle. We're going to have to have good execution in the second half of the year. And we're well positioned to capitalize on markets as they continue to improve. But clearly, we're not as far along in distribution as we are in EWP and still have some work to do.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Great. Very helpful. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details, and congrats on the operational excellence again. I guess the first question I had, can you comment as to what roughly you would have in your guidance thus far for the third quarter for wood product pricing? Would prices have to rise above the current run rate or the \u2013 clearly the second quarter average, and if so could you put a bracket on what kind of growth rate we'd need to see in pricing from here?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","George, where we are currently is \u2013 prices are up. So, quarter-to-date, prices are up versus the second quarter average. So, lumber prices for us are up roughly $10 versus the second quarter average. And OSB prices are up roughly $5. As Patty said in her comments, we anticipate prices will move up from this point forward, but we'll all watch that together. But because of the reasons I've said earlier, primarily driven by improving demand is our best guess and it is a guess, but it's our best guess that we'll see prices move up for the \u2013 somewhat for the balance of the quarter versus where they are today. But we are currently higher than where \u2013 than the second quarter average.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough, Doyle.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. And I think the price...","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, Patty. How are you?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. When you think about prices in the month of July, they actually came down. So, we had a little bit of rally late in the second quarter in June, and then about after the 4 of July holiday, prices started to tick back down. So, the average that Doyle was giving you for July is actually a little higher than where they would be with midweek print randomly. But we do anticipate, for all the reasons that Doyle said that those prices will be going back up.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, to summarize, third quarter is a decent start on an average basis, but the markets would need to see more movement, more progress relative to what you have embedded in your guidance. Is that fair?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's generally fair. Yes.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. All right, thanks, Doyle. In terms of the mills, can you tell us where you think you are on the cost curve? Recognizing that we're not at \u2013 hopefully, at the precipice of a recession. I know one of the goals in the past has been to get all the mills in the Wood Products business, as much as possible, to cash break even so that when you do get into a downturn you won't be losing cash. So where do you stand in terms of getting the mills to where you want them to be on the cost curve and positioned both versus competitors and versus the macro?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So, as you said, George, our goal is just as we say around here, be black at the bottom and that's the cost structure that we're putting in place in our Wood Products facilities. We've made progress but we've still got work to do. We've laid out specific OpEx targets. And like I said, we're making good progress on those, but by the end of this year, we'll met our 2015 targets but we've still got additional work that needs to be done over the next two to three years to get our cost structure where ultimately it needs to be, to be black at the bottom, fully capitalized on the this upturn and maybe most importantly outperform our competitors on an ongoing basis going forward. So, progress made, still lots of work to do.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Fair enough. Doyle, last question and then I'll turn it over. If we look at the pulp mills, and again, we're down the pike in terms of the 18-month maintenance cycle being brought in now maybe a couple of years, what continue to be the learnings that you are getting from this? How the mills come up after maintenance? Anything that you would tweak with the strategy on a going-forward basis? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you. So, George, I would tell you that the 18 month outage plan has been a success for us. When you take mills down, it can be difficult to bring them back up. We saw that in the first quarter as we talked about. But that occurs whether it's down over 12 months or down every 18 month. So, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on the 18 months schedule and we think that has been a net benefit to our company and to our shareholders.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Is there a particular challenge when you go up 18 months versus 12 months, or really no difference?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know I wouldn't say there is no difference, George, but you still got to take \u2013 as you and I talked about last quarter, taking these mills down and starting them back up, there is always challenges associated with that, and it may be a little more challenging if it's 18 versus 12, but we haven't seen anything systematic or systemic that makes it harder. You just got unique challenges with each one of these mills as you take them down and bring them back up. And some of them go really, really well. And some of ours have gone well and some of them, you have challenges.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Well, thanks. Congrats \u2013 go ahead, Patty.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","George, when we look at our \u2013 and I think Flint River is a good example of that. It was not only a factor of taking a mill down for maintenance, but we were also installing some really very beneficial equipment around energy costs. And so, it's the combination of all those things. But I think it is important to your question that as we've gone through this process, there are learnings, and I would call them only tweaks that you get from just the maintenance, which is a very important piece in our Cellulose Fibers business. So, we are capitalizing on looking at the learnings as we take a mill down and bring it back up to factor that into our maintenance going forward, and that's part of our operational excellence.","George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks for the thoughts. Congrats on the quarter and good luck going forward.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, George.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark?","Operator","Mark, please make sure your line is not on mute.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello, Mark.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Why don't we take the next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes, good morning. Thanks. I just had a question I guess lumber and OSB prices. I guess they ticked down recently. I know it's not a big decrease, but is there anything you can point to that's maybe driving that drop?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You know, I think it really is just the factors that Doyle went through. We've had weaker demand from Asia, which impacts the exports that come out of Canada. We've had some changes in currency that put some headwinds there. And then I think, notwithstanding the fact that housing has been ticking up of late in terms of people have reiterated their full-year guidance for the year. The first half was a little disappointing in terms of where we thought things would be. So, as we look at housing for the second half, our guidance really hasn't changed. And since we didn't have a great response in the first half, that would bode for the second half being better. But as Doyle said, we'll have to wait and see. There's just a lot of moving parts out there with all of this, so.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then just, I know it's still early, but I think you mentioned CapEx of $500 million this year. Can you give a rough sense of a range where it could be for next year?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We really don't have a range for next year that we would give in terms of guidance at this point, Tyler. We'll do that as we approach year-end. But one thing that I would say about the projects that we're putting in, and the $500 million is a little higher than where we've been historically. But we've got some great Wood Products projects that are underway that I think will pay additional dividends as we look at bringing our costs down across that system. So, really excited about the projects that we are spending that money on, but a little too soon to tell you exactly what we'd be doing for next year.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just a last question, southern seller prices I know, I think last quarter you were looking for maybe a, it was 3% to 4% increase. Prices have been generally flat. Do you think it's more realistic that prices are flat for this year?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Tyler, we still anticipate that southern prices will be up kind of in line with what they've been up over the past couple of years, which would be somewhere in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year.","Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Steve.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Steve.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","So, if I'm not mistaken, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations should conclude today, and I don't think it's a highly visible piece of the puzzle, but Canada's effective ban on log exports is part of the equation. That's mainly BC, obviously. So but if BC was compelled to export logs, can you tell us how that would impact your Pacific Northwest operations?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As we look at that, Steve, we'll just have to see how that actually plays out in terms of what the final resolution will be. So, difficult for us really to tell what that result is.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","Has it been on your radar, clearly, Canada is a big supplier of sawn lumber. So, are there ports, for instance, conducive to log ships as opposed to lumber ships?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It is something that we have tracked, but it's not something that I would say we have a comment that we'd make about in terms of ports at this point.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.","All right. Thank you, Patty.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You bet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Hopefully, you can hear me this time. I apologize.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We can hear you.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Go ahead.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Great. So first question is, it's around but not really about transfer pricing. I'm curious whether your internal log prices to your West Coast lumber operations were up a similar amount to your outside log sales. Obviously, there's going to be a mix and other difference. I'm just curious how they tend to track, understanding mix and geographic differences.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Mark, just to be clear, your question is related to how we do transfer pricing to our docks?","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Well, you mentioned that external log sales realizations are up. And I'm curious whether your internal log costs are up by a similar amount, and whether those two things tend to track over time. I'm not asking whether you do transfer pricing, honestly. Obviously you do.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, they are correlated because they all come from the same geographies. There is a different mix however, as you think about what we would send exports, for example to Japan versus the grade that our domestic sawmills would use. So, directionally, they usually do track but they will not be similar absolute pricing because of the grade mix.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. It's just what I was looking for. And second quick question. Does the U.S. dollar strength increase your relative interest in overseas timberland acquisitions?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, as we've said before, we are looking to grow our Timberland. We think our biggest opportunities will be domestic whether it'd be in the South or the Pacific Northwest. We'll also continue to look internationally but we're going to make sure that we appropriately risk adjust any acquisition that we would make internationally. So, that's kind of generally the way we think about it. Currencies don't move up. Currency is going to move down. So, we won't overemphasize that in any decision we may make versus acquisitions.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Very helpful, Doyle. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, Doyle and Patty.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Collin.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","I guess my first question, just Patty, as it goes back to the guidance significantly increased results in the Cellulose Fibers business. I think, Patty, you indicated in the prepared remarks that would be above last year's 3Q, so could we see that bounce all the way back up to, call it, about the $90 million or so figure that you posted a few quarters last year, or is that a bit too optimistic?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","You're probably just a little optimistic there, Collin. If you kind of think about guidance for the Cellulose Fibers business, we were at $27 million, I believe, in the second quarter. We've got 46 days in the second quarter and, probably, less than a handful in the third quarter. So, between the maintenance expense and better productivity as we run more days, I would say that's probably going to be around just to give you some sense around the $45-ish million number. We said we will have likely lower realizations. But I would expect that to be offset by some higher volumes as well as some additional potential for cost improvement in other ways. So, I think that will help you get a little bit in the ZIP code. I think $90 million \u2013 love to have $90 million, but that might be a little optimistic at this point.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. No. That's very helpful. And I guess also, Patty, just going back to Tyler's question, just thinking about the CapEx, I know it's obviously too early for 2016, but the comments as far as kind of the ramp-up over the last couple of years, should we view the $500 million as kind of a high-watermark, or do you think there's still the potential to see a higher number at some point as you continue to invest in your mills?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think you would think about $500 million as being closer to the high watermark, Collin. I don't think we'd be looking at something that's significantly above that. I think last year in 2014, we were around in the $400 million, maybe $450 million. So, we have ramped that up a little bit. But I wouldn't see us being significantly above $500 million for 2016.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then I guess just the last question, kind of going back to Gail's question earlier, just about the share repurchases. One thing that surprised me a little bit during the quarter was that there was a moderation in repurchase activity relative to 1Q, particularly in context of the drop in the share price. Anything that we should read into that or any sort of restrictions on preventing you to buy back stock during a period of the quarter? Or just can you put any additional color around that?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Collin, there is nothing that should be read into that. That's just where it ended up for the quarter under our program and we'll continue to report on a quarterly basis our progress going forward.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Great. Good luck during the quarter, guys.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Doyle R.

Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Doyle and Patty. Just a question for Doyle. You've been running Weyerhaeuser for a couple of years now, and you've had operational excellence in place for quite a bit of that time. Just wondering if you're happy with the current portfolio of assets? And besides timberlands, what business segment looks good for growth?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, Collin on \u2013 I mean Paul on your first point on OpEx, we're encouraged by the progress we've made there. Still more work to do. In terms of opportunities to grow our portfolio going forward. We've consistently said, I think now, over the last couple of years, that we think our biggest opportunity to grow will be in Timberlands. But we would look at growing other parts of our company as well, if we can find appropriate growth opportunities that meet our hurdle requirements and drive value for shareholders.","So, that's generally how we think about growth going forward. The beauty of it is we don't have to grow to be successful. But if we \u2013 so we can be very disciplined, we have been and will continue to be.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the conference over to Kathryn McAuley, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Ms. McAuley, you may begin your conference.","Kathryn F. McAuley","Good morning. Thank you for joining us on Weyerhaeuser's Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. The earnings release, analyst package and web slides of this call can be found at our website or by contacting April Meier at (253) 924-2937. Please review the warning statement in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. Joining me this morning is Dan Fulton, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. ","Please turn to the earnings information package available on our website. As summarized on Chart 1 on the package, this morning, Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter 2011 net earnings of $65 million or $0.12 per diluted share. Our net sales from continuing operations of $1.6 billion. Earnings for the fourth quarter included net after-tax charges of $12 million for restructuring and asset impairments. Excluding these items, the company reported net earnings of $77 million or $0.14 per diluted share. ","For the full year 2011, the company reported net earnings of $331 million or $0.61 per diluted share and net sales from continuing operations of $6.2 billion. A GAAP reconciliation on special items can be found on Charts 2 and 3. In the following discussion of the business segments, I will refer to Charts 4 through 10. ","Turning to Chart 4. This illustrates the change in contribution by business segment from third quarter 2011 to fourth quarter 2011. My comments reviewing the fourth quarter refer to changes from the third quarter unless otherwise noted. We begin our business segment discussion of the fourth quarter with Timberlands, Charts 5 and 6. ","Timberlands contributed $70 million to pretax earnings, $8 million more than Q3. Earnings from the disposition of nonstrategic timberlands increased $17 million to $21 million. Fee harvest volumes rose 2% in the West and 5% in the South. Log prices declined 4% in the West, due to weaker Chinese demand. Log prices were slightly higher in the South. Road and silviculture costs were seasonally lower, fuel costs were higher. ","Wood Products, Charts 7 and 8. In the seasonally weak fourth quarter, Wood Products lost $61 million, $18 million more than in Q3 but less than in the fourth quarter of 2010. Sales volume seasonally declined. Lumber, 8%; oriented strand board, 6%; and engineered Wood Products, 12%. As illustrated on Chart 8, price realizations for most products were lower. Lumber and oriented strand board prices decreased 2%; engineered solid section prices declined 4%, and engineered I-Joist prices were 1% lower. ","Operating rates were lower in response to weaker market demand. Downtime across all product lines increased from 12 weeks in Q3 to 47 weeks in Q4. Unit manufacturing costs were higher due to market downtime. ","Cellulose Fibers, Chart 9. The pretax contribution to earnings in fourth quarter was $134 million, $1 million less than in Q3. Average pulp price realizations declined 3% or $25 per air-dried symmetric ton. Pulp sale volumes increased 10%. There were no annual maintenance outages in the quarter. ","Real Estate, Chart 10. Real Estate contributed $41 million to pretax earnings, $31 million more than in third quarter. Earnings were also higher than in Q4 2010. Single-family home closings seasonally increased 15% from Q3 to 582 homes. Year-over-year closings declined 4%. The average price on homes closed decreased $5,000 from the third quarter. This reduction was due to mix. ","The single-family gross margin was 25.4%, an increase from 23% in Q3, but lower than the gross margin of 26.1% in the year-ago quarter. Land sales contributed $19 million in earnings. ","In Corporate & Other. Corporate & Other was $6 million lower in Q4. Gains on foreign exchange were more than offset by increased charges for share-based compensation and other items. ","I will now turn the call over to Dan Fulton. Dan?","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Kathy, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. Despite continued economic challenges, our company took full advantage of every opportunity to improve our overall performance during the last quarter and the entire year, and I'm pleased with our overall results. ","In my remarks this morning, I'll provide some highlights of our fourth quarter results for each business segment, as well as observations on overall performance for the year. I'll also provide my perspective for the year ahead. Patty will then present our first quarter outlook as well as financial highlights, and then I'll add a few more remarks before turning to your questions. ","First, before commenting on the fourth quarter, I want to set the context for the full year 2011. As we entered the year, I told you that we were basing our plans for the year on an assumption that we would begin to see some recovery in U.S. housing, we targeted a level of 525,000 single-family housing starts, which would have been an 11% increase from the 2010 level of 471,000. Unfortunately, we never experienced the eagerly awaited spring selling season. And single-family starts ended the year at 429,000, even lower than 2010 and 18% short of our forecast. ","Offsetting this negative drag from lower-than-anticipated housing activity was the continued positive strength in our Cellulose Fibers markets for most of the year, plus increased opportunities for log exports to China during the first part of the year. ","The other major surprise during the year was the devastating earthquake and tsunami which hit Japan on March 11. Though we suffered immediate short-term disruption to our export sales of logs, lumber and cellulose fibers, we were able to work through this extreme upset condition with minimal impact. This was mostly due to the extraordinary efforts of our team in Japan, which worked so effectively to meet the needs of our customers. ","Now let's shift to a discussion of the accomplishments of each business segment in the past year. In Timberlands, the stronger export markets for the year helped to offset continued weakness in U.S. demand. We fully leveraged our long-term export relationships and our logistically advantaged Western Timberlands to use these markets to increase earnings over last year. ","Harvest levels for the full year increased 19% in both the West and the South. Increases in the West were primarily related to increased export sales, while increases in the South were primarily the result of increased emphasis on third-party sales. ","Log exports are an integral part of our Timberlands business, providing valuable market diversification. In 2010, exports represented approximately 60% of our third-party sales volume from our Western lands. We spoke throughout the year about the significant impact of increased demand for logs from China. We were able to quickly respond, as this opportunity emerged, using all of our competitive strengths in the log export market, including harvesting, hauling, board access, and sales and marketing relationships. ","While maintaining historic volumes to our largest long-term customers in Japan, we added additional volume to meet increased China demand, resulting in a slight shift in mix among our Asian markets. In the fourth quarter, export volume decreased from the third quarter as a result of an anticipated slowdown on exports to China. For the full year, however, overall export volume was up, coupled with an increase in realizations. ","In addition to log sales, we generate income from our lands from a variety of sources, including mineral rights, recreational leases and biomass. Our minerals revenue was lower in the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. Production levels of natural gas dropped in response to lower prices. Reported revenue from lease fees declined as fees collected in prior years were fully amortized. ","Turning to Wood Products, a business that was challenging enough before the 2011 slowdown in housing. We maintained our focus on using all available levers to improve cash flow and profitability. In the seasonally slow fourth quarter, we experienced soft market conditions with lower prices and reduced volumes. We responded by taking more market downtime. ","For the full year, taking into consideration adverse market factors, we improved performance in areas that we can control. For the year, we were able to offset the significant negative effect of lower prices and higher log and freight costs with performance improvements in a number of areas across our business. Our ongoing improvement efforts reduced manufacturing and related costs over $100 million, and we reduced SG&A by nearly $60 million. ","In addition to our focus on reducing costs and selectively increasing price for certain products, we added new customers. We also expanded our sales in select geographic markets, including sales of Canadian lumber to meet growing Chinese demand. ","In Real Estate, we continue to pursue our strategy as a regional builder and land developer, adapting to individual market conditions and diverse customer needs. For the second consecutive year, was profitable, which is strong performance relative to our competitors. Despite a decline in closings for the year, consistent with the overall market decline, our strong margins held firm helped by mix. ","In the fourth quarter, traditionally our strongest, as homes sold earlier in the year are delivered to customers, we had profitable quarter that included earnings from both home closings and land sales. Land sales historically represent about 10% of our total Real Estate revenues though timing throughout the year can be a bit uneven. In the fourth quarter, land sales represented a higher percentage of our revenue than normal, but were in line with our historic averages for the full year. ","During the quarter, we experienced lower traffic year-over-year, but conversion rates of perspective buyers improved. As we approached year end in November and December, we had an encouraging pickup in sales, about a 5% increase over the same period last year. This positive momentum is carried into the new year, as sales for the first 5 weeks of the year are up an average of 16% over last year. ","Though individual market conditions vary, that 5 weeks does not establish a longer-term trend, maybe we're beginning to see some green shoots in the market for new homes. ","In Cellulose Fibers, as expected, we experienced slowing conditions during the fourth quarter as market inventories increased and prices came under pressure. Our realizations were down, which was offset with increased volume, resulting in earnings approximately equal to our strong third quarter. ","For the full year, this marks the second consecutive year of record earnings for Cellulose Fibers, a strong performance given more challenging market conditions. All products contributed to this success as we maintained our focus on operational excellence, product innovation and meeting the needs of our customers. ","Before turning the call over to Patty, let me provide some context for our outlook for the upcoming year. As we entered 2012, we still face an uncertain environment. December's reported unemployment level improved slightly over one year ago, so we're moving in the right direction, but progress is slow. This morning's report shows some additional slight improvement. ","Consumer confidence is still very weak and though somewhat improved at year end, it is still languishing near the low levels seen in 2008 and 2009. Uncertainty about the pace of housing recovery is still high. Structural issues in the mortgage market are not resolved, and the direction of prices is not clear. ","The good news on the housing front for me is that the Fed clearly is now engaged on this issue. This may generate some increased attention to the critical role that housing must play in the overall recovery of our national economy. ","With this backdrop, we're basing our 2012 plans on 665,000 total housing starts, 455,000 single-family, which is a modest 6% increase over 2011 plus 2,000 -- 210,000 multifamily. We consider this to be a conservative assumption, and there are certainly some who are more optimistic. Given our experience in 2011, we're planning cautiously while being prepared to flex up if we have the opportunity. ","For Timberlands, we're planning to increase harvest levels approximately in line with our forecasted increase in housing starts. Most of this increase will occur in the South, where we also had an increase in third-party sales. In 2012, we continue to play to our strength in export markets, plus take advantage of opportunities for other revenue, including minerals and biomass. We expect natural gas prices to remain low, but we had some opportunities in the Tuscaloosa Basin Shale oil play where we leased land in 2011 for exploratory activity. ","With respect to biomass as a renewable fuel, we're position to respond to market demand in the U.S. as well as overseas if public policy supports this renewable fuel resource. ","In Wood Products in 2012, we'll focus on continued improvement to reduce cost and increase revenues, introducing new products, funding our customer base and improving our relative competitiveness. As market conditions improve, we have the production capacity to respond quickly to meet customer needs. ","In WRECO, we expect to increase volume at pace with the overall housing recovery, but we believe that public builders such as ourselves have an opportunity to increase share over the next several years given our land base and our access to construction capital. We'll anticipate what today's homebuyers want and respond quickly with appealing new homes in great communities, leveraging our regional value propositions and industry-leading customer satisfaction. As the market begins to pick up, our land position gives us the capacity to increase home production, plus we're poised to sell desirable lots to land short builders as part of our long-term strategy. ","In Cellulose Fibers, we'll continue to focus on what we consider the basics: Continuously improving manufacturing excellence; carefully targeting capital expenditures to lower costs and increase volume; and developing innovative new products to meet the needs of our strategic, growing global customers. ","And now I'll turn the call over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook, as well as provide financial highlights. Patty?","Patricia Bedient","Thanks, Dan, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the first quarter by business segment is summarized on Chart 11. I'll begin the outlook discussion with Timberlands. ","In the West, fee harvest volumes will likely increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. We are expecting a higher mix of logs to Japan versus China, which should result in a higher sales realization for export logs as our Japanese customers buy our premium-grade logs. Domestic log prices in the West are anticipated to decrease slightly. ","Dan mentioned earlier that fee harvest volumes in the South are projected to increase for the full year of 2012 compared to 2011. However, fee harvest volume in the first quarter should be similar to the fourth quarter, as typically the first quarter is seasonally our lowest volume quarter. Prices will likely be flat quarter-to-quarter, although we anticipate a slightly positive mix variance. Costs are expected to increase due to higher silvicultural spending in the South, and diesel fuel costs will likely be higher across our geographies. ","Nonstrategic land sales are expected to be lower compared to the fourth quarter, but the timing of these sales is often difficult to forecast. Excluding the effect of nonstrategic land sales, overall Timberland earnings in the first quarter are expected to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. ","In Wood Products, lumber prices are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth. Oriented strand board pricing is anticipated to increase over 5%. However, pricing for both product lines is anticipated to be lower than the first quarter of 2011. Volume for both product lines should be -- should increase over 5% compared to the first -- compared to the fourth quarter. ","Engineered Wood Product prices are anticipated to be relatively flat, while volumes are expected to increase. Log costs in the South and Canada are expected to be higher, offset by lower log costs in the West. Operating rates will likely be higher across all product lines as manufacturing resumed to normal operations after the market and holiday downtime in the fourth quarter. ","As is typical of the first quarter, we anticipate a seasonal working capital build, and we will continue our sharp focus of matching supply with demand. We expect that our loss in Wood Products will narrow in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and be similar to the first quarter of 2011. Lower prices and higher freight costs compared to Q1 2001, are anticipated to offset our improving sales volume and operating rates. ","In Cellulose Fibers, we expect significantly lower realizations for pulp in the first quarter, driven by the continued economic uncertainty in global markets and high inventories worldwide. Shipment volumes are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth. This quarter, we will also have increased maintenance cost and lower production as a result of more scheduled annual maintenance compared to the fourth quarter, when there were no scheduled maintenance outages. We expect cost for chemicals, fuel and energy to be higher due to the planned outages. Also, fuel and energy cost will increase due to the winter season. Overall, we expect to considerably lower earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment in the first quarter compared to the fourth. ","In our Real Estate segment, the first quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter of the year for home closings. In addition, we continue to battle the headwinds of continued challenging economic conditions and mortgage qualification hurdles for home buyers. We expect approximately 360 single-family home closings compared to 582 in the fourth. Prices are expected to be lower, with margins in the high teens, down from margins of 25% in the fourth quarter due to a shift in market and product mix. ","On the encouraging sign, as Dan mentioned, we have seen stronger sales during the month of January compared to last year, but these will not affect first quarter earnings as the closings for these sales would typically occur later in the year. Excluding any earnings from potential land sales, we expect a loss in our Real Estate segment in the first quarter. ","Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. At the end of the fourth quarter, we had cash of $953 million. Debt declined to under $4.5 billion as we reduced debt by over $30 million during the fourth quarter. Our total debt maturities over the next 5 years are approximately $600 million, with about $188 million of that due in 2012. ","In addition, we have a $1 billion credit facility that has no borrowings outstanding. So as a result, we continue to have solid liquidity. The underfunded status of our pension and other postretirement plans increased by approximately $540 million compared to this time last year. This was largely due to changes in actuarial assumptions, the largest of which was the lowering of the discount rate. ","For example, in our U.S. qualified pension plan, which is our largest plan, the discount rate decreased by 90 basis points and is now at 4.5%. Reductions in future benefit payments as a result of planned amendments to our other postretirement benefit plans decreased the overall liability. ","Based on the funded status of our U.S. qualified pension plan, as of yearend 2011, we estimate that we will have a cash contribution of up to $60 million. This payment is not due until September of 2013. No cash contribution was required for this plan in 2011. Contributions in 2012 for the remaining plans, which include our Canadian registered pension plans, our nonqualified pension plans, as well as other postretirement benefit payments, will be similar to the amounts contributed in 2011 for a total of approximately $140 million. ","During 2011, we had capital expenditures of approximately $240 million. During 2012, we expect to spend in the range of $260 million to $290 million. ","Now I'll turn the call back to Dan and I look forward to your questions.","Daniel S. Fulton","Thanks, Patty. As I conclude my remarks this morning, I'd like to end where I started. I'm pleased with our performance in the context of the challenging market conditions that we faced in 2011, but I'm not satisfied. Given the level of uncertainty in our markets, for 2012, we're planning conservatively while maintaining readiness and looking forward to the opportunity to flex up to meet increased demand. All of us in Weyerhaeuser are committed to taking full advantage of every opportunity to improve our overall performance and to safely deliver the sustainable results that you expect and deserve. ","And now we welcome your questions. Kathy?","Kathryn F. McAuley","Carrie, would you please open the floor for questions?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","In Wood Products, your initial goal last year was to be cash positive, and obviously, the market became much more challenging later in the year. Can you share with us how you're thinking about the Wood Products business reaching cash flow positive or being operating income positive in 2012?","Daniel S. Fulton","Yes, Anthony. As you note, we ended up in 2011 encountering a more difficult market than 2010. Nevertheless, we made a significant number of improvements, as I noted, throughout the year, both in improving operating costs as well as reducing SG&A, which helped to offset declines in prices and increases in costs such as logs and freight. As we look forward into 2012, we continue the ongoing improvement efforts in every single one of our businesses. As I noted, we're focused on improving revenues where we have the opportunities to obtain higher prices for certain products. We're adding new customers. Our efforts in terms of cost reduction, touch every single one of our operating businesses, lumber oriented strand board, engineered Wood Products, and distribution. And at this point, given our outlook for housing at the level that we are projecting today, we have an expectation that for the full year, we would be EBITDA positive and cash flow neutral. We continue to, as I noted in my remarks, use all levers that we have. I'm encouraged by the improvement and our focus continues to be to improve profitability at today's level of starts and then be able to take advantage of the upside leverage that comes with an improving market.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just a question on capital expenditures. I think on the last call, you had guided to about $100 million in the quarter, which would've brought you kind of closer to that $250 million to $270 million range that you had earlier guided to. And I guess you ended up a little bit short of that. And I was just wondering if you could give us any color on any projects or investments that, maybe, you've slowed back or pushed back a little?","Daniel S. Fulton","It's fundamentally timing difference, Anthony. We haven't changed the scope of the products or the projects. As we move into 2012, our CapEx continues to include reforestation expense, road work in the woods in order to open up lands for harvest. And the most significant capital expenditures continue to be in our Cellulose Fibers business, where we focus our improvements on projects that reduce costs, that have added benefit, in many cases, of improving volume and continue to move us forward towards a maintenance schedule in our Cellulose Fibers facilities where we will be stretching out our -- what has been our annual maintenance over the next 2 to 3 years to an 18-month schedule.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","First question is on the -- if you could just give us a roadmap to think about pulp or, I'm sorry, for the Cellulose business this year. Especially given the downtime, I know you normally, I believe, have that heaviest in the second and the third is sort of when you let it rip, so to speak. And should we see similar pattern this year? And, I guess, if you look at last year, the profit sequentially in the first were off about 38% without the prices falling, so I would guess you're expecting it to be a deeper drop in the first quarter this year even though we're seeing signs of it turning up later. Could you -- if you could comment on that as well, I'd appreciate it.","Patricia Bedient","Sure, Chip. If you compare the first quarter of this year to the first quarter of 2011, the mills that will be taking their annual outages will be similar. But the length of the outages is going to be somewhat extended, both to allow us for some completion of some capital projects, but also positioning those mills for an 18-month frequency between the plan to shut down. Now the benefit of that increased frequency will actually start to accrue in 2013. But we're setting those mills up to be in a position to do that as we take their annual maintenance shutdowns this year. So we'll have a little bit longer outages and do a little more maintenance work to prepare for that in addition to the capital project. So I would estimate that the actual maintenance spend for the quarter will be about $25 million to $30 million. Then if you factor in the lost productivity and the additional costs for chemicals, energy and fuel, I'd expect that the total dollar impact of the outages would be on the order of $45 million to $50 million. And then as you referenced, the other major difference quarter-over-quarter in the results will be lower pulp realizations, which is also likely to be around $45 million, coupled with the realizations and also a little slightly lower volume. And then we'll have some seasonally higher input costs as well. So I think that will help you dimension the change from the fourth quarter to the first. And in terms of our maintenance schedule for 2012, we had completed all of the maintenance in 2011 by the end of the second quarter. And I think our schedule actually calls for a little bit of maintenance also coming in, in the second half as those mills just change a little bit. But for the first quarter, they are very similar to last year in terms of the operations itself.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Got you. And a quick follow-up, Patty, you gave a great rundown on the pension funding situation. Could you let us know how the expense change will be at least from a GAAP book basis from '11 to '12?","Patricia Bedient","Sure. You know, Chip, I think just to reiterate, maybe if you could look at the cash flow statements that we have in the analyst package. So on Page 3, we break out in the cash flow from operations on 2 separate line items the impact of cash contributions, as well as the non-cash charge that goes through the income statement for pension and other postretirement benefits. So let me just start with the cash impact to reiterate that. So I'm looking at the line item, which is 2 lines up from net cash from operations, and it's titled Pension and Postretirement Contributions. So you see that we had $143 million that we contributed in 2011. We would expect that those contributions for the plans that I mentioned in my remarks would be similar in 2012 or about $140 million. Now that doesn't include the U.S. qualified pension plan, which did not have a contribution due in 2011. Based on the funded status at the end of this year, we would estimate that the cash contribution would be about $60 million, and we would not need to make that contribution until September of 2013. We certainly have the discretion to make it earlier if we want, but it's not due until September of 2013. Now let me address your other question, which is the difference in the book expense on a GAAP basis. So if you go a little further up the page from where we were before, you'll see a line item called Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits under the Non-cash Charges to Income. So in 2011 for the full year, that number was $81 million. The comparable number for 2012 is about $115 million. Offsetting the $115 million though, we will have amortization of the changes that we made in some of our postretirement benefit plans at the end of the year. So we made some amendments to those changes or to those plans, and we'll be amortizing those in 2012, and that will just about offset that $115 million. But, I think it's a little more than $115 million. But they just about offset each other. We will call those out as special items in 2012, but that's the way that the expense will flow through the income statement.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just on pulp realizations for a moment. Patty, that was just very helpful guidance. I'm just wondering what you're expecting to recognize in the first quarter. Do you think that would represent a trough or would you expect kind of further erosion as contracts recognize pricing that's already been published?","Patricia Bedient","Well, as prices came down through the fourth quarter and certainly softened into the first quarter, but we would expect that they are pretty much at a bottom at this point, and wouldn't expect further erosion coming out of the quarter.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And would you be seeing any signs that the markets could recover over the next quarter or 2? Or do you think it could stay at this level for a while?","Patricia Bedient","That's really hard to speculate. We usually just limit the guidance to the first quarter in terms of the outlook. But I think, we have, as I said, starting to see some stabilization in that pulp price.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then can you give us a little bit of color, that pickup that you're seeing in housing activity so far this year? Is that any different as across the regions than what you operate or is it pretty broad-based?","Daniel S. Fulton","Could you ask it one more time? I've got a little bit of a bad connection with you.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sorry. The improvement you're seeing in your Homebuilding business so far this year, is that -- any differences in what you're seeing in trend across the various regions or is it pretty universal?","Daniel S. Fulton","Well, it does vary by region. And as I noted in my comments, it's a little bit difficult to extrapolate from 5 weeks. However, I've made a point, a number of years in the past, that we normally don't see a pickup in housing until after the Super Bowl. So it's actually encouraging that we've got some increase in activity during January. We're seeing more strength in the Phoenix market, in the Pacific Northwest. Texas continues to be very strong. We've seen a little bit of softening in the Washington D.C. area, which was stronger during 2011. And in Las Vegas, we're still relatively challenged. We're seeing a bit of a pickup in all of Southern California, with the exception of LA County. So it's a bit mixed, but for the first 5 weeks overall, we're encouraged. That mix will translate to differences in margins as we go forward. So last year, we did have increased sales in all of our markets with the exception of Nevada and California. And California especially is our strong margin market, and so that's some of the mix change that Patty's talking about as she provides an outlook for the first quarter. So we're encouraged and we'll track it through the balance of the quarter and look forward to on the next call being able to update you.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one last super quick question. Patty, can you give a little guidance on the tax rate in the first quarter and for 2012?","Patricia Bedient","Sure. I think the way to think about the tax rate, Gail, is really it's not only just the rate but, it's also the mix of income between the REIT and the TRS. So as you think about our Timberlands business, most of that income is at the REIT, so no tax would be applied to that. And then for the TRS, the income which also would include not only the TRS businesses but also the interest expense, you would think about a tax rate of around 35%.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Wilde of Deutsche Bank.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Patty, can you talk -- just following-up on the head tax rate question. Can you give us a little color on tax rate in the fourth quarter?","Patricia Bedient","Sure. As you think about the rate itself, there's a couple of things impacting that fourth quarter. So one, of course, is the mix of income that I just mentioned. We actually also had a special item that we exclude as we talk about our results. So for the full quarter, quarter 4, we actually had a tax benefit of about $10 million. And most of that was a result of the special item of $19 million, tax-affected would be around $7 million or $8 million. So most of that is the result of that additional benefit, that when we talk about our earnings, we exclude as a special item. Then if you think about the mix of income, as I talked about before for the quarter, and this doesn't work exactly perfectly, but if you looked at Chart 1, for example, you'll see that our earnings, pretax earnings before special items was about $160 million. You subtract from that the Timberlands earnings of $70 million and also subtract from it the interest expense of $88 million, and you get just about a push for the quarter. And then also at the fourth quarter, you have a little bit of true up not much running through the quarter. So basically, we ended up with a small benefit of about $3 million from continuing operations.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. Dan, a second question. Just in Wood Products, is there -- are there particular segments in the Wood Products business that you would regard as sort of the biggest challenges for you in getting to cash breakeven? Or is it really just kind of a question of better volume across the whole system?","Daniel S. Fulton","The markets to which our products flow has some impact on this, Mark. So lumber, where we have the broadest set of markets, it certainly flows into new home construction, but it's also runs to the repair and remodel market. And so we are less dependent on single-family new home constructions. Our oriented strand board product is used in new home construction but also some portion of that runs through the repair and remodel market. And then when you go to engineered Wood Products, that has a lot heavier concentration in new home construction. And so our challenges for Engineered Wood Products, which also I would couple that with our distribution business, because there's a good portion of our engineered material that flows through our distribution business is reliant on a recovery in new home construction. And so if you look at our utilization rates across our facilities, they are the lowest in engineered, they are higher in OSB, and then they're the highest in lumber. Lumber also has the benefit of being able to flow to offshore markets, and there's a portion of our Canadian lumber that goes to Japan and recently China. So we will be recovering more quickly in lumber. OSB would follow on, and then I would say our Engineered Wood Products in our distribution. In our Distribution business, we picked up distribution of some third-party specialty products, they bring on some additional margin contribution, and so we're pleased with our progress there. I would say overall, once again, our goal is to get the cash breakeven with the level of starts that we have, but we have a tremendous amount of operating leverage as the market starts to recover. And this business in a recovering housing market will have the benefit of increased cash flow and in ultimately earnings.","Mark Wilde - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. I think it actually would be helpful in May when you're out here if we could give a little more color on sort of what the footprint looks like in distribution now because I know you've made some changes over the last several years. Last question I had just on the housing market, you mentioned California being the strongest margin area for you typically. Can you give us some sense of how much of that is a question of just sort of the types of homes you're building, the size of homes, and how much of that might just be from the maybe a little cost land basis in California?","Daniel S. Fulton","It is both, Mark. So California is a big state, and so we have to look at submarkets within California. Our strongest position historically with respect to earnings and margin is San Diego. San Diego, we're now the largest builder. And so we build a higher-end house that has a lot higher price point, and the margins in those homes are much higher in part because of the product that we're building, the neighborhoods in which we're building, and to some extent, our land basis. The lower margin portion of the market would be the Inland Empire, with LA County being about in the middle. So there's a significant impact on our margins overall. If San Diego was strong, and San Diego was stronger in 2011 -- I'm sorry, 2010 as compared to 2011. Now in the first 5 weeks, we're seeing sales up in San Diego, that's a real positive and we've got a strong land position from which to build in San Diego. The other high-margin market for us historically has been the Virginia and Maryland suburbs, Washington D.C. It's also a higher price point in product, and the margins there are fundamentally related to the homes that we're building in the price point rather than a low-land basis.","Operator","Your next question comes from George Staphos with Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I just want to continue on WRECO. Dan, as you think about, are there any regions where even if you do like your land basis around the country, where you are perhaps maybe less advantaged or have less ability to flex if, in fact, the market recovers more than you expect? And a related question, if I look back at the fourth quarter, your ratio of closings relative to your backlog coming into the quarter is a little bit higher than it normally would be. It's usually 90%, but a little bit higher than that. Does that have any impact on your ability to grow with the market, at least early on in 2012?","Daniel S. Fulton","Let me first address the question of our land position. As we've talked about this in the past, we have a relatively long land position as compared to many other public builders. And in large part, it's related to our value proposition and the markets in which we operate. So we generally would have a longer land position in a market that is more challenging for entitlements processing, and we have a lighter land position in markets where it's relatively easy to process land or to acquire land. So the extremes for us would be San Diego County, where it may take a decade to get property entitled, and one -- the benefit of that is that, that becomes very valuable property. And it's important to have access to land into markets like that in order to be an effective profitable builder. The other extreme would be Houston, Texas. Houston has no zoning. There's a vibrant land development community there, and historically, we're able to acquire many of our lots on a rolling option basis. And so we won't need a long land position in Houston, and then the other markets fall somewhere in between. In terms of our ability to flex, one of our challenges over the last couple of years has been to redeploy some of our land capital to markets where we may be a little bit land light. We made a conscious decision in Phoenix to sell land that we had impaired earlier in the recession because we were confident that we could obtain the land from others as the market recovered and that has been the case so far. If we had a very strong recovery in the Pacific Northwest, we might find ourselves a bit challenged to flex as much as some other markets. But we're comfortable with our land position as we look out the next 3 to 5 years in our markets, and we do have the ability to flex up in response to increased demand. But it varies by market.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. I guess the next question I had. Switching to wood, realizing that hopefully this year, operating leverage will be one of the factors that contributes to your ability to get to cash breakeven. What additional cost benefits do you have, if you will, incrementally already banked for 2012 versus 2011? Or have you realized more or less what cost benefits you had been working on in '10 and '11 within the segment? And what capacity, if we're surprised again to the upside, what capacity -- what in percentage terms could you restart, say within a couple of quarters, within lumber, within OSB to meet the market?","Daniel S. Fulton","We've been engaged in a broad process for over a year to improve performance in this business. As I've discussed it, it includes revenue improvement as well as cost reduction. Some of the cost reduction would come from reduced operating cost and input costs, some would come from increased productivity. We captured some of those improvements in 2011. We have more to come in 2012. And so I can't give you a number as to what we would have \"in the bank\" for 2012. But we're making good progress and we should expect to see more improvement in 2012. As I look at our operating rates, we operated -- in the fourth quarter, our lumber system at about 75%. OSB was running at 72%, and our Engineered Wood Products were around 30%. So we have much more room to flex it up in our engineered business as the housing market recovers. But we've got plenty of capacity in lumber, in OSB, and we're looking forward to the opportunity to test the margins when we're fully utilizing all of our facilities.","Operator","The next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","First of all, could you remind us the percentage of your wood that you sell into your facilities? And conversely, how much outside wood your mills are buying?","Daniel S. Fulton","Is this -- this is a question, Steve, around Wood Products or...","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","No. Your Timberlands obviously sell to China and to third parties, and I want to get the sense of how much they're selling to Weyerhaeuser facilities. And then are Weyerhaeuser facilities 30% beholding on your own Timberlands and buying 70% from third parties or I want to get the ratios, please?","Daniel S. Fulton","In each of our businesses, we participate in the outside market, both Timberlands and in our Wood Products facilities as well as Cellulose Fibers. If we think about the Western Timberlands, and these are rough numbers, Steve, about 1\/3 of our logs would go to the export market, 1\/3 would go to domestic third parties, and about 1\/3 would go to our own mills. In the South -- and those numbers will move up and down on a year-over-year basis. In the South, a much higher percentage of our logs historically have flowed to our own facilities. But as I noted in my remarks this morning, we are consciously increasing our sales to third parties from our Southern Timberlands. Last year, that number exceeded 20%. And that's been a good market for us. We're seeing good prices and we are building relationships with third-party customers that we'll be able to continue to serve in 2012.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Terrific. And the other quick question also focused on the Timberlands is we've seen few small deals recently at very good prices where the buyer approached the vendor. Are you open to hit the bid if good offers materialize or would you rather grow your asset base?","Daniel S. Fulton","We are in the market all the time as a prospective buyer. And at the right time and the right place and the right circumstances, we could be a seller. But generally, we're -- and we have routine dispositions of nonstrategic land, that in some cases, are part of 1031 transactions or HBU land. In general, our strategic intent is to grow our Timberlands position. But we are engaged in the market and have exposure to both buyers and sellers...","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Sure. Do you have any 1031s that have to be crystallized in the near future?","Daniel S. Fulton","We always have some in process and -- so I can't talk about specifics. We match up the buy-sell opportunities.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","2 quick questions. First, Patty, working capital was a very big negative swing in Q4, which took free cash a lot lower than I thought. Can you give us a sense of what seasonal pattern we should be expecting, and if there was anything funny in this quarter? And then a quick question for Dan. You talked about the ability to sell land. Would you consider buying a land short builder at this point? Or do you still want to keep your exposure to home building where it is?","Daniel S. Fulton","Patty, you want to address the first question?","Patricia Bedient","Sure. On the working capital, you had a couple of things in the fourth quarter. So typically, our working capital in Wood Products would come down a little bit. In terms of reduced receivables in the quarter, we did have some inventory build in the fourth quarter to take advantage of some markets that new markets, in terms of customers, that we are building in the Wood Products business. The other swing that you had in working capital was in our Cellulose Fibers business, where we had more volume that we sold into the fourth quarter. And so I believe our receivables went up, those would certainly, swaps with the volume that we said would be a little bit lower and a little bit lower prices as well in the first quarter compared to the fourth.","Daniel S. Fulton","And to your second question, Mark, our focus in the Homebuilding business is to grow organically. We like the markets that we're in. We've got strong regional local brands that you're familiar with. And our focus in growing that business will be to flex up with the operations that we have and improve our selling activity and our production in those operations. As you know, today's volume is about 1\/3 of what it was at the peak. So we have a great operations and have the capacity to build more as the market begins to recover. If there is a land-light builder out there that need lots, they better be talking to us because we'd be happy to sell lots, assuming we can do so profitably. So it's part of our ongoing business, and it's important for us to have a balance between our land sales and our Homebuilding operations.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just a question on the plan for 2012 on the outlook, 665,000 starts. That split between single at 455,000 suggests 68% single-family, 32% multi, which is quite a big change from what we saw back in 2005 and '06, and would suggest that future OSB and lumber consumption would be down 10% from that time point. I guess it's more of a question on the future. Do you see this sort of new sort of mix ratios staying at this level going forward? And what is your information in terms of house size and log in OSB consumption?","Daniel S. Fulton","During the recession, we've seen some reduction in average square footage in single-family homes, Paul, maybe 10%. There has been a swing to multifamily during this timeframe. Multifamily market right now is really record low vacancy rates in many markets. And a lot of that I'd attribute to buyer uncertainty more than a shift long term in choice of multi versus single-family. So it's a little bit too early to tell. And as I talked about the numbers for 2011, single-family dropped, multifamily starts were actually up. We have the ability to sell all of our Wood Products into the multifamily market. Multifamily units generally have a lower square footage, on average, roughly 50% of the single-family. The amount of utilization of products varies. In multifamily units, our data would show that if you look at lumber, lumber utilization and the multifamily unit as compared to single-family maybe about 1\/3 of what is single would be. OSB about the same ratio. When you move into Engineered Wood Products, our numbers indicate about 60% on average usage per unit, so our strength in Engineered Wood Products will help in the serving any multifamily needs. And I think it's going to take some time through this recovery to see how the ratios between singles and multis actually settle out. I think what we're seeing now is multis being stronger, a lot of fires on the sidelines. My personal view is that as people start to reenter the single-family market, you'll see vacancies rise and multifamily, and people will take advantage of record low-interest rates and low prices for single-family. And that'll be what disburse the recovery in single-family overall.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joshua Barber with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick questions. First, you mentioned in your remarks that you had a higher Japan volume in the first quarter, do you think that's a sign of a larger trend with reconstruction starting to happen more in Japan now, or is that just something that's seasonal for Japan?","Daniel S. Fulton","It's not clear yet, Josh. Our volumes to Japan during 2011 were about equal to what they were in 2010. And that is in light of the disruption that we experienced, and the country experienced during the earthquake and tsunami, so we've seen a pickup in demand from our customers. And so as Patty talked about, the outlook for first quarter, that incorporates the increase in demand we're seeing. It appears that, that is primarily growth of our customers and perhaps their share rather than the rebuilding efforts following the earthquake. The areas that were most severely impacted, I think, are going to take some time to recover, because they have very significant infrastructure needs that need to be addressed. Can't add any more color than that.","Joshua A. Barber - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","One other sort of housekeeping item. Your deferred income taxes on the balance sheet seems to have dropped very sharply this quarter. Was there anything that was due to, or is that just a onetime funny tax fluctuations?","Patricia Bedient","It's really the booking of the additional liability for pensions. So pensions is the biggest reason for why deferred taxes moved around.","Operator","Your last question comes from Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","A couple of quick clarifications. I apologize, you may have said this to Chip's question before. But the pension expense on a booked basis, what's it going to be this year versus last year?","Patricia Bedient","So we said that this is pension and other postretirement benefits both, so they both flow into the same footnote. They're about a little over $80 million in 2011. In 2012, we would anticipate that, that'll be around $115 million. But there will be an amortization of a special item that will offset that $115 million for changes in the retirement benefit plans. So what I said to Chip was that we'll call that out as a special item. It's clear, but that's the change year-over-year.","Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And is that going to primarily show up on a corporate line or at the segments? And maybe an even easier way to answer, corporate in 2011 was roughly $100 million, is that a decent number to use for 2012 or should we be adding the $35 million increase in pension expense?","Patricia Bedient","Well, we charge to the segments themselves sort of normal service cost. And on Page 4 of the analyst package, we actually give you that breakout of what gets allocated to the business segments versus what stays at corporate. I would expect that the amount that gets allocated to the segments next year will increase a little bit as service cost increases, but the bulk of it would stay in the corporate segment.","Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And so corporate expense overall, would you expect that to go up a little bit 2012 versus 2011?","Patricia Bedient","It'll be a little bit up for that item. The Corporate segment does move around from quarter-to-quarter. In addition to these expenses, the other things that account for swings quarter-to-quarter or what happens to share-based comp, as well as foreign currency exchange fluctuations so it can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. But sort of as a rule of thumb, I would think about $15 million to $20 million a quarter.","Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then lastly, on the performance on Fibers, I was a little bit surprised with the magnitude of the impact you were expecting from pricing, given that you ship roughly 450,000 tons. The same hand, I was surprised how resilient pricing for you had been in the fourth quarter. And I'm wondering, is that a function of the way your contracts are set up? Are they either quarterly? Do you have a fair bit of annual contracts? How does pricing typically flow through into that business?","Kathryn F. McAuley","Mark, we didn't hear all of the start of your question, I apologize. Could you just rephrase it a little bit, so we can get a better feel for what you're asking?","Patricia Bedient","I think your question was about mix in the fourth quarter or was about pricing in the fourth quarter that was a little stronger than what you have expected?","Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","And then also the magnitude. I think you said about a $45 million impact 1Q versus 4Q, which you should about...","Patricia Bedient","Yes. The $45 million is about -- is a combination of both pulp realizations and slightly lower volume quarter-over-quarter. And in the fourth quarter, you had a little bit higher mix of specialty volume that went to the quarter as well. So there's a little bit of mix in the fourth quarter, and then there's a little less volume in the first quarter compared to the fourth.","Mark A. Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Very good. And so there's not much impact from the way your contracts are set up? Do you have much in a way of annual contracts in particular in the pulp business?","Daniel S. Fulton","Longer than annually, for a longer period of time, and they have some adjustments that are built in. But for our long-term customers, we have mutual commitments to keep them supplied. And that's really one of the great strengths of our business is the great longer-term customers that we have that are growing around the globe, and that provides a lot of strength for us in this business.","Operator","At this time, we have reached the allotted time for our Q&A.","Daniel S. Fulton","I'd like to take one minute and thank everybody on the line. We appreciate all of your comments and your questions. As usual, if you have further questions following today's call, I encourage you to follow-up with Kathy McAuley. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning, and thanks for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser Company.","Patricia Bedient","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Thank you.","I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth L. Baum - Director-Investor Relations","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2016 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.","On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Beth, and welcome everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $70 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $150 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Our first quarter earnings included results from Plum Creek for the period February 19 through March 31.","Special items for the first quarter included integration and restructuring charges related to the Plum Creek merger and a strategic review of our Cellulose Fiber business, partially offset by gain on the sale of our corporate campus.","I'm extremely proud of the work of our employees in the quarter, as we closed the Plum Creek merger, delivered solid operating performance across each of our businesses, and took significant steps toward achieving the commitments that will drive long-term value for shareholders of our merged company including \u2013 we have specific plans in place to capture $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies, and I am highly confident that we will meet or exceed this run rate target by the end of year one. As part of that, we made and announced nearly all our personnel decisions in the 41 days between merger close and the end of the first quarter.","We raised $2.5 billion of attractively priced term loan financing and began to aggressively execute against our $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had repurchased approximately $860 million or 35% of our authorization at an average price of $27.49 per share, and we close the sale of our corporate campus for $70 million in cash with our move to Seattle on track and scheduled for September.","We have continued to execute against our goals as the second quarter has progressed. On April 1, we closed the Twin Creeks transaction announced by Plum Creek in September 2015, receiving $440 million in cash in a transaction that valued 260,000 acres of Plum Creek Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per acre. As of the end of April, our share repurchase program was 50% complete with cumulative repurchases of $1.25 billion or nearly 44 million shares at an average price of $28.62.","And finally, earlier this week, we announced the conclusion of a portion of our Cellulose Fibers business strategic review with the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper for $2.2 billion.","I will turn now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with some brief comments about the housing market. The U.S. housing market continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by a continuing job growth and historically low interest rates.","As of March, total housing starts had improved 14% year-to-date compared with 2015. Single-family starts have grown even more and are up 23% year-to-date. Although multi-family activity, which is typically more volatile, has driven some choppiness in monthly indicators, first quarter housing activity has been consistent with our expectations and those of our customers. Despite some headwinds from labor constraints, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. We continue to plan for just over 1.2 million housing starts in 2016.","Let me now turn to our business segments. Following the merger, we realigned our management structure and our business segments to incorporate the increased scale of our Timberlands operations, as well as the addition of Plum Creek's real estate, energy, and natural resources expertise. For the first quarter, Weyerhaeuser is reporting four business segments: Timberlands; Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources; Wood Products; and Cellulose Fibers.","To make it easier to compare current and historical results, business segment results for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect our new segment definitions. We've also revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to add back the non-cash basis of real estate sold. With this change, EBITDA for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment will better reflect the cash generated by those activities. Going forward, we will focus on adjusted EBITDA for all our businesses.","I will now begin the discussion, Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. In Timberlands, we're reporting EBITDA by three primary geographies, Western Timberlands includes Washington and Oregon; Southern Timberlands includes all Southern states; and Northern Timberlands includes operations in Montana, the Lake States, New England, and West Virginia.","Results from Canada and Uruguay are reported in other Timberlands. Recreational lease activities continues to be reported within the Timberlands segment and volumes and realizations for our Timberlands business are now reported in tons.","Timberlands contributed $129 million to first quarter earnings, an improvement of $22 million compared with the fourth quarter. These results include a higher non-cash depletion and amortization costs due to the step-up in Timberlands basis associated with acquisition accounting and the alignment of our accounting policies.","Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $39 million to $199 million. Approximately, 12% of Timberlands first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations. Western Timberlands contributed $118 million to first quarter EBITDA, an improvement of $15 million compared with the fourth quarter. Western fee harvest volumes increased due to slightly higher harvest for legacy Weyerhaeuser land and a partial quarter of Plum Creek harvest.","Average realizations for Western logs declined slightly due to a shift in mix from export to domestic markets. Average realizations for export logs improved and export sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. Sales volumes to Japan increased and pricing improved modestly due to continued strong demand. Japanese wooden housing starts have improved slightly compared with 2015 as mortgage rates remained low and we see some pull forward in advance of a scheduled increased in the consumption tax next year. Volumes to China declined seasonally compared with fourth quarter as construction activity paused during the Lunar New Year period. Average realizations improved slightly.","Log inventory to Chinese ports rose during the first quarter, but remained within a normal range for the season and well below the elevated levels experienced during the first quarter of 2015. With inventories in line and slightly improved construction activity, our customers are optimistic regarding current market conditions. In Western domestic market, log supply and demand remained balanced and realizations improved slightly.","Southern Timberland contributed $77 million to first quarter EBITDA, $21 million more than the fourth quarter. This improvement was attributable to a partial quarter of Plum Creek operations. A partial quarter of harvest from Plum Creek's 3.4 million Southern acres increased Southern harvest by 40% and more than offset a small seasonal decline in harvest from legacy Weyerhaeuser land.","Realizations for Southern logs declined slightly primarily due to mix. Silviculture costs and forestry costs declined as activity was delayed due to wet weather. A partial quarter of results from Plum Creek's Northern Timberlands contributed $3 million to first quarter EBITDA.","Operational excellence initiatives continue to contribute to Timberlands' results. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we set a target of $20 million of $30 million of OpEx improvements from legacy Weyerhaeuser Holdings. Following the merger, we have now increased the Timberlands' 2016 OpEx target to $30 million to $50 million to incorporate $10 million to $20 million of operational synergies we expect to achieve from the merger this year.","The multi-year OpEx targets for Timberlands has also increased to $200 million, including the $64 million achieved in 2014 and 2015 to incorporate operational synergy opportunity from the merger. Timberlands has begun an internal benchmarking exercise to identify best practices in silviculture, logging and transportation, and leverage those learnings across the entire Timberlands portfolio. Although this work is still in the early stages, I'm pleased by the level of energy and teamwork in identifying opportunities across the business.","Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, chart 6 and 7. The Real Estate & ENR segment includes sales of HBU and non-core Timberland property as well as lease and royalty income from minerals, aggregates, and oil and gas. These activities were formerly reported within Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands segment. Real Estate & ENR contributed $15 million to first quarter earnings, $12 million lower than the fourth quarter. However, EBITDA increased by $1 million to $34 million as lower EBITDA from legacy Weyerhaeuser operations was more than offset by a partial quarter of Plum Creek results. Total acreage sold increased in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter due to a conservation sale of over 8,000 acres of Maine timberlands.","Although a partial quarter of Plum Creek's operations contributed significantly to the segment's EBITDA, the Plum Creek contribution to earnings was minimal because Plum Creek land was marked up to fair value as part of the merger purchase price allocation.","Operational excellence for the Real Estate & ENR business will be based on the premium to Timberland values captured from the sale of HBU properties. The first step in defining the size of this opportunity is applying Plum Creek's asset value optimization, or AVO, process across Weyerhaeuser's 6.9 million acres of legacy Timberlands. This process is underway and we anticipate it will be substantially complete in about one year.","Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $87 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $48 million in the fourth quarter. Results for Plum Creek lumber mills are reported as part of the lumber business and results for Plum Creek's plywood and medium density fiberboard, or MDF, facilities are reported with Engineered Wood Products.","Adjusted EBITDA for the Wood Products segment increased to $117 million, primarily due to improved unit manufacturing costs and seasonally higher sales volume. Approximately 4% of Wood Products' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations.","In lumber, EBITDA improved $18 million compared with fourth quarter. Average realizations improved 1% and sales volumes increased 3%. Unit manufacturing costs declined due to higher operating rates and strong operating performance. Fourth quarter included downtime for installation of capital projects.","In OSB, EBITDA increased to $31 million, $6 million higher than the fourth quarter and $27 million higher than the first quarter of last year. Unit manufacturing costs improved due to strong operating performance and reduced downtime for planned maintenance. This more than offset a 3% decrease in average sales realizations. Sales volumes increased 5%.","Engineered Wood Products' EBITDA more than doubled to $31 million, compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter. Operating rates and unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher demand, strong operating performance, and reduced downtime for maintenance and capital projects. Sales volumes increased seasonally and average realizations declined slightly due to mix.","EBITDA for the Distribution business improved to $4 million, $2 million more than the fourth quarter and $7 million more than the first quarter of 2015. This business benefited from improved margins and lower operating cost. Operational excellence continues to contribute to Wood Products results as all four businesses gain leverage from ongoing improvements in controllable cost. The businesses are collectively targeting $55 million to $75 million of operational excellence improvements in 2016. Each business remains relentlessly focused on its initiatives and is on track to achieve its target.","Cellulose Fibers, charts 10 and 11. Cellulose Fibers contributed $28 million to first quarter earnings, compared with earnings before special items of $64 million in the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging declined as prices remained under pressure. Sales volumes declined only slightly as demand for our pulp remained strong despite the seasonally weak Lunar New Year period. Maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. First quarter included 16 days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with eight days in the fourth quarter.","As I noted earlier, we have announced the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper in a $2.2 billion cash transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review, and we expect it to close in the fourth quarter. This transaction delivers compelling value for our shareholders and we expect to use a substantial portion of the $1.6 billion after-tax proceeds for repayment of the 18-month term loans raised during the first quarter.","I want to thank the employees of our Cellulose Fibers business for their dedication and professionalism as they have continued to operate safely and deliver an exceptional customer experience through the strategic review process.","As noted in Monday's press release, the strategic review of our liquid packaging business and newsprint and publication venture is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The overall outlook for the second quarter is summarized on chart 16 of the earnings slides. Please note that the second quarter will include a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. Starting with Timberlands, we expect second quarter EBITDA to come in approximately 10% higher than first quarter with second quarter earnings comparable to the first quarter.","It is important to note that as part of the purchase price allocation, the Plum Creek Timberlands basis was stepped up to reflect fair value. As a result, new depletion rates were established for the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek Timberlands. In addition to changes in the depletion rate, the accounting policies for amortization of road and other related expenses have been aligned. These changes will result in total amortization and depletion expense of approximately $90 million for the second quarter.","In our Western Timberlands operations, log export volume is expected to improve in the second quarter as volumes to China increased following the seasonally low Lunar New Year period. Japanese export volumes were elevated in the first quarter and are expected to return to more normal seasonal levels in the second quarter. We anticipate stable pricing for our Japanese and Chinese export logs with a slight decline in overall export price realizations due to the higher proportion of Chinese volume. Domestic log volumes will increase with the addition of the Plum Creek activity with prices remain stable quarter-over-quarter. Costs will be higher due to shifting harvest activity to higher elevation, which is typical during the spring season.","In the South, harvest volumes will increase approximately 40% as we benefit from the full quarter of Plum Creek operations. We expect average log prices will decrease modestly as the harvest mix will include a higher proportion of pulpwood logs. In addition, forestry expenses will be higher due to increased seasonal spending.","In the North, harvest volumes will be above the first quarter levels with the inclusion of a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. The second quarter typically has the lowest harvest levels of the year because of spring weather conditions with the mud season, which limits access to harvest sites in the Northern operating region. Average sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter levels. Note, that prior to the merger, Plum Creek included their Oregon and Washington activity in their Northern segment.","Moving on to our full year Timber harvest outlook. We expect our combined 2016 fee harvest will be 40 million to 42 million tons. The 2016 fee harvest is comparable to the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek 2015 harvest levels after adding Plum Creek's harvest for the January 1 to February 19 pre-merger period.","Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources' second quarter EBITDA and earnings are expected to be similar to the first quarter. Higher and better use markets remain active in the Southern states and we expect similar transaction activity in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter.","In the second half of the year, we expect transaction counts to increase as more higher and better use properties are identified through our AVO process and brought to market. For the remainder of the year, we estimate the sales mix will be evenly split between Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek lands, with an average basis of 50%.","For Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain relatively low, as buyers continue to meet their purchasing needs on a just-in-time basis. Prices for lumber have improved in the second half of the first quarter, and that trend continued into the second quarter. Average April sales realizations were $30 higher than the first quarter average. OSB prices have also rallied, with average April sales realizations approximately $15 higher than the first quarter averages. We anticipate prices will continue to strengthen during the second quarter, as building activity increases.","Sales volume for the Engineered Wood Products are expected to be seasonally higher in the second quarter, and we expect continued improvement in this business. Operating rates remain strong across all the Wood Products business lines. We expect overall second quarter EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be significantly higher than the first quarter. In fact, EBITDA for this segment has not been this strong since the second quarter of 2013. This is primarily a result of our improved operational performance and competitive cost structure.","Moving to Cellulose Fibers, EBITDA and earnings in Cellulose Fibers business were expected to increase during the second quarter with higher average sales realizations across our product lines. Volumes are expected to be similar to first quarter levels. We anticipate maintenance spending to be similar to first quarter. Other cost of sales are expected to decrease slightly due to lower fiber and energy costs.","For our key financial items, cash from operations during the first quarter was $47 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonally lower earnings, inventory buildup, and semi-annual interest payments.","We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $415 million. Going forward, we anticipate that our normalized cash balance will be in the range of $200 million to $400 million, which we feel is an appropriate level for the capital structure at this time. We completed our planned post-transaction financing in February and March by entering into two 18-month term loans at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 105 basis points or approximately 1.5%. The loans have a total capacity of $2.5 billion.","At the end of the quarter, we had drawn down $1.1 billion. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.1 billion, was $6.7 billion at the end of the quarter. We have no debt maturities in 2016 and we intend to pay down the new term loans primarily with proceeds from asset sales. This will allow us to move toward our target debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times.","Interest expense for the first quarter reflects a partial quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. Looking forward, our 2016 interest expense will be approximately $450 million for the year.","Moving on to capital expenditures, first quarter capital expenditures totaled $73 million. Our capital spending is seasonal and tends to be lowest in the first quarter before ramping up through the rest of the year. We continue to expect 2016 CapEx will be approximately $450 million, excluding Cellulose Fibers. This includes minimal spending for Real Estate and Energy and Natural resources where the focus is on entitlement and royalty contracts and not capital-intensive development.","Our 2016 total company tax rate would be dependent upon the mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. We are currently estimating our full year total company tax rate to be approximately 18% to 20%. Due to prior year overpayment, we do not anticipate making a cash payment in 2016. These first quarter estimates do not take into account the impact of the divestiture of the pulp business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Let me direct your attention to chart 12, which details the major components of our unallocated items. Income before special items improved to $19 million in the first quarter compared with $1 million of expense in fourth quarter of 2015. Improvement was driven primarily by foreign exchange as the Canadian dollar strengthened 7% against the U.S. dollar during the quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Russell. I will close my comments this morning with some brief comments on the merger integration process. Two-and-a-half months after day one, we have made solid progress on merger integration. Our merged corporate area team is operating together out of our building in Federal Way and we have begun the consolidation of regional offices. Each of our senior management team members has spent several weeks on the road meeting with employees and reinforcing our vision and the core values, relentless focus, and key behaviors that will define our success as a merged company.","I look forward to building on that strong foundation as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company. We are relentlessly focused on improving performance through operational excellence and capturing cost and operational synergies to leverage the full benefit of an improving U.S. housing market and drive long-term value to our shareholders.","And now, we like to open up the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Plum Creek typically gave guidance on annual revenue from the Real Estate business and I was wondering if you would continue that, if you had any thoughts on sales or EBITDA contribution in 2016. And then from your comments earlier, is it safe to say you'd expect Real Estate sales to step-up in 2017 as you apply that AVO methodology to Weyerhaeuser's portfolio?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Anthony, as we indicated, we are right in the middle of applying the AVO process across the entire legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberland base. And as Russell mentioned, we anticipate that activity will ramp-up in the second half of 2016 and into 2017 as you mentioned. As we get a better feel for what those numbers are going to look like, we will provide guidance as we have historically on a quarterly basis to let you know what we think those will look like going forward. But we're excited about the process. We think there's lots of opportunity, and that activity, as I said, will ramp-up in the second half of 2016 and into 2017.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then switching to lumber, prices have been much stronger than we expected year-to-date. And I was wondering if you could give us some sense of what's happening on the ground in terms of demand you're seeing at job sites, how tight inventories are. And I think typically we see a little seasonal weakness in the second quarter. And I think in your comments, you referenced continued strengthening. So, what's driving your confidence there and maybe what's different from previous years?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in lumber and the price increases that have taken place to-date, Anthony. I think the key drivers are just improvement in demand, and as I highlighted, especially in single-family housing has been a big part of it. And then the other part, and Russell mentioned this, is just the low inventory levels across the system. So, what we've seen is average prices for April, $30 above first quarter average, and current prices are $10 above the April average, so it has continued to go up. And as we said based on the low inventories, the strong demand, we are very encouraged by what we've seen on the ground in terms of lumber demand and the opportunity for pricing going forward.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on the outlook for Wood Products, you talked about 2Q EBITDA being significantly higher than 1Q. Is there any way you can put a finer point on that or quantify that versus previous years?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Russell mentioned it, you can go back to second quarter of 2013 as kind of a comparable period. The reason \u2013 the other thing, Anthony, and the reason we laid out the price and the detail that we did, you, of course, know the leverage. But in terms of, on an annual basis, every $10 increase in lumber is $40 million on an annual basis. Every $10 increase in OSB is $30 million on an annual basis. I should mention that we talked about lumber, but OSB prices have continued to improve as well, and current prices are up another $7 versus the April average in OSB. So, we try to provide you the leverage that we have to pricing, and I'll tell you on top of that, as you saw in the first quarter results, our Wood Products business is running, operating really well. And we anticipate that's going to continue as we move through the quarter.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Collin.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","First question for me. Just as far as acquisition opportunities from here, Doyle, can you maybe just touch on the final terms with the Twin Creeks JV? And, obviously, we've seen a few larger Timberland deals here announced in the last few weeks. Maybe just your take on the current acquisition environment.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, let me comment on the current acquisition environment and then I'll ask Russell to comment on Twin Creeks. So, in terms of the current acquisition environment, there continues to be a lot of interest in this asset class and, frankly, a lot of money chasing deals. As we've seen announced recently, there have been some deals that are happening. I would highlight on the West some transaction announced at $4,300 an acre and then in the South, of course, our Twin Creeks transaction at $2,150 an acre, and then I think I saw just last night CatchMark announced something at $2,000 an acre. So, I would tell you, as I've said, a lot of increased activity, a lot of interest in the asset class. And I would say, good values being paid for high-quality property.","And, now, let me turn it over to Russell to comment on Twin Creeks.","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, Collin, as we announced, we closed the Twin Creeks transaction on April 1. And that was a deal that was put together prior to the merger, obviously. And we delayed the close so that we could sit down with the investors and make sure that we'd structured it appropriately, given Weyerhaeuser's differences to Plum Creek.","So, the real key items are, the property management agreement under the Plum Creek structure was 15 years. We've shortened that to three years under the Weyerhaeuser, as amended. And then the equity ownership dropped from 25% to 21%. Those are probably the two biggest items that changed in the transaction.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just, Russell, remind us on what can Weyerhaeuser buy for its balance sheet versus what has to have a first right of refusal to the JV?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Right. So, the acquisition right of first refusal is anything under $10 million, Weyerhaeuser can buy on its account. And that's primarily because those would probably be properties that are more adjacent to operations. Anything in between $10 million and $200 million first goes to the joint venture for a period of three years. And so, the remaining $400 million of cash available for acquisitions is completed.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Very helpful. And then I guess, Russell, just \u2013 I wanted \u2013 when the dust settles with the Fibers business and use of proceeds for that. I know in the prepared remarks you're referencing kind of a 3.5 times debt to EBITDA. But are you going to move any of those leverage targets up a little bit given the mix of businesses is going to be a lot more towards timber and less towards manufacturing capacity or what do you stand on that?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","So, was your question in relation to leverage ratios?","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes.","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, I would say that right now we're targeting to 3.5 times, we'll continue to move towards that over time. As we've mentioned, we issued short-term debt. We'll use sale of assets to reduce bad debt over time.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just one other follow-up on Anthony's question, just as it relates to the Real Estate business. I think, Doyle, you've suggested in the past may be 15% to 20% of the combined companies could potentially be Real Estate. Is that still how you're thinking about, again recognizing you're still relatively early in that review process? But would that be fair as we start thinking about 2017 to the comment that it's going to step-up materially?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's exactly right, Collin. We are still comfortable with that guidance of 15% to 20%. And as I mentioned, we anticipate real estate activity will ramp-up second half of 2016 and into 2017 to get us to that range. Every year won't be exactly that, but that's kind of a guideline as to what we anticipate the contribution from Real Estate will be on a go-forward basis after we complete the AVO process.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Collin.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, everyone. This is actually John Babcock standing in for George. Just two quick questions for you. First on the EWP markets. Demand was a little better than we expected, and just wanted to get a little bit of a sense for what you're seeing in the market and ultimately how that might trend for the rest of the year?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, so we were encouraged by the demand in EWP in the quarter. I think that's primarily driven by the increase in single-family starts. As you very well know, that is by far the biggest driver of demand for EWP and with single-family starts being up 23% in the first quarter, that flowed through to our EWP business. And again, optimistic that housing is going to continue to improve, including an improvement in single-family starts, so that should bode well for EWP for the balance of the year.","John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. And then secondly, just as the \u2013 with regards to the merger as a whole, as that gets under way, ultimately how do you expect that to impact the pace and trajectory of the operating improvements that you're targeting for the business?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, the key there, of course, is the OpEx targets for Timberland. And as we mentioned, we have raised those targets significantly. In 2016, the original target pre-merger was $20 million to $30 million for Timberlands. We have now raised that to $30 million to $50 million for 2016 to identify the early opportunities to deliver operational synergies, which are, of course, above the cost synergies.","More importantly than that, though, we raised the multi-year target to $200 million. So that's an incremental $130 million above what we received \u2013 what we accomplished in 2014 and 2015. So, an additional $130 million that we think we will be able to accomplish over the next two to three years, as we put these two companies together and deliver bottom-line operational synergies. So, really excited about that opportunity. A lot of work going on currently to do benchmarking of the best of each company and start to identify opportunities to drive those operational synergies to the bottom line. So, excited about that as we move forward.","John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Just a quick follow-up there, though. I mean with the merger kind of starting obviously in the first half here, do you expect that \u2013 the improvements for this year to be kind of back-weighted?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, let's talk about the two components just to be clear. So, there's cost synergies and then there's operational synergies. In terms of the cost synergies, as I've said, these are hard dollar cost synergies, as I've said in my remarks, we are highly confident that we'll meet or exceed the $100 million run rate that we laid out as a target. I'll tell you that will be somewhat lumpy, but it's not going to be all backend loaded, and we will report out on our progress on that on a quarterly basis as we move forward.","As with \u2013 in terms of operational synergies, again, $10 million to $20 million additional on top of what we had already identified for Timberlands in 2016. And then I would say kind of as you've seen distributed kind of evenly over the next two or three years to get the balance of the operational synergies that we've identified as part of the merger.","John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot, Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thanks. Doyle, do you have much visibility into the split of export log business for the year between Japan and China? You talked about seasonality, so I'm kind of hoping you can give some sense of what you think the whole year might look like?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would think the whole year, Mark, will be in line with kind of what we've seen historically. But let me give you just a little bit of color on what we're seeing in each of those markets currently. And then if that doesn't answer your question, we'll come back to it. But in terms of Japan, as we talked about, volume and pricing were both up in the first quarter. We think \u2013 and a little bit of that was pull forward for people being ready for an anticipated run up before the consumption tax increase. In the second quarter we think demand, because it was elevated in the first quarter, will be down a little bit in the second quarter and price will be down, flat to down slightly.","China, encouraged about what's happening there. As you know, the inventories didn't build like they have over the last couple of years in the first quarter, so we anticipate both demand and pricing will be up in the second quarter. And then domestic, as we said, good demand, probably a little bit slightly lower prices in the second quarter. So, as you know in the slides, we break out the percentage of Japan versus China and Korea, and we wouldn't see any significant changes there as we move forward, although in the second quarter, we will anticipate as I just highlighted, China being a larger component. And maybe that continues for the balance of the year if China continues to accelerate in terms of demand like we've seen in the first and going into the second quarter.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Super. That's really helpful. Can I ask just one more question? Can you remind us how much of your OSB is currently going into your EWP business?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Mark, we're going to get back with you with that exact number. It's a small part of it, but I just don't know that number exactly off the top of my head, but we'll get back with you.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Fair enough. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. Just a couple follow-ups first. On the \u2013 just want to make sure I understand, so the cost synergy is the $100 million. Where will that be showing up? Will that be presumably in the various segments as well, primarily in Timberlands? But that is separate from the operational synergies? And I think you talked about being $130 million over a couple years. Is that correct?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That is correct, Mark. It will show up in various places, but it'll show up in the segment and then we'll lay out a way for you to track it exactly. But more importantly than that, to your second point, yes, the additional OpEx amount that we've identified for Timberland is above and beyond the hard dollar cost synergies.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Completely different bucket.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then a second quick follow-up, also you'd mentioned 15% to 20% from real estate sales. Was that a reference to EBITDA? And are we talking kind of $300 million to $350 million or so expectations coming from real estate from an EBITDA perspective? Is that how we should think about that? Or was that a different reference?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. It was an EBITDA reference. And again, once this \u2013 we ramp-up, just general guidelines, 15% to 20% of overall EBITDA for the company would come \u2013 we would anticipate would come from the real estate business. Now, like I said, a lot of work to do and identify all of those opportunities, but just to give \u2013 we wanted to give some guidance of what we thought that number could be on a go-forward basis.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay, and then lastly, just understand kind of the expected pace on the share repurchase. I think you had indicated previously that you anticipated about $2 billion of the $2.5 billion would be done quite quickly \u2013 forget the exact terminology. Now, would you be just continuing to draw down on the term loan to execute on that, and then you pay all of that back when the pulp business gets sold? Is that how to think of it?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, Mark, you're exactly right. What we said is $2 billion of the $2.5 billion we would do on an accelerated basis. And I think we've shown that that's exactly what we're doing. Once that's completed, we'll kind of pause and reevaluate the timing on the additional $500 million. You're right, we'll draw down on the term loan and we will use the asset sales and whatever else; but asset sales in Twin Creeks, whatever, to pay down that debt \u2013 that short-term debt.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. This might seem kind of silly to just focus on a small part of your portfolio, but with 320,000 acres in Uruguay, you only had $1 million in EBITDA? So is there something about the accounting that keeps the cash or the contribution in South America?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, there's nothing that would keep cash in any given place, Steve. So, as we've said, as part of this, we're going to be evaluating our 13.2 million acres of Timberland and making decisions as to what we want the long-term portfolio to look like; with 13.2 million acres and no big tax in place, we have lots of flexibility.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah. I mean, I don't know how much managerial bandwidth it takes, but it's not a big contribution. And then switching gears, I assume that NORPAC and the Longview mill will also be sold. I'm just wondering, does that have any implications for your export terminal at the Port of Longview?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. That has no implications for that.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay, thanks. And one other quick clarification \u2013 maybe I need a hearing aid. I think Russell referenced Q2 2013, and you referenced Q2 2014 when you were talking about the Wood Products run rate?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","If I said Q2 2014 that was a mistake. The reference was to Q2 2013.","Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. It was a better quarter. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi. Thank you; and I know you guys have been working hard the last few months. Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Chip.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","First question has to do \u2013 thank you \u2013 is with the pension income. I know \u2013 should that continue to be at the higher level that we saw in the first quarter at roughly, I think, it was $9 million per quarter for the whole year?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I think on the pension income we're expecting a little improvement in 2016.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And so at the same \u2013 should it be similar in the second, third, and fourth to the amount you showed on unallocated items in the first quarter?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. That would be our expectation.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then on the depletion side, I know you said something about $90 million. When I look at the first quarter of 2016 versus 2015, it was up about $37 million. Are you saying it should be up year-over-year therefore by \u2013 are you saying depletion should be up $90 million or EBITDA should be up $90 million from \u2013 which is probably saying the same thing, since EBIT is going to be flat. But I just want to make sure I had that progression right for Timberlands?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. So the depletion and amortization for the second quarter will be $90 million and that's a fair number to use through third and fourth quarter also.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And then how about the depletion for the real estate segment in the second quarter?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","You can probably look at what the first quarter was like as a pretty good guide.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Even though your real estate sales will pick up a little bit?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Second quarter they will probably be similar to first quarter, and then pick up in the second half of the year.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay, got you. And then next question has to do with the \u2013 I think Doyle mentioned the real estate sales would be ramping to eventually around a $350 million EBITDA level sort of a target out there. Should we see that \u2013 is 2018 a realistic year that you think you'll get there, or is that pushing it too soon?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think that's pushing it to too fine a point, Chip. Again, we're right in the middle of the AVO process. Again, what we wanted to do is just give some guidance as to the potential magnitude of the real estate business at 15% to 20% of the overall EBITDA for the company. We're going to learn a lot more as we go through this process. So, we'll be further refining that in terms of the timing as we move forward.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And last quick one, the business you just announced you sold to IP, is that going to be reported as a normal segment until it's sold or are you going to split it out as a discontinued operations, or have you figured that out yet?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The pulp business will be asset held for sale, so it would be a discontinued operation starting in second quarter.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Oh, okay, important. And so when you give us adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, you will not include the income from that business?","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Correct. You'll be able to see it in our presentation, so you can run your calculations.","Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you, Chip.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russ.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Yeah. Doyle, I have a couple of portfolio questions. I think one of them you've answered already, and that is just, any potential portfolio repositioning within the Timberlands, maybe concentrating more going forward on plantations in the South and in the Northwest?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. As I mentioned, Mark, as part of the integration process we're going to \u2013 it's going to involve a review of the overall Timberlands portfolio. And again, as I mentioned with 13-plus million acres and no built-in gains tax we've got lots of flexibility as to how we create the most value for our shareholders going forward. So, that work is ongoing.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay, and is it fair to say that the focus is going to be kind of plantation forestry, Doyle?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't want to exclude anything at this point, Mark. Let us do the work and figure out exactly what we want the portfolio to look like as we move forward.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then the second one I had is just kind of on capital allocation going forward, particularly thinking about what your business investment focus is going to be. You're selling the Cellulose Fibers business. That was clearly a forestry-related business that had a good cash return. And if I look over at kind of Plum, historically, they had invested in a limited scale in things like gravel pit participations, which looked like they were lower return businesses and not forestry-related. So, if we think kind of going forward, are there any bounds you would want us to kind of think about in terms of where you'll put capital and where you won't put capital?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, Mark, as you know, we've done a lot of work here at Weyerhaeuser over the past few years to really focus our company. And as we say in where we're headed, we're going to the premier timberland and forest products company going forward. So, I wouldn't \u2013 I think, as you see us, first and foremost, we're going to focus on delivering the value from the Plum Creek merger. As we look to invest going forward, Mark, I would tell you, it's going to be focused on those areas. We do not anticipate moving into other areas \u2013 or non-forest-related areas in any significant way.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's helpful. Good luck in the second quarter and through the balance of the year.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Thank you.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you.","I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Denise M. Merle - Senior VP-Human Resources & Investor Relations","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2015 earnings. On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Denise, and welcome, everyone. For the past two years, we've been relentlessly focused on making Weyerhaeuser a truly great company by pulling three key levers to drive value for shareholders: portfolio, performance and capital allocation.","In 2015, we've made significant progress in each of these areas. We announced two transformational portfolio changes, a merger with Plum Creek that will create the world's premier timberland and forest products company and the exploration of strategic alternatives for our Cellulose Fibers business.","We maintained a relentless focus on improving our relative performance and delivered on our second set of annual operational excellence targets. And importantly, we delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We increased our dividend by 7%, and we repurchased nearly $520 million of common shares in 2015.","Despite ongoing headwinds related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain focused on what we could control. And for the fourth quarter, our business has once again delivered solid operating results. Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter net earnings of $59 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $121 million or $0.24 per share.","Our primary special item for the fourth quarter was a non-cash asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate. Additional items included costs for the Plum Creek merger and the closure of several distribution centers, and a tax benefit from the expiration of our built-in gains period.","I will begin the discussion of our fourth quarter business results with some brief comments about the housing market. The housing market maintained positive momentum in the fourth quarter as favorable weather conditions enabled building activity to continue through December in many areas of the country. Single-family housing starts improved in the quarter and ended the year up 10% compared with 2014. Total U.S. housing starts ended 2015 at just over 1.1 million, an improvement of 11% compared with last year.","For 2016, we expect steady moderate growth in the U.S. housing market. We are planning for just over 1.2 million housing starts in an increasing single-family share. With improving job growth and historically low interest rate, U.S. economic fundamentals support a continuing recovery. Despite some headwinds from labor constraint and falling oil prices, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. Most of our customers tell us they are planning for 2016 growth rate in the low-double digits.","Let me now turn to our business segment results, starting with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $134 million to fourth quarter earnings, an improvement of $8 million compared with the third quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes rose seasonally as we exited the third quarter fire season, and average log realizations increased due to a greater percentage of export sales. Each of our export markets improved during the quarter.","Log sales volumes to Japan increased and prices rose modestly as a solid Japanese housing market continues to drive demand. So the full-year 2015, Japanese win housing starts grew by 3%.","In China, log inventories at the ports declined throughout the fourth quarter as many suppliers curtailed shipments in response to weak third quarter pricing. Although overall Chinese market demand remained relatively flat compared with the third quarter, average realizations for our China export logs increased and sales volumes rose as we flexed volume to take advantage of opportunities created by the tighter Chinese inventory situation.","In Western domestic markets, log supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Realizations for our Western domestic logs declined slightly to a greater mix of hemlock and other whitewood.","The flooding experienced in some regions of Washington and in Oregon during December had no significant effect on our operations or infrastructure. In the South, heavy rainfall did affect harvest operations in select wood baskets, but fee harvest declined only 3% compared with third quarter as our Southern Timberlands teams did an outstanding job of flexing harvest settings in response to weather conditions.","Although overall market conditions were stable, realizations for our Southern logs declined slightly, due to a shift in geographic mix. Silviculture and forestry expenses declined due to cost control initiatives and weather-related constraints. Fourth quarter included earnings of $19 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, an increase of $6 million compared with the third quarter.","Wood Products, chart six and seven. Wood Products contributed $48 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items compared with $85 million in the third quarter. Special items for the fourth quarter included a pre-tax charge of $8 million for the closure of four distribution centers, as we continue to improve the cost structure of that business. Adjusted EBITDA before special items for the Wood Products segment declined to $75 million in the fourth quarter, as seasonally lower sales volumes and lower operating rates more than offset improved realizations for oriented strand board.","In lumber, EBITDA was $22 million lower compared with the third quarter. Average realizations declined 3% and sales volumes fell 9%. Operating rates declined and unit manufacturing cost rose due to increased downtime, primarily for installation of capital projects that will continue to reduce cost within our Southern lumber system.","In OSB, EBITDA improved by $13 million, primarily due to a 14% increase in average sales realizations. This improvement was partially offset by a 7% reduction in sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs due to planned maintenance downtime.","Engineered Wood Products reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $14 million compared with $36 million in the third quarter. Operating rates declined due to downtime for major maintenance, capital projects, and seasonal holiday shutdowns. Sales volumes declined seasonally, and average realizations were lower due to mix. EBITDA for the distribution business declined compared with third quarter due to seasonally lower sales volumes.","Cellulose Fibers, charts eight and nine. Cellulose Fibers contributed $64 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items compared with $79 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter results included a non-cash pre-tax charge of $84 million for the asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate.","Pulp prices remained under pressure during the fourth quarter due to continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Average pulp realizations declined compared with the third quarter, and maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage dates. Fourth quarter included eight days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with four days in the third quarter. These factors were partially offset by improved sales volumes and strong operating performance.","Pulp production rose compared with the third quarter despite the increase in scheduled maintenance outage days and several of our mills set operating records. For example, our Columbus, Mississippi mill operated at nearly 100% reliability in the quarter.","I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook, and then I'll follow up with some specific comments on operational excellence.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the first quarter is summarized on chart 12. Now, this outlook does not incorporate the merger with Plum Creek. We'll include Plum Creek results after the transaction closes. I'll begin my comments with Timberlands.","In the West, export demand from Japan is expected to remain strong, and we anticipate a slight improvement in pricing. The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to dampen significant price increases. Sales volumes to Japan are expected to increase more than 5% in the quarter. Our volumes and realizations for log sales to China are anticipated to increase modestly.","We anticipate a slight increase in Western domestic sales realizations as lumber prices are expected to improve later in the quarter. Fee harvest in the West is expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter.","In the South, sales realizations are expected to decrease slightly due to mix. Sales volumes will be lower as wet weather contributes to the typical seasonal decline in fee harvest. Earnings from non-strategic land sales are anticipated to be roughly $10 million lower than the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the fourth quarter.","In Wood Products, lumber average sales realizations are anticipated to increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth, although prices have not improved thus far. Realizations for our other product lines as well as overall sales volumes are expected to be roughly comparable to last quarter. We expect less downtime from planned maintenance and capital projects compared to the fourth quarter. And as a result, average unit manufacturing cost should decrease. Channel inventories remain low, with customers generally purchasing for immediate needs.","As we enter the spring building season, we do expect to see business improve. We anticipate that overall earnings on our Wood Products segment will be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth and slightly higher than the first quarter of 2015.","In Cellulose Fibers, global softwood pulp inventories as of the end of the fourth quarter were at 29 days, down slightly from the 30 days at the end of the third quarter. This is at the high end of balanced inventory levels. We expect that average sales realizations and volumes for our pulp products will weaken during the first quarter due to continued currency headwinds and the normal effect of the Chinese New Year.","Our liquid packaging operation will begin its planned maintenance outage this quarter, and as a result, we expect maintenance expense for this segment will increase significantly compared to the fourth quarter, which had fewer overall maintenance days. We anticipate that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and roughly comparable to the first quarter of last year. Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, and I'll refer to chart 11 for these discussions.","Cash from operations totaled $339 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $57 million from the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $174 million, bringing our total expenditures for the full year to $483 million, well within our earlier guidance of $500 million.","Looking ahead to 2016, we expect total expenditures for the full year to be down slightly from 2015, subject to the outcome of the strategic review for Cellulose Fibers and the transaction with Plum Creek. At the end of the quarter, we had cash of just over $1 billion and we do not have any scheduled debt maturities in 2016.","Now, I'd like to update you on the status of our retirement benefit plans. The year-end 2015 funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and post-employment retirement plans improved by approximately $400 million compared to year-end 2014. This improvement was primarily the result of the increase in discount rates.","We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2015 and we don't anticipate any cash contributions for that plan this year. Cash paid for all other pension and other post-employment retirement plans in 2015 was approximately $80 million. We expect spending in 2016 to be approximately $60 million.","Chart 14 in the appendix details the pension expense by business for 2015. Total expense in 2015 was approximately $42 million, and in 2016, we expect the total amount will be income of approximately $5 million.","So with that, I'll turn the call back to Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Patty. I'd now like to switch gears and provide an update on our operational excellence efforts. Throughout the year, each of our businesses remained relentlessly focused on achieving their respective operational excellence targets. Achieving these targets is not easy. They're designed to stretch a business to deliver a step change and relative performance, and that's exactly what is happening through a lot of really good work by our employees.","Chart 13 highlights our OpEx accomplishments for 2015 and our annual target for 2016. The Timberlands business delivered $39 million of operational excellence improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $20 million to $30 million. These results were primarily driven by cost efficiency in three key areas. First, harvest and haul cost. We're continuing the implementation of centralized dispatch systems to improve the efficiency of logging and trucking contractors and replacing costly cable logging with steep slope technologies.","Second, spending on forest roads. We're adjusting the volume of rock relay during road construction and the level of road maintenance to match expected vehicle travel patterns and local weather conditions. Finally, silvicultural cost. Data we have collected on tree stand growth patterns enable us to custom-tailors silviculture prescriptions to apply pruning and hardwood control only to acres where those activities generate an optimal financial return.","With total OpEx improvements of $64 million since 2013, the Timberlands business has achieved the $50 million to $70 million improvement goal we established two years ago. However, we are not done. For 2016, we are targeting an additional $20 million to $30 million of OpEx improvements from our existing Timberlands holdings. This does not include the benefit we will get from applying our OpEx efforts to over 6 million acres of Plum Creek lands.","The Lumber business achieved $21 million of improvements in 2015, meeting its target of $20 million to $25 million. Primary drivers include improvements in reliability and process efficiency and rigorous cost management as we continue to drive down our cost net of logs. Each mill is focused on maintaining consistent throughput and improving uptime by resolving process and equipment issues that create bottlenecks or stop production.","Capital expenditures for the Lumber business increased in 2015 as we invested in low-risk, high-return projects to further improve the cost structure of our mills. These projects include auto graders and continuous dry kilns. We will capture the full benefits from several of these investments in 2016.","With cumulative improvements of over $40 million since 2013, the Lumber business is nearing halfway on its journey to $100 million of controllable manufacturing cost reductions. For 2016, the business is targeting OpEx improvement of $15 million to $20 million. Oriented strand board delivered $24 million of OpEx improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $10 million to $15 million. Results were driven by improving reliability as our mills focused on eliminating sources of downtime and recovering efficiently from outage events; lowering wax and resin costs as we optimize recipes for multiple products; and increasing our mix of higher-margin products such as flooring.","With cumulative improvements of $34 million, the OSB business is more than halfway to its $60 million goal. The business is targeting another $15 million to $20 million of OpEx improvements in 2016.","For Engineered Wood Products and Distribution, we set specific bottom-line EBITDA improvement target for 2015 as those businesses remain focused on turnaround performance. Engineered Wood Products improved full-year EBITDA by $35 million compared with 2014, significantly exceeding its $15 million to $20 million target. Each mill maintained a rigorous focus on reducing unit manufacturing cost for all products. For example, maintenance team shared best practices across the mill system, increasing reliability and reducing cost.","Engineered Wood Products has made a substantial improvement since 2013. Over the past two years, this business has increased annual EBITDA by almost $70 million, proving that it has the ability to perform. Our focus now is continuing to improve relative performance versus the competition. The 2016 goal for this business will not be a bottom line EBITDA target, but an OpEx improvement target of $10 million to $15 million.","Distribution improved full-year EBITDA by $8 million in 2015. The business fell short of its $20 million to $30 million improvement target as it was unable to overcome between effect of severe winter weather early in the year and lower than expected demand in the first half of 2015. 2015 OpEx improvements were largely attributable to improved product margins and reductions in head count, warehouse and delivery expenses.","Improvements made to the Distribution cost structure during 2015 have created a stronger foundation for better operating performance next year. In 2016, the distribution business is targeting bottom line EBITDA improvement of $15 million to $20 million.","Cellulose Fibers. Cellulose Fibers delivered operational excellence improvements of $47 million, significantly exceeding its $30 million to $35 million target. Improvements were primarily attributable to lower energy costs, driven by our new turbine generator at our Flint River mill and a boiler conversion at Columbus and reduced usage of key chemicals as several mills-adjusted processes are tied to their digesters and bleach plants.","During 2016, Cellulose Fibers is targeting improvements of $40 million to $50 million. With OpEx improvements of $75 million to-date, this would enable the business to exceed the $100 million goal established in 2013.","I'll also mention the reduction in our SG&A. Part of our commitment to operational excellence is having the right cost structure across our company. Two years ago, we committed to reduce SG&A about $75 million and achieve that run rate by the end of 2014. Last year, we told you we had delivered on that commitment, and you can see our performance in this year's results. Compared with 2013, we have reduced our SG&A by over $100 million.","Success in achieving our OpEx target was a critical component of Weyerhaeuser's 2015 financial performance, enabling us to offset pricing headwinds in many of our markets. In Timberlands, weaker year-over-year pricing for Western logs created a headwind of over $100 million. By exceeding its operational excellence target, the Timberlands business was able to overcome nearly half of that deficit.","Lower year-over-year realizations of 11% for lumber and 9% for OSB created a headwind of over $250 million for Wood Products earnings. However, the segment captured nearly $100 million of operational excellence improvement, significantly mitigating the effect of these lower prices and earnings for Wood Products declined less than $70 million on a year-over-year basis.","Cellulose Fibers made the headwind of over $100 million from declining pulp prices, higher fiber cost, and the effects of the West Coast port slowdown. The business offset nearly half of this amount through its OpEx efforts.","Looking forward to 2016, our relentless focus on operational excellence remains a key component of our commitment to improve our relative performance and drive value for shareholders.","I will close this morning with some brief comments on our merger with Plum Creek and the strategic review of our Cellulose Fibers business. The joint proxy and registration statement associated with our announced merger with Plum Creek was declared effective by the SEC on December 28. Both ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the proposals.","The shareholder vote will be held on February 12 and we anticipate closing the merger in the first quarter. Our joint integration team is making excellent progress as we define staffing needs, establish plan for cost synergy, and position the merged company for a smooth and successful day one. The review of Cellulose Fibers is proceeding well and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete.","As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us. Although the first few weeks of the year have been characterized by market turbulence and global macroeconomic concerns, I am encouraged by the positive trend in U.S. housing and the optimistic tone we are hearing from our customers. Our portfolio changes and operational improvements are positioning Weyerhaeuser to drive long-term value for shareholders. We will remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation, and I look forward to sharing our continued progress with you.","And now, I'd like to open up the phone for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","In Cellulose Fibers, your average prices were down, I think, around 10% year-over-year, which is maybe a little bit sharper than the list price decline. Can you remind us, was there any mix issues there or kind of what was driving the price decline? It seemed a little bit sharper than what we might have expected? And then, just related to Cellulose Fibers, you're targeting an acceleration of OpEx improvements in 2016, and I'm just wondering if you could give a little color on what's driving that kind of year-over-year.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me start. I'll address your second question with OpEx and then, I'll ask Patty to address your first question. And what I would tell you on OpEx is we're gaining a lot of traction across our businesses and specifically in Cellulose Fibers. What we found there through Cathy Slater's leadership is an abundance of ideas that are percolating up from a bottoms-up approach in terms of continuing to drive down our overall cost structure. The encouraging thing about OpEx overall, Anthony, that we've seen is, it started off as a top-down effort.","But as we defined winning, defined exactly what we mean by OpEx and people are incented to drive OpEx, we are having just more and more ideas bubble up in terms of the opportunities, and Cathy has a full slate of those outlined and proved in 2015 the ability to execute on those, and more to come in 2016. So, it's across the board, lower energy, lower chemicals, better reliability, all the safety blocking and tackling of running a Cellulose Fibers business.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Anthony. This is Patty. Your question on Cellulose Fibers, was it fourth quarter of 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015 in terms of...","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Yeah. Year-over-year.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. It really isn't anything significant as it relates to anything out of the ordinary. As you know, we do have a different mix in terms of both our product within our fluff mill, as well as our NBSK mill in Grande Prairie. But I wouldn't say there's anything out of the ordinary or strange about the pricing itself. It's just that the mix can change.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just shifting to Wood Products, can you share your operating rates across the three businesses? And I'm sorry if I missed this, but with OSB, can you just repeat kind of the trajectory of pricing that you're expecting into the first quarter?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Anthony. So in terms of operating rates, in the fourth quarter, Lumber was in the high-80s, OSB was in the low-90s, and ELP was in the low-70s. In terms of pricing for OSB, if you look at its current or first quarter to-date, average to-date is down about $7 versus the fourth quarter in terms of the OSB pricing.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Congratulations on the year. Doyle, if we can talk about operational excellence first. So you're two years into the program, you're more than achieving your goals. I'd have to imagine that you're getting to the proverbial fruit that's maybe hanging higher on the tree. So do you need to have a larger funnel to get to the goals in a year like 2015 relative to what would have been the case in \u2013 excuse me, 2016 relative to 2015 or 2014?","And then the related question, ultimately, running a business is a lot easier than running numbers on a spreadsheet if you're an analyst. But what's been so difficult about getting the OE benefits to the bottom line and distribution?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Yeah, thanks for the question, George. On OpEx, I think you said it exactly right. It does get more difficult as you move forward. But as I said in response to the earlier question, what I'm really encouraged about and why we're confident we're going to \u2013 be able to continue to deliver on OpEx targets is because it has become part of who we are. It is being done much more from a bottoms-up approach, George. So whereas previously, you would think that we're identified at the top and kind of driven down and now more and more of these ideas.","To your point, it's a larger funnel. More and more of our ideas are coming from our employee base, which they are the ones out there doing the hard work every day. When they understand what the opportunities are, recognize that they are empowered to go do something at those, and then send them (31:33) to do that, it's amazing what can happen. So, you're right, it is a different approach, but very encouraged by the progress. And most importantly, it's becoming part of our culture and that's why we're year-after-year, we believe, we're going to be able to continue to drive operational excellence as we move forward.","In terms of distribution, George, it's been \u2013 while we have made \u2013 and I think it's important to highlight, we have made an improvements there. And if you look at it, we've made $40 million plus improvements over the last two years in bottom line distribution EBITDA, but we're still not where we need to be to your point. This year, I hate using weather, but weather did have an impact in the first half of the year, slower than the expected demand, and then the fact that we had kind of eroding commodity prices throughout the year limited the ability to leverage the margin improvements.","As we said, we made some significant changes to the cost structure by closing four sites to reduce the footprint, the cost structure and really focus on our growth markets going forward. And I'll tell you, with those changes, we are confident that we're going to be able to continue to improve our distribution business. But still a lot of work to do there and still have work to do, frankly, to prove that we deserve to be in this business long term. With good progress and again with the structural changes we made in the fourth quarter, optimistic about that business going forward.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And my last question and I'll turn it over, two-part, unrelated, I guess that's two questions. First of all, what kind of pricing are you expecting on average for wood sequentially versus fourth quarter to hit your guidance? And then in SG&A, you've more than achieved your target. Should we assume that SG&A is now flat on a going-forward basis? Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, George. In terms of pricing, as Patty outlined, we anticipate prices will in fact be higher in Lumber in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. However, that's still in front of us. If you look at it currently, quarter-to-date, prices for Lumber are down approximately $7 versus the fourth quarter average. Encouraging, prices were up $4 or $5 this week. So, we'll see where it plays out. But normally, you start to see an inflection point in Lumber prices mid to late-February as the spring \u2013 as building season kicks in. And we would hope to see the same type of price inflection or improvement in OSB as we move through the quarter as well. And that's what's baked into \u2013 generally baked into our guidance for the first quarter.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, George. As you think about Wood Products, the primary price increase quarter-over-quarter that we have baked into our guidance is in Lumber and I would say we're looking for something low-single digits in Lumber. And OSB and Engineered Wood, combinations of those two, probably the results would \u2013 in our guidance would be roughly flat from a pricing perspective. But as Doyle has said, thus far for January, one month does not a quarter make, but we are down from the guidance that we have baked into the quarter.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And in terms of SG&A, George, we're always looking to drive down our SG&A costs and as we complete the merger with Plum Creek, as we already identified, there will be at least $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies. Most of that will be SG&A they did and then of course operational synergies on top of that. So like I said, we're never done on SG&A and the focus after the closure of the merger will quickly turn to the \u2013 to hard dollar cost synergies that we outlined when we announced that merger.","George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Collin.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Good morning.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","First question. I just wanted to follow up on George's question. Just as it relates to closing the four distribution centers, can you quantify how much of a lift and run rate as far as EBITDA within the distribution business? How much that specifically will provide a lift in 2016?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, as we said, we did close four sites. These were markets with limited growth potential and high cost. And we think, as a result of that, we've laid out our OpEx target for 2016, and we are confident with these changes, Collin, that we will meet these specific targets that we laid out for 2016 in terms of bottom line EBITDA improvement of $15 million to $20 million in that business.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. I'll just \u2013 is there any way to think about how much of a drag maybe those facilities were in 2015 or you don't really break it out that way?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We don't really break it out that way, Collin. I'll just tell you, it does significantly improve our cost structure. It gets us focused on the markets that we need to be focused on. And I think it's going to be a big benefit as we move in to 2016.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Then, moving to Timberlands, just maybe as we enter the year here, just update us on your latest thinking as it relates to the potential improvement in sawlog prices in the U.S. South this year? What are you thinking about for 2016 and then, just more broadly (37:09) continue to extend, just how you're thinking about the price recovery in the South?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So, if you think about Southern log prices, Collin, our prices were up a couple of percent in 2015 versus 2014, and we would anticipate a similar increase in 2016 versus 2015.","From a broader picture, if U.S. housing starts continue to improve, demand for lumber will rise. And we expect the tension and rising prices across the Southern log markets, we are confident that's going to continue to pay out.","And frankly, the additional mills, whether it be the Canadians coming down and investing in mills and increasing the productivity of those mills or Klausner adding the three mills that they're adding, that's all positive from a demand standpoint for Southern sawlogs as well.","So we are \u2013 we remain confident that we're going to reach that inflection point and see Southern sawlog prices begin to rise on a more aggressive basis than the 2% that we've seen over the last couple of years.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then switching gears and recognizing there are some limitations, I recognize what you can say is related to disclosure. But I do want to touch on the financial projections in the proxies internally within Weyerhaeuser. I was curious if you could provide any color on the kind of a drop in expected EBITDA and expected FAD reference between 2016 and 2017 on really Weyerhaeuser on a standalone basis. Any additional color you can provide on that?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, I don't think there's anything additional that we can say about that at this point.","Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. All right. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Hi. Good morning, Patty and Doyle. First question is on the \u2013 thanks. As you think about the analysis with the Cellulose division, I understand since most of its legacy proctor (39:22) properties bought 25 years ago, the basis is low. And I guess the way we need \u2013 would help me to think about this, obviously, if you do a spin, you would avoid some capital gain tax, I believe.","But on the other hand, if you do the spin, there's a lot of cost, I guess, in terms of setting up a public company that you would not have to incur if you're just doing a direct sale of the assets. And I guess can you give me some feel for the trade-off of that? I mean, can you actually put a rough dollar cost of pursuing a spin versus just a sale?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Chip, this is Patty. I think as we think about Cellulose Fibers strategic review, we're looking at all of those alternatives and evaluating them. I couldn't put any dollars on them at this point. You are correct in that the tax basis for Cellulose Fibers is low. And so, we would have on a cash sale a tax, a gain, but we would have to compare that to what we would get in terms of a spin and both in terms of time as well as cost of setting up a separate company. But as we have done with all of our other strategic reviews over the course of time, we are looking at a broad range of options at this point.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And when you look at the distribution business, I know that it's really nice to see how every business has hit their targets, obviously, Doyle, the last couple of three years except for that one. And I didn't know if you were \u2013 just sort of give us an update on your thinking in terms of sort of how much more of time do they have before you might consider strategic review of that business.","And then maybe just more broadly, is your thinking toward all the Wood Products segment, all the manufacturing, has that changed at all in light of the Plum Creek deal in terms of would this be an area that you \u2013 in other words, do you want to be a pure Timber play and maybe it's not as strategic?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, Chip, let me \u2013 since it's Super Bowl weekend, let me use a football analogy on distribution.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. But you guys aren't in it?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, I guess (41:45)...","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Sorry.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","... rough around the air (41:45).","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Don't remind us, Chip.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Everybody's walking around with a frown on their face. But in terms of distribution, Chip, I would tell you, as I mentioned earlier, we have made improvements in that business. I think the business has earned the right to continue to be on the field at this point, but has not earned a spot on the roster. So, like I said earlier, still more to do, encouraged by the progress. Like I said, we made some significant changes in the fourth quarter of 2015 and we're confident that that's going to help us accelerate progress in distribution going forward, so more work to do.","In terms of Wood Products overall, Chip, as you've heard us say and me say historically, we believe that this can be a very good business and create a lot of value for shareholders over a cycle, assuming that you run it effectively and get the cost structure to where it needs to be, where you're back at the bottom and that you're fully capitalizing on the upturn in housing that we still have in front of us. We're encouraged by the progress we've made on the overall cost structure and our OpEx improvements and still more to come, and like I said, very well positioned to continue to capitalize on the improvement in housing as we move forward.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Two things. The rating agencies have said that given the terms of the deal, they'd probably downgrade Weyerhaeuser. Since you've said you want to remain acquisitive, would it make sense to scale back or slow down the buybacks to keep the agencies happy? And the second question is maybe a little more theoretical, WestRock has said publicly, it wants to get out of its land deals faster. Would that be something that might fit with your priorities? You've talked about wanting to expand, but is cleaning up those JVs something that might be attractive to you?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, let me talk about the acquisitive part and I'll turn it over to Patty to talk about the rating agency. Mark, we have said that we would like to grow the company. We said that our primary opportunities were in Timberlands and thus, the Plum Creek transaction. I'll tell you, in the near term, our focus and maybe our singular focus is going to be on fully integrating Plum Creek and making sure we fully realize the synergy and the value of that transaction. So, in the near term, that's going to be our primary focus and our plate's full on that. Longer term as we integrate that and get the full benefit, continuing to grow the company assuming we can find the right opportunities is something we would consider, but right now, our focus is on Plum Creek and the integration thereof.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And Mark, as to your question about the rating agencies, S&P did write that based upon their understanding of what the leverage would look like after we close the transaction in order to repurchase the shares, as we've talked about that, the leverage will be certainly higher than where we have historically been. And so, based upon their understanding, at this point, they would expect that they would downgrade us from BBB to BBB minus, so still investment grade. We are focused on bringing that leverage down as we go forward. We are still committed to the $2.5 billion of share repurchase, but certainly mindful that we'll need to bring the leverage down going forward and we think we'll have good opportunities to do that, both with respect to the broader portfolio of 13 million acres of timberland as well as depending upon the outcome of the strategic review of Cellulose Fibers.","Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC","Super. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Mark.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","The whole Weyerhaeuser team has done an impressive job over the last couple of years. I had a few questions. One, Doyle, can you just clarify for us on the review of Cellulose, especially, does that include things like the NORPAC joint venture and the bleached board mill at Longview?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. So first, let me say thank you for those comments, Mark. And then secondly, yes, the strategic review of Cellulose Fibers includes all of the businesses in Cellulose Fibers.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And then to kind of follow on, on Mark's question about the rating agency, I mean there are some other things that you could look at divesting like the business down in Uruguay, which is still not generating a lot of cash. Any thoughts on that, Doyle?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we've said, as part of the integration process, we'll do a thorough analysis of all 13-plus million acres with 13-plus million acres and the fact, Mark, and I think this is an important one to highlight, with the recent tax extender package, reducing the build-in gains period permanently to five years, we no longer have that constraint. So, 13 million acres with \u2013 plus no longer being under the built-in gains tax. We have lots of flexibility in terms of what we could do going forward.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Now, last question I had is to kind of come back to something Collin Mings raised and that is you've got a lot of capital tied up in Southern timberland and you're going to commit a lot more capital here pretty quickly to Southern timberland. But if we look at the cash returns on Southern Timber, they've been pretty anemic for about a decade now. What gives you the confidence that these returns are going to improve significantly over the next few years, and what do you think that trajectory looks like?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Mark, what gives me confidence and gives us confidence is basically supply and demand. And as you know, ultimately that works. And if you just look at it from a housing continuing to improve and housing has improved, it's been slow but steady. So, I think that's going to be what's going to happen on the demand front.","And on the supply front, if housing continues to improve, the supply is not going to come from the Pacific Northwest, the supply is not going to come from Canada. Yeah, we see a little influx now because of exchange rates in China, but ultimately, they, being Canada are limited because of the pine beetle situation as to what they're going to be able to provide. So, supply and demand works. We're going to reach that inflection point. And when we do, that's when we're going to see a significant change in Southern sawlog prices.","So, yeah, it comes slower than any of us would have expected or hoped, but if you just look at the basic supply and demand, we remain confident that we will in fact see improved prices for Southern sawlog just like we have historically.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And, Doyle, just to follow on this, we all, I think, buy into supply and demand. But on the supply side, it seems like for many years here because of the weakness in housing, we've really been under-harvesting the growth rates down in the South. So we've got some accumulated inventory, and I just wonder how that accumulated inventory affects the rebound in pricing.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Mark, that's a really good point and there's no doubt that there is some accumulated inventory as housing has improved over the last couple of years, we have started to work through some of that accumulated inventory, but there's still some out there. So that's why I'll say there's still a little bit of time, if housing continues, to improve to work through accumulated inventory. But once we do that, you can hit that inflection point of supply and demand, and that's where you start to see the significant increase in pricing.","Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. I'll turn it over. Good luck in 2016, Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. First, a numbers-oriented question. Just on the Cellulose Fibers business, can you provide us with at least preliminary estimates on the maintenance expense and scheduled maintenance outage days for the \u2013 for 2016 by quarter if possible? Is that something you have handy?","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, we can't give it to you by quarter, Mark. I can tell you that as you think about fourth quarter to first quarter and the guidance that there's about roughly $10 million of additional maintenance expense in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-on to that, the $40 million to $50 million of OpEx improvement in Cellulose Fibers, does much or any of that come from being able to effectively reduce maintenance outage expenses? So will we see it in not variable year-to-year?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That is not a key driver of the OpEx improvement that we laid out, Mark. There is, of course, some benefit as we go into the 18-month schedule, but that's not the big driver of what we saw in 2015 versus 2014 nor we'll see in 2016 versus 2015.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. And then, maybe lastly, kind of following on Mark Wilde's question a little bit. One of the components of the bullish lumber, as well as log story has been the expected reduction in supply coming from British Columbia related to the beetle, et cetera. It doesn't seem to have happened yet and lots of reasons maybe that (51:48). Are you still of that view that we will see a reduction and any color you can provide on how that might play into the market?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, Mark. We are absolutely confident that that's going to happen and all you have to do is spend some time in that area and see the devastation that the pine beetle has, in fact, caused. You're starting to see some announcement as you know of some lumber mill closures because of that. I think what's happened is, part of that has just been distorted by the fact that there's been less demand from China. So, some of the impact from lumber that would normally would get on to China has come to the U.S. and that has temporarily offset the pine beetle situation. But if you just look at what the allowable cuts are, if you look at just the overall fiber situation in Canada, we are confident that the pine beetle scenario is going to play out.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","Yes. Thanks very much. Just looking at your overall volumes in both Timber, well I guess, Timber, Lumber and OSB. What are you planning for 2016? I noticed 2015 Timber volumes were down but you had gains in Lumber and OSB. Just wondering at a higher level what the plan is.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So, we would say unit for 2016 in terms of sawlogs overall, we would then anticipate volumes from being flat to maybe down just very slightly. In terms of Lumber and OSB, part of that of course will be dependent on markets. But as we continue to improve our reliability, we would think Lumber and OSB volumes will be up slightly in 2016 versus 2015.","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And just a follow-up, just a flat to down on the log side, is that related to not so robust markets or is that because you're logging at a sustainable level?","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think it's more related to the fact that we're logging at sustainable levels. As we said, we have the ability in any given year to flex 5% or maybe a little more depending on markets. So we'll see how that plays out and that will ultimately determine what the harvest levels are. But basically, we are harvesting at sustainable levels.","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","Great. That's where I'll put the vote.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","All right. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Doyle for any final remarks.","Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you and thank you for everybody's interest today. Before I \u2013 or in closing today, I want to say some words about Patty as this will be her last earnings call on behalf of Weyerhaeuser as she will retire later this year. Specifically, I want to acknowledge her outstanding work as the CFO since 2007 and personally thank her for partnering with me over the last couple of years as we've taken significant steps to make Weyerhaeuser a truly great company. Thank you, Patty, for all you've done for Weyerhaeuser.","Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, Doyle, let me, just before you close the call, interject one additional thank you to the analyst community on the call. We are very fortunate as a company to have a whole host of very knowledgeable people, and I've enjoyed the dialogue over the years.","And as I do retire from Weyerhaeuser now, I feel very confident in the management team going forward, really pleased with the progress that we've made on portfolio performance and capital allocation, and couldn't be more pleased with my successor, once we close this transaction, Russell Hagan. I think that as we go forward, since I will continue to be a significant shareholder, I think that we have a lot of additional capabilities and levers to pull to create ongoing value for shareholders.","So, Doyle, thanks to you and thanks to the whole senior management team and employees of Weyerhaeuser.","Doyle R.

I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth Baum","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2019 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.","On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagan, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.","Devin Stockfish","All right. Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported a first quarter GAAP loss of $289 million or $0.39 per diluted share on net sales of $1.6 billion. This loss was driven by a previously announced $0.47 noncash special charge related to the transfer of pension assets and liabilities through the purchase of a group annuity contract. Excluding special items, we earned $80 million in the quarter or $0.11 per diluted share, an improvement of 14% compared with the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $365 million, $19 million more than the fourth quarter.","I'm proud of our first quarter results as each of our businesses delivered strong operating performance and increased EBITDA despite the slower-than-expected pace of U.S. housing starts in the first quarter. We also continued to demonstrate our commitment to disciplined capital allocation as we repurchased $60 million of our common shares, reduced our pension liabilities by $1.5 billion through the annuity purchase transaction and refinanced our 2019 debt maturity at a very favorable rate.","In a moment, I'll dive into our business results. But first, let me set the stage with some brief comments on the housing market. U.S. housing activity has rebounded slowly from low fourth quarter levels as the spring selling and building seasons have been slow to gain momentum. First quarter housing starts averaged approximately 1.2 million on a seasonally adjusted basis. This is an improvement of 1% compared with the fourth quarter but lower than the first quarter of 2018.","Several factors appear to have contributed to the softer first quarter activity. An unusual and lengthy stretch of severe rain, snow and cold across much of North America, particularly in February, deterred prospective buyers at the start of the spring selling season and curtailed construction activity in many regions.","Higher inventories of new homes for sale entering 2019 delayed the demand for housing starts as builders sold through completed inventory. And buyers were slow to reenter the housing market following the fourth quarter's financial market volatility. Activity has picked up as the year has progressed. Builders report that buyer traffic and new home sales are improving monthly, and we are seeing signs of momentum as winter weather clears and we move deeper into spring.","First quarter new home sales were 15% above fourth quarter levels, and March sales were the highest in nearly 18 months. Western housing starts increased 30% in March compared with February as rain and snow receded. And we are hearing of increased demand for cement and rebar in a number of areas, signs that foundations are being poured. Our customers also tell us that builders continue to adjust product offerings to increase the proportion of affordable product in response to market demand. Near- and long-term economic fundamentals remain supportive of increased building activity.","Mortgage rates are approximately 75 basis points below their November peak, and mortgage purchase applications are near 10-year highs. Permit activity remains solid, averaging approximately 1.3 million through the first quarter, and overall economic fundamentals remain positive with increasing real wages, unemployment at 50-year lows and strong job growth in key housing markets.","Repair and remodel spending, which comprises about 40% of lumber demand, also remains strong and is forecasted to rise 6% to 7% this year. These favorable signs are balanced however by continued constraints around labor and lot availability. The supply of construction labor remains tight.","Although construction activity has some capacity to catch up for delayed first quarter starts, it will be challenging to recover all of that activity this year. As a result, we have tempered our 2019 housing start expectations to be slightly below 1.3 million starts. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in housing, with that growth primarily attributable to increased single-family activity.","Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 4 through 6. Timberlands contributed $120 million to first quarter earnings and $193 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA increased $5 million compared with the fourth quarter as results improved in each of our geographic regions. Western Timberlands EBITDA increased by $3 million compared with the fourth quarter. Lower average realizations were more than offset by lower costs, primarily for forestry and roads. We typically do less forestry activity and roadbuilding during the cold winter months. We also deferred some silviculture activity due to unusually severe winter weather.","In the Western domestic market, log demand remained moderate through most of the first quarter due to continued low lumber prices. Log availability was adequate early in the quarter but decreased in February and March due to strong storms, which brought several feet of snow and heavy winds to many parts of the Pacific Northwest.","Our teams did an excellent job of flexing harvest plans so that we could maintain production and capitalize on pricing, which improved throughout the quarter. I will note that the weather in Southern Oregon was particularly severe, and we lost several days of harvest activity and incurred some storm damage on our property in that area. We don't expect this to have a material impact on us, but we will see some modestly higher logging costs in the second half of this year as we bring the affected wood to market.","Moving to the export markets. In China, sales volumes and realizations for our logs declined modestly compared with the fourth quarter in connection with the typical slowdown in construction activity during the Lunar New Year. Log inventories at Chinese ports increased significantly during the Lunar New Year period and remained elevated through the first quarter as demand was slow to pick up coming out of the holiday. Over the last several weeks, however, we have seen log takeaway increase and return to more normalized levels.","In Japan, post-and-beam housing starts have increased 3% year-to-date through February and demand for our logs remains steady. Our export log sales volumes to Japan were comparable to the fourth quarter. This was a higher sales volume than we had initially expected and was attributable to the timing of vessels during the quarter.","Average sales realizations for our Japanese export logs declined moderately. Overall, first quarter export revenues were lower than the year ago quarter due to lower realizations for our Japan and China logs.","Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands EBITDA increased by $1 million compared with the fourth quarter. Average realizations for our Southern logs increased approximately 3% as extremely wet weather limited log supply and drove improved realizations for sawlogs and pulpwood across most of the South.","Fee harvest volume decreased 5% as higher log sales volumes were offset by seasonally lower stumpage sales. On the export side, Southern log export volumes decreased slightly and average realizations were roughly flat. Comparing overall Southern Timberlands results with the year ago quarter, EBITDA declined due to lower harvest volumes and slightly higher harvest and haul costs. In 2018, we harvested a greater proportion of our annual volume during the first quarter.","Northern Timberlands EBITDA increased by $1 million compared with the fourth quarter. Fee harvest volume was comparable and average realizations improved modestly due to mix as we harvested a greater proportion of hardwood-grade logs. Compared with the year ago, EBITDA from Northern Timberlands increased by $1 million due to the timing of harvest volume.","Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 7 and 8. Real Estate and ENR contributed $55 million to first quarter earnings and $106 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA was $16 million higher than the fourth quarter and $65 million higher than a year ago. As we indicated during our fourth quarter earnings call, although buyer traffic is typically slower during the winter months, strong real estate activity in the fourth quarter of 2018 allowed us to pursue additional transactions that closed in the first quarter.","The number of acres sold in the first quarter increased over 20% compared with the fourth quarter and was up over 75% compared with the year ago. Average price per acre was comparable to the fourth quarter on a generally similar geographic mix. First quarter Real Estate sales included a slightly higher portion of Southern acres and fewer Western and Northern acres. Compared with the year ago quarter, average price per acre increased significantly due to a much smaller proportion of sales for Montana where Timberland prices are regionally lower. Wood Products, Charts 9 and 10. Wood Products contributed $69 million to first quarter earnings and $115 million to adjusted EBITDA. Compared with the fourth quarter, earnings and EBITDA increased significantly despite flat to lower pricing for our commodity products. EBITDA for lumber increased $41 million compared with the fourth quarter. This was almost entirely attributable to lower log and manufacturing costs.","Lumber prices were flat through most of January and improved moderately in February in anticipation of the spring building season. With building activities slower to materialize, prices stabilized and then eroded slightly toward the end of the quarter. The framing lumber composite price averaged 2% higher for the first quarter compared with the fourth and our average realizations increased 1%. Lumber sales volumes increased 3% in the first quarter. Our log costs decreased substantially in the first quarter as Western and Canadian log costs declined and the benefit of lower fourth quarter log costs was also included in our financial results. Unit manufacturing costs also decreased significantly compared with the fourth quarter as our lumber system achieved the lowest first quarter controllable manufacturing cost per unit that we have ever reported. This comes despite several days of downtime at one of our Oregon lumber mills due to severe snow and wind.","First quarter EBITDA includes $3 million of charges for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. Comparing our first quarter results with the year ago quarter, EBITDA decreased significantly due to lower average realizations, partially offset by lower log and manufacturing costs. OSB EBITDA decreased $12 million compared with the fourth quarter due to lower average realizations. OSB pricing entered the first quarter below the fourth quarter average and remained flat at that level.","First quarter benchmark North-Central pricing averaged 13% below the fourth quarter, and our average realizations declined $29 per 1,000 square feet or 12%. Sales volumes increased 8% compared with the fourth quarter, and operating rates and manufacturing costs improved as our Grayling mill returned to full production following a press replacement that was completed in late October.","Comparing our first quarter results to the year ago quarter, EBITDA was significantly lower due to a 29% decrease in average sales realizations. Engineered wood products EBITDA increased by $21 million compared with the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for solid section products increased 4%, and average realizations for I-joists increased by 1%. Sales volumes for solid section and I-joists products decreased due to sluggish first quarter construction activity, particularly in the West as well as continued efforts by dealers and builders to maintain lower product inventories.","Fiber costs declined due to lower cost for logs and oriented strand board web stock, and unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher operating rates. Compared with the year ago quarter, higher average realizations and lower cost for logs and oriented strand board were largely offset by lower sales volumes. Distribution EBITDA increased by $2 million compared with the fourth quarter due to improved product margins and was lower than a year ago due to lower sales volumes.","I'd like to now turn to operational excellence. Our businesses are making good progress against our collective 2019 operational excellence target of $80 million to $100 million. During the first quarter, our biggest OpEx benefits in Timberlands came from initiatives related to logging and hauling efficiencies in our Southern operations as well as our continued marketing and bucking for value improvement efforts.","In Wood Products, our greatest benefits came from our ongoing initiatives to reduce controllable manufacturing costs for lumber and OSB. Our Real Estate business is also on track to meet or exceed its targeted 30% premium to timber value. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook.","Russell Hagen","Thanks, Devin, and good morning. Key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Chart 13 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million to $30 million lower than the first quarter. About half of that is due to seasonality around our forestry and road spending, and the other half relates to the timing of our export shipments.","At our Western Timberland operations, we expect second quarter harvest volumes will be comparable to the first quarter. Domestic log inventories are at normal levels, with supply and demand largely balanced as supply returned to the market following first quarter's severe storms. We anticipate our second quarter average domestic sales realizations will be modestly higher than the first quarter average. Forestry and road spending will also increase as we enter the spring and summer months. In Japan, housing starts are expected to remain healthy, driven by strength in the high-end post-and-beam construction market that we serve.","We continue to see strong demand for our Japanese export logs and expect average log sales realizations in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter. Average sales realizations for our Chinese export logs are expected to be lower than the first quarter. Although inventories at Chinese ports are relatively high, we expect them to trend downward over the next couple of months as construction activity and log takeaway have ramped up to more normal levels following the Lunar New Year holiday. We expect our Western export log sales volumes, both Japan and China, will be lower in the second quarter due to the timing of shipments at the end of the first quarter. In the South, we expect second quarter average sales realizations will be comparable to the first quarter. Fee harvest volumes should be slightly higher and we expect a greater portion of pulpwood as we shift to more thinning activities in the second quarter.","Forestry spending in the South is expected to increase, which is typical coming into the spring. In the North, we anticipate second quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly lower than the first quarter as we enter the spring breakup season.","Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the first quarter but approximately 30% higher than the second quarter of 2018, driven by favorable Real Estate activity. We expect second quarter land bases as a percentage of Real Estate sales to be approximately 60%. Markets remain active and we continue to see strong interest in Real Estate from high-net-worth individuals, recreation and conservation buyers. As a result, the cadence of our Real Estate sales would be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year compared with the usual seasonal pattern.","In our Energy and Natural Resources operations, we anticipate that second quarter royalties will be comparable to the first quarter. For the full year 2019, we now expect approximately $270 million of adjusted EBITDA for our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We anticipate that land bases as a percentage of Real Estate sales will be between 45% and 55% for the full year 2019. For Wood Products, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be higher than the first quarter due to seasonally higher sales volumes and improved operating rates across all product lines. This is before any benefit from improving prices.","For lumber, second quarter to date average sales realizations are approximately $15 higher than the first quarter average, and current realizations are approximately $10 higher than the first quarter average. Many of our builder customers who were delayed by adverse weather conditions in the first quarter are eager to resume a normal construction schedule. In areas of the country where wet and wintry weather conditions have receded, we're seeing improved demand. As a reminder, every $10 change in lumber realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. In late March, we started up our newly expanded sawmill in Millport, Alabama. And when ramp-up phase is completed over the next 12 to 18 months, our capacity will increase by 250 million board feet.","For oriented strand board, second quarter to date realizations are comparable to the first quarter average, and current realizations are approximately $10 below the first quarter average. As a reminder, every $10 change in OSB realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $51 million compared with the fourth quarter 2018. In the first quarter, we had noncash charges from elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO, foreign exchange and share-based compensation. Fourth quarter included income from these items.","First quarter pretax special items include a $455 million noncash pension settlement charge and a $20 million legal charge. Excluding the pension settlement charge, our first quarter noncash nonoperating pension benefit cost was lower than the fourth quarter. We continue to expect to record approximately $60 million of expense for the full year 2019.","Now I'd like to update you on our key financial items, which are summarized on Chart 12. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $259 million. Cash used in operations during the first quarter was $14 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow due to inventory and other working capital build as well as higher quarterly interest payments. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $59 million. We continue to expect total CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $400 million, $120 million for Timberlands inclusive of reforestation costs and $270 million for Wood Products and $10 million for planned corporate IT system investments. As discussed on our last conference call, during the first quarter, we received $250 million of cash proceeds from the maturity of a note held by a variable interest entity that was established as part of a timber installment sale in early 2000s.","Turning to financing activities. We repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock in the first quarter for a total of $60 million. At the end of the first quarter, we had $440 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with approximately $6.4 billion of total debt outstanding. And during the quarter, we issued $750 million of 4% notes due in 2029. Subsequently redeemed, the $500 million 7 3\/8% notes that were due in October 2019 and incurred a $12 million pretax charge due to the early redemption. This charge for early extinguishment of debt is included in our results as a special item. Excluding that special item, first quarter interest expense was $95 million. We now expect full year 2019 interest expense will be between $370 million and $380 million, excluding special items.","Moving on to taxes. For the second quarter and full year 2019, we now expect the effective tax rate will be between 7% and 10%, excluding special items. We expect minimum cash taxes in 2019 due to a $90 million federal income tax refund associated with the $300 million pension contribution that we made in the third quarter of 2018. We expect to receive that refund later this year.","Now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.","Devin Stockfish","Thank you, Russell. Looking forward, we anticipate modest year-over-year U.S. housing growth and expect that building activity will accelerate as we move into spring and summer with improved weather and continued macroeconomic stability. We remain focused on delivering operational excellence and industry-leading performance to fully capitalize on a wide range of market conditions and drive superior value for our shareholders. And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Mark Wilde with the Bank of Montreal.","Mark Wilde","Really nice quarter, much better than we expected. I wondered, Russ, if you could just help us peel the onion a little bit on the quarter-to-quarter gains and in performance in both lumber and EWP. I know you mentioned kind of log costs, but those costs must have been down even more than we would have anticipated. And you also mentioned in EWP, part of it is always big. But if you could just put a little more color on that, that would be helpful.","Russell Hagen","Sure. So for lumber, as you mentioned, we did have lower log costs coming out of the fourth quarter so that was very much beneficial coming in the first quarter. And we also had improved operating performance coming into the first quarter. And similarly to EWP, we had a lower cost structure, they ran very well coming into the first quarter, and that really contributed to their overall improved performance.","Mark Wilde","And then I wondered, Devin, can you give us any perspective on what you guys see in terms of inventory sitting in the distribution channels right now?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. Sure, Mark. Well, so it's -- I'd say for lumber and OSB, the inventories through the channel are probably a little on the full side. And so I think as we saw the building activity be -- start off the year a little slower than we had expected, you did see inventory levels build up a little bit. Our view is that as we see the construction activity really start picking up, that's going to flush through probably a little bit quicker on the lumber side than the OSB side just because we did see a little bit more supply coming online at the end of 2018 and 2019.","On the EWP side, I'd say probably inventory levels are at reasonable levels. And some of the customers may be even keeping a little bit lower inventories than normal. But I'd say on balance in EWP, it's probably about normal for this time of the year.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Last thing for me. Just any sense from your perspective on sort of where mills in both the Northwest and up in Canada are sitting relative to cash costs right now, because it looks to me like pretty much everybody must be under water.","Devin Stockfish","Yes. So Mark, I can't really comment on what our competitor is doing other than just to note, obviously, we've seen the announcements, as you have, on some of the curtailments and closures in those regions. For us, the way we've been really approaching our business in general is that we're really focused on OpEx and getting our cost structure in place so that we can be cash flow positive or breakeven even under these types of pricing environments. And so that's generally where we sit at this point.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George Staphos","I guess my first question, Devin, if you could comment -- what's your current estimate of operating rates this year, if you could provide one, for -- across your Wood Products businesses? And also, do you think that, switching gears to the OSB market, it can be in balance this year with your current estimate of housing? And if not, what do you think needs to happen there?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, sure. So on your first question, in lumber, we're -- our operating rates for Q1 were in the low 90s. In OSB, they're in the mid-90s and EOP, they were in the kind of low 80s for operating rates. With respect to OSB, my sense is that it's going to take a little time for us to have the demand catch up with the supply with the new mills coming online and really getting up full.","There's probably going to be a little bit more inventory in the system this year until we catch up from a demand perspective. Now that being said, I do think if we see the continued housing construction activity build into the spring and summer season and demand gets back up to where we think it ultimately will be, that should come back into balance over the course of the year and into 2020.","George Staphos","Okay. And coming back to EWP again, Mark hit on this as well. I mean we were very impressed with your performance there. I took from your comments, there was nothing one-off in nature. Obviously, had a little bit better pricing realization too. But is there anything in the first quarter performance in EWP that's not repeatable in the second quarter over the course of the year?","Devin Stockfish","I think the answer to that is really no. Obviously, we got some benefit across all of Wood Products, including EWP, from lower log and fiber costs. And so we would expect that to continue really into Q2 on some extent. And then the other piece is just improved unit manufacturing costs, and we are hyper-focused on that with our OpEx initiatives. And so not only do we think that, that will carry over, we would expect that to even improve over the course of the year as we continue to focus on operating costs across the system.","George Staphos","Okay. My last question and I'll turn it over. Kind of one is more of a confirmation point. I took from your guidance on Timberlands again that you're not seeing anything other than normal seasonal increases in harvest costs and that's part of what is driving the sequential decline 2Q versus 1Q, but I want a confirmation on that. And then there was a legal charge of $20 million in the quarter, if I saw that correctly. Could you remind us what that was around?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. Maybe I'll take the first one and then Russell can take the second one. Just in terms of the quarter-over-quarter, really, on the Timberlands segment basis, it's really a couple of things. It's about half of that relates to the ordinary cost increases that you see in Q2. So we build more roads, we have higher forestry expenses, we did defer a little bit of silviculture in Q1 that's going to get pushed to Q2. So that's about half of it.","The other half is really just around timing of vessel shipments. And so we had a couple of ships that ordinarily, we are -- going into the quarter, we thought would ship out in Q2. They moved up a little bit into Q1. So that's the other piece. And then the last piece, which is a smaller piece of the puzzle is just, as you know, in the northern business, we go through spring breakup and so you see the volumes come down. And so that's really the driver of Q2 versus Q1.","Russell Hagen","And George, on the $15 million after-tax legal charge, that's just for potential settlement of various legal matters.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Devin, on the homebuilding front, you talked about builders adjusting their offerings to bring some more affordable product to market. And I'm just wondering, should we interpret that as a move from larger formats to smaller formats or single family to multifamily? And I guess as you kind of lower your estimates for full year starts a little bit, is there also potentially kind of a change in mix that could impact kind of aggregate demand for wood products?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. And so really, when we're talking about the more affordable price points, that's really in the single-family space, so it's not a comment on mix from single to multis. I think it's really -- it's a host -- a whole host of things, Anthony. It's maybe smaller footprints in some geographies, it's different amenity packages, all the things that they can do to really meet that lower price point where a lot of the demand is.","And so we are seeing some of that. You saw some of that, I think, on our earnings calls for various homebuilders. And certainly, that's what we're hearing out in the market. In terms of overall wood demand, my view is it's much better for us to the extent that the builders can make more houses, even if they're a little bit smaller. On aggregate, that's better for wood demand.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful. And then earlier this month, WTO issued a ruling on U.S.-Canada lumber dispute that was maybe a little mixed for U.S. producers. I was wondering if you could just give your take on it. And then just today the trade issue, we're kind of hearing rumblings of maybe potentially a resolution to the U.S.-China trade dispute. Is that something that your customers are anticipating or potentially buying -- impacting buying behavior or any kind of thoughts on U.S.-China trade as well?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. Sure. With respect to the WTO decision, I think from a U.S. perspective, it was moderately positive. But again, just kind of stepping back, our view now is really that this is something that's going to play through the various channels of appeals through WTO and NAFTA over a course of several years. I think we're still early in that process. But at some point, I assume that we will come to some sort of agreement, which we believe should be quota-based. But I think we're still a ways off from that.","In terms of the China agreement, obviously, there's a delegation going over to China early in May. We're optimistic that they're going to make continued progress there. I think on balance, the feeling with our customers is probably more optimistic and positive than it was a few months ago. But it's really hard to tell exactly how those talks are coming along. We're optimistic that it will get resolved at some point. And I think importantly, we're really well positioned if and when those tariffs do come off to reaccelerate the growth out of our Southern business. And I think in the West, it's really not had a big impact on us out of our Western export business, which is the 5% tariff. But that being said, we certainly would like to see that go away so we can get back to a completely normalized environment.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Thanks for all the comments on the 2Q outlook. I know you guys don't give guidance, but just putting it all together, does it sort of seem like in the ballpark of sort of being in line with the 1Q number, sort of flat quarter-over-quarter, assuming current Wood Product prices?","Russell Hagen","I mean you're right. We don't give specific guidance, but I think if you kind of add it up, absent change in pricing, we give you some relative parameters around what the pricing impact would be looking quarter-over-quarter. You can probably piece it all together and then factor in the pricing.","Devin Stockfish","Yes. And I would just add to that. From a Q2 perspective -- and you're talking about Wood Products specifically, Brian?","Brian Maguire","No. I was hoping the company as a whole.","Devin Stockfish","Well, so just a couple of additional comments there. On a Q2 versus Q1 basis, we do think that Wood Products is going to be higher EBITDA. And that's -- even putting pricing aside, it's largely a reflection on continued improved operating rates and continued focus on costs. And so that in and of itself, we think, is going to be the driver. Pricing will just be an upside to that. And then again, the other piece just on Timberlands, as we said, that's going to be down versus Q1, but that's primarily just a reflection on timing and some seasonal cost.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Got it. And then it was good to see the Southern log price realizations tick up a little bit in the quarter, and I guess the outlook for 2Q implies that we stay at similar levels. Just wondering if you could parse out how much of that is maybe due to weather impacts or mix versus the long-awaited sort of tightness in that market that we've been predicting for many years?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. And so we absolutely saw a healthy increase in pricing. And I'll tell you, I think the majority of that is due to weather. We had a really, really wet Q1 and that kept inventory levels low. It kept supply levels moderated, and so that was really reflected in the pricing that you saw. That being said, I do think we are starting to see some of those pockets that we've been talking about for years really start the tension where we have the new capacity coming online and running full. And certainly, we've seen that in areas of Central Mississippi, some areas in Arkansas, a few geographies in Alabama and most recently in Northern Louisiana.","And so as we said, when that new mill capacity comes online and gets up and running full in that geography, that micro region, we are seeing some pricing tension. So on balance, I think the price increase was largely driven by weather, but we are starting to see the early signs of some tensioning in some of those micro markets.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Last one for me. Just thoughts on cash flow this year? I know you give some components like CapEx there, and I think that some of that is maybe discretionary over the long term. But how do you think about this year's free cash flow, ability to fund the dividend, continued share repurchases? Because it does seem like obviously, we're at sort of challenged levels of profitability and for sure, the Wood Products business, if not, Timberlands a little bit. How -- and it does seem like you've got a couple of onetimers in the cash flow this year that may not recur in future years. But how should we kind of be thinking about the dividend and the ability to fund that at these levels?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. So let me just start off with a few comments on cash flow and then I'll move to the dividend. As you think about our FAD for 2019, a few things to keep in mind. So first, as Russell alluded to earlier, Q1 is typically our lowest quarter from an operating cash flow perspective, largely because of inventory build, et cetera. That generally will work itself out over the course of the year as it typically does. And so I don't think you should look at Q1 cash flow really and annualize that. That wouldn't be a typical way to do it.","The second point that I would make is we are expecting minimal cash taxes this year because of, as Russell mentioned, just the pension transactions that will substantially reduce the cash taxes this year. But the other thing I would say is we're still optimistic that you're going to see some upward pricing pressure on commodity prices. As you see that construction activity really start to take hold, as we get into the spring, I think we're seeing early signs of that now. We do think you're going to see some upward pricing pressure as well.","So we're still optimistic at this point in the year that we're going to have a healthy cash flow for the full year. Now that all being said, with respect to the dividend, as we said repeatedly, one of our core priorities around capital allocation is the sustainable dividend that grows over time.","And so when we set the dividend at 85% of FAD, we really look at that over a cycle. And so we understand in commodity businesses, in cyclical businesses, sometimes, you're going to be a little bit above that, sometimes you're going to be a little below. And in those instances where we're over 100%, we don't look at that as a cause for panic. We've got levers that we can pull.","There are some opportunities around CapEx. As we said, our sustaining maintenance CapEx in Wood Products is around $150 million to $200 million, and so there's some flexibility around that. There's still some things we can do around cost. As you know, we're very focused on OpEx and continuing to take costs out of the system.","And then ultimately, we have a lot of liquidity. We have a strong balance sheet and so that gives us some flexibility. And so just with respect to the dividend and cash flow for the year, I think we are going to see some upward pressure on pricing, which will give us a little bit more flexibility there. But we have plenty of tools and levers that we can pull ultimately to make sure that we're continuing to meet our core capital allocation priorities.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global.","Mark Weintraub","First, just following up on the comment about Wood Products maintenance capital can be kind of in the $150 million, $200 million range. How much of the $400 million that you're guiding for this year is in the Wood Products business?","Devin Stockfish","$270 million.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. And then a second thing that sort of caught my attention was you has mentioned that you had run in the low 90s in Lumber and the mid-90s and OSB during the first quarter, which are pretty good operating rates. And then in the guidance, it says you're expecting to have higher operating rates across all product lines. And I guess in particular, what's striking is you're already in the mid-90s in OSB. And if prices are now $10 lower than they were on average during the first quarter, you're presumably not making much money in OSB at all, and yet you're running potentially higher than in the mid-90s in that business. And so kind of just what's the kind of the philosophy of running in OSB and Lumber relative to market environments?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, Mark. So I would just comment, with respect to OSB, we did say that we're expecting to be higher in Q2. That's really a pretty small percentage relative to Q1. We were operating well in OSB, in the mid-90s already in OSB, so not a lot of uptick. The bigger uptick really is around EWP and a little bit Lumber as well. And I guess just with respect to your question around philosophy, a big part of how we look at our strategy is making sure that we have a really low cost structure so that we can continue to make money and drive cash flow regardless of pricing. And so it may make sense for us to run where it may not make sense for others to run. But again, it's a big part of our OpEx program being black at the bottom and are focused on having the right cost structure.","Mark Weintraub","And so I guess as a part of that, when you say it makes sense for you to run whereas -- what would be the thought process behind making sense for you whereas for others, it might not? Is that because of your lower cost position or your smaller market position?","Devin Stockfish","Having a lower cost structure so that we can continue to run profitably even at lower product pricing.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And then one last one, if I could. On EWP, great performance in the first quarter, considering the environment. What -- are there any price initiatives out there in the market? And I guess it was notable that prices were up in an environment where pricing for most of the other commodities were low. Or any more color on how that tends to play out would be much appreciated.","Devin Stockfish","Yes. And what I would say on the pricing is a big piece of that was -- well, that was primarily mix. Just in context of pricing generally, there is a little bit of pricing headwind out in the market right now. But as we look forward, we're anticipating holding onto the price increases that we put into place and captured last year.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James.","Collin Mings","First one just on OSB pricing. Can you maybe just expand on your comments in response to George's question? Do you think we are finding a bottom now in terms of OSB pricing? Or just given some of the recent deterioration, could there be some further downside from your vantage point?","Devin Stockfish","I'd be hard-pressed to really try to call a bottom. What I would say is that as we see the construction activity pick up, we would anticipate that would start to drive some of the inventories down. And as we get further into the year, as long as you see that construction activity hold up, align -- along the lines of what we think is going to happen, we do think ultimately, you'll start seeing some upward pricing pressure on OSB. That's just a little bit tougher to call because that supply comes on and off in a more lumpy fashion maybe than Lumber does. And so we think directionally, ultimately, it's going to go up, but the timing is always a challenge.","Collin Mings","Okay. All right. Fair enough. Appreciate the color there. And then just picking back up on the outlook for cash flow. Just recognizing -- you did already push your Real Estate EBITDA guidance marginally higher this quarter. Just how are you thinking about potentially ratcheting up land sales further in the current environment? And again, in the prepared remarks, pretty upbeat about kind of the demand you're seeing out there. Does it in particular make sense to maybe generate some additional cash for share repurchases just given where the stock trades relative to NAV?","Russell Hagen","So Collin, this is Russell. Again, as far as our Real Estate outlook, we increased it from $260 million to $270 million for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We did come out of a strong first quarter, which is going to benefit again the second quarter. But we think the $270 million number is the right number to really capture the premium to timber value which is the key focus for that business. So I wouldn't anticipate we would increase that above our guidance to affect any other capital allocation priorities.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc.","Mark Connelly","How are you thinking about freight if -- and I know it's not easy to separate from weather right now. But do you think freight costs for your system are going to moderate later this year?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. What I would say is we've seen freight costs generally moderate in Q1 relative to last year. And part of that obviously is fuel prices. But I don't think, at this point, we're really anticipating a meaningful increase in freight nor are we expecting a meaningful decrease. And so it would more or less on par with kind of how we've been tracking in Q1 is how we're currently seeing it.","Mark Connelly","Okay, that's helpful. And if we could just go back to Japan for a second. If I look at Japan revenues over time, they have been slipping for a few years. But do you think we're reaching a bottom there or is there a structural reason why that may continue to slip? And certainly, as a percentage of your total, it slipped but that's really high-value stuff. So I'm just curious, do you think we're bottoming out?","Devin Stockfish","What I would say about Japan is from a demand perspective, we have seen that remain pretty consistent over time, and the demand for our high-quality Japan logs remains solid now. I think what you're alluding to really is maybe a little bit more about realizations. And so as we think about Japan log pricing, there are really a couple of things to look at. So there is the correlation to the domestic market here in the West. And so you'll typically see that trade in a correlated fashion to what domestic pricing looks like in the Pacific Northwest. And then the other piece is just related to the dynamic in the Japan market. And so there is a competing product coming over from Europe that the Doug fir product has to compete against.","And so those things all play together to come up ultimately with what Japan pricing looks like, and there's a foreign exchange piece to that as well. But again, just going back to the original comment, the demand has remained solid and we would anticipate that to continue.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research.","Clyde Dillon","First question, just to make sure I heard you say -- heard you right. Did you say the industry OSB operating rate was mid-80s? Did I hear you say that or did I misunderstand you?","Devin Stockfish","No. No. We just commented on our operating rate, which was in the mid-90s.","Clyde Dillon","Mid-90s. So low 80s was lumped -- was EWP, is that right?","Devin Stockfish","That was EWP, correct.","Clyde Dillon","And you didn't give us like a guide on the Real Estate segment. Did you -- specifically like you mentioned in timber harvest, it would be down $25 million to $30 million from the first quarter. Did you give a similar guide for the Real Estate segment?","Russell Hagen","No, we gave a guide for the total Real Estate and ENR segment at $270 million for the year.","Clyde Dillon","Okay. For the full year. Okay. That's helpful. And let me ask you this. One area of obviously of weakness in the Timberland segment has been in the export log area just in general, and I think the delta there is largely China. Any signs that their absence or relatively low levels of activity have started to turn around yet? Or is it just too early to know?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. Here would be how I would phrase that. The Chinese demand that we've seen over the last 12 months really hasn't gone down that much. And I'm talking about specifically from the West Coast. Obviously, the South with the tariffs, the southern yellow pine demand has changed a little bit. But from the West Coast, we haven't seen the demand really fall off.","Now maybe what you're referring to is during the Lunar New Year period, we do see a reduction in construction activity. And so you'll see a little bit weaker demand during that period and you'll see the inventory levels at the Chinese ports tick up a bit, and that certainly happened. But in terms of the China demand, we haven't seen a meaningful dropoff.","And in fact, I do believe that construction activity in China recently has started to pick back up. That's what we're hearing from our folks on the ground. And so we would expect, as we get deeper into the spring and summer in China, you're going to see the continued activity and mostly continued good demand for our China logs.","Clyde Dillon","Got you. And then the Southern log prices seem to be -- hold up pretty well, even though we're under the impression that, from the hurricane activity, it might have created a lot of salvage competition. Has that kind of worked its course? Or did it work itself out earlier than, I guess, the first quarter?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. I think one of the things that may be mitigated to some of that during Q1 was just because it was so rainy across the system. Anybody that could move wood have the opportunity. And so I just -- I think the overall weather dynamics probably mitigated some of that impact. But even now across the system in the South, I would say inventory levels are moderate to low. And so from a pricing perspective, we would expect pricing to be comparable to Q1 as we think about Q2.","With respect to the salvage, we don't have a whole out of ownership in that area so really didn't impact us meaningfully anyhow nor do we expect it to. But I think the fact that just because the mill inventories are low, that probably mitigated some of the downward pricing pressure in those areas.","Clyde Dillon","Got you. And then last question just in terms of the operating philosophy. Certainly, in a fragmented market like lumber, it makes all the sense in the world what you guys do. But when you look at the last numbers I saw in OSB, you have basically a market construct that's similar, for lack of a better comparison, to the U.S. containerboard market where, without telling us anything, we can tell those producers are deciding not to hand inventory to their customers with which to resist future price rises until they work those inventories down.","I mean could you argue that maybe in OSB, given the consolidated structure, that maybe it makes more sense to maybe operate similarly as opposed to shipping a lot at these very low prices, which again if I were a builder, that's great. That just means that when -- it's just going to take longer for markets to tighten up and longer for you guys to make money. I didn't know if you had any thoughts about that.","Devin Stockfish","Yes. I really can't comment on what other folks in the industry are doing in terms of production. The way we look at it really is just we produce what we can sell at a profit. And so really, our focus is just on running our mills at a level that we think we can remain profitable and move our inventory. And so the other producers obviously will make their decisions, I think, similarly, but we really can't. We don't have visibility into that.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson.","Steven Chercover","So my first question was kind of a different spin on the whole freight issue. In 2017 and '18, I think some of the difficulties on the railroads contributed to the strength of lumber, at least the sense of scarcity. And I'm wondering this year, with lumber being weak, is that partly a function of improved efficiency on the rail network?","Devin Stockfish","No. I don't think so. I mean I think without question, in 2018, that was the case. The challenges with rail particularly out of Canada created a little bit of an imbalance, particularly in the first half of the year. And when that unwound, that was part of the driver for while you saw lumber prices slide so dramatically. There were some challenges this year from a rail perspective. And so it's not as though everything went perfectly smoothly this year. But I do think the pricing environment kept people from building inventories to the same levels that perhaps they did last year. And so I don't think you're going to see the rail and transportation issues have near the effect this year that they did last year.","Steven Chercover","Okay. And then two other short ones. Were there any start-up costs associated with the ramp of your new sawmill in the South?","Russell Hagen","No, we don't have any specific start-up costs. I mean, we're clearly going to build that ramp-up over the next 18 months but, no specific charges related to that.","Steven Chercover","Okay. So I guess it'll -- the cost structure will come down. And the third one...","Russell Hagen","That's correct.","Steven Chercover","And the third one is with respect to just the commentary on running the mills for profitability. Is there any view that maybe the proper metric should be earning the cost of capital as opposed to generating a cash contribution or a modest profit?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. Of course, over time, I mean, we're in business to earn in excess of our cost of capital. Now we don't look at that necessarily on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We look at that over a longer period. But without question, that's certainly our intent is to make sure that we're operating to earn returns in excess of our cost to capital, no question about that.","Operator","And today's final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul Quinn","Very strong results and I think your offering rates in Wood Products are going to be the envy of the industry. But I thought I'd try to get some color on just the major CapEx projects that you're doing in 2019, that $400 million spend. Where are you spending it in Wood Products and Timber?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. So remember, $120 million of that is on the Timberlands side and that's primarily reforestation. And so just in terms of the Wood Products side, that's about $270 million. And I'd say you still have some of that, that's coming on finishing up the Millport. And then beyond that, it's really just -- it's a mix of various projects across the system. So it could be CDKs, could be optimization in mills going after bottlenecks. So there's nothing that I could specifically point you to that's of the magnitude of Millport or a Dierks or Grayling. It's really a lot of projects across the system really going after improving our reliability and lowering our cost of manufacturing.","Paul Quinn","Okay. So no major projects in '19. Do you have any major projects in '20?","Devin Stockfish","We're still working through that frankly, so I don't know that we're necessarily ready to comment on specifics. But as we get into the back half of the year, early part of next year, we'll provide more guidance on that.","Paul Quinn","Okay. And then just lastly, you mentioned a potential agreement with -- between the U.S. and China. Just wondering how material that would be to Weyerhaeuser?","Devin Stockfish","I think it's directionally positive for us. But what I would say is if you think about our China business generally in the West, which is the much bigger piece from an earnings perspective, we haven't really seen a material impact other than some initial noise once the tariffs were put in place back last summer. So I think it would have a moderately positive impact to the West, maybe a few million. I think the bigger opportunity over time, although it's not a big earnings impact now, is the opportunity to grow the Southern export business. And so that business is not a meaningful percentage of our harvest in the South right now, but we had some good momentum going last year on building that program before the tariffs came into place.","We've continued to have conversations with our customers in China, and we think there's a good opportunity for us there. But that's something that would grow over time, not meaningful probably in the very near term. It's more of a midterm opportunity from a magnitude perspective.","All right. Terrific. Well, I think that was our last question. So thank you to everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser Company. Have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"22932":["Weyerhaeuser Company (NYSE:WY) Q2 2019 Earnings Conference Call July 26, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Elizabeth Baum - Senior Director of IR","Devin Stockfish - CEO","Russell Hagen - CFO","Conference Call Participants","Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets","George Staphos - Bank of America","Collin Mings - Raymond James","Chip Dillon - Vertical Research","Mark Weintraub - Seaport Global","Mark Connelly - Stephens","Steve Chercover - Davidson","Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets","Anthony Pettinari - Citi","Operator","Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]","I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Elizabeth Baum","Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2019 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. And our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.","On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish.","Devin Stockfish","All right. Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today.","This morning, Weyerhaeuser has reported second-quarter net earnings of $128 million or $0.17 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding a small benefit from special items, we earned $123 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $343 million. I'm extremely proud of our team as each of our businesses delivered strong operating performance despite various market and weather related challenges throughout the quarter.","In a moment I'll dive into our business results, but first let me set the stage with some brief comments on the housing market. Outside of the Pacific Northwest, the second quarter was extremely wet. Record setting precipitation constrained building activity in key areas across the country.","Housing starts in most regions, increased modestly quarter-over-quarter, despite the unusual weather and second quarter, housing starts totaled $126 million on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with $1.2 million in the first quarter.","However, housing starts in the south, which account for roughly half of U.S. homebuilding activity, declined on a seasonally adjusted basis as build our struggle to navigate flooding in near historic levels of rainfall. In addition to the weather related challenges during the first half of 2019, the industry continues to face many of the same supply side constraints that have been headwinds for housing over the last several years, namely affordability, regulatory burdens and labor and lot availability.","While these constraints continue to affect the housing market, we believe the fundamentals support modest growth for 2019. In particular, mortgage applications for purchase are up over 6% in the first half of 2019 versus the same period in 2018. New home sales are up 2% year-to-date, builder sentiment remains strong, economic data remains positive with increasing real wages, unemployment below 4% and consumer confidence near 15 year highs. And affordability has improved as mortgage rates have declined.","Our builder customers are optimistic that they will be able to return to a more normal pace of building activity in the third quarter and they continue to hope for catch up activity in the fourth quarter, weather permitting. We also expect builders will continue to adjust product offerings as they seek to meet solid and growing underlying demand for affordable housing.","Turning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 4 through 6. Timberlands contributed $102 million the second-quarter earnings and $175 million to adjusted EBITDA.","Western Timberlands EBITDA decreased by $8 million compared with the first quarter due to additional forestry and road building activity, which typically increases during the drier months.","Demand for Western domestic logs softened slightly at some lumber mills reduced hours in response to continued low lumber prices. Logging conditions improved significantly, compared with the first quarter, resulting in good log availability across the Northwest markets.","Although pricing trended modestly lower as the quarter progressed, our second quarter domestic log pricing was comparable to the first quarter average.","Moving to the export markets. In Japan, post and beam housing starts are up almost 2% year-to-date and demand for our logs remained steady. Average sales realizations for our Japanese export logs were comparable to the first quarter. Second quarter log sales volumes to Japan were stronger than we had originally expected and were down only slightly compared with the prior quarter. In China, overall log inventories at Chinese ports decreased 11% during the second quarter to 4.1 million cubic meters.","However, the inventory trend varied by species. Inventories of North American hemlock and Douglas fir logs decreased by 44% but inventories of Radiata pine continue to build in the quarter. At the end of June, Radiata radio represented approximately 73% of the ports inventory volumes compared with 60% at the end of March.","The oversupply of Radiata pine has had only a modest effect on demand and pricing for our logs as the Douglas fir and hemlock that we export generally serve different end-markets than Radiata.","Second quarter realizations for our China export logs were slightly lower than the first quarter. Log sales volumes decreased, but this was primarily due to the timing of vessel sailings. Overall, second quarter log export revenues were lower than the year ago quarter, due to lower realizations for our Japan and China logs and lower sales volumes to China due to timing of shipments. For Western Timberlands as a whole, EBITDA is significantly lower than a year ago due to the lower prices for domestic and export logs.","Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared with the first quarter due to lower fee harvest volumes. Extremely wet weather created challenging logging conditions during the second quarter our fee harvest volume decreased only slightly, as our scale operability and supply chain infrastructure enabled us to largely maintained our planned harvest volume through the record rainfall.","Log availability was tight across Southern markets particularly in the Mid-South resulting in low mill inventories and continued solid pricing. Average realizations for our Southern saw logs were flat with the first quarter and realization for our fiber logs increased slightly.","On the export side, Southern log export volumes and realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Comparing overall Southern Timberlands results with the year ago quarter, EBITDA increased slightly due to higher average log sales realizations, partially offset by lower harvest volumes and slightly higher harvest in whole cost due to the wet weather.","Northern Timberlands EBITDA decreased by $6 million compared with the first quarter. Fee harvest volumes declined seasonally as spring breakup limited activity across most of our Northern operations and average realizations improved as our harvest mix shifted seasonally to a higher proportion of hardwood sawlogs. Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA from Northern Timberlands decreased slightly due to lower harvest volumes.","Real estate, energy and natural resources, Chart 7 and 8. Real estate and ENR contributed $35 million to second quarter earnings and $71 million to adjusted EBITDA. So second quarter EBITDA was $35 million lower than the first quarter by $24 million higher than a year ago. As we previously indicated, due to strong activity at the end of 2018, our 2019 real estate activity is heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Interest from recreational and high net worth buyers remained solid in the second quarter.","We also closed a large acreage transaction in Montana, which accounted for approximately half of the acres sold. As a result, the number of acres sold in the second quarter increased 21% compared with the first quarter and there was nearly three times higher than a year ago.","Average price per acre decreased significantly compared with the first quarter and the year-ago quarter, due to the large proportion of acres sold in Montana, where Timberland prices are regionally lower. In energy and natural resources, EBITDA increased slightly compared with the first quarter due to a small seasonal increase in construction materials volumes. Compared with the year ago quarter, ENR EBITDA increased due to higher volumes and pricing for construction materials and hard minerals.","Wood Products, Charts 9 and 10. Wood Products contributed $81 million to second quarter earnings and $128 million to adjusted EBITDA. Compared with the first quarter, earnings and EBITDA increased despite lower average pricing for our commodity products. EBITDA for lumber decreased $3 million, as slightly lower lumber realizations and higher log costs were mostly offset by a seasonal increase in sales volumes.","Lumber pricing trended unevenly throughout the quarter, holding flat through April, declining in May as continued wet weather and limited customer purchasing and improving in June with the announcement of curtailments in mill closures in British Columbia.","On average, the framing lumber composite price decreased 3% in the second quarter compared with the first and our average realizations decreased by 1%. Lumber sales volumes increased 12% compared with the first quarter while production was up 4%. Our mills had another excellent quarter operationally.","Unit manufacturing costs decreased slightly compared with the first quarter and our lumber system achieve the lowest controllable manufacturing cost per unit it is ever recorded. This is a strong indication that our OpEx efforts are yielding meaningful results.","Our Timberlands and Wood Products teams also worked exceptionally well together to keep our mill supplied with logs in very challenging harvest conditions. Despite record levels of precipitation across the U.S. South and Alberta, we experienced only minor out of log downtime at one mill in our system.","Comparing second quarter results with the year ago quarter, lumber EBITDA decreased significantly due to lower average sales realizations, partially offset by lower log and manufacturing cost. EBITDA for the second quarter of 2019 includes a charge of $5 million for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. OSB EBITDA decreased $11 million compared with the first quarter. This is almost entirely attributable to lower average realizations.","The second quarter pricing trajectory for OSB mirror that of lumber. Benchmark North Central pricing averaged 12% below the first quarter and our average realizations declined 4%. Our sales and production volumes were comparable to the first quarter, slightly lower than a year ago as we took a bit more downtime than originally forecasted. Comparing our second quarter results to the year ago quarter, EBITDA was significantly lower due to a 42% decrease in average sales realizations and slightly lower sales volumes.","Engineered Wood Products EBITDA increased by $17 million compared with the first quarter. Average sales realizations for solid section products were flat and average realizations for I-Joists decreased by 3%, primarily due to seasonal mix. Sales volumes increased by 17% for solid section products and 27% for I-Joists due to seasonally higher building activity.","Production volumes for solid section and I-Joists products increased only modestly as we began the customary draw down of our first quarter inventory build. Fiber cost declined due to lower cost for logs in oriented strand board web stock and unit manufacturing costs for MDF improved due to higher operating rates.","Compared with the year ago quarter, lower costs for logs in oriented strand board were partially offset by lower sales volumes. Distribution EBITDA increased by $7 compared with the first quarter due to improved sales volumes. EBITDA was slightly lower than a year ago as sales continue to lag last year's levels.","I'd like to now turn to operational excellence. Our businesses are making good progress against our collective 2019 operational excellence target of $80 million to $100 million. Year-to-date, our biggest OpEx benefits in Timberlands continue to come from improved logging in hauling efficiencies in our Southern operations and marketing and merchandising improvements across the West and South.","In Wood Products, our greatest benefits have come from our ongoing initiatives to reduce controllable manufacturing costs for lumber and OSB and improve log recovery and engineered wood products. Our real estate business is also on track to meet or exceed its targeted 30% premium to timber value.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook.","Russell Hagen","Thanks Devin, and good morning.","Key outlook guidance for the third quarter are presented on Chart 13 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, as is customary, third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be seasonally about we expect a seasonal decrease, similar to what we saw in the third quarter of 2018 when earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately $35 million compared with the second quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we expect our third quarter harvest volumes will be lower than the second quarter.","As is typical for this time of year, our road spending will be slightly higher. Operating conditions in the West had been favorable for the past several months. Domestic log inventories are at healthy levels ahead of fire season. Our domestic log sales realizations trended down late in the second quarter and we anticipate our average realizations for the third quarter will be moderately below in the second quarter average, absent significant fire-related disruptions or restrictions.","In Japan, post and beam housing starts are expected to remain steady and we continue to experience solid demand for our export logs. In the third quarter, we expect Japanese export sales volumes will be comparable with the second quarter and average log sales realizations will be slightly lower. Chinese export log sales volumes are expected to increase in the third quarter due to the timing of vessel selling's. We anticipate average sales realizations will decline modestly compared to the second quarter.","Although demand remains fairly steady, we do anticipate the recent sharp drop in Radiata pine pricing will create some downward pressure on our prices for a Chinese export logs. In the South, forestry spending will increase as we entered the drier summer months and complete activities that were deferred by wet conditions in the first half of the year.","We anticipate higher fee harvest volumes in the third quarter and average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the second quarter. In the North, third quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher in the second quarter as we move past the spring breakup season.","Turning to our real estate energy and natural resources segment, as previously discussed the cadence of our real estate sales will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year in 2019. We continue to see strong interest in higher and better use lands from high net worth individuals and recreational buyers. Markets in the South and the West are particularly strong. We anticipate third quarter adjusted EBITDA for the real estate energy natural resources segment will be approximately $15 million lower than in the second quarter.","Land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be slightly higher than the second quarter at approximately 60%. We expect third quarter earnings will be $10 million lower than the second quarter. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $270 for the full year of 2019. And we now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be between 50% and 55% for the full year.","For Wood Products we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the second quarter before the benefit from the improvement in sales realizations. We anticipate comparable sales volumes and slightly lower fiber costs offset by slightly higher unit in manufacturing costs, engineered wood products due to scheduled downtime.","We expect third quarter realizations for lumber and OSB will be higher than the second quarter average. For both lumber and OSB third quarter to date average sales realizations are comparable with the second quarter average, and current realizations are $5 higher than the second quarter average. As a reminder, for lumber every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.","And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis; Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The $13 million favorable variance in earnings before special items compared with the first quarter is primarily attributable to lower variable compensation expense. Second quarter also included a small non-cash foreign exchange gain as compared with a non-cash charge in the first quarter.","Each year in the second quarter, we finalized prior year-end estimates for pension plan assets and liabilities. As a result, our second quarter pretax special items include a $6 million benefit from finalization of the non-cash settlement charge related to the transfer of pension assets and liabilities to the purchase of a group annuity contract, which we completed in the first quarter. Excluding pension settlement items, our second quarter non-cash, non-operating pension and post-retirement benefit costs were comparable to the first quarter. We continue to expect to record approximately $60 million of expense for the full year 2019.","Turning to our key financial items, which are summarized on Chart 12, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $212 million. Cash from operations during the second quarter was $396 million, an increase of $410 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year.","Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $84 million. We expect total CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $380 million. $120 million for Timberlands inclusive of reforestation costs, $250 million for wood products and $10 million for planned corporate IT system upgrades.","Moving on to financing we ended the quarter with approximately $6.3 billion of total debt outstanding. We have no debt maturities until 2021. We expect full-year 2019 interest expense will be approximately $375 million excluding special items.","I'll wrap up with taxes. In the second quarter, we recorded an income tax benefit as we recalibrated our annual effective tax rate to account for lower than expected wood products pricing. We currently expect our full-year effective tax rate will reflect the benefit of approximately 20% before special items. We expect to pay minimum cash taxes in 2019.","Now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions.","Devin Stockfish","Great, thank you, Russell.","Looking forward, we continue to believe there is a modest growth trajectory for US housing. As the market addresses supply-side constraints it narrows the gap to fundamental demand, but we also remain positioned and prepared to fully capitalize on a range of market conditions. Most importantly, we will continue to focus on what we can control.","Optimizing our operations and portfolio, capturing efficiencies, capitalizing on our diversification and scale and delivering operational excellence every single day. We will remain focused on these things so that we will drive industry-leading operational and financial performance and deliver superior value to our shareholders.","And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Brian Maguire","Russell, I just wanted to clarify the comments you made on the 3Q outlook for wood products. I think you noted in the release you expect it to be flat sequentially assuming that price realizations are flat, but then I think in the prepared remarks, you also talked about assuming higher lumber and OSB prices. So I just wanted to reconcile those. And then when you talk about prices being flat are you talking about versus the 2Q average or where you ended 2Q, or kind of where we are today?","Russell Hagen","Yes, I think really what we're looking at is: one, we're operating very well in our manufacturing operations. The cost structure is clearly as Devin mentioned, really well positioned. So as we look at quarter-over-quarter, and the activity pricing has been pretty flat, but we would expect as we come into later in the summer, as activity increases, that we'll see improving pricing.","So that's kind of how we're looking at it. We're really in just really a good position to benefit from that improvement in pricing.","Devin Stockfish","Just to follow-up on that, I think directionally, we're expecting a pricing uplift. As we see construction activity continue to pick up in the back half of the year, obviously, there have been a lot of curtailments and mill closure announcements.","I think those are still working their way through the system. So directionally, we're expecting an uplift. I think, for us, the challenge is quantifying the timing and the magnitude.","Brian Maguire","And just to be clear, if that uplift developed, that would be upside to the flat sort of outlook on earnings?","Russell Hagen","Correct. Yes, correct.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Just wanted to be clear on that. And then you commented on some of the curtailments that have been announced. Just wondering how long you think it will take for some of that to create some tension on the market?","And I guess tied into that question; how would you assess the inventories in the channel and sort of your own inventories? Because obviously there have been a lot of curtailments. So far, it hasn't really moved the needle a lot on pricing. But I'm guessing there's still a little bit of excess inventory in the channels.","Devin Stockfish","Yes, so let me speak to channel inventory first and then I'll get back to your second question. I'd say, as a general statement across the industry, I would say that inventory levels are in the normal range. Now there may be a few geographies where it's a little high or a little low. But on balance, I think they're in a normal range.","I do think one of the dynamics that you're seeing at present is that buyers are generally not building inventories. They feel pretty confident that they can get supply on an 'as needed' basis to meet their needs. And so I wouldn't say that inventories are in an extreme level by any means.","The one I guess caveat to that is on SPF as you alluded to with some of the mill closures and curtailments, some of that volume from those mills that are closing down seems to be finding its way into the market. And I think that's been a little bit of a headwind on SPF here just recently.","That being said, there have been a lot of capacity that's coming out of the system for the announced mill closures. There is a little noise in the system as that volume flows through, as you think about mills that are closing down. They're going to have to move their inventories out into the market and sometimes that will put a little pressure on things.","But after that it sort of works its way through the system. We would expect that to normalize over time, whether that's two weeks, four weeks, what have you, hard to predict. But certainly, directionally, that's what we would expect to happen.","Brian Maguire","And just last one from me. The log costs in Western Canada been elevated I think the pine beetle impact that you guys have been talking about for a number of years. Maybe it's finally starting to work its way from the initial stages of creating an oversupply of logs that maybe now restricting supply a bit.","I was wondering if you could talk about that market and how in general that's impacting you? I know you have a little bit of lumber capacity in that area. But net-net, I would think the pressure that it creates on some of the imports to the U.S. would be a benefit for you. But I just wanted to get some perspective from you on that.","Devin Stockfish","Yes. So there are really two things going on in British Columbia. One, as you mentioned, is the impact of the pine beetle and forest fire, which has reduced the overall supply of timber. Now, I would say that it's differential by region.","And so when you're talking about certain areas in sort of the mid-B.C. range, it's a little bit more heavily impacted. Where we own a mill is a little bit further south. The wood basket that we operate in, hasn't been impacted in a meaningful way by the pine beetle or forest fire. So our fiber supply at our mill is actually in reasonably good shape.","The other piece that you've been hearing about from a log cost perspective is the way that they do stumpage rates in British Columbia. And that reset on July 1st. It went up. You've probably heard that talk to you from a number of our competitors that are bigger in that region. And so that's the other impact on log cost, it's just the method that they used to calculate stumpage rates.","For us, given the wood basket that we operate in, where fiber is a little bit more available, we have a mill that's a low-cost mill, top quartile cost structure in that region. And so even with the increased stumpage rates, I think we're feeling pretty good about the operations that we have in British Columbia.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Mark Wilde","I wondered, Devin, if you could just give us any color on the lumber trade dispute. Is the pain that we're seeing in lumber markets right now, is this sparking anymore interest in discussions or is it still a back burner issue?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, I'd say there hasn't been a whole lot of movement on that front. Really, the activity is primarily in the litigation channels with the WTO and NAFTA. And so that process is going to take several years to work its way through. Ultimately, we would hope to come do a resolution that both sides can live with. From our perspective, that would be quota-based. But there hasn't been a whole lot of movement on that front recently.","Mark Wilde","And then just to come back to this kind of Canadian log issue, can we get a general sense of what you think at current SPF pricing levels, - many of the mills up there actually cash positive, would you guess?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, Mark, it's really hard for us to speculate on the cost structure for our competitors. Really, what we can speak to is our mill in British Columbia, as I mentioned; we think that's a top quartile mill and we can make money even at these levels.","And so you can do the math. If we think we're a top quartile cost structure, that means others aren't, at least not everyone. And so you can probably run your own math. It's hard for us to speculate specifically on their cost structure though.","Mark Wilde","Last one from me is just maybe you can provide a little bit of color on what you're seeing in U.S. Timberland markets, both in terms of the volume of properties that are in the market and then what you're seeing in terms of Timberland valuations.","Russell Hagen","2019 has actually been a pretty slow start. We've seen a little more activity as we come in the summer months. But I think. in general, our expectation is that 2019 will be a pretty light year from a timber transaction kind of from the broader market timber transaction base.","Typically, we expect around $2 billion to trade. And then every year you see maybe one large transaction sit on top of that. And so the average over the last number of years has been $2 billion to $4 billion. But I would speculate that we'd be hard-pressed to hit $2 billion in 2019, given the amount of transactions that we've seen close and the amount of acres that are on market or we would expect to see come to the market.","One thing I'd say is, I think it's just a timing of transactions. I don't think it points to any fundamental change in the timber market. We're still seeing strong values. We're still seeing quality properties trade. good prices, and we're still seeing capital coming into the market seeking out the investments. So I think we're just going to see a slow year this year.","Mark Wilde","If can slip one more; is it possible, Devin, for you to just to update people on your thinking around the dividend? I think there has been some concern that you won't cover the dividend this year and I think it would be good to just hear how you hand the board. Our thinking about that, clearly there's a lot of volatility in your cash flows, just because of what's been going on in the wood markets?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, sure, Mark. Obviously, the first half of the year has been a little soft on pricing across a number of our products. And that impacts cash flow. I would say, just as a starting point, we're expecting prices to pick up over the back half of the year, as I mentioned earlier.","But putting that aside, I think we've been clear, returning cash to shareholders through our sustainable dividend is a core capital allocation priority, as is reinvesting in the business and maintaining an appropriate capital structure.","And so to the extent that we continue to see a soft pricing environment. we've got leverage, we can pull. There is a little bit we can do around CapEx and further cost control. We're obviously always working on OpEx.","But over and above that, we have two key levers to pull. First, as we continue to look to optimize our portfolio, we have opportunities to monetize non-core assets. You've seen us do that in the past with our Uruguay divestiture with what we did on the Twin Creeks transaction. And so that's a lever that we have to pull.","Additionally, we have a strong balance sheet and lots of liquidity. And we're prepared to tap some of that liquidity to bridge as needed. I do think it's important to point out, we value our investment grade credit rating and so we'll obviously balance that in consideration of the other levers that we have to pull. But again, we do think you're going to see some uptick in pricing, but we've got levers that we can pull to continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities in the meantime.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","George Staphos","I had three questions, one on homebuilding and housing, one on cost and operations and then one on timber pricing. First, some of the research and some of the commentary that we've heard and seen suggest that one of the issues that's been impacting homebuilding is a lot of issues that you had mentioned in terms of land availability, labor availability and so on. But one of the things that's hurting affordability is permitting costs and those are somewhat intractable and being driven by fiscal issues and other issues that kind of feedback and community.","So to the extent, that your customers have a view on this, and whether that comes down. That's become a very meaningful price for a new homeowner to get over to build that new home. What are you hearing in the marketplace, and I'll come in with my follow-ons?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, there is no question that is one of the things that's driving the affordability issue. We've heard estimates as high as 25% of the costs of some homes being built are due to some of the regulatory burdens that are put on the builders. And so that's a challenge. Now the issue there is that something, typically that you have to battle out at the local level. The one thing that does give me some optimism around that, however, is there is a growing appreciation I think in the public policy space that affordable housing is a real issue that must be resolved.","You've heard the governor of California talk about building 2.5 million to 3 million units to just get back up to base level demand. Here in Seattle, where the markets tight. It's a topic of conversation regularly. And I think you're seeing that play out. Now, the challenge in moving local governments is going to be differential depending on where you are in the country. But I do think that has really found its way into the public debate and that gives me some level of optimism that perhaps it's an issue that we can figure out to help with the affordability issue.","George Staphos","All right, thanks for thoughts on that Devin we'll keep coming back to that. In terms of costs, I mean you pointed to it from our vantage point you did really, really well this quarter. How did you keep SG&A really well aligned I think it was flat year-on-year, flat in the quarter, especially within wood products? And what is repeatable in terms of your manufacturing cost \u2013 leverage in wood products, looking at in the next couple of quarter. Was there anything aberrational in your ability to keep cost as low as they were in the quarter?","Devin Stockfish","No, absolutely not. And you know both from an SG&A perspective and an operating cost within the businesses, whether it's wood products or elsewhere. The reason that we've been on the positive trajectory there is, because we focus on it. We talk about it all the time we're always focused on it. OpEx has become part of the D&A of this organization that's true in the business, it's true with the corporate level.","And so I wouldn't say there's anything aberrational in Q2. My expectation is, as we mentioned we're targeting another $80 million to $100 million of improvement in 2019. And we're confident that we're going to get it.","George Staphos","And Devin, just the SG&A, we should be able to see or you should be able to maintain that leverage going forward?","Devin Stockfish","That's certainly the goal.","George Staphos","And the last I didn't hear you, Russell talk about, you just mentioned there was a downtick in Western realizations and logs. If you could comment in terms of what was driving that end of quarter, pressure that would be helpful? Thank you, guys and good luck in the quarter.","Devin Stockfish","Yes, let me just comment on the Western system generally, because that's a little context for what's going on with the pricing. I'd say over Q2, the demand was steady in the Western system, but as it's typically the case as the weather improves as you get into the drier months. You see additional volume coming into the market from the non-industrial former wood. And so that's an incremental volume that we see every year. I think the two additional factors at play this year are number one.","While, our demand has been steady to China, I do think you've seen a little bit of a drop off within the Western region on shipments to China so some of that volume has stayed domestic. And then the third piece is, there were some ice storms in Southern Oregon over the winter time and you're seeing a lot of the landowners, moving some of that salvage volume to market, which is impacting the dynamic in Southern Oregon and is bleeding up a little bit to mid Oregon as well.","And so those three things together, I think have put a little bit of a softness in pricing in the West. That's not a typical of what you typically see this time of year, as you see the former wood come to market. But that's sort of where we are. And I would say that's likely going to continue here until we get into \u2013 the more wet months here in the Pacific Northwest. So as we said, we would anticipate Q3 pricing in the West to be down moderately compared to Q2.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Collin Mings","Going back to Mark's question earlier around the dividend and capital allocation, it does not look like you repurchased any shares during the quarter. Can you maybe just update us on how share repurchases fit into your capital allocation priorities?","Russell Hagen","Yes, sure Collin, this is Russell. As you know, our first priority is \u2013 returning cash to the shareholders through the sustainable dividend. And then we'll do share repurchases on an opportunistic basis. In the first quarter, we repurchased around $60 million worth of shares and we did not have any repurchase in the second quarter. But it's something that we look at on an ongoing basis as part of our overall capital allocation program, and we'll update you next quarter as to our activity.","Collin Mings","Switching gears just as far as China and really appreciate all the detail around log inventories in China across the different species you broke out earlier. But can you maybe just expand on why you think there is such a divergence there and maybe expand on how you think that's going to impact that market going forward?","Devin Stockfish","Yes and so the overall rationale for why the radiata pine inventory built up, is a little bit hard for us to project. We obviously don't have Timberlands in New Zealand. What I will say is on an ongoing basis, I do think you've seen a bit of a price correction on radiata pine ordinarily, that would impact the volumes going in, in going into the fall. The other piece I would just say in terms of the overall dynamic in China, typically July and August are warmer months in the Southern China region. And so you ordinarily would see a little bit of a slowdown in take away.","And I think in certain end markets, you're also seeing a little bit of lessened economic activity impacting the takeaway at the ports. And so, I think both on the supply and demand side. That's why it has gotten a little bit out of balance and why you've seen some of that price correction. I will say, as we mentioned earlier, though for our business for Hemlock and Douglas fir. We're still seeing good steady demand from our customers. Pricing soften a little bit, but we haven't seen the same kind of price correction that we've seen in some of the other species.","Collin Mings","Appreciate all the detail there, and then just shifting to the U.S. South. I mean clearly wet weather has helped support log pricing throughout the first half of the year in the South. Maybe just as we've kind of moved into the summer and starting to roll into 3Q, have you seen any shifts across different wood baskets in terms of log pricing here? Just maybe it maybe the wet weather hasn't been as pronounced in some areas?","Devin Stockfish","Yes and I think you're absolutely right. The first half of the year, very wet that really kept log inventories at the mills down kept pricing tension in the market. And so, part of the uplift that you saw was attributable to weather. I will say, as we continue to see the manufacturing capacity come into the region and get up and running in those wood baskets. I think that's another piece that added to the uplift on pricing.","Our view is that will be something that will continue on. Now that's local to those specific wood baskets, but I do think where we've seen that that's putting an upward pricing pressure. With respect to going into Q3, I think on balance we're expecting comparable quarter-over-quarter pricing. You're going to see maybe a little bit more pricing pressure in some of those regions that have just recently seen a whole bunch of rain, maybe a little less so in regions that have been dryer. But on balance across the south, we're looking at comparable quarter-over-quarter.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Chip Dillon","Thanks for all the details much appreciated yeah. Just to get a handle on the second half cash flow I know that you're unwinding. And I think this is going to be largely done by next year the timberland transactions from 15 years ago with the SPEs. Is it fair to say that you're going to probably need to make it what a $300 million payment in the second half and you get that back next year? And therefore should we, unless there's a dramatic recovery and pricing expect that net debt number which I get to about 6.1, you mentioned gross debt 6.3, should rise a little bit into year-end and then hopefully drop off next year?","Russell Hagen","Chip. Yes, I think you actually described that pretty well. We entered into a couple of timber transactions back in 2002 and 2004, and set up the financial instruments to monetize those. And the first set of those transactions or vehicles were completed last year.","And then we have the second step or a second set coming due this year. In the third quarter, we'll make a payment of $302 million. And then in the first quarter of 2020, we'll receive $362 million. So I would expect at year-end, you're going to see a little bit elevation on that. We'll probably tap a revolver to cover that. But it will be repaid back right in the first quarter. So it'll be very temporary.","Chip Dillon","And then just to clarify, on the Timberlands expectation for the third quarter, I think you said down $35 million EBITDA from a year ago, which I think would mean just a very small like $5 million drop from the second quarter, is that the right zip code?","Russell Hagen","Chip, it's $35 million quarter-over-quarter.","Chip Dillon","So it's from second to third?","Russell Hagen","Correct. Similar though to the drop that we had in 2018, second and third quarters. So it's really impact - it's a seasonal effect really around harvest levels and pricing. And then also drill cost\u2026","Chip Dillon","And then last question is, in the OSB business, I know, and I'll be the first to admit, I was a little skeptical about you guys running so hard. But you clearly have made the right choice because of - we see folks falling by the wayside, so to speak. And you're making money, and that's totally up on the up and up. But you did miss and you took some downtime in OSB.","And I'm just curious, was that because you have a different approach there or is it because you were approaching cash cost at a couple of facilities? I'm just curious why you chose to take downtime in OSB?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, Chip. And that really was just some maintenance downtime that extended a little bit longer than we had anticipated. At a high level, we're obviously always trying to match our supply with profitable demand, generate appropriate returns over time.","I think with our products mix, and remember, we're predominantly a value-added OSB product. So we are not as heavy into the commodity sheeting business. And when we combine that with all the work that we've done on our cost structure, it allows us to be cash flow positive where others perhaps may not.","And so in Q2, every one of our OSB mills was cash flow positive in every month, unless they had scheduled maintenance downtime. And I'd say, obviously the ultimate goal is not to just to be cash flow positive. The goal is to exceed earnings in excess of your cost-to-capital over time and that's certainly our expectation. But we're continuing to watch that and monitor it closely.","Chip Dillon","So said differently, if you needed an extra coat of paint this year or next year, why not extend it a few days when the prices are low and do it this year? Because maybe next year it will be a much better market.","Devin Stockfish","Well said.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.","Mark Weintraub","A couple of follow-ups. First, you had mentioned that in some of the southern geographies where new lumber capacity has been coming on, you felt a little bit more tension in pricing. Roughly what percentage of your Southern harvest would you say is in those baskets where there is lumber capacity coming on such that it can add some tension to those geographies?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, well, rather than give you a specific percentage, I can talk about sort of geographically. When you think about some of the capacity that's been coming into the Arkansas, Oklahoma region, that's an area where we've seen price tensioning. And, in fact, really some of our highest delivered log prices in Q2 were coming out of that region, sort of the Mississippi area where the [Beaver] mill came in, that's an area that's been tensioned.","We obviously have a significant land holdings in Mississippi. There are spots throughout the rest of the south, where some of the mill capacity is impacting our harvest. North Carolina is another strong operating region. We've got a mill that's coming up to speed in that region.","And so I think, regionally, there are spots where it's helpful. Obviously, there is new mill capacity coming in Alabama. We have some holdings there. That's not a state where we have a significant amount of a holdings. But it's having a little bit of a knock-on effect in some of those regions as well.","Mark Weintraub","And are there certain locations where you have land where there is going to be capacity coming on shortly which wasn't covered in the list you gave where hopefully we're going to see that tension pick up?","Devin Stockfish","Well, I think those are the regions primarily that we're looking to see the new capacity. If you're asking if there is anything in the rumor mill that's coming on other than what's been publicly announced, I don't think we have anything to add there.","Mark Weintraub","And just also a follow-up on the question of the levers that you have to pull. You had mentioned optimizing the portfolio and looking at non-core assets. Is there any color you can provide to us as to what some of the non-core assets might include?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, I don't know. They were prepared to really list out specific non-core assets other than just to say. Obviously, as we look across our acreage in our businesses, we're looking to generate good, strong return on our assets.","And that's really part and parcel to how we look to optimize our portfolio and to the extent that we have assets that we don't feel are generating the right return profile, that would be something that we would look at. And so I guess just directionally, we believe there are probably some non-core assets within the portfolio that we could monetize if and when we need to.","Mark Weintraub","And then lastly, trying to make sure I understand. So on the tax rate, so for the full year, as I understand it, you expect that to be a 20% benefit; is that correct? And I also believe that you said that from a cash perspective, it basically would - maybe if you could just restate what you would expect, if anything on the cash side?","Russell Hagen","So that's correct. We expect a 20% benefit for the full year. And that's really just re-calibrating our tax provision to factor in the lower wood products pricing. So, as far as cash taxes, we'll pay minimal cash taxes. We have some refunds associated with the pension work that we did last year. And so we would expect to see minimal cash taxes in 2019.","Mark Weintraub","So on a net basis, minimal cash taxes paid or were the refunds supplemental to that, so that on a net basis you have cash coming in from taxes?","Russell Hagen","Yes. No, on a net basis, it's minimal cash taxes. And then we do have, as we announced, I think in the prior quarter, we do have an outstanding refund that we've put in with the IRS.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead.","Mark Connelly","Russell, you spoke earlier about the slow timber transaction market. Has your view of the attractiveness of values in that market changed much, or is there just not enough out there to make you want to be more involved?","Russell Hagen","Mark, we really don't have a changed view. The transactions that we are seeing close, are strong values. We're just seeing a slow market right now. And I really don't have an answer as to why we don't see more volume on the market.","Just in context, there's about 120 million acres of investable timberlands in the United States. And so as we've seen in the past, those acres are going to trade hands over time, and we would expect that continue into the future. So I just think we're in a slow, slow part of time as it relates to timber transactions, but we really haven't seen any change in value. They remain strong.","Mark Connelly","And then just one quick question. Devin, on the South; how much is the wet weather and the wet soil in the South, affecting your current harvesting? And when do you think we get back to normal, if there's any such thing as normal weather anymore?","Devin Stockfish","Yes. Well, in the second quarter, there is no question, it was difficult logging conditions. And we did lose some volume. It was only slight for us. And so, down just a few million dollars in terms of the actual dollar impact to us. But there is no question, logging conditions are very difficult when you have that amount of rain.","What I would say is, you know it doesn't typically take all that long for the woods to dry out this time of year. And so we did see a good rain storm coming through in Arkansas, we saw a little bit in Louisiana. Most of the other regions have dried out for the most part. So, I think by and large, you're probably seeing relatively normal logging \u2013 activity across the south at this point.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Please go ahead.","Steven Chercover","So just to begin with respect to your black at the bottom initiative within wood products, is this what black at the bottom, looks like. And of your 100 sorry, 80 million to 100 million OpEx targets how much more might trickle into the wood products bucket?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, with respect to the OpEx piece. So of the 80 to 100 or 40 to 50 of that is in our wood products business. And what I would say is, by the end of this year will be essentially there on back at the bottom, outside of maybe one or two mills. But I think certainly we're \u2013 by all intents and purposes, we're going to be there by the end of the year. In terms of what black at the bottom, looks like it certainly is not a great pricing environment. I wouldn't call this what I would see as the bottom. And so, we're certainly planning the black at the bottom initiative for pricing south of this.","Steven Chercover","And so with respect to your fleet, then it's effectively about as modern as you can get until there is a new generation of technology that you could invest in and deploy across the asset base?","Devin Stockfish","Yes, I actually wouldn't say that at all. I mean it's a range we have certain mills in our systems Dierks and millport, which are clearly best-in-class technology. But we have plenty of other mills in our system that are a bit more aged and we're slowly building up that technology and that's part of our capital expenditure plan in our program we have roadmaps at each mill. So I wouldn't say that we're anywhere near having best-in-class technology across our entire wood product portfolio.","Steven Chercover","And then switching gears a bit, and keeping in mind the statement, the timber values remain strong. Would it be fair to say that in this environment, you have more sellers than buyers and would you have the financial flexibility to transact if an attractive asset came to market?","Russell Hagen","Yes, Steve, this is Russell. Yeah, we're obviously in the market we have timber operations in every major wood basket in the United States. So, we see everything that comes to the market. I would say that if there is an opportunity to acquire Timberlands that created shareholder value and fit within our portfolio. And we could demonstrate that we could capture the synergies from that that's clearly something that we would look at. I mean, our long-term view is to build the most valuable timber portfolio.","So that would add to that overall strategy. As far as how we're looking this on the buyer sell side. As Devin mentioned, we're constantly looking at our portfolio to optimize it to make sure that we are the rightful owner of every asset in every market. And in doing so we may identify areas or properties that don't fit on the long-term basis, but again that's just an ongoing process that we work through every day.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Paul Quinn","I just had a couple of easy questions on the wood product side, one surprise to me was EWP and the outperformance there and it doesn't seem to be price related at all. I guess there is a little bit of tailwind on cost but real big volume pick up. And noting that business is really into new home construction just trying to understand, we didn't see a lot of big pickup in new home construction in the first half. So why was that segment so strong?","Devin Stockfish","Yes well, that's a great point I'd just say I'm incredibly proud of the work that our EWP team is doing. Really there are a couple of things there it's first and foremost, our manufacturing team is doing a great job managing costs, running our mills efficiently, and that's a great starting point. We've got terrific products in our EWP business and our sales and marketing team does an excellent job of servicing customers and that's a good recipe for success regardless of market conditions.","And so, we were able to move profitable volume across our portfolio of products in the quarter and I think that's really what drove the results.","Paul Quinn","And then, just you did a good job at outlining sort of BC log cost, you know you\u2019ve got a couple mills in Alberta what are you seeing there, log cost wise and any type of inflation you're seeing as well?","Devin Stockfish","Not really any sort of meaningful appreciation of log costs in Alberta those remaining reasonable. Again, it's all wood basket dependent in one respect and we have good fiber availability near the mills that we're running in Alberta. And so they don't have the same stumpage model in Alberta as they do in BC so didn't seem that that same uptick in July that you saw in the British Columbia region. So log costs are pretty much comparable.","Operator","And today's final question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead.","Anthony Pettinari","You've spoken about very wet weather depressing homebuilder demand throughout the first half of the year. I guess when you look at July, are you seeing or can you quantify any kind of demand-pull or reacceleration of job site activity? And then just generally when you have this kind of prolonged poor weather do these projects just get pushed later into the season or is there some portion that's just sort of loss for the year?","Devin Stockfish","Yes with respect to July from what we're seeing with our customers. There seems to be steady demand and steady pull-through. And so we still anticipate the construction activity will continue to build momentum and we haven't seen anything that would lead us to a different conclusion in July. With respect to the projects that were delayed in the first half due to weather. I think there is a general optimism among our customers and the homebuilders that they're going to make some of that up now.","Realistically, there is a limit on how much of that they're going to be able to make up this year, primarily because of labor availability. I think if people can get the folks to actually go out and do the building, they're going to make up a pretty fair amount, but I think has been much discussed that remains a challenge throughout the industry. So they will make up some, I doubt they will make up all but we would anticipate as I said, a pickup in activity to see when we get to the end of the year some moderate level of growth year-over-year.","Anthony Pettinari","And then just a quick question on Southern log obviously, there is still a 25% tariff in China and you discussed the weakness in radiata pine and some of the underlying weakness in China. With all that said, are you still shipping Southern Yellow Pine to China, if you can quantify that? And then just while you're at India obviously a smaller market, but one that had been growing pretty quickly, just wondering if there's anything you kind of add-on, on India as well?","Devin Stockfish","With respect to China Southern Yellow Pine at a 25% tariff that's a pretty steep headwind. And so we're still shipping to China at a relatively low level really the amount that we need just to keep the supply chain open. We've got a few really good customers in China for Southern Yellow Pine and they're using that still. And so we're still getting a bit of a takeaway on the Southern Yellow Pine but certainly at a much-reduced rate than we had been on a trajectory even a year ago.","With respect to India, we have been shipping into that market sort of off and on over the last 18 months. One of the things that we saw when they put the tariffs on Southern Yellow Pine that caused some market disruptions. Some of the volume that was headed for China ended up in India. And so it was a little choppy, but I think that's normalized a bit and so I think that will be an interesting market for us, still very small, but an opportunity to grow over time.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Devin Stockfish","All right terrific. All right well, I think that was our final question, so thank you to everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining the Weyerhaeuser second quarter 2019 earnings conference call.

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Denise M. Merle","Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2014 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website.","On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations.","I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you, Denise. Welcome, everyone, and Happy Halloween.","This morning, we reported strong third quarter results in each of our businesses as our employees continue to drive sustainable performance improvements through relentless execution of our operational excellence initiatives.","Net earnings for the quarter totaled approximately $1.15 billion or $2.15 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.9 billion. This includes a gain of approximately $970 million related to the July 7 divestiture of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company.","Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we earned $178 million or $0.33 per diluted share, an increase of almost 31% compared with the year-ago quarter. Special items for the third quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to a post-retirement health plan and restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions.","I will begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about market conditions. Housing starts continued to improve in the third quarter but at a measured pace. We now anticipate approximately 1 million housing starts for 2014. We are confident that housing markets will continue to strengthen, supported by employment growth and increasing consumer confidence. We are also encouraged by changes recently proposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency that would improve mortgage credit availability.","Looking forward to 2015, our outlook is in line with consensus forecasts, which anticipate 1.1 million to 1.2 million housing starts and an accelerated single-family recovery.","Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $136 million to third quarter earnings compared with $170 million in the second quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes declined as we intentionally accelerated harvest during early 2014 in anticipation of lower price realizations in the third quarter.","Realization for Western logs declined due to the normal -- due to normal seasonal increases in domestic supply and softer Asian markets. Inventories at Chinese ports, although down from their peak, are still elevated and takeaway remains below normal levels.","Sales volumes to Japan increased due to timing of shipments. Our Longview Timber acquisition contributed $36 million of EBITDA in the third quarter and remains on track to achieve our 2014 target of $175 million to $185 million of EBITDA.","In the South, fee harvest volumes increased due to improved weather conditions. Average realizations for southern logs rose slightly compared with the second quarter.","Third quarter earnings included $19 million from disposition of nonstrategic timberlands, a decrease of $5 million compared with second quarter. Operational excellence initiatives to optimize truck scheduling, road construction and maintenance and silviculture practices contributed to Timberlands' strong performance in the quarter.","Wood Products, Charts 6 and 7. Wood Products earned $105 million in the third quarter, a slight improvement compared with the second quarter. EBITDA increased to $135 million. In lumber, EBITDA improved by $8 million compared with the second quarter.","Average price realizations improved approximately 1% as higher realizations for narrow lumber were partially offset by lower prices for wide dimension lumber. Log cost for our western mills declined and operating rates fell slightly. This business continues to implement operational excellence initiatives focused on reducing manufacturing cost net of logs.","In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $3 million compared with second quarter as a decline in average realizations was partially offset by lower manufacturing cost. This business remains focused on lowering cost, improving operating reliability and increasing sales of higher-value products.","Engineered wood products reported third quarter EBITDA of $27 million, a slight decrease compared with second quarter. Average sales realizations improved for solid section products in TJI joists as we captured the value of our announced second quarter price increase and benefited from a favorable sales mix. These improvements were offset by lower sales volumes across most product lines as second quarter included prebuying in advance of the price increase and customers managed inventories tightly during the third quarter.","The distribution business reported EBITDA of $5 million in the third quarter, an improvement of $2 million. This business remains focused on improving margins and lowering costs. Our engineered wood products and distribution businesses continued to make strong progress against their operational excellence targets, and we remain confident that both of these businesses will improve EBITDA by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 compared with 2013.","Cellulose Fibers, Charts 8 and 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $59 million to earnings, down from $91 million in the second quarter. Fluff pulp markets remained strong through the third quarter, and average realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board increased. This was offset by substantially higher maintenance costs due to a scheduled increase in maintenance outage days within the pulp mill system and an extended planned outage at our liquid packaging board facility. Our liquid packaging board facility restarted in early October and is running well following the safe and successful completion of several maintenance and capital projects. The Cellulose Fibers business continues to demonstrate excellent offer -- excellent operational performance.","Let me now switch gears briefly to SG&A and other matters. Our SG&A initiative remains on track, and I am highly confident we will achieve our $70 million run-rate reduction target by year-end.","On August 13, our Board of Directors approved a 32% increase in our quarterly dividend and authorized a $700 million share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 19% of that authorization. Our foremost priority for capital allocation is returning cash to shareholders, and these actions demonstrate that commitment.","Also in August, we announced we will move our corporate headquarters from Federal Way, Washington, to Seattle. We expect the move to occur in mid- to late 2016, when construction of our new leased building will be complete.","Although our existing campus has served us very well over the years, it is too large and too costly for our current needs. Our move to Seattle is an important step forward and will help position Weyerhaeuser for future success.","I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our fourth quarter outlook.","Patricia M. Bedient","Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for the fourth quarter is on Chart 11. I will begin my comments with Timberlands.","Starting with log exports in the West. Log inventories at Chinese ports are still at elevated levels, which will likely result in somewhat lower sales volumes to China this quarter. We also expect lower sales volumes to Japan, primarily as a result of timing of shipments, and realization for our Japanese exports are expected to increase modestly due to mix.","Sales realizations for domestic logs in the West are expected to increase compared to the third quarter. In the South, we anticipate volumes will increase slightly with flat pricing.","Silviculture costs are expected to increase seasonally. Earnings from nonstrategic Timberlands sales and miscellaneous items are anticipated to be approximately $15 million lower in Q4 compared to Q3, primarily as a result of timing. Excluding these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the third quarter.","In our Wood Products segment, the fourth quarter is the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. Because of the seasonal slowdown, we expect lower sales volumes across all product lines.","Average sales realizations for both lumber and OSB are expected to weaken relative to the third quarter. Log costs are anticipated to increase somewhat with seasonal inventory build and weather-related restrictions.","Production volumes in the fourth quarter will decrease due to the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. This downtime will result in higher per-unit manufacturing costs. Consistent with the normal seasonal pattern, we expect fourth quarter earnings in our Wood Products segment to be lower than the third quarter, and likely comparable to the fourth quarter of last year.","Moving on to Cellulose Fibers. Worldwide inventories for softwood pulp at the end of the third quarter were at 27 days, slightly below normal levels. Demand for our products continues to be strong, especially for our fluff pulp, and we expect mostly -- pricing to be stable in the fourth quarter. Sales realizations for liquid packaging board are expected to be somewhat lower due to grade mix, and fiber costs are expected to be higher.","Total maintenance expense for the segment will be much lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. As I discussed on our last quarter call, we had an extended planned shutdown at our Longview operation during the third quarter for maintenance and installation of capital equipment. We had a very successful startup of the mill, which was completed during the first week of this month. The mill is running well, and customer response has been very positive. During the fourth quarter, we planned only one mill down for maintenance. That shutdown was completed earlier this month, and that mill is also back up and running well. We expect earnings on our Cellulose Fibers segment to be significantly higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third.","Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. As shown on Chart 12, during the third quarter, we invested approximately $112 million in capital expenditures in our businesses. This brings our year-to-date expenditures through the third quarter to $271 million, and we still estimate total expenditures for the year, including reforestation, to be approximately $400 million.","As reported earlier, we completed the divestiture of our home building business in early July. As a result of the transaction, we retired approximately 59 million shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of over $700 million during the third quarter. These proceeds, combined with strong cash flow from operations during the quarter, resulted in a cash balance of approximately $1.6 billion as of the end of the third quarter.","Chart 13 details significant actions we are taking to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In August, the board increased our quarterly cash dividend by 32% to $0.29 per share or $1.16 on an annual basis.","Based on the closing stock price at the end of the third quarter, that equates to a 3.6% yield. In August, the board also authorized a $700 million share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares, using approximately $130 million, at an average price of $33.63.","As a result of the WRECO divestiture and of the share repurchase program, we reduced our outstanding share count during the quarter by over 10%.","Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle.","Doyle R. Simons","Thank you, Patty. As many of you have heard me say over the past few months, we are relentlessly focused on performance and capital allocation to grow shareholder value. The pace with which we have begun to execute our share repurchase program illustrates our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. Through our operational excellence initiatives, we remain focused on driving performance to sustainably grow earnings and cash flow and deliver additional value to our shareholders.","And now I'd like to open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just a question on Wood Products. If I look year-to-date, it seems like your third-party sales volumes in lumber and OSB are sort of flat with the first 3 quarters of 2013. And if I think that housing starts are growing, and maybe your operating rates are in the low 90s and you have maybe some room to ratchet them up, is there a reason that your volumes in lumber specifically aren't up more year-over-year? And by that same token, if we do 1.1 million to 1.2 million starts next year, would you expect your volumes to be up in 2015 by a decent amount?","Patricia M. Bedient","Anthony, as we look at our volumes for lumber, I think, year-to-date -- based on year-to-date, we were pretty flat, as you said. But I think that the third quarter, we probably produced a little bit less than what we thought we would. And as we look at 2015, I think that we have the ability to increase with the market, which, as Doyle said, we don't have a real robust outlook for housing starts, although they will continue to improve as we move forward.","Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Okay. And then, Doyle, last week, one of your competitors in fluff pulp said it was exploring the possibility of putting their mill system in an MLP structure. And I was wondering, obviously, Weyerhaeuser's a REIT, and the Cellulose Fiber's business is in a TRS. But is the MLP angle something that you've looked at? Or do you have any thoughts you can share on whether this structure might ultimately be appropriate for Cellulose Fibers?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes, and that, Anthony, is something we have looked at, and I'll ask Patty to give a little bit more color on that, because she's coordinating that effort for us.","Patricia M. Bedient","Anthony, we are actively looking at the applicability of the structure. As you know, there are a number of uncertainties, and not the least of those is the fact that the IRS has put on pause issuing any additional private letter rulings until they've completed a thorough review of the MLP structure overall. We don't have clarity on when that will be, but we do continue to monitor the situation. And if we think it will add value, we'll move forward with our review. We have consulted our advisers, and we have included their input into our review. As you probably know, a number of years ago, there was a private letter ruling for pulp, but private letter rulings are fact-specific, and technically, can only be relied on by the taxpayer that's making that particular application. And given the fact that the IRS is now undertaking an in-depth review, we don't think it would be prudent to move forward without a ruling. And so we're sort of on pause, waiting to see what happens. We haven't made any decisions one way or the other, but we'll continue to monitor the situation.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Doyle, Patty. Doyle, the progress that you're making in the Wood Products business is pretty impressive. I wondered if you could give us a sense of where you think the gains are coming from. Is it kind of better commercial performance, just better operating performance, reduced cost? And where do you think you are on a sort of a scale of 1 to 10, in terms of optimizing those wood businesses?","Doyle R. Simons","So Mark, thanks for that comment. And there is a lot of really good work going on in our Wood Products businesses. In terms of the progress we're making, as we've identified, and starting with lumber, we said that we think there's $100 million opportunity there, and as we've previously said, we'll think we'll get $30 million to $40 million of that in 2014. And then part of what we're going to be doing on December 9, Mark, on our Investor Day is being -- laying out more details of what we think the opportunity is and the timing is in that business and our others going forward. In OSB, similarly, we've made some progress there. More work to do, but again we've identified 50 to 60 of operational excellence opportunities, and more work to do there. We will get 5 to 10 of that, we believe, in 2014. In ELP and distribution where we had, in my opinion, and I think most people's opinions, the biggest opportunity to improve. As I said in my comments, very encouraged by the progress we are making in both of those businesses, and we believe we're going to improve. Despite not great housing starts, we think we're going to improve both the EBITDA in both of those businesses by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013, and we're on track to do that. I would tell you, Mark, to your exact question, there's still a lot of work to do in both of those businesses and opportunities. With the $30 million to $40 million, the way we think about it proves that we -- or shows that we've earned the right to be in those businesses, and our next step is to show that we can win in those businesses, and part of winning, of course, is earning above cost of capital over the cycle. So good progress there, very encouraged by all the hard work that our employees have done, but still a lot of work to do in both of our ELP and distribution businesses.","Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada","Okay. And if I could, as a follow-on, just for Patty, even if we assume the rest of the share repurchase were to happen in the fourth quarter, it still looks like you're going to be sitting on over $1 billion of cash. Can you talk to us about how much cash you want to carry going forward? And just thoughts on the use of that residual cash.","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, Mark. In terms of how much cash we carry, it's a function of where we are in the cycle, it -- we'll use some cash in the first quarter. At least, we hope to use some cash in the first quarter to build some working capital as housing recovers. So that's one place that we're looking. We also are continuing to utilize the share repurchase, as you said. As we look at capital allocation, our priorities for capital allocation, first and foremost, has been returning cash to shareholders. We increased the dividend, as we talked about. Continuing to execute on that share repurchase. And then, we'll also be investing in our businesses in our capital expenditure program. We'll give you a little more color on that when we get to our December Investor Day and then certainly on our earnings call for the fourth quarter. I would expect that may be a little higher than this current year, not a huge magnitude. And then obviously, as we've said before, we're looking to grow our businesses in a disciplined way. Our first priority there would be in Timberlands, but there's no imperative that I have to grow. So we're being very disciplined about looking at all areas where we would utilize that cash. In addition, we do have the credit line that doesn't expire until September of 2018. $1 billion that has not been utilized to this point. So we really feel very good about our opportunities to continue to provide value to shareholders as we go forward. So it's a nice place to be.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Doyle, I guess my first question, maybe this is under the category of \"no good deed goes unpunished.\" I mean, you've done quite well in Wood Products, Mark was noting that in his Q&A. If we look at Slide 7 of your deck, we generally see product prices that are flat to higher on average than where they were last year, OSB maybe being an exception there. We know the progress that you're making in cost reductions and operational excellence. So I was just curious why, if I heard you correctly, fourth quarter guidance and EBIT for Wood will be flat year-on-year, not to mention the progress you've already made this year-to-date? And then I had a couple of follow-ons.","Doyle R. Simons","George, I would say, just from a seasonal perspective, as you know, the fourth quarter is the slowest seasonal period. So that's going to have some pick on -- impact on our performance in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. If you look year-over-year, we have made improvements, as you've said, and part of the year-over-year will be impacted by sales realizations. We'll -- it remains to be seen what happens in the quarter. I will tell you, currently, lumber prices are down roughly $10 in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. OSB, down roughly $5 in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But part of it, of course, will be, if you look at pricing on the chart that you refer to, specifically in OSB, if you look at it year-over-year levels, pricing will be down fairly significantly in OSB fourth quarter of 2014 versus fourth quarter of 2013. So we'll see how that plays out for the balance of the year, but that's the biggest driver of what's going on.","George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, and that's fair. We appreciate the thought. If we switch gears a little bit, but still within Wood Products, and I recognize, again, this is probably going to be something you'll talk more about in detail on December 9, can you give us a little bit of a flavor in terms of what kinds of investments you're making within the mills? Is it similar to what you did at your former shop in terms of automation and improvement of yield? But -- can you give us a little bit more color there? And then, my follow-on, and I'll turn it over, again, you're clearly getting improvement in SG&A, at least in terms of the numbers that we are seeing across the segment. Do you worry at all that with the cost reductions, and you're on target for your $75 million, that at some point in time, that begins to impact negatively your ability to be commercially more effective within Wood Products, i.e., you cut a little bit too much on the cost side, cut into the bone?","Doyle R. Simons","Thanks, George, for the questions. So in terms of what we're doing in investment in our Wood Products businesses, George, those are specific investments that will be made to lower our costs. This is proven technology that's in place in some of our mills, and we will be extending that to additional mills. But again, the key focus is on investments, improving technology that are focused on lowering costs. This is technology that we are comfortable with, we know how to put it in and are confident as we implement these capital expenditures that we will ultimately get the cost reduction associated with that. In terms of the SG&A, as I said earlier, we are on track to achieve the $75 million cost-reduction initiatives in SG&A. With that said, I am not worried at all about that cutting into the bone, as you said, in Wood Products. These are cost-reduction initiatives across the entire organization, and we are making sure that we are still very well positioned from a commercial standpoint and able to do what is necessary to service our customers going forward. So no concern regarding that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Doyle, with all of the work on operational improvement, do you think we're going to see a faster rate of growth in profits in REIT income or TRS income over the next, say, 12 and 24 months, assuming housing continues the slow recovery?","Doyle R. Simons","Mark, as you know, we are looking at operational excellence across the entire organization, in our Timberlands business as well as our manufacturing businesses, and we've laid out specific targets for both. We've given an update on where we are on each of those for 2014 versus 2013. And we'll, as I said, in December 9, be giving more clarity on what 2015 looks like. So I think there's opportunity, Mark, and clearly on the REIT assets, on the Timberland, and encouraged by the progress we're making there, and there's also opportunities on the manufacturing side, both in Wood Products and Cellulose Fiber. If you look at it just from a dollar basis in terms of what we've laid out and add it up, the bigger numbers are, of course, in Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers combined, compared with the Timberland business, but we're focused on operational excellence across into -- our entire organization including, as you'd -- as we just alluded to, the $75 million of SG&A.","Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Okay. And just one more question. How much of the improvement that we saw in engineered wood this quarter was attributable to lower OSB prices? And should we assume that, that division has already seen the full benefits of the decline we've seen so far?","Doyle R. Simons","So only a minor part, Mark, of the -- of what you saw in the ELP was a result of the lower OSB prices. And yes, you should assume -- we'll see what happens to OSB prices from this point forward, but yes, you should assume most of that benefit has played through the system.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Yes, just given things where housing starts are and where southern sawlog prices are and just with your thoughts on sort of housing starts for 2015, could you share some thoughts, I guess, on the type of harvest growth you may be planning for in the West and the South as we look out to 2015?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes. No, on the southern harvest, we have kind of been expecting, as we've talked to you about, a slow, steady increase in southern sawlog pricing for 2014. And that's generally what we've seen, up 3% to 4%. We continue to have consistent demand from our customers. So we're not planning, at this time, any type of deferral as we look into 2015. We'll continue to keep a close eye on market conditions. Just in terms of how we think about our harvest overall, what we look at is the financial maturity of -- and the expected market demand, and those are the factors that we use to build our harvest plans going forward, and we're working on those for 2015. We also, as you know and we've talked about, have the ability to flex some during a year and during a specific quarter. And you saw some of that earlier this year as we capitalized on stronger export prices in the first half of 2014 and 2015. And we'll continue to hopefully capitalize on those opportunities in 2015 and beyond.","Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just on the Wood Products side, I don't know if you could kind of quantify the type of volume declines you're looking for in the fourth quarter. And then, I mean, is this -- are these declines just sort of typical seasonal declines? Or are they driven by, I guess, a greater-than-expected drop in demand at all?","Doyle R. Simons","No, these -- what we are talking about, Tyler, is just your typical seasonal-type slowdown in the fourth quarter. As Patty said in her comments, the fourth quarter is typically the slowest seasonal period from a Wood Products perspective.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Maybe tagging on, on the question of kind of 2015 outlook, and again, I appreciate we'll get more either in December or January, but given the housing outlook that you put out for 2015, how do you think that affects the trajectory of sawlog pricing in the South? Do you think it's kind of more of the same? Do you see any chance for acceleration?","Doyle R. Simons","Gail, our best guess on southern sawlog pricing is we will continue to see slow, steady improvement. I think the range we gave on housing, 1.1 million to 1.2 million; at the upper end of that range, I think you could see maybe an acceleration in pricing in southern sawlog, even above the 3% to 4% that we anticipate for 2014. If it's at the lower end of that rage, then maybe it's more in the 3%, 4%, 5% range that we've seen for -- or we anticipate for 2014 versus 2013. So that's our kind of best guess on southern sawlogs in the near term.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of the log export markets? How severe do you think the inventory situation is in China? How long do you think it would take to normalize? And x the timing of volumes to Japan, can you give us a sense of kind of the underlying trend in Japan, particularly relative to -- has it fully worked through the consumption tax at this point?","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, Gail. This is Patty. As we think about China, as I've said, inventories are still at higher-than-normal levels, and the takeaway is going a little slower than probably what we would have expected last quarter when we were on the call. But they are working their way through. That'll probably take through the rest of this quarter. So we don't anticipate any significant change in direction for the quarter other than what I talked about earlier. In Japan, I think that, stepping back from that, too, you'd have to say there's the Japanese market overall, but then there's also the customers that we have. And the customers that we have worked with, as you know, for some of them well over 20 years, are really talking to us about making sure that they get the volume that they need to support their operations. So they're large customers. They have very efficient supply chains, both in terms of the supply for logs, but importantly as well, how they merchandise lumber in Japan. So volumes in Japan, as I said, are primarily down because of timing. We had a little better shipments in the third quarter, as Doyle talked about in his remarks. So we are still confident in our Japan volumes, although pricing will be impacted as we go forward based upon what things do overall. But we do expect our realizations to Japan for this quarter to be up a little bit because we'll have a little bit higher freight to Japan, relative.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And on engineered wood, do you think the volume you saw in the third quarter is reflective of kind of the underlying market? Or was it depressed due to payback from the outside strength in the second quarter?","Doyle R. Simons","I think, the -- we clearly saw, as we indicated after the second quarter -- or on the second quarter call, Gail, some pre-buying in the second quarter, due to the price increase that went in late in the second quarter in our engineered wood business. So I think maybe if you average the 2, that would probably be kind of the normalized rate. But clearly, we had some pre-buying in the second quarter versus the third.","Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And just one last quick one. Patty, can you possibly quantify, particularly since it seems like you're already done, what the outage expense would be for the fourth quarter in Cellulose?","Patricia M. Bedient","Sure, Gail. As we looked at Cellulose Fibers, if you look at Chart 9, where we detailed the maintenance expense and outage days, so in the third quarter, we had about 38 days of maintenance downtime. We would expect, because we are now complete, that, that would be about 14 days for the fourth quarter. So that's a difference of around 24 days. And as I've said in the past, each day is usually about $1 million. So it's around a $20 million delta from third quarter to fourth quarter, which is the primary difference between our outlook for the fourth quarter as it compares to the third.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Doyle, engineered wood products, could you just talk about how engineered wood is performing in the marketplace relative to lumber in single-family construction? And any progress, if any of those been made, in further penetrating the multifamily end market with engineered wood?","Doyle R. Simons","Sure, so in engineered wood, we continue to be, as I mentioned earlier, about the -- encouraged by the progress that we're making. As you see from our overall shipment numbers, we continue to gain in terms of capturing profitable share going forward. And some of that is coming from multifamily. Still, the -- I don't want to mislead you. The key driver for engineered wood has been and will continue to be single-family, but we have had some successes in moving into multifamily in terms of our engineered wood products.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then, at the Analyst Day last year, we talked about the performance in engineered wood and distribution, that it materially improved, and that potentially, those businesses will not be part of the portfolio longer term. Obviously, we've seen very meaningful improvement in those businesses. So are we at a point now where the improvement is enough where we would -- we can say that engineered wood and distribution will be part of Weyerhaeuser for the long term?","Doyle R. Simons","Alex, the way I would answer that is -- and I think I said this earlier, is the $30 million to $40 million was necessary to show that we deserve the right to be in those businesses. I think we are delivering on that. So our next step now is to show that we can win in these businesses, and again, we define winning as showing that we can earn above cost of capital in each of these businesses over a cycle. That's going to take some additional work in each of these businesses going forward, but that's what we're focused on doing, winning both from a cost of capital perspective and showing that we can be the leader in each of these businesses going forward. And that's the way we think about it.","Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Understood. I mean, just last one on share buybacks. So good to see that happen in the quarter. Should we read into an issue -- in terms of the amount and the timing, is that any sort of potential number that we could see consistently on a go-forward basis? Is that some sort of run rate that we can think about on a go-forward basis that you could -- you can buy back?","Doyle R. Simons","No, what I would read into it is the fact that we are committed to executing this share repurchase plan in a -- on a timely basis. The comment we made when we announced this authorization is this is one we fully anticipated completing on a timely basis. We will report to you, just as we did this quarter, the progress we're making going forward. But I wouldn't read into, just to say we're going to do this amount every quarter based on what we did for half a quarter in third quarter of 2014.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Doyle and Patty, first question is, we've seen a pretty interesting divergence of opinion in the last few weeks. And one way you guys can, of course, buy timber is just by buying your own stock, and it looks like we've seen 2 of your competitors, one step up and pay pretty close to peak prices, I guess, for southern lands, and another of your competitors decided to focus more on, not only maybe being buying back stock, but actually selling land into The Street to buy back stock. And I didn't know if you had an opinion on what you thought of land values. And I'm really thinking of the South at this point, where there seems to be a divergence of opinion, and whether we would see you step up now or hang back?","Doyle R. Simons","So Chip, I think you can look at our actions in terms of the way we think about things. Clearly, as we've already highlighted, we are in the market actively repurchasing our shares. So we are convinced that we are creating value for our shareholders for doing that. In terms of actively buying timberland, there's no doubt that there are lots of opportunities out there to do that in today's market. There's also lots of money chasing those deals. We look at those deals, each and every one of them that comes along. And as we've said before, we're going to be very disciplined in what we actually acquire. And to date, we have not made any acquisitions in the South. The type of transactions we're looking for, again, actions, are the ones that are along the lines of what we did in the Longview acquisition. And you can look at the type of returns that we are generating from that acquisition that we made last year. That's not a South-versus-West statement, Chip. We'd look for -- if the right opportunities are there, that where we think we can grow value for shareholders, we would look at making acquisitions, both in the West and in the South. But we're just going to continue to be very disciplined in the way we look at those potential acquisition opportunities going forward.","Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Last year, I seem to recall that you all made a point of saying that lumber and OSB were a little bit more strategic and possible areas of growth through acquisition, than say, EWP and distribution. And I just wanted to know if you're still open to making acquisitions if the right thing comes along in those 2 businesses that you've mentioned. And if those other 2 businesses, EWP and distribution, continue to improve, as they've certainly done this year, could they also be areas that maybe in a couple of years you could see growing in?","Doyle R. Simons","Chip, I don't specifically remember making the comment that you just referred to, but let me talk about how we think about acquisitions generally. As we've consistently said, we think our biggest opportunities for acquisitions are going to be in our Timberland business. With that said, if we can add -- find acquisition opportunities in our Wood Products business, or Cellulose Fiber business for that matter, that will result in additional shareholder value, that's something we would look at. Now we don't feel compelled to grow any of our businesses. But again, if we can find bolt-on type acquisitions in Wood Products or Cellulose Fibers that we think add value for shareholders, that's something we would potentially consider. But again, we think our biggest opportunities for acquisition will be in our Timberland business.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just a couple of cleanups. In engineered wood, can you please tell us what your operating rate was in the quarter? And what you expect it to be in 2015?","Doyle R. Simons","The operating rate in the third quarter, Steve, continued to be in the mid-7 range -- so roughly 70%- to 75%-type range operating rates in EWP in the third quarter. And we'll see what happens to housing. But I don't think that number will -- so I would anticipate, if housing continues to improve, that number could go up going forward.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Yes, and I was going to say, given that housing has kind of underwhelmed over the last couple of years, is it appropriate to budget your production to the lower end of that 1.1 million to 1.2 million range? Maybe particularly with respect to OSB?","Doyle R. Simons","Well, yes. OSB is a different story, of course. And what I would tell you in OSB is we took 20 days of downtime in the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we would anticipate higher amounts of downtime due to normal seasonal factors, holiday season and some maintenance and capital projects that are going in place in terms of OSB in the fourth quarter.","Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Great. The final question, with respect to your understanding of MLPs, is converting logs into lumber panels in EWP also eligible? Or is it just for pulp-based businesses?","Patricia M. Bedient","Steve, as I said before, that the IRS has a project, a very complete project that they've undertaken, and it seems they're taking even a little bit longer than maybe what was anticipated when they announced the project, which was back towards the beginning of this year. So I think it's difficult to know, really, where they'll come out on their deliberations. What we do know, as I said before, was a number of years ago, they did have a ruling on pulp. But whether or not they will modify that ruling and application going forward, and whether or not they would say anything about the other businesses is still yet to be known. So tough to give you any more clarity. I wish we all had a little more clarity at this point, but that's sort of what we know as we sit here today.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I too, like George, was looking at Chart 7, where you had Wood Products volumes and pricing. And I had something of a different question, and that's the lumber, engineered wood and if we threw plywood on here, it'd be the same. Prices have been pretty good over the last 1.5 years. Obviously, OSB has been a very different story. There was a lot of restarts last year, but that was a while ago. Any thoughts as to why it's taking so long for OSB to regain its footing and what needs to happen for the markets to get into balance and more profitable?","Doyle R. Simons","Mark, I think you said it right. There was significant additional supply that came online, I think in anticipation of maybe stronger housing starts than we've seen occur in the 2014-type time frame. So I think it's a simple supply-and-demand equation that appears to be out of balance currently, and that's what has resulted in the current pricing environment.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Do you think there are any structural impediments, though, to regaining balance? Because I'm not sure the operating rates in engineered wood are higher, or for that matter in gypsum, than in OSB. It just seems to be that the market struggles to adjust to the demand situation. Any thoughts as to what impediments might be in place?","Doyle R. Simons","No, Mark, I don't think there are any long-term structural impediments. OSB tends to be very volatile, as you very well know, over a cycle, and I think we're just in one of those periods of low pricing currently.","Patricia M. Bedient","One thing I would say, Mark, that's different in the 2 technologies. OSB, when capacity comes on the market, comes on in pretty big chunks, and people seek to run those mills 24\/7 because of the type of operation that they are. So I think when new capacity starts up, as we saw a number of mills earlier this year, it takes a longer time for the market to absorb it if the housing doesn't recover as quickly as I think what people anticipated as we started the year. So I think I would point to that as the difference between the 2 technologies. Lumber, similarly, also is a more fragmented business that capacity comes on in smaller chunks than what OSB does.","Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","Fair enough. And certainly, I realize it's not your job to be prognosticating on price actions, et cetera, but given your housing starts forecast for next year, is it feasible that OSB gets into balance? Or do you think we're still a ways away?","Doyle R. Simons","Mark, I think, as we move through 2015 and housing continues to improve, I think they're in the range that we laid out. You could see an environment -- and again, we're not prognosticators of pricing and we'll leave that to others, but I think you could see a point where that is more in balance going forward.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Yes, just following up on, I think, Chip's question on Timberland transactions and trying to get your viewpoint about your actions. If you could give us a little bit more color on your nonstrategic Timberland sales, where are those happening? Is it more West-based than South? And in terms of transaction values, are you seeing a steady increase over the last year?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes, so we have those in both the West and the South. I'll give you an example of one that was in the third quarter. It happened to be in Oklahoma. It was a tract that was roughly 760 acres, and it sold for $14,000-plus per acre. So that's an example of what we see occurring out in the marketplace right now. So some of it's truly nonstrategic, some of it's more HBU-type land, and that's what we've seen going on, and we think will continue to be opportunities for us going forward.","Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and just getting back to the Q4 outlook on lower lumber and OSB pricing. Just specifically on the OSB side, it looks like those prices bottomed out in September, and we've seen, depending on the region, about anywhere from 10% to 14% price lifts since that point. What's your level of confidence that prices will be lower quarter-over-quarter?","Doyle R. Simons","Again, we're not better than anybody else in predicting what's going to happen on prices. The number that I referenced earlier is, if you look at third quarter average versus October-to-date prices, October-to-date is down roughly $5 for our overall mix. So that's to give you some sense of where we are today. Now again, that third quarter average, you referenced end of the third quarter, but if you look at third quarter average versus October-to-date, that's where we ended up.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James.","Collin Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of cleanups here. Just kind of a follow-up to Gail's question on Japan. You mentioned that you're seeing better realizations in 4Q due to mix. How are like comparable-quality log prices? Are they still falling in that market? Or are you actually starting to see some stabilization and lift on kind of an apples-to-apples basis there?","Patricia M. Bedient","I would say that Japan is stable as it relates to price, overall. And as I said, both in terms of the volume to Japan, we are also very pleased with the customer relationships that we have that really are focused on making sure that they have adequate supply of Douglas fir logs in order to supply their large operations.","Collin Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, Patty. And then, as far as the Cellulose Fibers guidance for 4Q, could you see, as far as from an earnings contribution, a bounce back all the way to what you saw in 2Q? Or is it probably going to fall out somewhere between what we had saw in 3Q and -- I'm sorry, between 2Q and 3Q?","Patricia M. Bedient","Well, I think, as you look at that, the major difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter is going to be that roughly $20 million of maintenance expense that I referenced when Gail asked her question. There are some puts and takes and other -- I said liquid packaging realizations will be down. Pulp pricing should be pretty stable. But the major difference between the 2 is that -- 2 quarters, is that $20 million of maintenance.","Collin Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay, Patty. And then just one last big-picture question, Doyle, and kind of a follow-up to both Chip's and Paul's questions. Just given the strong bid for timberland right now, have you thought about just becoming more aggressive as far as capital recycling within the Timberland business? More specifically, are there certain wood baskets in the U.S. South that you want to try and get more aggressive in and have a bigger presence in, and maybe exit some of the regions you are in now? Because just looking at your footprint in the region, there are some areas in states where you have a pretty large concentration, and then some other areas where we're seeing arguably a little bit better signs of a price recovery in sawlogs that you're not in. So are you looking at kind of shifting some capital around within Timberland from that perspective?","Doyle R. Simons","Yes, that's a good question. And as you, I think, know, and as we've talked about before, we're always looking to improve through trading and buying and selling the overall quality of our timberlands. And some of that may include, as you alluded to, potentially getting in markets maybe that we're not in, although we're in most of the markets currently. So those are things that we are","[Audio Gap]","to consider going forward. With that said, we have, as you know, a pretty good footprint in terms of -- both in the South and in the West in terms of where our strategic timberland is located. And we're convinced that through growing and harvesting trees on that strategic timberland, we're going to be able to drive value for our shareholders going forward. But we're always looking to improve the overall quality of our timberland base, and I think we've had some success in doing that historically, and we'll continue to look at opportunities to do that going forward.","So as I understand it, that was our final question. As we wrap up this morning's call, I want to just remind everybody that we will be holding an investor meeting on December 9. That's going to be at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York. Our business leaders will be participating in that meeting. We're looking forward to that meeting, and we look forward to seeing each of you there.

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you.","Ms. Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Elizabeth Baum","Thank you, Ginger. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2016 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website.","Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation to GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website.","On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $227 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Our third quarter results include after tax earnings of $65 million from discontinued operations and $10 million of after tax charges for merger related expenses. Excluding these items, we earned $172 million or $0.23 per diluted share. This is an improvement of over 30% compared with second quarter and over 40% compared with a year ago.","Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $434 million, an improvement of $21 million compared with the second quarter. Our employees delivered strong performance in the quarter, as operating results improved across each of our businesses with Timberlands driving increased EBITDA through merger synergies and Wood Products achieving its highest third quarter earnings in 12 years.","However, these results reflect only some of our quarterly achievements as we also closed the sale of our liquid packaging board business, completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Seattle and completed our commitment to a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase. I'm proud of what our teams accomplished and the pace at which they continue to operate as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company.","Before turning to our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Third quarter housing activity was roughly in line with our expectations and we are anticipating nearly 1.2 million housing starts for 2016 in line with consensus estimate. Although total housing starts for September were weaker than expected, the headline number was driven by the volatile multi-family sector. Single-family starts have continued to grow at a favorable pace. Through September, single-family starts are up approximately 10% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis and low inventories of homes for sale reflect continued steady demand.","As we enter the seasonally weaker fourth quarter, we're encouraged by the strength of some timber permitting activity, new home sales and continued solid builder confidence. Although constraints such as skilled labor permit delays and fees and rising costs for land and construction maybe functioning as a governor on supply side growth, rising employment and wages and favorable mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand.","Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts three to five. Timberlands contributed $122 million to third quarter earnings and $223 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased about a $3 million compared with the second quarter. Western Timberlands contributed $109 million to third quarter EBITDA compared with a $114 million in the second quarter. Western fee harvest volumes decreased and average log realizations were largely flat.","Sales volumes to Japan improved moderately during the quarter, as low mortgage rates continued to drive strong housing activity and the effect of the delay in the consumption tax increase continue to fade. Average realizations for Japanese logs declined slightly early in the quarter, but stabilized as the quarter progressed. Sales volumes to China decreased due to timing of shipments and a slight seasonal decline in demand and average realizations decreased modestly. Log inventory to Chinese ports declined during the quarter and remain within a normalized range.","Western domestic markets remained solid during the quarter and pricing for domestic logs improved marginally, as some markets were tensioned by fire related harvest restrictions and increased mill demand. Western logging costs benefited from operational excellence initiatives during the quarter. Although we anticipated a seasonal increase in per unit logging cost due to the harvest on higher elevation stands, crews were able to mitigate this cost increase through new harvesting technology that improves productivity on steep slopes and reduces the need for the highest cost cable logging operations.","Southern Timberlands contribute a $108 million to third quarter EBITDA, $9 million more than the second quarter. Seasonally higher log sales volumes were partially offset by seasonally higher silviculture and forestry costs and a 1% decrease in average log price realizations. This decline was partially attributable to mix as third quarter harvest included a slightly higher proportion of pulp wood. Southern logging cost benefited from operational synergies with merger integration progress enabling further optimization of logging and hauling activities across the combined ownership.","Northern Timberlands' EBITDA improved $3 million compared with the second quarter. Seasonally higher volumes were partially offset by weaker realizations and seasonally higher road and forestry expense.","Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced a strategic review of our Uruguay operations. This review will enable us to ensure that we're best positioning the business for long-term success and maximizing value for our shareholders. We look forward to providing further information after the review is complete.","The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and synergies, and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million target for 2016. Internal benchmarking teams are rolling out their initial best practices that resulted from comparing a subset of high-value activities at each company. We are pleased with the progress to-date and look forward to continuing to capture the benefits later this year and into 2017.","Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, chart six and seven. Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to third quarter earnings, compared with $12 million in the second quarter. EBITDA increased by $9 million to $37 million. Real Estate EBITDA increased by $7 million. Average price per acre declined slightly as we sold a greater percentage of lower value Northern acres compared with the second quarter. Contribution to earnings increased minimally due to a proportionally higher land basis as the northern properties are legacy Plum Creek holdings that were marked up to fair value in acquisition accounting.","Our Real Estate team is making strong progress as they applied Plum Creek's asset value optimization process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. Work began first in the U.S. South and that process is entering the latter stages. As we wrap up portions of the Southern analysis, the focus will turn to the West. Work remains on track and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in the first half of 2017.","Wood Products charts eight and nine. Wood Products contributed $170 million to third quarter earnings, an increase of $14 million compared with the second quarter. These earnings are the strongest since third quarter 2004 when we operated roughly twice the number of manufacturing facilities we do today. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $203 million. EBITDA for lumber totaled to $85 million. Average realizations increased less than 1% compared with the second quarter. Operating rates and sales volumes decreased slightly due to downtime for capital projects and weather. Log cost for Canadian mills increased primarily due to weather and Western log cost were also higher.","EBIDTA for OSB increased to $63 million, an improvement of over 45% compared with the second quarter. Average sales realizations increased 7%. Operating performance was very strong and the business benefited from operational excellence initiatives to reduce spending on controllable manufacturing cost, wax and resin. Engineered Wood Products contributed $43 million to EBITDA compared with $45 million in the second quarter.","Sales volumes for Solid Section and I-Joists increased modestly and average realizations were flat as improved pricing in the West was offset by slightly lower Eastern realizations and a weaker product mix. EBITDA for distribution declined slightly to $7 million, primarily due to a seasonal shift in products mix. The business remains focused on improving margins and lowering costs.","Year-to-date, Wood Products earnings have nearly doubled compared with 2015 and operational excellence has made a meaningful contribution to that improvement. The Wood Products segment has made good progress on this year's OpEx initiatives, and remains generally on track to achieve this 2016 target.","I will now turn to discontinued operations, chart 11. Discontinued operations, which was formally our Cellulose Fibers segment, contributed $65 million to after-tax earnings in the third quarter. This includes an after-tax gain of $41 million on the sale of our liquid packaging board business, which closed on August 31 for gross proceeds of $285 million. Excluding this gain, net earnings from operations declined $14 million compared with the second quarter. Maintenance expense increased significantly and pulp production declined due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. This was partially offset by higher average sales realizations for pulp, primarily due to mix.","On October 4, we announced an agreement to sell our printing papers business to One Rock Capital Partners. This completes the strategic review of our Cellulose Fibers business announced in November, 2015. Both this transaction and the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper are on track to close in the fourth quarter. I'm proud of the contribution our Cellulose Fibers employees have made to Weyerhaeuser, and I want to thank them for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering a superior customer experience throughout the strategic review process.","I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook.","Russell Hagen","Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in chart 14 of the earnings slides.","In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly over the third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we anticipate harvest volumes will be lower than third quarter levels. However, we expect sales realizations will increase modestly in each of our export markets as housing activity remains strong in Japan and Chinese demand remains solid.","Domestic log sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. We anticipate domestic sales realizations will increase slightly in the fourth quarter, as a result of steady domestic demand and seasonally lower available log supply.","Western logging costs will continue to benefit from the results of our operational excellence initiatives. Southern harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than third quarter. Minerals have adequate log inventories entering the fourth quarter and average sales realizations are expected to be flat quarter-over-quarter. Silviculture and road spending will be seasonally lower in the South during the fourth quarter. In the North, fourth quarter harvest volumes will decrease seasonally from third quarter levels, as third quarter is typically the best operating quarter of the year.","Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, while adjusted EBITDA will be about double from third quarter results.","It is important to note that the real estate sales include a mix of legacy Weyerhaeuser properties and Plum Creek properties. And that the Plum Creek properties have proportionally higher basis, because they were marked to fair value in the purchase price allocation. This results in lower earnings when these properties are sold.","For Wood Products, we expect lower demand due to seasonal decline in building activity. Channel inventories remain lean as buyers purchase for immediate needs. We expect lumber sales realizations in the fourth quarter will be flat to slightly down compared to third quarter levels. We expect OSB prices will decrease, giving back much of the third quarter gains.","Engineered Wood Products prices are expected to be similar to the third quarter. We anticipate seasonally lower sales volumes across all product lines in the fourth quarter, and a slight increase in manufacturing costs, as a result of the holiday season, and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. Overall, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and the earnings for the Wood Products segment to be seasonally lower than the third quarter. We do however, expect adjusted EBITDA will be nearly double the fourth quarter of 2015.","Moving on, chart 10 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $5 million, $4 million higher than the second quarter. As a reminder, unallocated corporate function expense now includes about $9 million of expenses, previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers.","On October 31, our partner in the Southern diversified timberland venture redeemed our interest. Following the redemption, Weyerhaeuser now holds all of the equity interest and consolidates the timberland venture as a wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result in consolidation, the investment was eliminated and the note payable to the timberland venture has been classified as intercompany debt. At the end of the second quarter, the investment in the timberland venture was $825 million and the note payable was $830 million. These items no longer appear on our balance sheet as of September 30, for financial reporting purposes.","Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 million, an increase of $284 million from the second quarter. This is higher than our targeted cash level and we expect the balance will decrease as we pay down the term loans with proceeds from previously announced Cellulose Fiber asset sales. We expect these sales will close by year-end.","Cash from investing activities during the quarter, included $285 million from the sale of the liquid packaging board business. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $129 million, including $29 million for our discontinued operations. CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter, $150 million will be for Wood Products which typically has a highest capital spend during the fourth quarter.","Financing cash flows for the quarter included $231 million for common dividends and $11 million of preferred dividends, which represent the last dividend payment on the mandatory convertible preference shares. During the quarter, we drew an additional $300 million on our term loan. And as of September 30, we had drawn $1.7 billion of the $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.7 billion was $6.6 billion at the end of the third quarter.","Interest expense was $114 million in the third quarter. We expect interest expense will be similar in the fourth quarter. For our continuing operations, the company now anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the expected mix of 2016 earnings between the REIT and the taxable REIT subsidiary.","I'll wrap up with chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchase activities. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $306 million completing our post-merger goal of repurchasing $2 billion of our shares on an accelerated basis. Overall, under the $2 billion accelerated program, we purchased a total of 68 million shares of common stock at an average price of $29.49 per share.","On July 1, the mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares, as a result of the conversion, the company issued approximately 23 million shares. We ended the quarter with about 748 million shares outstanding.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Russell. I'll wrap up with some brief comments on merger synergies and integration. We continue to implement the changes necessary to achieve our $100 million hard dollar cost synergy target. As of the end of the third quarter, we have achieved about two-thirds of these reductions on a run rate basis. I'm highly confident, we will meet or exceed our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year one.","We've also fully identified the sources of reductions for the $35 million of costs formally allocated to Cellulose Fibers and are on track to eliminate these costs within one year of closing the International Paper transaction.","The integration with Plum Creek continues to progress well. Working together will be the foundation of our success and I'm encouraged by the team work I see within and between the businesses and functions of our merged company. I'm excited by what we've achieved and where we're going, and I look forward to continuing to share our successes with you as we work together to drive value for shareholders, through a focused portfolio, industry leading performance and disciplined capital allocation.","And now with that, I'd like to open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi.","Anthony Pettinari","Hi. Good morning.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Anthony.","Anthony Pettinari","Doyle, I had a question on the Softwood Lumber Agreement, earlier this year there seemed to be some optimism \u2013 a new agreement would be negotiated. And over the past couple of weeks we've had U.S. legislators and the Canadians issuing statements, saying the other side isn't serious. I was wondering if you were surprised by the lack of an agreement at this point and kind of where we stand here, and with the exploration of the standstill period, I guess the U.S. Lumber Coalition has talked about initiating trade cases and to the extent that you're able, I was wondering if you could give us any thoughts on that process.","Doyle Simons","Yes, Anthony as we previously said, we're very actively involved with and fully supported of the U.S. Coalition, and frankly, we would prefer the certainty of a negotiated agreement and hopeful that one will be reached. And as you mentioned, the governments are having ongoing negotiations and those are pretty fluid right now.","With that said, as we've said consistently, any agreement would need to be consistent with the objective identified in the Obama-Trudeau joint statement, which is to maintain Canadian exports at or below an agreed U.S. market share to be negotiated. So, where we are now, I think is ongoing negotiations, but if no agreement is reached, we would expect a petition will be filed soon and then, we'll see how it plays out from that point forward. So, that's kind of where we are in the approach we're taking.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just switching gears to Wood Products. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment in engineered Wood Products? I think there were some price initiatives on the table earlier this year, and in 3Q, prices seem to be flattish to maybe down a little bit. I was wondering if you could just talk about the forces that are impacting that market and kind of outlook for 4Q?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. So, there are a lot of moving pieces in the pricing for EWP currently. To get to your second part of your question, we anticipate EWP prices will be essentially flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Regarding the price increase, the price increase that went into place within the West in the second quarter and third quarter that was successful, but was offset by some pricing pressure in the East. As you know, Anthony, there's been a lot of dealer consolidation in the Eastern markets and a lot of jacking around has occurred in those markets. So, up in the West, down in the East, which has resulted in the net pricing that we saw in the third quarter, we think that's stabilized and anticipate essentially flat prices in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.","Anthony Pettinari","Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over.","Operator","Your next question is from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Maguire","Hey. Good morning, everyone.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Brian.","Brian Maguire","Just wanted to follow-up on the Wood Products, obviously a really strong quarter, like you highlighted in the prepared remarks [indiscernible] year-on-year. But it seemed like it could have been maybe even a little bit better if lumber margins had been closer to where they were in 2Q. And I know you mentioned maybe some downtime and weather-related issues. But just wondering if you could dig into that a little bit more and talk about the margins in lumber and where they might be headed from here?","Doyle Simons","Yes, so I think, there were three things that impacted our lumber results in the third quarter versus the second quarter. And as you mentioned we had a strong second quarter in lumber, but three things in the third quarter. One was we had slightly lower sales volume. Two, as you mentioned, lower operating rates that was due to weather and some downtime for installation of some capital projects as we continue to invest capital in that business to drive down our overall cost structure. And then third and the most surprising one for us that log cost increased in Canada, that was weather-related, and as you may know Canada has been very wet this year and as a result having to spend additional dollars to get wood to the mills, so that had an impact.","And then also we had higher log cost in the West, that's consistent with what we reported in our Timberlands operation. So those both higher log costs in Canada and the West impacted our margins and results in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Going forward, we would anticipate as we said, lumber prices in the fourth quarter to be essentially flat to maybe down just a little bit in fourth quarter versus third quarter.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Great. And then just a follow up one on the Real Estate segment in the fourth quarter. I know you said, you'll be about double in the EBITDA. Is that the start of maybe a trend higher here as you're getting through the process of evaluating everything, can we start to think about it being somewhere closer to that neighborhood and where you've been historically or is there just some lumpiness in it and then we're kind of back to lower levels in 2017?","Russell Hagen","Brian, this is Russell. On the Real Estate as we mentioned, we expect fourth quarter to be double the third quarter, and then we would expect that trend to continue as we work into 2017, and work through our AVO process, and really start bringing some of the Weyerhaeuser properties in through the Real Estate program. So as we've indicated, our target for the Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resource business is at 15% of total EBITDA, and so I would expect that in 2017, we will start moving towards that target.","Brian Maguire","Okay. Thanks very much.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from the George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill.","George Staphos","Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for the details. I want to...","Doyle Simons","Good morning, George.","George Staphos","How are you doing, Doyle? I wanted to dig into Wood Products a bit further. Can you comment at all \u2013 maybe provide a few more details in terms of where you stand with being \u2013 as you've termed to black at the bottom, I know we'll get more color probably in December on this, but what other initiatives do have going on or where you stand in terms of the \u2013 are you \u2013 you're certainly not a 100% done, but where you stand in terms of being done on that project?","And the related question was on operational excellence you said, as you were talking about Wood, if I heard you correctly that you're generally on track, now that's fine. But I kind of took your comments, as maybe there were some areas that weren't progressing quite as well as you'd like, if that was a correct assessment, where do you need to see some accelerated pick up? And then I had a couple of follow-ons either way.","Doyle Simons","Okay. So, George, to your point, we will be talking about both of those issues extensively in our December investor presentation, which we're looking forward to. But let me give you a sense on both of those.","In terms of black at the bottom, as you know and we've talked about consistently over the past two years to three years, that has been our focus, in terms of our operational excellence initiatives, driving down our cost, the capital that we're spending, and we've made a lot of progress on that front. As you said, we're not there yet. But I would say, we're 60% to 70% of where we need to be, maybe even a little more than that in terms of getting our cost structure where we're black at the bottom. And as we've said before, what we measure that against is what happened back during the recession in the 2007, 2008, 2009 type timeframe. So, a lot of progress made there, more work to do.","In terms of generally on track, George, I wouldn't over focused on the, generally. I would say, we are on track, in terms of our OpEx initiatives, still I guess, three months left in the year. So, didn't want get up over our sleeves, but again, we will give you a report on that in December but \u2013 and very pleased at the progress we're making in our Wood Products operation and frankly also in our Timberland operation, in terms of delivering against our OpEx targets for 2016.","George Staphos","All right. Thanks for that, Doyle. Two last ones and I'll turn it over. As we think about value return and the dividend, certainly the company has done a very, very good job of returning value to shareholders over the last couple of years, so this is not a complaint.","As we think forward for the dividend, should we more or less think about it trending with the realizations that you can get in Timberland, in terms of what drives the next level of \u2013 if there's anything left for that matter of a sustainable pickup in the dividend growth rate? And then, just Russell, on the term loan, should we expect that you will be paying that down pretty quickly from here on a going forward basis? Thanks, guys, and good luck on the quarter.","Doyle Simons","Thanks for those questions, George, and I'll address the dividend increase and then, I'll ask Russell to answer the term loan question. So, in terms of the dividend, again as we've said it consistently, we are committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. 2006 is a very noisy year, as we all know as we do these various transactions, but looking into 2017 as we think about it, we're going to benefit from our cost \u2013 continue to benefit from our cost and operational synergies, continued OpEx improvements and what we believe will be stronger housing markets.","To your point, we're also going to benefit from a portfolio perspective, from a much more stable earnings streams for Timberland. And as we just talked about improvements made in Wood Products cost structure to eliminate some of the downside. So with all that said, we'll be working very closely with our board to determine the right level of dividend going forward. And Russell, if you'll address the term loan question.","Russell Hagen","George, as I mentioned, we have $1.7 billion drawn on the term loan as we start closing on the Cellulose Fibers transactions, we'll start paying that down, so we would expect that to be paid down hopefully by year-end or soon around that time.","George Staphos","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question is from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners.","Chip Dillon","Yes. Good morning, Doyle and Russell.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Chip.","Russell Hagen","Good morning.","Chip Dillon","First question is, I might be mistaken, but I think you're earning maybe more than 100% of the cumulative profits in the engineered wood business, that's quite a turnaround. And I really seriously wanted to ask you about, with these kind of some numbers and looking at the rest of the industry and it looks like you're not necessarily transferring raw materials in low, so how are you doing it? Is it because of the distinctiveness of some of your products or would say that maybe it is being vertically integrated or maybe there is something else that we're missing?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. I would not attribute it a much of it Chip to being vertically integrated. I would attribute it to all the things that we've been working on now for two years or three years starting to fall to the bottom line in terms of log recovery, controllable spend, preventive maintenance. Chip you've heard us talk ad nauseam about, it's the basic blocking and tackling. And I think, we're starting to see the benefit of that hitting the bottom line. And the other part of it, as you mentioned is kind of the products that we bring to market and the additional value that we give for some of those products. So I think it's a combination of both, but I think really the reason for the improvement that we've seen over the last two years or three years have primarily been driven by just basic blocking and tackling in that business.","Chip Dillon","And I suppose, it's safe to say, it's no longer sort of in the category that you put it in when you had first Investor Meeting with us?","Doyle Simons","Chip, I'm happy to say that it is no longer in that category. I think that business has proven the right, to be part of our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Now you constantly got to earn that right, but that business as you highlighted, and I appreciate you saying it, has made a dramatic turnaround in terms of bottom line performance.","Chip Dillon","And then just a couple of quick ones and turning it over \u2013 before turning it over is, could you update on what you \u2013 and you might have mentioned this, what you see CapEx at this year? And I know it's early, but directionally where should it go next year? And then lastly for Russell, I know there is roughly a $600 million tax bill tied to the sale of the Cellulose business, does that tax actually get paid in cash sometime in 2017?","Russell Hagen","So the first question on CapEx, as we've indicated, we're focused on about $425 million CapEx this year, a $125 million in Timberlands and $300 million in Wood Products. I think next year we expect around that general amount maybe just a little more in Timberlands as we bring in the combined Plum Creek and Weyerhaeuser properties. As far as the tax bill on CF, we would expect that to be paid hopefully again by year-end, but possibly in the first quarter.","Chip Dillon","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Gail Glazerman from Roe Equity Research.","Gail Glazerman","Hi. Good morning.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Gail.","Gail Glazerman","I assume this is baked into your guidance. But can you talk about any impact you had from Hurricane Matthew either in terms of your operating facilities or your timber operations?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. So, yeah, we're fortunate, Gail, from the hurricane perspective that we had minimal damage to our Timberlands operations due to the hurricane a couple of days or maybe a little few more that we were kind of out of the woods in the Atlantic region, but very minimal damage. In terms of \u2013 from a Wood Products perspective, we had some production loss as you would expect at our Atlantic mills, we had some minor water damage to some finished lumber, but nothing that's [Technical Difficulty] (34:32) financially.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And going back to Softwood Lumber Agreement, can you just give a little bit of color on how it's affecting your conversations with customers, and how they may be preparing forward as they look out to the building season next year?","Doyle Simons","I mean clearly, there's some uncertainty regarding the Softwood Lumber Agreement and how it plays out, Gail. But I wouldn't say it's affecting the way our customers are thinking about their ongoing business. And, in fact, customers continue to be \u2013 especially homebuilders continue to be very optimistic about the demand that's out there in terms of new home sales and just underlying demand for new houses. So, it's a minor part of our conversation, it's not a major part, but our customers continue to be optimistic for the balance of 2016 and into 2017.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And just one last one. Can you give any sort of color on the export markets, particularly maybe some of the competitive dynamics in terms of logs from Russia, and New Zealand, or even some finished Wood Products from Europe going into Japan, just what you're seeing, and how that's been trending?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. So, let's talk about that, and bottom line is we're encouraged by what we see in the export market currently. From a Weyerhaeuser perspective, we anticipate that \u2013 from \u2013 in Japan, which as you know is our most important market, that pricing will be up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, due to steady demand and lower log supply that always happens in the fourth quarter. We think volume maybe down a little bit, but that's just going to be due to timing and the way the shipping worked.","In China, we continue to see a solid demand, anticipate higher prices in China in the fourth quarter, and encouragingly inventories actually came down a little bit in third quarter versus the second quarter. They are currently at 3.38 million cubic meters, which is down from where they ended at the second quarter. In terms of just overall views on it, we've seen a slight increase in imports into China from Russia, but nothing significant, and New Zealand seems to have kind of stabilized. So, that's what we're seeing overall in export markets.","Gail Glazerman","Okay. And in terms of European competition in Japan with finished goods?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. So, that's the challenge that our customers face is Glulam that comes in from Europe, currencies have not been helpful from that perspective. But the good news in Japan is housing is growing 6%, 7%, 8%, and our customers continue to have very good demand for our Doug Fir which is used of course to build houses. And these solid logs or solid lumber is a preferred building material post and beam construction.","Gail Glazerman","Thank you.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets.","Mark Wilde","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Mark.","Mark Wilde","Doyle, first question. It sounded from your comments like maybe the AVO process was going a little bit slower than expected. You said you expected to have it substantially done by the end of the first half of next year, I think initially we've been talking about it sort of by late this year, very early next year?","Doyle Simons","No, Mark, I wouldn't say it's slipped. Our focus has been on the South. And as I said, we are in the process of wrapping that up. Currently, we're in the latter stages of it. We'll then be moving to the West, and it may take us into the second quarter to complete it in the West. But I would actually tell you it's going very well. Our biggest opportunities as we said all along are in the South, so we're pleased that we're wrapping that up. And as Russell mentioned, I think we're going to start to really see the benefit of that in early 2017, as we move forward with this process. So, I would categorize it is right on track.","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right. That's helpful. And Doyle, can you give us a little bit more color, background on the Uruguay announcement? And then, if you were to dispose that, what you would likely do with the capital?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. So Mark, as we previously mentioned, as part of this merger integration, we've been in a review of all 13-plus million acres of our timberland. As you know, Uruguay is a project that was started back from the ground-up back in the mid-1990s and is just now really coming into maturity. Our focus going forward is going to be primarily domestic and we think there may be an opportunity to position Uruguay with what I would call a more natural sponsor that maybe more focused on those markets going forward.","In terms of what we'll do with the cash, as you would anticipate Mark, we'll run that through our capital allocation priorities as we do everything and figure out the best use of that cash to drive value for our shareholders long-term.","Mark Wilde","All Right. And Doyle just if I could, the one other kind of block of land that seems like a little bit of an outlier is these kind of Northern Timberlands in New England, and the Great Lakes, they're not plantations. It's a little different business than what you have in the South or the West, any thoughts there?","Doyle Simons","Mark, I would answer that this way and consistent with what we've said before. We're in the midst of a review of our overall timberland portfolio with 13-plus million acres that we now have, we have lots of flexibility as to how to create the most value for our shareholders, so we'll be factoring all that in, as we move forward.","Mark Wilde","Okay. Last question I had Doyle is just, back on the SLA one more time. I am just curious, from your perspective it seems to me that we're likely to have a more protectionist administration, no matter who is elected come January. And I am just curious about whether you share that view? And whether you think that's having any effect on sort of the negotiations right now? In other words, are the Canadians perhaps more interested in getting something done with this administration rather than waiting to see what they get come January?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. Mark, I would say, I don't think the election is currently having much effect on the negotiations. And in terms of predicting what in the hell may happen in this election or what the implications of that maybe is probably not somewhere that I should go or I'm qualified to go. So, we'll see how the election plays out, but we are encouraged, Mark, at this point about the negotiations that are going on between the government and we'll just have to wait and see how this plays forward?","Mark Wilde","Okay. All right. Sounds good. Good luck in the fourth quarter and into next year guys.","Doyle Simons","Thank you, Mark.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA.","Mark Connelly","Thank you. Doyle, two things. Obviously the step up in basis affects the real estate profit that you report. But it doesn't mean that the sales are any less attractive. Can you give us a sense of whether these were higher or lower than average quality sales?","Russell Hagen","Mark, this is Russell. I think on the call, as we mentioned a lot of those transactions were in the Northern properties, it's not that they weren't lower quality, it's just lower price per acre than you would see in the West or in the South.","Mark Connelly","Okay.","Doyle Simons","But Mark, you're exactly right on your first comment that \u2013 yeah that doesn't mean they're not quality sales just because they were written up. So thank you for making that point, that's exactly right.","Mark Connelly","Yeah. Russell, what I was really trying to get at is relative to what you do in the North, was this pretty typical stuff?","Doyle Simons","Yes, I think those are typical transactions that you'd see in the North.","Mark Connelly","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one simple question. How much of higher OSP prices that we saw in the quarter actually hit engineered Wood Products in the quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense of how fast that flows through.","Doyle Simons","About $2 million impact in the quarter Mark.","Mark Connelly","Perfect. That's all I need. Thank you very much.","Doyle Simons","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Collin Mings from Raymond James.","Collin Mings","Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell.","Doyle Simons","Good morning, Collin.","Collin Mings","I guess, just first one, just recognizing you're taking a pause right now, [indiscernible] Cellulose Fibers sale is being finalized. Just maybe update us on how you're thinking about the remaining $500 million under the share purchase reauthorization, again, especially here with the stock at 30 box or so, not too terribly different than kind of the average repurchase prices of $2 billion that you completed this year?","Doyle Simons","Yeah, Collin as you'll recall when we announced the merger with Plum Creek, we said at that point in time that we were going to do $2 billion of the $2.5 billion on an accelerated basis. And as you just alluded to, we completed that actually in a little less than six months. We also said at that point in time, when we announced it, that subsequent to that, we would take a pause and work closely with our board to determine the timing of the additional $500 million, see where we were on our Cellulose Fibers transaction and a lot of other factors. So we're in that pause period, we will work closely with our board to determine what the timing is going to be on the additional amount. And as you alluded to, where our stock is trading, will be an important component of that decision.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then just following up on the commentary as far as the outlook for Q4. Just on Timberlands, you indicated that it would be up modestly relatively to 3Q, but could it actually be higher year-over-year relative to 4Q 2015, or is it likely to fall somewhere in between?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. I'd have to go back and look at the 4Q 2015 numbers because as you very well know, Collin there is lots of moving parts with 4Q of 2015. We didn't have Plum Creek as part of the company. So, we'll have to get back with you on exactly that. But what I would say, as we said in the guidance, we do think it will be up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and a big driver of that, as I mentioned earlier is what we're seeing in export markets.","Collin Mings","Okay. And then, just one last one from me. Just as you're budgeting for 2017 and given kind of the lack of momentum clearly in log pricing in the U.S. South this year. I mean just curious how you're thinking about shaping up harvest activity for next year again recognizing, you're not providing guidance on harvest volumes at this point. But just how does that factor in Doyle? This is as you've referred to before just a stubbornly low log pricing in the U.S. South as you think about harvest plans?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. Well, we are working on our harvest plans right now, Collin. As we put the two companies together, we think we're going to have the opportunity to maximize the harvest plan on a go-forward basis. As part of that, we will factor in what we think is going to happen with Southern sawlog prices. We do remain convinced that we are going to reach the inflection point where Southern sawlog prices are no longer stubbornly low, but start to head in the right direction. We're encouraged by what we see, as I mentioned earlier about continued growth in housing, and are also encouraged by some of the announcements we've seen regarding additional capacity coming online in 2017 in the South. So all of that will be factored in and we'll be providing more color on that as we move forward.","Collin Mings","All right. Thanks, Doyle. See you in December.","Doyle Simons","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Steve Chercover from Davidson.","Steven Chercover","Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could recap the dissolution of the timber joint venture, if I'm not mistaken, the counterparty was The Campbell Group, and I think, you said the debt in the note will negate one another. But is there any kind of capital call? And then I had a second question.","Russell Hagen","Sure. So this is Russell. As I mentioned, we did dissolve that at the end of August. And when we did that, if you recall that was 450,000 acres in six states, it was a joint venture with The Campbell Group. They redeemed their interest and so we received the note back, distributed to Timberlands. There is a small gain in recognition at about $6 million, but there is no additional capital calls and there is no continuing ongoing obligation.","Steven Chercover","Okay. Well, that's good news. And then I thought \u2013 and hopefully this is just a red herring that the IRS was challenging the structure and there was some discussion or litigation with them?","Russell Hagen","So you're correct. So our 2008 \u2013 Plum Creek's 2008 income tax return is currently being audited. And as you recall Plum Creek, we appealed that to the IRS but we could not reach a resolution. And so recently Weyerhaeuser filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court and as you are aware this will take a number of years to resolve, but we remain confident that in our position, we do expect a favorable outcome from the U.S. Tax Court.","Steven Chercover","And I assume that Weyerhaeuser didn't put out a filing because it's not material, but can you tell us in a worst case scenario what the financial impact might be?","Russell Hagen","Yeah. We're not going to \u2013 we won't do that. But we will say, I'll reiterate, we're very confident in our position and expect we'll get a favorable outcome.","Steven Chercover","Okay. And it does failed to meet the test of materiality I assume?","Russell Hagen","We've not reserved anything related to this. Again we're very confident that we're going to succeed in this.","Steven Chercover","Great. Thanks, Russell.","Russell Hagen","You bet.","Operator","Your next question is from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research.","Mark Weintraub","Thank you. A couple of follow-ons. First, going back to the dividend, the fact that there hasn't been an increase in 2016, you mentioned a lot of moving parts and there was also the question on share repurchase and you mentioned wanting to have the Cellulose Fiber sale done as well. Should one read the fact that there hasn't been a dividend increase so far this year? Is that because the way fundamentals have played out or is that because you would want to wait to see to get the asset sales done [indiscernible] before that would even be contemplated?","Doyle Simons","Mark, as you would expect, we factor all of what you just outlined into a dividend decision will, as I mentioned, continue to work with the board to figure out what the right timing and what the right level is for a dividend increase as we move forward.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. And then in terms of the AVO process, you indicated that the Southern analysis would be done well before the Western analysis relatively soon. Will you \u2013 when that part of the analysis is done, will that be shared with the investment community or is the intent to wait until the whole analysis is concluded?","Doyle Simons","Mark, as you would expect, we will be providing a significant update on that at our December Investor Meeting. So we'll tell you where we are, how we're thinking about it and how the South is playing out and maybe even preliminary kind of how we're thinking generally about the West. So all those details are still being fleshed out, but we will be giving a significant update at our December Investor Meeting.","Mark Weintraub","Okay. Great. And then lastly, a real small one. But on the Uruguay, if you were to go forward with a sale, would that potentially be taxable or would that not be a taxable event?","Russell Hagen","So, the Uruguay assets \u2013 this is Russell, the Uruguay assets are held in the combination of in the REIT and the TRS, and so, we would have some minor tax leakage. We really haven't gone into that point yet, but we would expect probably some tax leakage because of the TRS held that assets.","Mark Weintraub","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Doyle Simons","Thank you Mark.","Operator","Your next question is from Paul Quinn, from RBC Capital Markets.","Paul Quinn","Yeah. Thanks very much and good morning.","Doyle Simons","Morning, Paul.","Paul Quinn","Just a question on Wood Products. It looks like you did a very good job on the OSB segment a little bit \u2013 I don't know a little bit off versus our numbers on the lumber side. It looks like costs were up, I think you cited weather and capital projects maybe you could just outline what the capital projects you had in the quarter and how much of that was an effect on lumber cost?","Doyle Simons","Yeah. So as we mentioned lumber was off basically for three reasons. One was this lightly lower sales volume, second one as you just alluded to was lower operating rates due to weather and downtime for installation of capital projects and then the third and the largest to try to quantify this, which I think is where you're headed, Paul was the log cost increase primarily in Canada, but also in the West as we mentioned earlier.","So, the downtime for installation of capital projects went for any one big project as you know we are spending roughly $300 million a year in capital in our Wood Products operations. Some of that's maintenance capital, but some of it's also capital that we're putting in to drive down our overall cost structure and we just had a couple of those projects that hit in the third quarter and there will be more of those in the fourth quarter.","Paul Quinn","Okay. And then I just had a question on Softwood Lumber, just trying to understand Weyerhaeuser's position on this. Without knowing quota levels or any kind of levels of taxation under CVD or AD duties, from a theoretical standpoint, what's better for Weyerhaeuser, a quota or a combined duty?","Doyle Simons","Well, I would say, ultimately a quota is the best for all parties involved because it's simpler, it establishes what the levels is, there's a certain level of certainty. So what we would like to end up with Paul, as we have said along is an agreement rather than having to go through the legal system and having a quota in place, very simple quota in place that sets forth the amount of imports from Canada into the U.S.","Paul Quinn","Well, thanks. That's all I had. Best of luck.","Doyle Simons","Thank you. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks?","Doyle Simons","Yes. Let me make a couple of closing remarks. As I've already alluded to, I just wanted to remind everybody that we will be holding our Investor Day on December 13, at the New York Palace Hotel. We look forward to that, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. And I would just conclude by thanking everybody for joining us this morning, and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. At this time, you may now disconnect."]}}
