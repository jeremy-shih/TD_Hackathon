[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the meeting over to Mr. Rob Sison, Vice President of Investor Relations. Go ahead, you may begin.","Rob Sison","Thank you. Welcome to EA's Fiscal 2013 Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today are John Riccitiello, our CEO; Blake Jorgensen, CFO; and Frank Gibeau, President of Labels. Peter Moore, our COO, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call and a transcript.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of October 30, 2012, and disclaims any duty to update them.","Throughout this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable measures for certain non-GAAP measures to be discussed are: for Q2, net revenue of $711 million; digital revenue of $320 million -- $324 million; gross margin of 37.4%; operating expenses of $630 million; and resulting loss per share of $1.21.","During this call, unless otherwise stated, the financial metrics will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now I'll turn the call over to John Riccitiello. John?","John S. Riccitiello","Good afternoon. And for those calling in or listening in from the East Coast, we hope you and your families are safe.","EA delivered a very strong performance in the second quarter of fiscal '13. Our non-GAAP revenue was $1.08 billion in the quarter, higher than a year ago despite a significant headwind from the declining packaged goods channel. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance, making this our 11th straight quarter of meeting or beating guidance. And I'm proud to say that we are tracking towards another sharp increase in EPS in fiscal '13.","Our performance in Q2 was led by very strong sales of our EA SPORTS titles, Madden NFL 13 and FIFA Soccer 13, consistent strength on smartphones and tablets and the breakaway success of our iOS game, The Simpsons: Tapped Out. Medal of Honor Warfighter shipped last week and the highly anticipated Need for Speed Most Wanted launched today in North America. While we are very pleased with the demand indicators on Need for Speed, the Metal of Honor launch is coming in below our expectations. Blake and Frank will provide more detail on these.","We also continue to see overall choppiness in the sector. Digital games and services are surging, mobile is scaling nicely and free-to-play is bringing in millions of new consumers. The growth in social network gaming has slowed and console packaged goods are declining, which is typical for console games this late in the cycle.","Despite the volatility and headwinds, EA is performing well. We've focused our title count and managed costs. We have diversified our platform partners and business model so that EA is less vulnerable to weakness in a single channel, platform or business model. We got more big franchises than any other publisher, and in most of these, we're performing very well.","We are managing the ups and downs. Our Q1 and Q2 were better than expected. Our Q3 appears soft due mostly to Medal of Honor. We're expecting a strong finish in Q4, driven by a powerful slate of titles. Taken together, we are updating our fiscal '13 non-GAAP EPS guidance to a range of $1 to $1.15, down $0.05 from our original guidance, which reflects the weakness in Q3 associated with Medal of Honor. At the midpoint, our guidance is to deliver over 25% non-GAAP EPS growth and to beat the current street EPS estimate for our fiscal year.","Next, I want to highlight our progress on 3 key strategies. By now, you will recognize these strategies as our mantra: brands, platform and talent. Our focus on brands centers on constantly improving the quality of our key franchises. We make fewer titles, but we make them bigger by making them better. We transformed the revenue model by adding digital content and services, which extends the relationship with consumers. This strategy is working for EA, and here is one key highlight to prove the point. Since we adopted the fewer, bigger, better brand approach in 2007, EA has delivered the 5 biggest revenue hits in our company's entire history.","Our platform strategy is about taking our brands into new fast-growing digital channels and also building our own platform technology to facilitate growth from these platforms and on our own Origin service. We are building bridges to the next generation of games and technology. This strategy is delivering for us, and here's a proof point: inclusive of our successes on Battlefield 3 Premium, EA is currently tied for first in digital revenue among western gaming companies. Over the past 5 years, we have consistently grown our digital revenues, averaging annual growth of nearly 40%.","Our third strategic initiative is talent. We are evolving our core capabilities to better address both the art and science of gaming. In addition to having the best creative talent in our studios, we are adding new DNA to build our engineering and analytic capabilities. We are building this capability to support network and platform technologies that will define the most profitable companies in years to come.","To summarize, the game sector is in a volatile period of change and transition, awaiting new catalysts for even more rapid growth. EA is executing well in this environment and investing for strong growth in leadership in what comes next. Since the San Francisco Giants won the World Series, I'll use a baseball analogy. EA doesn't win every inning, but we put a lot of runs on the scoreboard, and we expect to finish the season at the top of the standings and to continue to do so for years to come.","With that, I'll turn it over to our new CFO, Blake Jorgensen.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Thanks, John. Before I discuss the quarter, I'd like to make a few comments and observations about EA after my first 8 weeks on the job. First, I'm very excited to join this great company. The management team and all the people I've met are true leaders in the industry and extremely dedicated to developing and delivering world-class entertainment to consumers around the world. I'm fully aligned with the strategy of the company and believe we need to continue our journey of focus on those products and activities that generate the greatest shareholder returns.","I joined EA because the company is now in the middle of an exciting transformation to a truly digital business that will allow us to grow and improve our profitability over time. My focus at EA will be to help lead the company in improving our operating margins, increasing the return on capital and generating greater key -- greater free cash flow for investors.","In conversations with investors and analysts, I'll be direct and transparent, providing the information required to follow our business. I'll help people understand the changes in the financial results as we move further into the digital business, and I'll provide key metrics and guidance when they are appropriate for understanding our performance in future outlook. But I will stop providing metrics if they no longer provide useful information on our business performance. I look forward to working with each of you. And now let me turn to our business and quarterly performance.","First, let me start with a brief review of the gaming sector for the quarter. We estimate that the worldwide video game sector grew in the high single-digit percentages. We are encouraged the digital market continues to grow more than 20% over the prior year as the packaged goods market slows.","In addition, the mobile business continues to expand, while the social network game -- gaming growth has slowed recently. For EA, both FIFA Soccer 13 and Madden NFL 13 debuted as the top 2 best-selling titles for the western world in the month of September, and NHL 13 made the top 10 list.","Additionally, we saw solid catalog performances from Battlefield 3 and the FIFA Soccer 12, as well as continued growth in our mobile business. Our Q2 non-GAAP net revenue was $1.08 billion, which was in line with our revenue guidance and 4% higher than the same period last year, driven by our FIFA, Madden and NHL titles.","EA's Q2 non-GAAP digital net revenue increased 45% year-over-year to $314 million, and for the trailing 12 months, exceeded $1.4 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 59%. For the quarter, each digital revenue channel demonstrated more than 30% growth versus the prior year. For example, extra content and free-to-play were up 34%, led by Battlefield 3, SimCity Social and Mass Effect 3. Full game downloads were up 46% with continued strong demand for Battlefield 3. Mobile business alone was approximately $88 million, up 60% over the prior year. Smartphone and tablet revenue accounted for $66 million of this quarter's revenue, growing at more than 120% year-over-year.","The primary drivers include FIFA World Class Soccer in Japan and Bejeweled Blitz on a worldwide basis. The Simpsons: Tapped Out launched in mid-August and has led top-grossing applications in the Apple App Store for most of the month of October. Frank will provide more color on this business later.","Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue grew 48%, driven by Star Wars: The Old Republic and other key properties. As mentioned on the last call, a free-to-play option for the Star Wars game will be available this quarter, and we will provide more insight regarding the results of this change in future calls.","Also, the non-GAAP revenue continues to exclude our Battlefield 3 Premium subscription service. $43 million of Battlefield 3 Premium sales were generated in the September quarter, bringing the total premium revenue from this year to approximately $80 million. As a reminder, we will recognize these sales as revenue in the fourth quarter when we release the fifth expansion pack entitled End Game.","A quick update on Origin. We now have over 30 million registered users, including 13 million mobile gamers to date, and revenue was up sharply year-over-year off a small base. Additionally, we have signed agreements with over 70 independent developers to publish their games on our platform, along with our own vast catalog of titles and new launches.","Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin was up 1% over prior year's results, driven by the growth of our digital business. Operating expenses for the quarter came in at $20 million lower than expectations due to the phasing of marketing expenses out of the quarter, slower-than-anticipated hiring and our focus on improving operating efficiencies. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.15 for the quarter, $0.05 above the midpoint of our guidance and market consensus.","Now turning to cash. Our cash, short-term investments and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $1.3 billion or approximately $4.21 a share. Roughly half that cash is held outside of the U.S. Net cash used in operating activities for the quarter was $28 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $490 million, an increase of $183 million over Q1.","During Q2, EA repurchased 8.4 million shares at a cost of $108 million. As a reminder, the $500 million share repurchase program was initiated in August, and we continue to actively repurchase shares under this program.","In summary, for Q2, we delivered revenue in line with our guidance, and regarding non-GAAP EPS, we were able to over-deliver through favorable product mix, the management of our marketing and operating expenses.","Now turning to guidance. GAAP revenue for the third quarter is expected to be between $900 million and $1 billion as compared to $1 billion -- $1.06 billion in the prior year. GAAP EPS for the third quarter is expected to be a loss between $0.71 a share and $0.57 a share as compared to a loss of $0.62 per share in the prior year.","Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion, a decline in comparison from last year's $1.65 billion, which included the launch of Battlefield 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Both titles drove packaged goods and full game digital download revenue. Frank will provide an update on our third quarter titles in his section.","Regarding our operating expenses, we expect our total non-GAAP operating expenses to be less than $600 million for the quarter, with marketing and sales down versus prior year due to fewer titles. For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $0.50 and $0.60 a share as compared to $0.99 a share last year. This reflects weaker-than-expected performance from Medal of Honor Warfighter and our decision to cancel our NBA title.","For fiscal full year '13, GAAP revenue for the full year is expected to be between $3.85 billion and $4 billion, and GAAP EPS is expected to be a loss between $0.27 a share and $0.06 a share. Non-GAAP revenue for the fiscal year is now expected to be between $4.05 billion and $4.2 billion. Operating expenses are still expected to be approximately $2.2 billion while we continue to focus on cost management and efficiencies. We've lowered our non-GAAP EPS estimate to be between $1 and $1.15 a share. The $0.05 adjustment is coming out of the third quarter based on the guidance that I just provided. It is an offset -- it is offset by a benefit from a reduced share count due to our share repurchase program.","Cash flow for fiscal '13. We reconfirm our operating cash flow and capital expense projections of at least $400 million and $100 million, respectively. This implies an expected free cash flow generation of over $300 million or 3x what we generated in fiscal '12.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Frank.","Frank D. Gibeau","Thanks. Now that Blake has briefed you on our financial performance, I'm going to provide some context around our ongoing success with core products. I want to show that despite a couple of misses, we've got a great track record rolling out big hits.","I'll start by providing some color around the outstanding performance of our EA SPORTS portfolio: Madden, NHL and FIFA are all meeting or significantly exceeding expectations. Madden NFL 13 just executed the biggest launch in 4 years. At the heart of this success is another big leap in product quality: a new gameplay engine that includes a huge physics upgrade and innovative online services such as Connected Career mode and Gridiron Club. These breakthrough improvements were noticed by critics who awarded Madden 13 an 86 at launch, our biggest year-over-year Metacritic jump in 4 years.","NHL 13 has stunned critics and fans with its graphics and year-over-year innovations. The 84 on Metacritic has helped offset the headwinds related to a strike-impacted season. In September, we released FIFA 13, EA's biggest game of the year with more than 7.4 million units sold in the first 4 weeks. FIFA 13 launched with a 90 Metacritic and quickly became the #1 seller in more than 40 countries.","FIFA Ultimate Team, a feature which allows fans to connect, to manage teams and trade players, is now one of the most popular online services in gaming worldwide. Today, more than 2.5 million people are actively engaged in FIFA Ultimate Team, up 34% year-over-year. Now consider 7 years into a console cycle, Madden and FIFA are tracking to their best performances ever.","Another breakout hit in the fiscal quarter was The Simpsons: Tapped Out, a free-to-play mobile title which launched in August and was the #1 grossing game on iOS for most of the last 4 weeks. The game has registered roughly 17 million downloads and is generating meaningful revenue in more than 40 countries, including the U.K., Germany and France. This serves as another demonstration that mobile is rapidly scaling and that EA leads with sustained share growth.","Now onto our expectations for Q3. I'll start with 2 franchises that have not met our expectations. The first is NBA live, which we elected to cancel this year. I'll address this in the context of our success on FIFA and Madden, where a spectacular core product sets us up for big opportunities with online services. This year's NBA Live did not meet that test. We take this situation seriously. EA SPORTS is committed to basketball, and we will publish a basketball game when we can match the quality of franchises like Madden NFL, NHL Hockey, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR and FIFA Soccer.","Next, Medal of Honor Warfighter shipped last week to a critical reception that fell below our expectations. While we're disappointed with the critical response, we believe this is a good game with a receptive audience. The game finished the weekend in the #1 position in the U.K. We will continue to support the game through the holidays with sales execution and marketing. This includes a compelling content download tied to the December release of Sony Pictures' film, Zero Dark Thirty.","While we're not pleased with the situation on either of these titles, we are confident in the hit potential of the games that will follow. Our highly anticipated racing game, Need for Speed Most Wanted, debuts this week, and the early reviews are strong. 2 of the most respected critical outlets, IGN and Game Informer, gave Need for Speed a 9 out of 10. And in the U.K., the Guardian awarded the game a perfect score. This spectacular open-world racing experience is enhanced by Autolog 2.0, an innovative social component which assembled an online community to advance players through the game. Edge Magazine said that Autolog is one of the most ambitious innovations in console gaming this generation. It's too early to celebrate, but Need for Speed Most Wanted launched today in North America with pre-orders well ahead of last year's game.","Finally, 2 more positives in Q3. First, Battlefield 3 is still charting in the top 10, a full 12 months after it launched. The game has now sold-in more than 17 million copies. And in 5 months, our Battlefield 3 Premium service already has more than 2.1 million active subscribers. A steady stream of online content and services have extended the life cycle of this blockbuster and created a large and persistent ecosystem of fans who pour over every new download of the game. We keep them supplied with digital content and they keep playing. A new expansion pack Battlefield Aftermath, will be available for download this quarter, and another, Battlefield End game, is scheduled for Q4.","Second, I want to direct your attention to the release of Real Racing 3 in December. This was the only game on stage when Apple unveiled the iPhone 5. We believe they chose Real Racing 3because the visuals are, quite frankly, incredibly close to what you see on current gen consoles. The EA FireMonkey studio that made this game has demonstrated an incredible mastery of the iOS format. If you want to understand why everyone is raving about mobile games, check out Real Racing 3 when it releases in December.","That's our portfolio through Q3, and we're planning a big finish in Q4, which has historically been a strong quarter for EA. Here's a snapshot of the 3 titles we think will be big hits. In February 5, Dead Space 3 is coming to Xbox 360, PS3 and the PC. Each time our Visceral Studio releases a new game in this critically acclaimed sci-fi horror series, the game gets scarier and the audience gets bigger. In North America, presales for Dead Space 3 are up 28% over the same period before our last release on this franchise.","In February, we will debut Crysis 3 coming to the Xbox 360, PS3 and PC. Helped by our partners at Crytek, this one follows Crysis 2, which was widely considered to be the best-looking console shooter of this generation. We believe Crysis 3 will set the bar even higher. Crysis 3 has cultivated a large audience in both Europe and North America and won several awards at E3 and Gamescom this year. This game has a lot of potential to be breakaway hit, and we're going to give it a blockbuster marketing campaign.","And finally, SimCity, one of EA's flagship franchises, will launch on the PC and Mac on March 5. Consumer awareness is tracking ahead of our expectations for this breathtakingly cool new experience. We're really proud of this one and it shows. SimCity won scores of prestigious awards this summer, including Game Informers Best of Show at E3 and the Best PC Game Award at Gamescom in Europe. We can't wait to release this one in March.","Now back to John.","John S. Riccitiello","Thank you, Frank. If you've been following our quarterly calls for the past few years, you'll note a certain consistency to our narrative. We promise to build our biggest brands and we have. We promise to drive our business to new digital revenue models, both on third-party platforms and on our own. We have. We have talked about investing in and transforming our talent base. We have.","Delivering on these strategies, combined with aggressive cost control, has allowed us to deliver double-digit EPS growth these past 3 years, and we are on track to do it again this year in fiscal '13. We're consistent in delivering on our strategy and goals, and we are very serious about driving shareholder value.","With that, Blake, Frank, Peter and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird & Co.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First, John, if we look out over the next 12 to 18 months, we may see new living room game platforms from Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft and potentially, even Apple. So I'm curious how EA is planning on distributing resources across each of these opportunities, and if there's any update to some of the financial framework you've provided before, and perhaps some of the progress to date on next-gen software development. And then secondly, just realizing that the Halo and Call of Duty have moved back in terms of monetization of digital, away from a premium or subscription model at least from the prior versions of games last year. Does that change at all your approach to the way you plan to charge for add-on content for future Battlefield titles?","John S. Riccitiello","I think we'll split this one up. I'll let Frank handle the second part and I'll take the first. So we signaled on our last call, we've investing some time in what we understand to be the future framework of, if you will, of opportunity. I would have to refer you directly to the companies you mentioned, Apple, Microsoft or Sony as to the particulars of their launch plans. But having said that, we've announced our investment, we believe we're going to get strong return on investment, and we are long-term believers in the opportunity of gaming in the living room with ever stronger devices driving that business. Now I guess in a word, we're not ready to make any announcements about next year. I would make these last observations. We're entering what is clearly the -- towards the tail end of a very long cycle. We've reached the bottom of our title count. We expect to increase slightly from here. And we see a lot of opportunity for the growth of our big franchises like Battlefield, FIFA, The Sims, SimCity, Madden, Need for Speed, Mass Effect, Dragon Age and others. We think it's an unparalleled portfolio, and we're putting the investment behind it to turn it into the biggest most profitable business in our sector.","Frank D. Gibeau","This is Frank, I'll give you some color on the Battlefield Premium subscription service. The feedback that we have received since we launched that 5 months ago has been extremely positive because at its core is a great value for consumers. The opportunity to buy basically 5 expansion packs for the price of 4 with all of the additional services and components is seen by subscribers as a very good value for money, and in fact, our growth rate on that subscription is well ahead of our expectations and we're very pleased with it. We also operate the Ultimate Team style of monetization online, which is more micro-transaction-based, and that's mainly focused on our sports business. But we're seeing good success on both of those console online services and don't see any reason to modify them going forward.","Operator","Our next question comes from Edward Williams of BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a quick question, if I could, on Medal of Honor and on NBA Live. What, in your opinion, really is kind of what drove the relative performance there? And how is it that you think you can kind of prevent that from occurring again?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes. This is Frank, I'll take those. We take product quality very seriously at Electronic Arts, and it's kind of lifeblood of what we do. And when we look at launches like Medal of Honor and NBA, we're not happy with the results there in terms of how they've been received, in the case of Medal of Honor, by the critics and reviewers, and in the case of NBA, it just didn't meet our standards of quality in order to go out and compete in basketball at a level that we felt was necessary and important for EA SPORTS. So in the case of basketball, we're committed to basketball, and we're going to be entering that category in the future, and it's going to be done in a way that we deliver a high-quality product. On Medal of Honor, we're disappointed with the critical reception. Our internal testing and mock reviews indicated that the game is better than the actual score that we have right now, and we believe that it is. However, we are seeing some folks out there that just don't like the game. We believe that it's going to find an audience. It's been -- had a good track record over the weekend in the U.K. We're going to continue to support the game going forward with marketing and additional content. And I think when you look at those 2 products and you take a step back and you look at the broader portfolio that Electronic Arts has been building, overall, we've got a quality record that's pretty remarkable inside the industry. I think no other studio has improved quality as dramatically as Electronic Arts over the last several years. And if you look at our recent track record, we've released the most popular FIFA game ever. We vastly improved Madden in terms of its quality. Battlefield 3 is a top 10 game and is past 17 million units. And today, we had a really good result with Need for Speed Most Wanted in terms of its release in the early critical reception. So we take quality very seriously. We're in a hit-driven business. And we don't reach our own high internal expectations, trust me, we're going to school on what happened and what occurred, and we're going to do better going forward.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","So your thought at this point with regards to Need for Speed is that as far as the initial channel sale, that's been in line with your expectations and has not necessarily been affected by the Medal of Honor release?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes. Repeat that, Ed, I'm sorry?","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","With regards to Need for Speed, the release of the game and the initial expectations in the channel sale, that has not been affected by the Medal of Honor performance?","Peter Robert Moore","Not at all. I was just glancing the Metacritic right there, we're an 86 of about an hour ago. In fact, we've getting better reviewed than Assassin's Creed as it currently stands on the Metacritic point of view. Our retailers have had early glimpse of Need for Speed. Our sell-in is strong. Our demand metrics are definite. Purchase intent, for example, is strong and our pre-orders as was mentioned on the prepared remarks are the highest we've ever seen for the Need for Speed franchise. So all of the data indicates a very strong start. And this, of course, as you know too well, is a title with a very long tail that will sell well. So no issues whatsoever. I don't think retailers link game performances from franchise to franchise. They place their orders accordingly based on their pre-orders and what they think their consumers are going to pick up.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then just the last question is, you have -- you built up about 30 million registered users for Origin based on your comments. Can you give us an idea as to how many of them you're actually able to monetize at this point?","Peter Robert Moore","As of the latest data I looked up this morning, about 4.4 million people have actually purchased on Origin. And our average sale on Origin, actually, is about $64, so people are buying multiple games. The breakup of that 30 million is, I think, mostly interesting is we're now seeing as many as 13 million who are accessing Origin via their mobile devices. So with the 70-plus developers that are now putting content on the platform with our own content itself and Medal of Honor debuted this week, obviously, our ability to be able to continue to drive strong commercial engagement, as well as community engagement is going to be key. And the metrics all point towards that being a very strong part of our business.","John S. Riccitiello","Yes. And over the next couple of years, you should watch Origin carefully. It's a big part of our strategic drive. You'll see a lot of interesting things coming there. We think it represents a huge opportunity for us.","Operator","The next question comes from Neil Doshi of Citigroup.","Neil A. Doshi - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","A quick question on the social gaming side. I Facebook noted on their earnings call that gaming, ex Zynga, was up 40%, and on your earnings call, you also noted that there was a little bit of slowdown on the social gaming side. Is this more of a structural issue regarding gaming on Facebook? Or are you seeing -- or is there some sort of execution issues with producing games for the Facebook platform? And then I have a follow-up as well.","John S. Riccitiello","Well, first off, I think it's always a little bit dangerous to try to answer the outcome of the game right in the middle of the event. So it's a little too early to call the social gaming business. But I think some pretty clear observations. One is when it was anticipated by some, the double, double and double again, 1 to 1.5 years ago, we were quite comfortable that it would double and that we'd start growing with the market. We never got to the second and the third double. So we were never quite as positive on it as some, although we are believers in it. Currently, it hasn't declined in the sector, but it is showing slow growth. The most recent quarter was up versus a year ago but down sequentially, but that down sequentially is probably more seasonal than anything. That's at the aggregate level. But my personal view is that Facebook has moved away from some of the game-based viral channels, and consequently has done a purposeful thing for the health of their own platform to diminish, if you will, the way a lesser game could spam people to death and generate revenue. So my second observation is that core games are doing better on that platform than some of the lighter things that are more traditionally defining the Facebook platform. I think a better way to think of it is this though. People are accessing Facebook games on either a mobile device or a PC. Think of them as mobile games and PC games, not so much as Facebook games. Assess it. What makes for a great mobile game will continue to be great. What makes for a great PC game will continue to be great. And there's a lot of opportunity with EA. We're growing rapidly on the PC side and rapidly on the mobile side, and we will continue to have entries on the Facebook side. We have reduced our SKU plans some there, but we continue to have a belief that it's an important part of our mix. I hope that gets added for you. Because the headlines are explode versus the hype, but it's certainly not dead. And we think if it is part of a mobile mix and part of a PC mix, and we continue to create entries. We have just announced yesterday, for example, a strong tie between our NHL franchise and Facebook, so it continues to be very useful and positive for us.","Neil A. Doshi - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And on the digital revenue side, you've had very strong digital revenue, which is great. However, I guess on the gross margin side, we've seen margins kind of tick up modestly. Can you remind us what the margin profile as of your different digital revenue line items, and at what point do you think we'll start to see gross margins expand, I guess, more in line with the digital revenue growth?","Blake J. Jorgensen","I can take that. It's Blake here. We don't disclose the differences between our margins, but what we have said, I think, in the past is that digital business does allow us clearly to operate in higher gross margins. We'll continue to see that growth over time, and we're very focused on it as a way of driving profitability and really reaching a much higher operating margin target in the long run. I can't give you a good sense of timing yet because the business is growing so rapidly. It's difficult to predict, but we're very focused on trying to drive profitability through improvement in gross margin, and you're seeing that as you compare our business over the last couple of years.","John S. Riccitiello","And on the last call, we got this -- a very similar question -- or maybe it was 2 ago, we\u2019ve seen better than a 12 point pickup on our gross margins over the last 4 years, and we attributed it then to really 2 factors. About half of it coming from exiting the distribution business, the old Rock Band business, the old -- we'd take a game in market, uptick for distributions stage. And the other half of it is due to mix towards digital. So we've seen a big pickup at the consequence of digital, and we expect to continue that. It's something that's been a key feature of our financial performance for the last 4 years.","Blake J. Jorgensen","And just remember when we talk about digital, we're talking about components of digital such as mobile, free-to-play and others. And so each of those have different gross margin perspectives. But in general, most of those will give us a gross margin pickup as we move forward.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","John, I think you suggested sharp increases in EPS going forward. Can you please help us characterize the primary drivers of this trend? Also, mobile revenue is up 60% year-over-year. Would you give us a sense for the key drivers of mobile growth? And finally, it looks like you're taking down full year guidance by about $50 million on revenue, $0.05 on earnings, despite the beat. Can you give us a sense for the drivers? Is it Warfighter's softness? Any color would be great.","John S. Riccitiello","So in terms of our expectations for the future, we've been showing sharp double-digit profit growth really since we restructured 4 years ago. And even at the midpoint of our guidance now, we're showing 25% growth. We're doing it in a year when we're lapping Battlefield. So if you think about that, that's a pretty stunning reality. There's a composition shift in our P&L towards higher-margin businesses is the primary driver there. Because it's clear, right now, we're not seeing a lot of top line revenue growth in this tail end of console GEN 3 cycle. The second point that I would say to you is, we're pretty strong believers in revenue growth going forward. We think we've reached sort of an end of an era. We are reaching a tipping point relative to digital, and we've intimated, in many ways as we can, without getting ahead of ourselves that we are believers and it's worth investing in next-generation technology, some of which are invisible to all of you on the call. When you take top line growth together with the superior margin structure we've built around the advancing digital end of our business, we see the opportunity for continued margin expansion. But that's about as far as I'm going to get towards guiding you to years beyond this one. That's the framework. It's consistent with what I've said at E3 and other public speaking events. But we're not here on this call ready to talk about sort of fiscal '14, or fiscal '14 through '16 framing. We'll begin to do that over the course of the next few calls.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Why don't I try to hit on the next 2 parts of the question? One is the digital question, and then the second is the guidance question. So digital, just hitting on some of the points that we made in the prepared remarks. Keys to digital growth have been across a wide variety of options for us or opportunities for us. Extra content and free-to-play have been a big driver. Battlefield is a great example of that, SimCity Social as well. Free game downloads, up 46% when you look at Battlefield 3. The mobile business, up dramatically, up 60%, driven primarily by the new smartphone formats and tablets. For those who haven't tried The Simpsons game, I think it's critical to go out and give it a go. It's been one of the top grossing apps on the App Store and it's just a fabulous game. But Bejeweled Blitz, for example, one of the PopCap Games we acquired, is doing extremely well. And then FIFA, on the mobile business, smartphone business has been great, particularly as people are playing Ultimate Team. So that, plus a subscription business, continues to really drive the overall digital revenue. And as a reminder, we haven't booked any of the Battlefield 3 Premium sales, already north of $80 million this year, and will all get recognized at the tail end of the year. On guidance, I'd say it's a combination of conservatism and impact from Medal of Honor. Our guidance though as a reminder also is still above the street in most cases. Our revenue guidance came down $50 million at the top end and the bottom end of the range and is right on top of the street guidance, and then at the earnings level, we came down $0.05, but are still above where street guidance is. We're confident in that because of the back half of the year portfolio that Frank spoke to you about, as well as the improvements in gross margin and our ability to hold OpEx and that yields the guidance, but we think that's realistic relative to the disappointment in Medal of Honor.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Great. Actually, my second question was more focused on mobile versus total digital, but it sounds like it was really Simpsons that was the key driver.","Blake J. Jorgensen","FIFA, Simpsons and Bejeweled, all 3 were big drivers.","John S. Riccitiello","And also Sims performed well on mobile for us as well. One thing to remember about mobile is, a few years ago, EA was pretty much a feature phone player, and we've completely transformed to putting leading microtransactions or free-to-play titles that monetize very well on smartphones. At this point, our focus has been iOS, and we've got a lot more coming. We feel very, very confident in that business.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Two questions for you. First, it looks like your guidance for Q4 obviously is very back-end loaded. I'm getting $0.70 to $0.75 versus $0.17 last year. Can you talk about the impact of Battlefield earnings-wise in Q4 and why you're confident that you can grow earnings with catalog for the industry being down so much? And then, John, maybe talk about just where we are in the cycle as you see all the hardware coming. I mean, is there a chance that packaged goods starts growing next year as an industry? Or can you give us any thoughts on -- with the new consoles coming, how you think about next year?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Justin, why don't I take the first part? The Q4, the reality is our differences between where we were originally guiding on Q4 versus where we're currently guiding aren't that different. We're up slightly versus our previous guidance, and that's really built on the strength of the fourth quarter titles, as well as just the continued strength in catalog. I don't think we're being overly optimistic. We've had a strong catalog business and it continues to perform really well, it tends to perform well in the back half of the year. Q3 is really where the big difference came, and we -- I did mention before, but realize that FIFA 13 did extremely well in Q2. We're assuming that, that may be pulling some of Q3's business and that, in combination with the NBA business and the Medal of Honor business, is really what's brought Q3 down. We haven't really moved much from Q3 to Q4. It basically stays the same because really, Q3 is where the big delta is.","John S. Riccitiello","And just 2 quick thoughts on Q4 and give you a little color. Q4 has essentially been rising with the increased performance of Battlefield. So we keep selling subscriptions well ahead of our initial expectations. 100% of the revenue drops into Q4, and it's 100% fully-owned IP with a very high margin. The second component is the only other thing that's comparable in our business with the Battlefield subscription business in terms of margin impact, it is in fact better it\u2019s selling SimCity. It's a PC-based wholly-owned IP with a huge global audience. So there's a lot of owned IP in the quarter and it's very strong IP. And Justin, I would give you points for trying very hard to get one more pint of blood out of us relative to understanding what next-gen looks like. Once again, we're going to have to tell you that color on next-gen needs to come from the people producing it, and color on our own fiscal '14 and beyond, beyond what I've stated, is going to have to wait for a future call.","Operator","The next question comes from Sean McGowan of Needham.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","I was hoping you could give us a little update on where things stand with Star Wars: The Old Republic, the changes that you've made to the business model and how that's working, or anything you can give us on that. And then remind us on the Battlefield Premium. You've given us some great color on the revenue that's coming. What costs might have been deferred on that or might show up in Q4 against that revenue?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, this is Frank, I'll start with the Star Wars question. As we announced in our last call, we are pivoting that business to open up a new free-to-play part of that business model. That starts this November. And so I think it's a little premature to be able to give you too much color on how that's going to go until we deploy it. In Blake's remarks, he mentioned that we'll have an update on a future call and give you guys some more information on how the free-to-play conversion went on Star Wars. So\u2026","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","How's the existing business going?","Frank D. Gibeau","It's vibrant and positive in Star Wars. The game is continuing to release content. People continue to be subscribing to the product. So for that part of the business, the premium subscription side of the business is very stable, and we're excited about the potential and the free-to-play option.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the people hanging out, those that already signed up or are kind of staying?","Frank D. Gibeau","Like I said, we feel good about stability in the community and people are excited about the new content, actually, we've been releasing. So yes.","Blake J. Jorgensen","And on your Battlefield question, we expense all of the costs associated with developing the extra content when it's developed, so that's been expensed in each quarter. So it's really the revenue that's getting recognized after all the packages have been delivered to the consumer.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","And there's no deferral of marketing costs?","Blake J. Jorgensen","No.","John S. Riccitiello","Think of Battlefield as a 4-quarter business in a way where all the costs or most of all the costs are in the first 3 quarters, and all of the revenues in the fourth.","Blake J. Jorgensen","You might have ongoing marketing costs that are associated with signing up new people, but for -- and those are relatively small because it's building off of the franchise. But for costs that are incurred in any of the quarter, the larger cost components are really the development, and all those have been in each of the quarters in which they occur.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Got it. I just didn't know if there was some accounting principle that tried to match costs to revenue and you put it off. But you've answers the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Creutz of Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, a couple of short ones. I think your last SimCity major release was SimCity 4 back into 2003. And I wonder if you can just remind us how many units you sold of that? Second question is, I think it looks like you're guiding to about $1 billion in digital revenue in the back half of the year. And I was just wondering how you're anticipating that phasing between fiscal Q3 and fiscal Q4?","Blake J. Jorgensen","So on the revenue piece, we'll continue -- we won't split out a lot of detail on the forecast going forward. But you should consider the similar percentages in Q3 and Q4 that we've talked about before and the trends that we've continued to see and growth off of that level. So if you're looking at roughly $300-plus million in Q2 actuals going forward, you'll continue to see growth in those in Q3 and Q4. On the SimCity, we're just looking for the data right now, and I don't have it off the top of my head.","John S. Riccitiello","We don't we always carry it when it's a 7-year-old factor. It was in the low to mid-single millions units, but we'll look that up and get back to you, Doug. And just another factor on digital, just remember, the majority of Battlefield Premium is a digital revenue sale for us, again. So another observation to keep in mind there, it's lumpy relative to digital revenue in the fourth quarter because of the recognition of Battlefield Premium.","Operator","Our next question comes from Atul Bagga of Lazard Capital.","Atul Bagga - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And I have 2 questions. Number one, on the digital title slate, I think in the last quarter call, you had highlighted you have 41 titles for in this slate -- for this year's pipeline. And in this earnings call, I think you were highlighting 31 titles. Can you talk about, are these 10 titles getting pushed out of fiscal '14 or these are getting canceled? Any color on this will be great. And second on the Battlefield, given the strong engagement that you're seeing with the users, strong catalog sales, would you ever consider making Battlefield as your annual franchise?","Peter Robert Moore","Atul, it's Peter. I can give you a little bit of color without too much detail, unfortunately, on the change from 41 to 31. It's a combination of pushing some stuff out into the next fiscal year, killing a few things that we didn't think were relevant in the marketplace today and a strong pivot towards mobile from social, in some instances, that would obviously push them back a quarter or 2. So no real changes other than those to the lineup, and obviously, we're getting completely focused on the mobile business as well, but taking care, as John mentioned earlier, of making sure that we deliver on major brands and social.","John S. Riccitiello","To be clear, the lion's share of that, and Peter's being careful, the stated plan, we\u2019ve reduced our SKU count against Facebook social and [indiscernible] . So that's the primary issue. Frankly, the combination of factors in terms of revenue outcomes for titles from us and others in that arena and the cost required is not proven to be a great equation. You can make a block, but you can't make enough to feel great about the investments, so we have re-prioritized and taken some time.","Frank D. Gibeau","And I'll take the question on Battlefield, this is Frank. We're committed to -- we're focused on building the next Battlefield experience right now, and our goal is to make a high-quality experience that grows the business. If we do that on an annual basis, that's not something that we've announced or are openly discussing at this point. We're really just focused on the next Battlefield.","Atul Bagga - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Makes sense. And if I can have one more follow-up. You guys talked about NBA cancellation, some underperformance of Medal of Honor and you're taking down your revenue guidance by about $50 million. Can you talk what other puts and takes? Is it mostly the strength of FIFA? What are the things going on in the guidance? You talked about what's going down, but what's going up there?","John S. Riccitiello","Broadly, the over performance, we've talked about already, and I'll just bring you up to speed. We talked a lot about FIFA being positive. We've talked pretty sharp positive in the form of Battlefield and Battlefield Premium. We've talked about -- look, frankly, Need for Speed, relative to our initial expectations, looks very strong. Madden, with a solid entry this year and mobile across-the-board. So those are generally our upside scenarios. We've got what we think -- look, when you start the fiscal year, you don't know your fourth quarter title in terms of the exact quality that they're finishing at. Right now, what I've seen at Dead Space, what we've seen at Crysis, what we've seen on SimCity could do nothing other than bolster our confidence and the ability of those titles to deliver. We feel good about our numbers. But you're right, we've had -- I mean, the principal downside this year were Medal of Honor, NBA and frankly earlier, Star Wars has underperformed. But that's really the balanced equation.","Operator","Our last question will come from James Hardiman of Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Just to piggyback a little bit on the back-weighted guidance for the fourth quarter. Obviously, at any given point in time, your guidance is dependent on the releases that you have, obviously, given all the releases that are scheduled for the fourth quarter, maybe a little bit more risk. Can you go through some of the major titles that you have coming out in the fourth quarter and just talk about the risk that those releases could get pushed back? Are the major console titles pretty much etched in stone? Or is there some risks associated with some of these PopCap Games for the fourth quarter?","Frank D. Gibeau","This is Frank, I'll try and give some additional color. If you go back to my remarks, I called out 3 key blockbusters for us in Q4 with SimCity, Crysis and Dead Space 3, all proven brands with great development teams working on those products, so we feel very good about the trajectory on those 3 games. And those are the primary drivers in the HD console PC business that we have. In mobile, continuing to see strong growth in there. Obviously, the smartphones are going to be very popular items at Christmas this year. We see that expansion in the installed base continuing to drive not only our new releases as exemplified by Real Racing 3, but also our catalog titles in future releases and updates for PopCap. As you might know, we've converted most of our, if not all, of our mobile business to a premium business model, so these are much more reflective of ongoing services that we are constantly updating. In the case of Simpsons, we did a little Treehouse of Horrors update around Halloween that drove tremendous growth inside the revenue inside that business. We're going to -- we're committed and going to continue to release timely updates of content inside the mobile business and is going to feel very much like an online service going forward. So I hope that gives you a little bit more color. And then of course, the Battlefield subscription premium. We still have 2 more releases of Battlefield content inside that subscription with Aftermath and End Game. That digital business continues to grow, and we're seeing continued and strong performance in FIFA Ultimate Team, which has gotten longer and longer legs over the years, where we see very high peaks in terms of our online community participation and revenue generation in Q4 and FIFA as the season in the Premier League, as an example, really heats up and we're continuing with releasing content. So it's a combination of proven brands that are related to new releases, as well as online services continuing to be updated and grown, coupled with, as Blake mentioned, a strong catalog business. Electronic Arts has a very diverse and deep catalog that always performs well for us at Christmas and in Q4.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Very helpful. And just a quick follow-up, gross margin guidance has really remained unchanged over the course of the year despite top line guidance coming down a bit. What's going on there? Does that say anything about the revenues that are being lost that were relatively low-margin revenues? Any way is it a function of better mix from Battlefield? How should I think about your ability to maintain that gross margin number?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, I mean, I think as we mentioned, we're fairly confident in our ability to continue to drive gross margins. And clearly, as you're looking at guidance, you should view the gross margin guidance we've given in the past as definitely good and we'll probably exceed that. And that's being driven by the shift towards more digital business and a portfolio effect of higher fully-owned IP, particularly in the back half of the year where you get much higher gross margin in the fourth quarter based on the titles that Frank just talk about. So all that leaves us with fairly good confidence around the direction for gross margin, both in the near term, as well as longer term for the business.","John S. Riccitiello","All right. Well, thanks, everyone for joining us on the call. For those of you on the East Coast, stay safe, and we'll talk to you again in a quarter.

Amazingly creative games combined with services like Ultimate Team, our Battlefield network, multi-platform experiences and subscription programs like EA Access are the future of this industry. With every player that joins our games, every game session, and every engagement in our live services, we are adding strength to EA's Player Network.","In FY 2018, we'll deliver more thrilling experiences that broaden the reach of our major franchises and drive deeper engagement through more ways to play. Our EA SPORTS portfolio continues to have the biggest player community in sports games, and this year we'll add new experiences to grow that audience. Madden NFL 18 is set to be the most innovative Madden title in more than a decade, using the full Frostbite stack to deliver new modes that bring the sport to life in unprecedented ways. FIFA 18 will expand on The Journey and Ultimate Team, and we'll connect to more soccer fans with FIFA as our first title on Nintendo Switch. With new NHL, NBA LIVE and UFC console games, as well as more live events and content for our growing EA SPORTS player base on mobile, our multi-platform EA SPORTS portfolio is set to reach more fans around the world in FY 2018.","We're also incredibly excited to bring Star Wars Battlefront II to the massive Star Wars community later this year. This game is made possible by the collaboration of three incredibly talented studios \u2013 DICE, Motive and Criterion \u2013 bringing together their individual strengths and building on the feedback from our passionate fans. Star Wars Battlefront II will have more than three times the content of the previous game at launch, with a brand new story, a new single-player campaign, new modes, characters, vehicles and planets from all eras in the Star Wars universe, as well as a live service plan that will continue to add even more fun for the global community. Our Star Wars Battlefront II debut trailer has generated more than 16 million views across YouTube and other social platforms, and we'll have much more to share about this game in the weeks and months to come.","This will be a year of pioneering and creativity across many of EA's top franchises. Every Battlefield 1 player will have more ways to play throughout the year, with continual game updates, new maps, and three more expansion packs adding new armies, regions and battlegrounds available to the whole community. We're just getting started with our live service plans for this massive game, and later this year, we'll introduce new ways for players to get an even bigger Battlefield 1 experience. Two of our other genre-leading franchises will also see new titles this year. The industry's biggest multi-platform racing franchise, Need for Speed, returns to console and PC with a brand-new title that will give racers vast customization and more freedom to race wherever they want. And on mobile, our Sims franchise has been a genre leader since launch, and this year we're going to deliver a brand new, deeply social experience for this wide-reaching global community.","Competitive gaming and esports will be a key growth factor for us throughout FY 2018 as we expand the ways that fans can play and watch. Year two of our FIFA and Madden NFL championships will kick off this fall, featuring millions of competitive games through Ultimate Team, deeper partnerships with leagues and teams that add new dimensions to the tournaments, and new venues for our major global championships. Later this year, we'll launch our first Battlefield 1 competition, unlocking the competitive spirit that runs deep in our Battlefield community. We're also continuing to expand our broadcast reach and content portfolio for our growing spectator audience. There is global excitement for our competitions, and this year we'll broadcast our tournaments and add additional programming through more major network partnerships including ESPN, BT Sport, Univision and more.","Looking forward, we will continue our aggressive pace of innovation through experiences that capitalize on our technology, network and creativity. We are very pleased with the progress of our new action IP from BioWare. The design is stunning, gameplay mechanics are excellent, and the action will be exhilarating. This game is built around a live service, and through our creative process, we've decided to add more to the disruptive new social designs for our players. To accommodate that, we are moving the launch date for this project into Fiscal Year 2019.","Through FY 2019 and beyond, our portfolio will continue to grow. There'll be more new experiences for our Battlefield fans. Our Star Wars action-adventure IP from Visceral will make its debut, and farther out, we'll have a new Star Wars title from our partners at Respawn. We continue to invest deeply in new IP, including the new game from BioWare and another project from our Motive Studio. With Frostbite powering more of our EA SPORTS games, we'll continue to break barriers and lead sports across all platforms. And on mobile, we have titles from more of our major IP in development.","Electronic Arts is leading the industry with some of the most creative, sophisticated and engaging entertainment available anywhere in the world. Yet we are building towards a far more powerful and connected future. As engagement and consumption patterns across platforms and business models continue to evolve, we are investing in our network to keep players connected to each other and the games they love. Our focus on esports continue to draw more players and spectators to the excitement of competition in our games. Our subscription services like EA Access are providing more fun and tremendous value. And with the unification of our engine and our platform, as well as major advancements in deep learning, AI and social layers, we are unlocking new ways to connect players and personalize their experiences at scale. This is the future of play that we see at Electronic Arts, and that we are ready to lead.","Now I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew. I'll start by reporting our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net sales to discuss the dynamics of our business.","At the beginning of fiscal 2017, at our Investor Day, we outlined to you the long-term trajectory of our business. We said we would invest in our player network, advance our live services, grow our digital revenue and deliver a more profitable and stable business than ever before. I'm delighted to say we're delivering on all of those commitments, and we are making the right investments to continue along this trajectory.","Net revenue for the year was $4.8 billion, cost of revenue $1.3 billion, and operating income of $1.2 billion. Most importantly, these results enabled us to deliver record operating cash flow of almost $1.4 billion. We also returned over half a billion dollars to shareholders through our repurchase program in fiscal 2017.","Total net sales for the year were $4.9 billion, a record. Digital net sales accounted for 61% of this, up 6 percentage points year on year. Extra content was a record $1.3 billion, with Ultimate Team contributing $832 million.","Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter: GAAP net revenue was $1.5 billion, compared to $1.3 billion a year ago. Cost of revenue was $202 million, down from $226 million last year, a significant improvement on our guidance of $242 million.","Operating expenses were $608 million, $17 million above our expectation, driven by an advance write-off of a licensing agreement. This resulted in an earnings per share of $1.81. As Chris mentioned, to compare this year's results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please see the new tabs in the downloadable model.","Net cash provided by operating activities was $407 million. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year was $1.38 billion, the highest in company history and 13% greater than last year's. Fiscal year 2017 capital expenditures were $123 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.26 billion. Please see our earnings slides for further cash flow information. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.53 billion, with 37% of this balance held onshore.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million shares at a cost of $125 million. Subsequent to quarter end, we completed the $1 billion, two-year buyback program we began in May 2015 with an additional $30.8 million of repurchases. Average cost per share over the two years of the program was $72.66. Looking forward, we announced today a new $1.2 billion, two-year stock repurchase program.","Now, turning to net sales to discuss our business drivers for the quarter: Net sales were $1.09 billion, above our guidance of $1.075 billion, and 18% higher than last year. This excludes $53 million of net sales related to premium editions of Mass Effect Andromeda that we had originally expected to be captured in Q4. They will now be captured in Q1.","Digital delivered $885 million of the $1.09 billion in net sales, up from $712 million last year. This growth is driven by the ongoing digital transition, as more players choose digital purchases over physical, as well as by our ongoing success with event-driven live services such as FIFA Ultimate Team.","Diving into digital net sales: Extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $405 million, up 31% over the prior year. The key element remains Ultimate Team, which grew 23% year-on-year, or 29% at constant currency. Expansion Packs for The Sims 4 also made a strong contribution. Our ability to engage players through live services and events continue to drive strong growth and deliver dependable on-going sales.","Our mobile business delivered $175 million in net sales, flat year on year. Key mobile games driving the sales in the quarter were Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, FIFA Online 3 Mobile, NBA LIVE Mobile and FIFA Mobile. The growth in these games was offset by a slowdown in some of our legacy titles. We're doubling down on live services and events across the mobile portfolio, and the strategy is paying off. For example, FIFA Mobile just had its best-ever month since launch in October.","Full-game downloads added $192 million in net sales for the quarter, up 43% year on year. For fiscal 2017, for the current generation of consoles, full-game downloads accounted for 33% of unit sales to consumers, considerably ahead of the 29% we had forecast and 9 percentage points up year on year. The chief driver was the continuing evolution of consumer behavior, but some of the outperformance was driven by the shift from Star Wars Battlefront to Battlefield 1, as well as the digital performance of our catalog. As a result, we continue to believe the underlying trend is closer to 5 percentage points per year.","Finally, subscription, advertising and other digital net sales totaled $113 million, up 19% over the same period last year. EA Access and Origin Access continue to grow strongly.","In conclusion for Q4, we were able to exceed our expectations for revenue, earnings and cash flow, demonstrating the power of multiple live services revenue streams.","Now, turning to our expectations for fiscal 2018: we expect sales of current generation consoles to continue to be strong, with the installed base growing to 105 million consoles by the end of calendar 2017, up from 79 million the prior year. We expect PC gaming to decline slightly, and the mobile market to grow in the high teens in calendar 2017.","Guidance for fiscal 2018 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.1 billion, cost of revenue of $1.3 billion (18:24-18:55) in our statement of cash flow. They do not impact our total cash and cash flow, but they do increase our operating cash flow and decrease our cash flow from financing activities. For fiscal 2017, applying the new rules would increase reported operating cash flow by $195 million and decrease financing cash flow by the same amount. A table presenting the impact is included in our earnings release.","For fiscal 2018, applying the new rules, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.6 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures to be around $120 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.5 billion.","Turning to business drivers, we anticipate net sales for the year to be $5.1 billion, up 3% year on year. This is driven by growth in Ultimate Team, mobile and Star Wars Battlefront II. It is offset by the success of Battlefield 1 last year and by FX. The stronger dollar represents a headwind of around $110 million to fiscal year end net sales. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website.","Segmenting the sales provides further insight into key drivers of our full-year net sales guidance: Net sales of packaged goods and other is forecasted to be approximately $1.7 billion, down 10% year on year, driven by the shift to digital. Digital net sales are expected to contribute $3.4 billion, up 11% year on year. Breaking down digital sales further: Our mobile business is expected to grow between 5% and 10%, led by the new Sims experience and continued growth from FIFA Mobile, NBA LIVE Mobile and Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes.","Net sales from full-game downloads are expected to grow 10% to 15%, driven by the underlying change in consumer behavior, offset by the fact that Star Wars Battlefront may skew slightly less digital (21:00-21:31) services are in a given franchise. In fiscal 2018, we expect to see net sales of live services to grow between 10% to 15%, led by Ultimate Team and Battlefield 1.","As Andrew mentioned, we have made the decision to move our new BioWare action title out of fiscal 2018 and into fiscal 2019. We're very excited about this opportunity for a new franchise and we want to further develop the live service component.","Focusing on Q1: we're expecting GAAP net revenue of $1.425 billion, GAAP cost of revenue of $157 million and GAAP EPS of $1.93. We expect Q1 net sales to be $750 million, up 10% year on year, driven by Mass Effect Andromeda, Battlefield 1 and Ultimate Team.","At the beginning of our year, at our Investor Day, we shared our long-term vision for the company. It provided context and framework for a very specific set of near-term goals we gave you in our annual guidance. Our fiscal 2017 performance demonstrated how our vision generates excellent financial results and supports growing our cash return to investors. But we are only just beginning to leverage the potential of our player network and event-driven live services. As we continue to do so, we will build a deeper player base and engagement, grow digital revenue and deliver a more profitable and stable business.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Blake. We are at a powerful point in EA's journey. The investments we've made in our IP, our technology platform, and our live service strategy uniquely position EA to lead in a networked world that spans more players, platforms, and geographies than ever before.","At our core, we are a creative company. We are game makers that love to capture the imagination and make extraordinary entertainment possible for our players. We're also unique in that we have a unified, world-class technology platform and engine that provide the backbone of our network. Our studio teams are leveraging more sophisticated data and insights, secure and scalable infrastructure, and new game (23:41-24:10) and streaming in the future.","With every experience, we are working to bring our players even closer. Constant community input is part of our creative process today: from developer feedback sessions and continual dialogue with community influencers, to the gameplay data that helps us tune and optimize, to community test environments where we can share our latest innovations. Putting our games into the hands of our players \u2013 like we will at EA PLAY in Hollywood in June \u2013 helps to keep us moving, evolving, and constantly pushing for more breakthroughs. We're continually engaging, expanding and strengthening our network by keeping players at the center of everything we do at Electronic Arts.","As we deliver more groundbreaking experiences, and deepen the engagement of our global player base, the EA Player Network is how we create greater value through a connected world of play. Every day, the global community of gaming is expanding \u2013 through more devices, more games, and more ways to play. Our EA Player Network will enable players to navigate, to find their friends and engage in more of the experiences that matter to them most. Through persistent experiences and user interfaces like our Battlefield network, to playing and viewing esports competitions, to discovery of new content that adds to the fun, the EA Player Network is already helping to deliver a more personal and connected gaming world for our players, and we're just getting started. We're looking forward to another year of growth and leadership for Electronic Arts.","Now Blake and I are here for your questions.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Operator, if we could open for questions now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We'll pause for just a brief moment while we compile the Q&A roster. Our first question is from the line of Justin Post of Bank of America.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Blake, in your guidance you talk about gross margins, looks like being up. Can you talk about the Star Wars impact there? And then maybe also how the other digital content is kind of helping the margins in the year. So kind of frame those two inputs this year into the gross margin outlook. Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. Sure, Justin. Before I do that I wanted to make just a quick announcement about our IR team. Carolyn, who almost all of you, I think, have met or know, has been with us for three years and is moving to our corporate FP&A team, which is a great move for her, and we thank Carolyn for an amazing three years of support to all of the investors and sell-side analysts. We have a new person joining the team, Erin. You'll get a chance to meet her in the coming months and we look forward to having her on our team. But thanks to Carolyn.","So to your question, Justin, first, if you look back to the difference between the year before the first Star Wars, fiscal 2015 and then fiscal 2016, you saw a fairly muted growth in gross margin, up about 50 basis points roughly. We expect a similar effect this year because of the impact of the royalty on a very large title as we saw last time. And the comparison was, remember this year a pretty tough comp because our gross margin was actually higher than we had originally anticipated because we sold more Battlefield than we anticipated and less Titanfall than we anticipated. Titanfall obviously has a royalty to Respawn and we expected that, but we got a little bit more bump in gross margin","We will see gross improvement as we continue to grow the live service part of our business, Ultimate Team and other similar live services on top of existing games. But for now we're only expecting a little less than 100 basis points or around 50 basis points because of that, primarily of that impact on Star Wars Battlefront II.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question, operator.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. The first one, Blake, can you just talk a little bit about your view on esports and kind of your esports strategy? There's some people regarding going \u2013 and how do you think about monetizing esports the next couple of years? And then secondly, can you just talk a little bit about your expectations and guidance for FIFA Ultimate Team off of the pretty tough comps and the great performance from last year? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Sure. I'll let Andrew address the broader esports strategy. I think the thing to remember is it's built around Ultimate Team for our core sports games and we'll most likely build it around in a similar style live service for non-sports games in the future. But I'll let Andrew talk little bit about that. I'll come back on the Ultimate Team question.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. We're very excited about our esports strategy and what we're doing, and what we saw this year in both FIFA and Madden were significantly higher engagement and monetization inside of Ultimate Team for those competing in esports tournaments.","And again, this isn't just about the big championship tournaments. We run a whole series of events at a grassroots level all the way up to the elite level of tournaments. And so we think about this in a similar way that we think about all sports, which is we want to make stars of all of our players, the novice player as well as the professional player.","And while there will almost certainly be solid revenue generation from broadcast rights, from sponsorship, from advertising, from players and teams and the monetization of those things, the lion share of the revenue will always be the digital transactions that exist in the ecosystem. We see that in leading esports tournaments and leading esports games already.","And what we have seen in FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden Ultimate Team over the past 12 months confirms what our original strategy was, which was we will drive those other things. We will benefit from those other things. The lion share of return will come from the ongoing engagement and live service component that is things like Ultimate Team. And you should expect as we launch other esports games that they will also revolve around a very robust and rich digital ecosystem similar to Ultimate Team.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And in terms of guidance relative to Ultimate Team, the thing to remember that was \u2013 two major drivers in FIFA this year were, first, the addition of a story mode in the game. The Journey brought new people into the game and brought those people from the game into Ultimate Team. So it grew the overall base of people playing in Ultimate Team.","The second is the addition of the competitive gaming mode inside of FIFA which, as Andrew mentioned, drove massive engagement around tournaments and around practicing for tournaments.","Both of those styles of change we're going to try to adapt into Madden in one way or another, and you'll see more of that coming in the coming months. But you can assume we've learned a lot of great lessons from FIFA. We'll try to drive Madden Ultimate Team and Madden Competitive Gaming off of similar modes.","But FIFA doesn't sit still. It continues to find new ways to engage people in new modes and new excitement, and as Andrew said, we'll be evolving The Journey in FIFA, which will continue to bring new people into the game, we believe. That's the core.","Now our guidance doesn't anticipate anywhere near the level of growth that we actually achieved this year. We tend to do that each year with FIFA because while it's very predictable based around events, we've continued to surprise ourselves on the upside. So you should trust that it's a rational number in terms of our guidance, but there is growth in there.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","So, Andrew, I think the decision to add The Journey to FIFA was based on user feedback, and that seems to be yielding dividends. So what kind of user feedback have you gathered from the first iteration of Battlefront that you will be looking to add to Battlefront II.","And, Blake, will you give us a sense of what percent of your mobile bookings are growing with the new games? And what percent of your bookings are from the legacy games that are now in decline? So wondering when we'll mathematically see a change in the growth trajectory as the mix changes. Thanks","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. So, thank you. As you know, Battlefront I was a great game, and widely regarded as the best way to fulfill your Star Wars fantasies. Frostbite really brought the Star Wars universe to life, but there were some things that a number of players asked for. A single player campaign was probably the number one thing that players asked for, and you heard that we'll be doing that. And I'm very excited by what we're seeing there.","The Motive Studios who is a collection of developers who have a tremendous track record in building action-adventure and single player campaigns is putting that together. They wanted things like space battles and more vehicles and more heroes and more eras and more planets, and what you heard from us is that it will have all of those things.","We took the feedback very, very seriously. We've invested in a very meaningful way, and when we say we believe the game is three times the size in terms of content, we're very serious about that. And our expectation is that the large, engaged passionate fan base of Star Wars fans around the world are going to love everything that we're doing.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","In terms of mobile, our net sales for the year were up 10% year-on-year. We're not happy with that. We think we can continue to grow that more, but I remind people that we didn't bring out NBA mobile and FIFA mobile until the back half of the year in October, essentially, and we've continued to learn and tune those games around the world. So we should continue to see more growth out of those.","We've had some amazing performers like the Simpsons: Tapped Out or Real Racing or Sims FreePlay that are in year four or year five of their lives and the fact that they're still going is pretty impressive relative to many mobile games. But we will see a natural decline in some of those as we add less content and move to players to new, more exciting games or new versions of those games.","And so, I don't know when you're going to see a more dramatic growth level. We've guided to around 5% to 10% of growth for the year, but we certainly are focused on trying to drive the new Sims title, as Andrew mentioned, as well as the sports titles because we feel that those are fabulous formula that we've been able to develop and leverage, both on the console and PC world as well as now in the mobile world.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Tim O'shea with Jefferies.","Timothy Larkin O'shea - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Just a few more on Star Wars Battlefront II. So the first installment sold around 13 million units in its launch window. Obviously, a very number. Is this the right framework to use as we think about how to model Battlefront II?","And then, there's been a bit of confusion on how you intend to support the game post-launch and I just was hoping you might clarify what we should expect in terms of season pass or DLC. And then, just broadly speaking at a higher level, how is the anticipation for that game shaping up? What's the feedback you're seeing around the announcement of the single-player campaign and the trailer? Thank you.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So again, in terms of, we'll start from the back. The fan anticipation has been very, very strong; 16 million organic views. That's not us paying the viewers. That is fans seeking out the content. I would say the feedback has been almost entirely positive. The inclusion of a single-player campaign, the inclusion of a new heroine in Iden, space battles, new content, new heroes, new world, new planets. I think the feedback of that is very, very strong.","As we think about the live services, nothing \u2013 I'm not talking in great deal about it now other than, the game is going to be three times the size of the original game at launch and we also have a very, very robust live services plan that we're going to talk about in the coming weeks and months, particularly around EA PLAY and E3 in just a few weeks' time.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes. And I think on the unit forecast, we sold 14 million units of Battlefront I in the year it was shipped and built into our guidance as essentially the same number. Our aspirations are clearly to sell more. We think this will appeal to not just the broad Star Wars fan base, but also to the deep, heavily-engaged Battlefield fan base and Battlefront fan base. And we see that as a critical part of the success of this game going forward and as Andrew mentioned, we've got the depth and the breadth in the games that will help that.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question's from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two on mobile. I wanted to know if we could tease-out a little bit about where you saw strength in mobile versus some of the legacy titles that might have been a drag on mobile just so we can tease-out some of the headwinds and tailwinds in the Mobile business. And then second, any sense of marketing and how it's being impacted in terms of trying to drive mobile engagement? Is there any change there, or you're actually leaning in against some of the key titles on the mobile engagement front? Thanks, guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, Eric. The core product portfolio that's been there for four or five years like the Simpsons I mentioned, have actually shrunk. Games like Sims FreePlay have stayed fairly consistent but not grown dramatically. And then things like FIFA, NBA, and particularly Galaxy of Heroes have grown dramatically. And so, I think what you'll see as we layer in games like the new Sims game and the sports games continue to grow, you'll continue to see that hopefully offset any of the shrinkage in the older portfolio. Those numbers for the older portfolio are starting to get fairly small and stable, and so I don't think you'll see a lot of headwind from that.","In terms of marketing. We're continuing a very ROI-driven marketing approach that's got a lot of discipline around it. We have a whole team led by our Chief Marketing Officer that focuses not just on our console and PC marketing, but very much on the mobile marketing. And they're driving decisions almost daily as to how to support the products. That's the beauty of the business is, when something's working well you can tune up the daily marketing. When it's not, you can tune it down. I would say, though, that we remain very focused on leveraging known IP that we own or license to try to offset some of the costs of marketing and has allowed us to run our mobile business at a level of profitability we believe higher than most, as well as, driven by the fact we're spending less on ROI-driven marketing.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I wonder if you guys could comment on your experience with Battlefield 1 DLC. What the conversion rate was in the March quarter and what your expectations are for fiscal 2018? I believe you guys had four maps launching this fiscal period. And then second question is more a clarification. Your commentary on full-game downloads being 9% last year, but moving back to 5%, is that a number for the company or something you expect the industry to trend at? And if it's not for you, where would you expect it to be given the Star Wars versus Battlefield dynamic? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. So thanks, Drew. The first question on Battlefield 1. We're not going to disclose attach rates because they're becoming less and less meaningful, particularly in a world of live services. And you'll see some changes to our approach, particularly with Battlefield and Battlefront over time that makes those DLC less important because it's ongoing content that's being delivered. I will say, you'll also see a lot of content delivered to the broad community for Battlefield, not just for the DLC owners going forward, which I think will continue to make those numbers a little less meaningful.","We're very pleased with the engagement levels on Battlefield, as well as the ongoing sales of Battlefield 1, and we think that will continue on. And I guess what I would say is, based on having seen some of the DLCs, I would never refer to them as a map. We've got a lot of exciting stuff coming and a lot of interesting things about World War I that have yet to be even seen.","In terms of full-game downloads. The number surprised us because we had thought that it'd be around the 5% year-over-year growth. Some of that may simply be the consumer is shifting faster than we know or we expected. The trends can sometimes jump in dramatic ways and maybe we're starting to see that overall shift. And some of it could be product-related. We do think the industry will end calendar year 2017 probably above 40%. We will most likely lag that as we have historically because FIFA is such a large product and it is so global that we are operating in markets where either the ability to purchase digitally, or the ability to download based on bandwidth speeds, are compromised and thus we tend to skew a little lower on FIFA than we do on the rest of our portfolio. So we've always lagged the industry slightly, but we are excited about the potential that you're seeing the consumer possibly shift quicker to digital than we'd originally anticipated.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question's from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer & Company.","Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Hey. Thanks for taking my question. I've just got two quick ones. Around Battlefield 1, it seems like the excitement around the game is a little bit better than you expected. Has that changed your view on the intensity or the strategy around extra content for this fiscal year? And then, could we see more in the following fiscal year to support Battlefield 1?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I would say it hasn't really changed our overall approach for this fiscal year. You may see some things you didn't actually anticipate as it evolves, but the general strategy is still based around quarterly or monthly DLCs that we put out. I do think you'll start to see that evolve next year as we get into more competitive gaming and it will clearly evolve, as Andrew mentioned, around Battlefront II property that we start to evolve the services associated with DLC to make them more live service, event-driven style gameplay versus purely an additional piece of content.","Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","On that particular comment, if I may, are you kind of leaning towards kind of (44:10-44:18)","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","You cut out.","Operator","","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Doris, why don't go onto the next question? We'll come back to Andrew.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Doug Creutz with Cowen & Co.","Doug Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. I think your revenue-deferred adjusted gross margin this quarter was a bit over 81%, which is I think more than 400 basis points higher than your previous high in any quarter you've reported. Obviously, you had a big digital mix this quarter. But there's been other quarters in the last couple of years where you've had similar digital mix, and the gross margins have been in the mid-70%. So wondered if you could talk about \u2013 was there anything special in this quarter that drove the gross margin so high? Mix of business, or anything like that? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes. I think primarily the biggest driver I would say is the mix, lower royalty-bearing titles this year versus last year \u2013 Battlefield catalog, for example, versus Battlefront catalog last year.","There was also \u2013 the one thing to remember is our technology team, led by Ken Moss, has done an amazing job making our back office ability to deliver digital much more efficient. We don't talk about it a lot, but it's become a continued help in our gross margin as we expand. And we'll continue to drive that. That's lower cost storage, lower cost delivery, more efficient network and platform that we've built it on. It's all pretty powerful, and that continues to help us as well.","And then obviously continued digital, as we said, is also a major driver in the business which has helped us in the quarter.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Doris, next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from the line of San Phan with Mizuho.","San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi. It's San. Two questions on my end. How far along are you in building and staffing out Motive Studio in Canada? And how should we think about that impact to the trajectory in R&D expenses over the next two years? And then secondly, can we just get your current thoughts on what areas are most interesting to you in the industry in regards to potential M&A?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So I'm sorry, San. I didn't catch the first part of your first question. Can you repeat the question?","San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Oh. Sure. It's just how far along are you in building out and staffing out the Motive Studio in Canada? And basically, what's the impact to the trajectory in R&D?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. It's a good question. Thanks. We're well along the way. We've hired close to 100 people for that studio \u2013 some of the most fabulous talent I've met in many, many years. It's very exciting for us to assemble a brand new team. We're finalizing our new office space there, which will have both Motive people as well as the BioWare Montr\u00e9al team in that same office.","We still have some hiring to go, but I think for now it'll be at a more gradual pace over the next couple of years as we move probably from, say, 100 to 150 or so as we go forward, so. But it's been exciting to be able to build such a great new team.","And in terms of the second piece on M&A, I think there are few large companies out there, and most of the companies are small. Many of the companies we've looked at we've passed on because the valuations have been so high, but we're continuing to keep our eyes and ears open, particularly for things that could add to either games that don't have live services and we can layer live services into them or games that could leverage our network and our scale that we don't have. And those will be big themes for us, but unfortunately, it's not a long list of companies that are out there of scale that we can go after.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question is the line of Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey. Good afternoon. Couple quick ones here. Despite moving out an entire title, guidance is quite solid on a tough comp, and then your digital guidance is up nicely, even with Star Wars, which last time was a bit of a drag on digital. So would you say that the biggest component of the favorable overall guide and digital guide is mostly the result of strength of Battlefield 1 live services? Or would you attribute it to something else?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I would probably attribute it to live services in general, so not just Battlefield, but the overall portfolio, both mobile and non-mobile where we're trying to layer more live services and are seeing success. We're seeing obviously \u2013 we have expectations for growth across the sports portfolio, both in HD and in mobile. We do have a new UFC game, I think as everyone knows, next spring and we have the Need for Speed game coming in.","So all of those add to the growth in the year, despite the fact that we have a tough comp to try to beat between Battlefield, Titanfall and the strength of FIFA this past year. So we see it as kind of growth across the whole portfolio versus dominated by one product or one new product. And we do have the new Sims game that Andrew mentioned that's coming out during the year on mobile. We don't know exactly what time of year that will come out, so we don't have a giant expectation in the guidance, but that's clearly in there as well.","Operator","Our next question's from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Just two for me as well. Curious if you could give us a deeper perspective, I guess on what's happening within BioWare. Mass Effect I think from a quality perspective didn't exactly hit the mark and it looks like we've now delayed the anticipated new IP which sometimes is also tied to quality. So curious if there's any change in leadership or developer turnover. What sort of cap internally within BioWare?","And then second question's PopCap. It looks like you have some layoffs in that studio. Obviously, that studio has good IP, used to, as well as [talent]. I'm sort of curious how you see the future of PopCap. And also with tinkering with head count on the overall firm or any trends there we should think about through fiscal 2018. Thanks, guys.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So let me just make sure that was only two questions and not three or four. The first one is what's going on with BioWare; and should we read anything in from Mass Effect to the new title? So that's that collection of questions. And the question was what's going on at PopCap and should we read anything in there? Was there a third question about head count overall? Or was that just head count related to PopCap?","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","We lost Mike now.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Mike?","Operator","","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Okay. Well, I'll answer...","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Only the first two.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And we'll go from there. The first thing is, is Mass Effect is an interesting title. It was in development for a really long time and represented a lot of the great things that BioWare is known for: story, size, depth, breadth, imagination. And while overall, the aggregate review scores were lower than we would have liked, we did have over 100 reviewers score the game at 80 or higher. So it represents a fan base that's very passionate; looking for very particular things. And many players found exactly what they're looking for and some players did not.","With that said, we believe Mass Effect Andromeda delivers a rich, deep experience which celebrates what makes the franchise great: wonderful, beautiful, deep rich worlds, amazing combat and engaging fast-paced, multiplayer. New multiplayer content is continuing to be released and new content kind of arriving overall more regularly so. We're very happy with kind of how BioWare is doing, how BioWare is treating Mass Effect. And our expectations for Mass Effect are still strong for the future and the franchise overall.","In terms of the new IP, the choice to move the new IP and what happened with Mass Effect are completely unrelated. The realities is we have a creative process. As a company, creativity and pioneering is really important for us. Now, innovation in games is important more now than ever. And as a leader in the industry, we see it as our responsibility to innovate. And as part of our creative process \u2013 and I get to be involved in that creative process \u2013 we recognize that there was so much more opportunity in a connected network social world to do some things in the new BioWare game that had never done before and we don't think anyone is going to do anytime soon. But by virtue of our network, our cross-platform presence and our scale, we think we can do that. And we chose to give the team some more time to deliver against that innovation because we believe players are looking for the kinds of things that we plan to put into that game.","And so we're very happy with BioWare. BioWare has continued to support Mass Effect, and the new team is doing some amazing things, and you'll hear more about that in the months to come. In terms of PopCap, again, I think there's a couple of different presence for PopCap. We have an amazing PopCap team in Vancouver that built Garden Warfare 1 and 2 on consol. That game continues to do extremely well, high critical acclaim, strong engagement, and strong sales over its life, so we're very happy with that team. The team's building against Mobile Games out of Seattle, recognize that the market continues to change, that brands are really important in the mobile space, but so is focus.","And the notion of building lots of small things really doesn't pay out the way it does in mobile like it did just a few years ago. And their decision was to refocus and really energize around a few core PopCap IP and that drove a slight change in structure there. But you shouldn't read into anything other than we are very, very committed to PopCap and very committed to PopCap IP, and very committed to bringing that wonderful IP to players across devices in the future.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our last question is from the line of Evan Wingren with Pacific Crest Securities.","Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities","Thanks. So what are your expectations for this next edition of Madden as it moves to Frostbite? And are there any potential synergies that you guys are thinking about for moving the game to that engine?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","What Frostbite allows us to do, as you can see what it allowed on FIFA is to have a much deeper experience, much better graphics, doing things inside the game that you couldn't do on a sports engine. So if you were to look at FIFA and say, how did FIFA change year-over-year, you'll probably see similar aspects of that in Madden. And we're pretty excited about it. It looks fantastic so far.","Evan Wingren - Pacific Crest Securities","Okay. And then, Andrew, in your remarks you called out AI and I'm just wondering how are you utilizing it now. And I use that term broadly. And how do you see it evolving over the next couple of years?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","We see kind of on three core vectors. Again, we make artificial humans inside of video games and have been doing that for many decades, and the sophistication of those human beings inside of our games continues to grow. And so we have a lot of energy about how do we improve the AI of our characters inside games so that their performance is far more believable and far more human. A second vector is just how we think about pathing and difficulty inside of our games, so with the growing population of players across devices, the notion that one size fits all with respect to experience is no longer relevant.","And so we have a lot of work going into how we think about a dynamic experience, a dynamic and personalized experience for every single player in our network, even as they play the same games with their friends on similar devices. And it's really about how do we change difficulty level, how do we change pathing, how do we provide the tools and feedback that those players need so that they can get the single best experience and ultimately engage with the game longer.","And then the third vector, of course, is just how we think about recommendations and presentation of content and merchandising of content and marketing of the content that we produce to a global player base. We have deep investment going on in all three vectors. We think we're leading in a number of categories. A lot of that will start to manifest itself inside of our EA Player Network. You're already seeing some of that in Ultimate Team, in our Sims games, in our Battlefield network that moves you amongst experiences. And we believe that in the not-too-distant future that's going to be a meaningful vector of growth for our business.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So one last question.","Operator","Our last question is from the line of Ray Stochel with Consumer Edge Research.","Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the question. How are you guys thinking now about the Nintendo Switch post launch? And is this in your new Gen console installed base forecast? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So we feel really good about it. Again, we came out early and said that we'll be supporting the Nintendo Switch with our biggest title in FIFA. We have a tremendous relationship with Nintendo and have done for many, many years and are excited by the fact that they have come out very strong and are bringing in a whole new player base into the ecosystem. We continue to be bullish on it and are looking at other titles that we might bring to the Switch. Our console number that we quoted does not include the Switch at this point, so anything that Nintendo does is additive to that number.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Great.

Q3 was a quarter defined by strong performances and important learnings for us at Electronic Arts. We love making games. It is a privilege to bring fun and entertainment to people all around the world. As we look across our games and services this quarter, we have a lot to be proud of. We brought hundreds of millions of hours of play to fans during the holiday quarter across console, mobile and PC. We also appreciate that our players have high expectations of us and the games we make and that passion drives us. As we push the boundaries with every new experience, we are continually listening, learning and taking action to serve our players.","Now, let me touch on Star Wars Battlefront II. This was definitely a learning opportunity. You'll remember that we brought three of our top studios together on this project, and the result was a massive game with a new Star Wars story; space battles; and huge multiplayer variety. We wanted a game that would meet the needs of the vast and passionate Star Wars fan base, so we designed it with the intent of keeping the community together, and a commitment to continually add content long after launch. Given the newness of this design, we knew that player feedback during the pre-launch testing period would be key. Having made adjustments based on sentiment and community data coming out of the beta and early trials, we ultimately made the decision to pull in game purchases out of the game prior to launch. We never intended to build an experience that could be seen as unfair or lacking clear progression, so we removed the feature that was taking away from what fans were telling us was an otherwise great game. We are fortunate to have such passionate players that will tell us when we get it right, and when we don't.","We're now working hard on more updates that will meet the needs of our players, and we hope to bring these to the Battlefront II community in the months ahead. Having made these changes before launch, Star Wars Battlefront II has been delivering fun to millions of players around the world, through the holiday season and beyond. With the breadth and depth of the game, fans spent twice as much time playing Battlefront II over the previous game during the launch quarter. The unique story of Iden Versio at the center of the game has drawn nearly 70% of players into the single -player campaign. Engagement has been strong in the first season of free post- launch content from The Last Jedi, and we're excited to bring new seasons to fans in FY19.","As we grow this game with more content, we believe that Star Wars fans will continue to have fantastic experiences over the long life of Battlefront II. Going forward, we believe that live services that include optional digital monetization, when done right, provide a very important element of choice that can extend and enhance the experience in our games. We're committed to continually working with our players to deliver the right experience in each of our games and live services.","Across the company, our fantastic creative teams are constantly pioneering new experiences that expand our reach, and add to the unmatched depth and breadth of our portfolio of games. There were many great examples of this throughout Q3, and I'll touch on a few of them here. FIFA continues to thrive as one of the world's leading entertainment properties. On console alone, our FIFA franchise had nearly 42 million players during the calendar year, and our FIFA 18 unique player base grew 10% year over year from launch through Q3. FIFA Mobile added another 26 million players in the quarter to its total player base more than any quarter in the last 12 months and millions more joined our FIFA experiences in Korea and China this year. Ultimate Team is more popular than ever across our EA SPORTS titles, and in FIFA Ultimate Team we had 12% more players' year-over-year from launch through Q3.","In other areas of our portfolio, Battlefield 1now has more than 25 million unique player's life to date, putting it on a similar growth trajectory as Battlefield 4's massive community. The Sims 4 had another extraordinary quarter as we launched our highest performing expansion pack to date, and brought the game to consoles for the first time. Both of those contributed to player base growth in our Sims 4 community of more than 35% year-over-year in Q3.","Need for Speed Payback also brought new experiences to longtime fans this quarter. On mobile, we're bringing more players into our network from across the world through the unique breadth and depth of our IP. From deeply engaged fans in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes to large, long -term communities in our EA SPORTS titles, The Sims FreePlay and more, our mobile games are reaching a wide and diverse audience and delivering years of high- value entertainment. Competitive gaming continues to be a major growth opportunity for us. We are bringing some of the biggest sports franchises in the world to the esports stage, and with new league partners, sponsors and broadcasters, our Madden NFL and FIFA competitions are reaching new milestones.","The Madden Challenge special on The CW network was the number one esports television broadcast in the U.S. for 2017, and our Madden Challenge live finals in December drove our largest digital viewership to date for a Madden tournament. On the FIFA side, we just kicked off the Road to the eWorld Cup with the FUT Champions Cup in Barcelona last weekend. Digital viewership was massive; with more than 17 million total views that's half of last season's total views in just our first tournament of the year. We are also partnering with leagues like the MLS, Bundesliga, and more to bring competitive FIFA deep into their fan bases, expanding our global opportunity. Next, we're bringing competition to Battlefield, with online qualifiers set to begin in Q1 FY19. Across FIFA, Madden and Battlefield, this is going to be our biggest competitive Season yet for players and spectators. Looking to the quarter ahead, we're set to deliver a mix of amazing new games that will add to the breadth of our portfolio.","First, later this week we will launch UFC 3. We have a great partnership with the UFC, and have worked hard over a two year development cycle to bring innovation across the entire game. With major UFC events coming in the months ahead, we're delivering UFC 3 at a very exciting time for the sport and its fans. During the fourth quarter, we will also launch the first two games from our EA Originals program, Fe and A Way Out. As you'll remember, we started EA Originals with a commitment to help independent developers bring unique and memorable games to the world. We can't wait to see fans come out and support these deeply -talented creators and the ideas they have brought to life in these games.","Also in Q4, The Sims Mobile will launch worldwide on iOS and Android. This game is a major leap forward for the franchise, combining the unique Sims magic with new dimensions of social play. Sims players are some of our most diverse and committed fans, and with games like The Sims 4 and The SimsFree Play, we've shown how we build and deliver for these communities over many years. In FY19, we will push the boundaries even further for our players, with new experiences and constant innovation. It's a World Cup year, and with the largest sporting event on the planet set to reach billions of soccer fans, our EA SPORTS development teams are packing excitement into our next FIFA. Madden NFL, NHL, and NBA LIVE will all bring new dimensions of gameplay, self-expression and social connection. The Battlefield universe will grow this year with our next Battlefield title, captivating longtime fans and new players alike, and adding to our Battlefield service where players can move seamlessly with their friends. Our new IP, Anthem is a stunning project from BioWare that will blend genres with a shared world experience that evolves around its players. Excitement for Anthem is building, and we're deeply invested in delivering a great new experience with this game when it launches in Q4 FY19. In addition, we plan to launch two new mobile games built around fan -favorite IP; we'll grow in esports with competitions and broadcast content reaching more players and viewers; and we'll continue to deliver for players through our live services including Star Wars Battlefront II with more great content for the games they love.","This collection of amazing games and content across more platforms, wrapped in live services, is at the core of the network we are building for our players. With competition, and subscription offerings that we will expand in new and innovative ways, we are reaching new audiences. Our amazing creative teams including the addition of the talented group at Respawn Entertainment","Our Frostbite engine, our central technology platform and our Labs groups are putting us in position to be disruptive, and deliver the unexpected. We are excited to bring many more great experiences to our global network in this quarter and beyond. Now I'll hand the call over to Blake","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks Andrew. Electronic Arts delivered earnings above our guidance absent of one time impact from tax reform. Sales of Stars Wars Battlefront 2 underperformed our expectations but event driven live services significantly exceeded them. This speaks to the stability of a business as diverse as ours with its broad portfolio of titles and mix of business model. I'll report our results on a GAAP basis then use our operational measure of net booking to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.","EA's net revenue was $1.160 billion compared to $1.149 billion a year ago. Operating expenses were $680 million compared to $637 million a year ago with the year-over-year increase primarily due to continued investment in existing and new genres and in live services. GAAP operating loss was $21 million compared to an operating loss of $4 million a year ago. And together with the charge from tax reform resulted in a loss per share of $0.60 compared with $0.00 a year ago. Almost all of the year-on-year change approximately $0.57 was due to the tax charge. Note, that given our GAAP result was a loss our share count was 308 million shares. Had we reported a profit the diluted share count would have been 311 million shares.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $849 million, down $288 million from last year. The decrease was driven by the timing of collection and be lower net bookings. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $24 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $825 million. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $1.514 billion. We remain on track to deliver operating cash flow of $1.6 billion for the fiscal year which would be a new record. See our earnings slide for further cash flow information.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of $150 million leaving $778 million in our two year $1.2 billion buyback program we began in May. We also paid a $151 million in cash to acquire Respawn Entertainment. Our cash and short term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.9 billion with 36% of this balance held onshore.","Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business in the quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $1.971 billion, down $99 million on the prior year, which benefited from a strong Battlefield 1 launch. Net bookings for the quarter were $29 million below our guidance driven by lower than expected sales of Star Wars Battlefront 2. For Q3, we had expected the sale of about 8 million units but we fell short of that by less than1 million units. However, this shortfall was significantly offset by excellent performance from our live services. The impact of FX was immaterial on the quarter.","Digital net bookings were $1.23 billion, up 12% on a year-over-year period and a new record for the third quarter. The main driver of this increase was live services, offset by lower sales of Star Wars Battlefront 2 compared to Battlefield 1. Digital net bookings now represent 67% of our business on a trailing 12 months basis compared to 60% in the prior year. Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net bookings and turn. Live services net bookings were 39% year-on-year to $787 million. The increase was driven by Ultimate Team and The SIMS4; this was a record for the third quarter. Mobile delivery net bookings of $183 million, up 5% year-on-year also a record for the third quarter. Year-on-year growth was driven by FIFA mobile. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $260 million, 27% lower than last year driven by Star Wars Battlefront 2 compared to Battlefield 1 last year. This was partially offset by the underlying growth in digital downloads. Star Wars Battlefront 2 units on console were 28% digital, up 12 percentage point over Battlefront 1 two years ago. Across the portfolio, 37% of our full game unit sales were digital, measured on X box and play station 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 32% a year ago.","Before turning to guidance, a brief note on tax reform. The enactment of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December 2017 resulted in a charge of $176 million in the third quarter. The charge is preliminary and includes a tax on accumulated overseas profits and the revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. Also, while we are not changing our management reporting tax rate for fiscal 2018, we are still analyzing whether the new legislation will reduce this rate for fiscal 2019.","In addition, because of new tax legislation and tax treatment for cash earned outside United States, it provides an opportunity for us to repatriate most of our foreign earnings. During the coming months, we'll reevaluate our capital return and investments strategy including our stock repurchases program and whether we should consider a dividend. We would expect to announce any changes on our next earnings call.","On the guidance. We are raising our full year GAAP revenue guidance from $5.075 billion to $5.1 billion on strength of our live services. Our guidance for full year EPS becomes $3.25 excluding the impact of $0.48 from tax reform, this represents a $0.10 increase on our previous guidance. We are affirming our operating cash flow guidance of $1.6 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $120 million which will deliver free cash flow of about $1.48 billion. We are reaffirming our guidance for net bookings at $5.15 billion but owing to the strength of our live services, we expect this to skew more digital than originally anticipated increasing our profitability.","For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.532 billion, cost of revenue to be $234 million and operating expenses of $690 million. Q4 OpEx is up slightly from our previous expectations driven by phasing of investments from Q3 and stock based compensation expenses related to the Respawn acquisition. It is up year-on-year primarily due to continued investment in existing and new genres and in live services. This resulted earnings per share of $1.86 for the fourth quarter using the diluted share count of 311 million shares. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.225 billion. This is to raise our previous expectation and up 12% year-on-year driven by strength in live services.","We continue to be excited about our opportunities for the future. Though the fourth quarter and through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 we will be launching games across five different genres sports, action, shooter, real-time strategy and sim. We will launch them across three platforms: PC, console and mobile. And we will reach players in all corners of the world. We expect full-game downloads to continue to grow, and to see growth in subscriptions, extra content and in our mobile business. We expect esports will continue to drive growth in Ultimate Team as well as Battlefield and other titles. This will also grow our broadcast, sponsorship and advertising deals associated with our esports activities. This diversity in portfolio, platforms, geographies and business models is the foundation of a robust business that enables us to deliver dependable cash flow.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks Blake. Across the world, more people are playing more games, in more geography, through more devices and more ways to connect. It's a vast and growing audience in the billions, with increasingly diverse interests and high expectations. Reaching players with the fun and meaningful experiences they seek requires the best games and content available across multiple platforms. It requires more ways to engage with that content, including competition. And it requires a strong connection to the community - the openness and dialogue that make this industry so unique and powerful in the entertainment world.","Today, EA has one of the most wide reaching portfolios of top games and franchises in the industry. Through FY19 and beyond, we are planning stunning new additions that will continue to grow the depth, breadth and quality of experiences we bring to fans around the world. Our DICE studio will deliver the next Battlefield, with innovation at every level, incredible stories at the core, astonishing visuals and game play that will captivate every Battlefield fan. Building on one of the strongest years ever for EA SPORTS, we're setting our sights to excite even more players, and deliver even more advanced experiences, with our next slate of games. Anthem will bring a rich and dramatic new world to players, built from the ground up by BioWare as a new IP that we believe will reach a wide audience and foster a long-term community.","We'll take major leaps in our mobile portfolio with two new titles set for this year, and more to follow as we continue to focus on high quality, long lasting games. And there is so much more to come in the years ahead, with new projects in development at Motive, Respawn, and our other studios, as well as more games from indie developers in our EA Originals program.","We're also creating more ways to connect with our franchises, including competitive gaming that reaches tens of millions of players and spectators. With FIFA and Madden, we've broken new ground, bringing global competition to some of the most passionate fan bases in all of sports. Now with league partnerships, broadcast partners and sponsors on board, we're driving even larger audiences with thrilling, high-stakes competition. Competitive Battlefield will open up a brand-new dimension of our esports programs beginning next fiscal year, and by the end of FY19 we will launch competition in a fourth title as well. Esports is also fueling opportunities for us in growth regions of the world, driving excitement with our players across China, Korea, the Middle East and more. In all of this, we are leading in service of our players, and strengthening the connections at the heart of our global network.","We are constantly listening, learning, and working to make every player experience better. With our subscription services, we're removing friction so players can enjoy more of the games they love, and in FY19 we'll be doubling down with new offerings. By leveraging the cloud, we're exploring ways that streaming and other technologies will enable those experiences to be even more seamless. And through our Frostbite technology, we are pushing the boundaries in every aspect of games today.","With an amazing collection of games and content, thrilling competitions for a global audience, and a network built on the strength of our player connections, EA is uniquely positioned to lead in the expansion and evolution of this industry that we love.","Now Blake and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","And your first question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs.","Chris Merwin","Great, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the great quarter. So you got live service revenue growth of 39% in the quarter. I don't think we've seen that level of growth, quarterly growth since fiscal 2015. So wondering if you could help us understand the component of that a bit better and particular what drove such a strong acceleration and growth for Ultimate Team. And then just second question when it comes to live services, you mentioned a learning experience that you have Star Wars, so now when you think about how to build the digital economy for non-sports title, can you maybe a talk a bit about how your philosophy has changed there, if at all, and are you now more focused on cosmetic items, or do you still think collection mechanic can work for well for share or action title. Thank you very much.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks Chris. Let me I'll display I'll start with the digital question then let Andrew answer the second one. So we were very pleased with the live service growth and the strength of across all the franchises. I think first and foremost FIFA and Madden had fabulous ultimate team experiences during the quarter, great events driving continued deep engagement. The opportunities that we did with last year with FIFA to bring a single player story mode into the game helped drive ultimate team last year and FIFA continued that this year, the same thing occurred in Madden where it brought more people into Madden and it brought them into ultimate team. That in combination with the esports business that we've been building around ultimate team and those two properties has proven to be extremely exciting for the consumer and driving huge level of interest in ultimate team and participation in ultimate team. Beyond those two properties as well as hockey which continues to do well. And UFC is starting to grow and basketball starting to around ultimate team. The SIMS4 added a substantial amount to extra content live services. The continuation of our successful content packages that we shift with the SIMS4 was a very strong during the quarter and then as we brought the SIMS4 out on console that also started the process for the console side of the equation. So we are excited about the continued future of the SIMS4 and clearly that in mobile down the road. Battlefield 1 continue to help monetize live services and their extra content program and the combination of all of that really drove the massive growth in extra content during the quarter and helped balance out the business model. So and as I mentioned just a moment ago, competitive gaming we believe continues to be a big driver there going forward. We'll see that in the Battlefield franchise I think as Andrew mentioned. So that's the extra concept when let live services, let me Andrew address the other question.","Andrew Wilson","Thank you. And a great question. We remain committed to a long term strategy of building amazing games that offer compelling adventure in the live services. And believe that digital economies can have place in those live services as we see that accepted across the industry now gains, added up in gain. But I think the greatest learning is that no single model and it's more of a how you can deliver the most engaging experience to players with new content and game update. So the same games like the SIMS, we continue to find that deal C packs through really well with the community. And that works well in that construct. We also know that when large games like Battlefield and Star Wars Battlefront premium content after launch is value by the community but only where we can offer in a world where we don't bifurcate the community. And so it comes that being really careful and consider in designing model for post launch content that will be authenticate and engaging but most importantly offer player choice. And as you see us continually work on Star Wars Battlefront 2 and as you can see us continue to evolve in the broader venture and large service across our portfolio, at the very center of earnings we want offer its choice, player choice in a world that keeps the communities together.","Operator","And your next question comes from Justin Post from BAML.","Justin Post","Thank you for my question. I guess my question would be on future titles given some of the recent controversies. First, we talked about Anthem; it seems to be pushed out to the fourth quarter. What's your confidence in that build in that game? How do you think it's coming along and maybe a little bit why it was maybe delayed a bit? And then with Star Wars having some issues versus your guidance. How do you think about that as a franchise? Can that come back in two years and be really strong again? How are you thinking about that franchise? Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","The first thing about Anthem is regardless of kind of how it's being portrayed, we are not looking at that as a delay in the game. We've chosen to launch Anthem in Q4 and the date is really determined by portfolio of balancing consideration not for product readiness reasons. It's tracking well on its development milestones. We are really confident of its ship date. We are really excited by the way the next battlefield is shaping up and it might set - it probably doesn't make sense to launch Anthem right up next to it. And when you think about Anthem as a brand new IP, we also believe it make sense to give it its own launch window so that we can give us a focus and attention that it deserve and give it some free air. In terms of Star Wars is ongoing and we remain committed to the franchise. We think the Star Wars Battlefront 2 is very core and is amazing game. The team is working diligently on update and extra content for the live services around Star Wars Battlefront 2. We expect to be - the response as I said in the prepared remarks is being really strong, the content we released so far. We expect the response to continue to be strong as we bring that content forward. And we are going to really look after that community and support and sustain that community, fulfill the commitment we made to them for a long time to come.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes, Justin, just as a reminder, we have not obviously announced product for our fiscal 2020 yet but remember that we have a Star Wars action game that the team of respondent has been working on for the last couple of years. And most likely that would drop in fiscal 2020 versus another battlefront. We haven't decided exactly timing for another battlefront yet but clearly the next big Star Wars game would be the action game in fiscal 2020.","Operator","And your next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju","Thank you. So Andrew or Blake, it seems like to me FIFA mobile presents one of the largest incremental opportunities for you given the installed base of devices and the global popularity of soccer. So I am wondering what drove the 26 million player increased to the base and what you may be doing in the background to improve the game's performance. I think the dialogues today has been you guys were looking to optimize the game, just wondering if you guys have turned the corner here. Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","Well, I don't know if I would say ever say turn the corner because it's a huge long term plan but we are seeing incredible improvement in the game. We are very excited about what we are seeing but it has been on the roadmap that we've been talking about. Similar roadmap that Madden followed two to three improvement cycle in game or constantly updating and building better, better events around for the players. And that's a same approach that we are taking with FIFA. It is now trending to be - they are number two or number three game depending where Madden is and behind Galaxy of Heroes. But it's really moving in a right direction. We are very excited, and we are continuing to tune it almost daily. The team is incredibly committed to making this one of the largest mobile games in the world and we think it certainly has the potential as you can imagine we are couple be part of that roadmap going forward and some exciting things coming there as well.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak","Thank you for taking my question. I have two. Just the first one the strength of the FIFA and Madden for the team, another very good quarter. I was wondering did you talk the composition of that ultimate team live service growth between and bring new payers into ecosystem versus ARPU and maybe just some of the key that do you see to bring more payers in to the ecosystem going forward? And then second one kind of the bigger picture, over the last couple of years you talked a lot about diversifying away from non-sports titles. And unfortunately some of the non-sports titles have performed below expectation. As opposed to Madden I guess can you give us some examples of areas you see for opportunity to improve your ability to execute and consistently you kind of deliver the titles and really drive non-sport franchises through the company.","Blake Jorgensen","Sure. I'll start on the ultimate team and then I'll let Andrew address the second one with the caveat and saying unless I checked last year's battlefield is one of the largest battlefields, it was the largest battlefield of all time. So I would probably say now put a little question in and how you say it our success rate in non-sports. So but to your point of live services around ultimate team, the biggest driver has been the continued to bring new people into the franchise. We grew the FIFA franchise this year and well double digit which is the largest game in the world probably one of the most amazing feat that we continue to do year in and year out through amazing innovation in the game and incredible improvement around the consumer experience, the gamer experience with the game. That plus bringing more people into ultimate team has really been the major drive. It is the single most popular way to play the game. People start to think about FIFA is really ultimate team more than they do other line game itself it's so exciting for people because it's constantly changing and it has new and exciting events every single week to bring people back. So it is truly a live service that has been driven every day and every week versus the single game. Madden follows that same trail as well as Hockey, UFC and Basketball and all of those efforts have been how do you bring more and more people into the ultimate team, overall versus how do you try to increase the ARPU on the people they are already there. We find that the ARPU increase happens naturally as people spend more time playing, but at the end of the day our effort is primarily on bringing more people into the franchise through us making sure they understand it, making sure they find ways to play it and enjoy it. For example, this year we addressed an issue where people who didn't want to play online they still want to play ultimate team, we created the modes so they can do that. So it's ways to continue to bring people into the franchise overall as well as in the ultimate team versus ARPU so.","Andrew Wilson","Yes. And of the second part of the question I echo Blake's sentiment a little bit. As I look back over the last few years and we think about the SIMS which is continue to perform year-over-year. Battlefield 1 which in its year I think without - certainly the biggest battlefield and maybe the biggest shooter of the year. Plants vs. Zombie Garden Warfare which is a new IP that has done well at plus two iterations, Dragon Age: Inquisition which is not year with game of the year, even you look at Mass Effect involved, there were some polarizing sentiment in that franchise, it's actually performed really well and player engagement is really strong. And then it calls across mobile SIMCITY build it, the SIMS FREE PLAY and Star Wars Gods of Heroes all highly successful in their own market. So as I take a 50,000 foot view and look at the breadth and depth of our portfolio, across all of the games we make and even you look at last in 2017 in aggregate we were the highest reviewed publisher across portfolio. So there is a lot of real goodness there. With all that said, that doesn't mean we are perfect and there are always learning opportunity for us and we are a learning company. And as you look through our history over the last three or four years, there have been times we didn't quite get it right and we have put out player first commitment at the forefront of everything we do and we have worked tirelessly to ensure that we are able to support and sustain them. With the kinds of experience they expect from us. And so that has made, we have changed and be the process and we've changed the testing process, we have changed some of the lively design, we changed some of the ways we go to market. And as a company we will always be learning and always evolving and always making the right changes and services of players. But on balance, I think we had a really, really strong run on sports and non-sports.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.\\","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two. One on the EA original, how should we think about the sizing of the opportunities for those sorts of games, as well as maybe the marketing support that's needed for those games versus more traditional titles that you've seen that might have bigger budgets on both the development side and the marketing side? Second question, obviously we are the world's top in the calendar 2018, how do you think about framing of world cup, what it means for FIFA broadly as a franchise both in mobile and non-mobile broadly as you look out over the next 12 months? Thanks guys.","Andrew Wilson","Let me take the first one. I'll let Blake take the second part. Again, EA originals for - is really build on a philosophical believe that we need to encourage all forms of game development to keep the industry healthy over time. We see this in the music business, we see this in the movie business and kind of world where today to compete with the likes often some of the other players in our development polishing space, and you need hundreds and millions of dollars. And that probably means some of the really interesting different working ideas never get to making into players hand. We believe that as a company with the kind of leadership position that we have that is actually our responsibility to help those games into the player's hands and through the process that probably means they are going to be giant games in the first part of it. And we don't look at it that way. But we do believe it is our responsibility and we think there is the chance as we work with these great creative developers who are doing really new and interesting and innovative things that we may find some great new IP for the future. And as we build those relationships to that kind into developers, we think it's an opportunity for us to continue to push the entire industry forward and give us access to some ideas that we may not otherwise see. Both inside the company or inside the industry.","Blake Jorgensen","And just one final point from financial standpoint and you should assume that the financial impact is negligible. We would love these titles to become big breakout hits and we are not - I am not saying they won't. But right now in our guidance for the fourth quarter we are not planning a big revenue component of it. And we provide the profitability back to the developer. So it's not really a profit issue, some revenue generated but it won't be a very large for the quarter. But we do think there will be great games that live on for a long, long period of time on multiple platforms. In terms of World Cup and how we think about that. As you know, the World Cup doesn't start until the summer, so really fall into the next year's fiscal we will give you some details when we give guidance around what we think the impact of that will be. But as we have in the past, we had a long tradition of celebrating of the World Cup inside of FIFA and bringing it to live for our fans, that goes all the way back I think to World Cup '98 where we really started to going and we've got some exciting and fun things to announce that will come on later this spring before obviously the World Cup it's going. Since I am on next year, I might as well talk a little bit about Q1 just to make sure everyone remembers a few facts from last year. We expect 2019 to be a growth year for EA. We've talked about World Cup, continued strength in all of our sports titles, the emergence of the next battlefield which is extremely exciting as Andrew mentioned as well as our new IP Anthem. All of that should turn out to be a fabulous year for EA. The one thing I'd want to remind people is all that stuff comes past Q1, so as you are looking at Q1remember last year we benefited from a $53 million deferral of Mass Effect revenue into the quarter. We shift Mass Effect to the end of Q4 but there was a deferral on the premium revenue which shifts fairly high profitability revenue into Q1. And we benefited as well from some onetime adjustments when we shut down our distribution center in Switzerland. And so the combination of those two is probably were somewhere between $0.15 and $0.20 of EPS. So just remember that as you are thinking about the quarter. Well, obviously give everyone quarterly data, the type of data that we give every year when we give guidance. But I just want to keep people aware of that as you think about next year's quarter. But we are very extremely excited for FIFA for World Cup for the year to come, it looks it's going to be another great year for EA. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Research.","Ben Schachter","Few high level questions. One can you just talk about how your view of esports has evolved really over the past couple of years? You just talked about it as much more of sort marketing driver and now that's changed. Second question is just how do you think success of PUBG has impacted your development and why do you think it has been successful? And then finally, Blake, any update on potential new streaming models or expectations for new platforms? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","So I am going to let Andrew talk about esports and PUBG and then I'll talk about last question.","Andrew Wilson","So I think what you are seeing right now is actually our strategy around esports coming to life. I don't believe there has been a material shift for us. We always believe that it's very cool, esports is going to drive tremendous engage - communities and allow us to reach broader communities of viewers who maybe never played our games before. And in doing so we would seek roads in the core digital businesses of the game that are featuring these sports. So you are seeing that right now in FIFA and Madden and we expect to see that in Battlefield also. What's actually happening is we are getting to a milestone quicker than we had planned. And we had always believe that over time as we build greater engagement, as we build greater viewership and as we added more titles to our portfolio of competitive games, that new opportunities around media rights, broadcast rights, sponsorship right would also come into play for us. And we are overjoyed with performance so far. Our competitive gaming group is doing spectacular work. The global player base in FIFA and Madden and we expect battlefield and future titles continue to engage and play these spectacular games and put on amazing entertainment for viewers and not just being that we are accelerating in terms of where we think all the growth effect is and profitable revenue might come from over time. In terms of PUBG, again I think what you discover in this industry is a lot of great vector that drive player engagement. And one of those is just innovation in the core game play mechanic. And the team with PUBG have done is really deliver a new level of innovation that change the way people were playing first and shooter game. And we are very respectful and complimentary what they have been able to do. We've seen that continue with fortnight. Again, so it's clearly a mode of play that the global FPS population interested in and given that we have some of the best shooters in the marketplace, you might expect that we are also thinking about new and innovative ways to play. And that doesn't mean just on a PUBG replicas inside of the battlefield universe but it does mean that our battlefield team and talked in prepared remarks, looking at how they innovate in every aspect of the game including core game play and map design.","Blake Jorgensen","On the streaming question, I think as we've talked about before, we see as we look at the media industry we've seen one of the greatest disruptions has been the combination of streaming plus subscription. We think that combination is critical. And we see the ability to have live services which allows you to monetize on top of subscription is also incredibly important. And obviously that plays to our strength. We built a long history already in the subscription business and we have a long history in live services and we think the combination of that experience plus delivering through streaming maybe very important in this industry going forward. We've been doing some consumer streaming trials. We've done over both cable and traditional streaming over cable as well as now through the use of local clients to help streaming through datacenters. We are obviously have a very successful subscription experience both on EA access as well as origin access and with the building actively as part of the investments that we've been making our player network through technology infrastructure internally that helps players' transition and connect with friends experiences, experiencing more content across multiplatform. We think that's important and also very important in the streaming world. And we've been working some of the largest partners out there on potential business models for streaming. We will continue that work and we'll continue work on the technology side ourselves. And I'd say that between in the next two to five years you'll see some major movements there with probably some testing that occurs on the shorter side of that versus the longer side maybe ever earlier. More to come but it's obviously something we've been trying to investing across many different vectors and we are extremely excited about it. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Gee from Barclays.","Ryan Gee","Hi, great. Thanks for taking my call. So we really appreciate the color on the unit sales for Star Wars. I was hoping you guys could just clarify what are you doing to restructure the MTX portion of Star Wars and assuming that you guys are still committed delivering content for sale, how should we think about the timeline there? And maybe how many full Star Wars could be the top and bottom line in year two of its life? Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","Yes. So I think as we talked about it in the prepared remarks, we believe that digital economy have a place in event driven live services and our plan is absolutely to continue to drive and focus and deliver on that. And the teams are working on how that will fit in the context of Star Wars Battlefront 2 universe and we expect over the next coming months we will have more to share on that front.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. In terms of financial, Ryan, I think you know we are inherently conservative and how we try to forecast and we did not build very much revenue at all into this year's forecast for Star Wars. And while we haven't given guidance yet as we are doing our budgets for next year internally, we are assuming that until we have a proven model that we are confident off, we are probably not going to build a lot into our budget either i.e. than into our guidance. More to come when we give our guidance but don't take that as a negative in any way. It's simply conservatism around how we are trying to drive the business. As Andrew said, it's very important to us long term because we think it's very important how fun the games are and how people will enjoy the game. We just make - we just need to make sure we get the model exactly right. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz from Oppenheimer.","Andrew Uerkwitz","Thanks so much for taking my call. If we remove World Cup I think for a second and just starting about FIFA medium and longer term, where is the opportunity in growing that franchise? Is it kind of increasing the player base, increased ARPU? And on the gaming side, you've added a lot of new features in the past couple of years. Is there still room for more features?","Andrew Wilson","Great question. As we think about FIFA the beauty of FIFA and greatness of FIFA is the soccer or football in many parts of the world is the world's game. And just goes from strength to strength across the globe. And so really the opportunity with FIFA is really, really strong. And we think about on a few key vectors. And I always involve at first level growing the total addressable market. So right now we have tremendous geographic expansion opportunities a little bit about our China presence and well it's doing there, the Middle East is opening up is a tremendous opportunity for FIFA. The US continues to grow; South East Asia continues to grow. And the passion quite frankly across Europe continues to grow. Next we think about this in terms of platform expansion. And as consoles continue to grow and again there are more consoles saw this generation than any other generation before on play station and X Box, PC is kind of - is making a resurgent for gamers and feedback that there is very strong PC presence. We talked that in prepared remarks around mobile. And Blake talked a little bit about how we think about streaming long term. So really remove the barriers to entry to bringing more people. And then two of the most powerful motivators of human behavior on the planet competition and social interaction. And so as you think about the types of game and features that we will continue to build inside of the FIFA universe as we bring these multi billion global community of football fans together, a feature that actually drive greater social interaction as a sports fan the thing I want to do most is interact with sports fans. And as a competitor I think I want to do most is compete. And you are seeing this now around our competitive modes. But you should also expect as we branch out in geographies and platforms and new access models like streaming and subscription that features around social interaction and competition continue to be at the very core what we do and we think there is still tremendous opportunity there.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. And I would add to that one of the things that made FIFA so successful for us is the deep partnerships that we build with the league out there. And today we don't have all the leagues so we are constantly looking at what leagues are emerging, what leagues are extremely strong and where can we better partner with leagues going forward. And it has been a fabulous way to help grow the business and help grow the support of football around the globe. The leagues see us a major way that they can market their product, their players, their teams, their stadium and we see it as obviously as perfect business combination for us. And so part of our growth strategy going forward particularly in new geographies is to how do you make sure you have the leagues for those geographies. But even in matured geographies where we might not be fully exposed to all the leagues, we are trying to make sure that we are driving that. It's an incredible competitive advantage for us to be able to have those deep partnerships and we are going to continue to try to leverage those to help grow the product across all the platforms that Andrew talked about, mobile, streaming, PC and the core console business.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Hickey from Benchmark Company.","Mike Hickey","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. I really appreciate it. Congrats on the quarter. Two on loop boxes, one sort of ground level, I am curious if Disney is formulated any sort of opinion on whether they are comfortable with that sort of monetization mechanic and battlefront or future games. And then maybe from a higher level how should we think about bounds of risk in any sort of constructive framework emerging around loop box, and maybe how you think about if you do see that as a risks, how are you thinking about mitigating that as a company or and\/or as an industry? Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","So first I would choose my words carefully. You shouldn't believe everything that you read in the press. We have a tremendous relationship with Disney. We have built some amazing games together Battlefront, Star Wars Gods of Heroes and even Star Wars Battlefront 2. And we have been very proactive in that relationship and service about players. And so at a point where we make the decision that we believe we have the right model for our players and our global community, I have no doubt that we will get the support of Disney on that. And again as we look forward, the big learning is there is no one size fit all when it comes event driven live services. But at the very core we must always build on the foundation of player of choice. And that might be the choice of whether a player engages in a particular mode or not, that might be whether a player decides to grind for something or not. But in all things it's around providing a fair playing field with players feel they have choice. And you should expect that we will continue to drive hard against that and ensure that again we didn't set out as I said in the prepared remarks to build the feature set that could be perceived to be anything other than fair. It's clear that we didn't quite get that balance right. But we are doubling down now to ensure that we do it.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. I'll just add we do not believe that loop boxes and similar mechanics are form of gambling. I think there are a plenty of governments around the world that have agreed with us on that. And there isn't just us it is the entire industry. We work very carefully and closely with all of our industry partners and the ESA the industry body to make sure that people understand exactly what loop boxes are, exactly why they are not gambling and we will continue to engage in that going forward. We think that's important and I think there is a lot of consumers who would argue the same thing based on their great experience they have with fun games to have associated live services with them, that some maybe misconstruing as a loop box or a gambling mechanism. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray.","Mike Olson","Hey, good afternoon. Just one question for me. You mentioned full game download continue to grow. I guess not surprise. So what did you say was in December high 30s as percent of the mix, I think something like that. And what are your expectations for calendar 2018, will we see like 10 points of growth over the next year, should we expect more incentives from either kind of film makers or publishers to push that trend. And then also is it still the case that full game downloads is 15 to 20 points better gross margin wise, or is anything changed on that front? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. Nothing is changed on the margin front. We finished the year around 37 for the calendar year around 37%. And as you know we are still little below the industry. I think the industry is getting closer to 40%. We skew a little lower due to the global nature of FIFA and then also battlefront 2 while it came up 12 points from battlefront 1, still skewed in the high 20s versus the high 30s primarily due to the gift giving and a younger audience base. But we see all the right trends helping that. We feel have our forecast is kind of 5 plus points a year. Obviously, we have been on a low side of that for the last couple of years. But I think at a minimum we should see five points of increase each year and hopefully it's greater than that. We don't see a cap any time soon because we know more and more players are realizing it's more convenient, easy and engaging way to play. Many players have been already buying extra content and thus have a way to have digital purchases as part of their overall game play. And we believe the consumer will ultimately default towards convenience however that might be, it might be they still have store around the corner from him, or it might be that he don't and it's easy for them to buy digitally. But you'll see us continue to do things to try to encourage people to buy digitally and we think that's still major key as part of the future business.","Blake Jorgensen","With that I think we are out of time. I appreciate everybody's great questions and interest.

I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Chris Evenden, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin, sir.","Chris Evenden","Thanks. Welcome to EA's Fiscal 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO. Frank Gibeau, our EVP of Mobile and Peter Moore, our COO, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, and a transcript.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the Company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of October 28, 2014, and disclaims any duty to update them.","During this call, unless otherwise stated, the financial metrics will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision.","All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise stated.","Now, I will turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Chris. I am pleased to report excellent results for EA's second quarter of fiscal year 2015 exceeding guidance for non-GAAP revenue and earnings and generating record Q2 operating cash flow. Strong new titles, deep player engagement in our large services, and ongoing digital growth drove continued momentum for EA.","Putting players first is our top priority at EA and that begins with delivering incredible experiences for gamers every day. Our players on console and PC logged more than 1.9 billion hours of gameplay through the quarter. We also reached more mobile gamers this quarter, with an average of over 155 million monthly active users for EA mobile games. Across the biggest platforms and most popular genres, EA is delivering long-lasting fun and enduring value for our players.","During the second quarter, EA launched a slate of new games and services across console, PC, and mobile. To call out a few highlights, Madden NFL 15 kicked off in August and quickly registered as one of the most successful Madden titles in recent years among players and critics. To date, players have logged more than 89 million games of Madden, up 48% year over year. With Sims 4 and NHL 15 launched in September, we have already delivered major content updates to players in both of these games with new features and game modes.","FIFA 15 had only one week in our Q2, but within that week it surpassed 3.4 million unique players in one day, a launch record for our FIFA games, and it continues to be strong. On average, we are seeing nearly 50% more players engaged online in FIFA 15 over FIFA 14 last year. With engagement this strong this early, we are very excited about the opportunity we have with FIFA 15 through the soccer season and beyond.","The Ultimate Team modes for Madden NFL 15, NHL 15, and FIFA 15 continue to see explosive growth. Our aggregate Ultimate Team player base has already increased by more than 40% over FY14. Madden NFL mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team for mobile also launched for iOS and Android this quarter. Along with our EA SPORTS King of the Course golf game, these are new experiences that have ignited the sports category on mobile. Our EA SPORTS mobile games averaged over 40 million monthly active users in Q2, up 250% year over year.","Our digital transformation strategy continues to drive EA as we innovate and provide more ways to play our industry-leading portfolio of games and IP. Last quarter, we launched EA Access, our new digital service for Xbox One players that allows unlimited play across a selection of EA titles and other valuable benefits for a monthly or annual fee.","EA Access membership has grown well beyond our early expectations and we anticipate continued momentum in the months ahead. Digital is driving our growth in Asia as well. FIFA Online 3 revenue grew 89% year over year in Q2. In Korea, one of the most competitive free-to-play markets in the world, FIFA Online 3 was one of the top mid-session games by revenue in Q2, and the bidder in China has already reached the top 10 for mid-session games as well. Korea and China are exciting growth opportunities for EA and we continue to explore new ways to reach more players with our biggest IP.","Across EA's portfolio, our second quarter results demonstrated the value we can deliver across different experiences, platforms, and geographies. Our slate of new titles and services for this year and beyond will continue to emphasize new experiences that allow players to spend more time immersed in their favorite games.","Looking ahead into Q3 and the holiday season, NBA Live 15 launched today with stunning visuals and new gameplay experience, and excitement is building for the release of Dragon Age: Inquisition in November. With more than 150 hours of gameplay, Dragon Age: Inquisition is shaping up to be a true BioWare epic.","We believe the additional time that we gave the development team has paid off with a great game that is immense, polished, and fun to play. Both IGN and GameSpot have Dragon Age: Inquisition as one of the most anticipated games coming this quarter and we are excited to have fans experience the deep story and gameplay when it launches in just a few weeks. We expect momentum from Q2 to continue across our portfolio as more players join in our top titles across console, PC, and mobile. Live services for our EA SPORTS games will continue to deliver new updates, content and challenges to players, connecting the real-world events of the NFL, NHL, soccer and NBA season directly to the player experience in our games.","We also expect continuing engagement in The Sims 4 as players in the game receive two more rich content updates before the end of the calendar year. On mobile devices, EA will launch two new games in Q3, SimCity BuildIt and Peggle Blast. Both games are free to play and took advantage of EA's new sandbox program where our employees from around the world play-test early versions of titles still in development. The data and feedback we collect from the sandbox helps us bring innovative, high-quality, new mobile experiences to our players.","Battlefield 4 will release its fifth expansion pack, Final Stand, during Q3, adding to the massive experience in that game. Battlefield 4 continues to add new players and engage existing fans a year after launch. As a result of the extended services and content updates that we provide, it's clear that players want to experience the games we are delivering for longer periods of time.","Looking into next year, we will ensure that our players have enough time between releases to fully explore the depth and innovation in our shooter titles. Beginning on March 17, 2015, in North America and a few days later in Europe, we will launch Battlefield Hardline, packed with innovation and set in an entirely new environment that will excite fans of Battlefield and new players as well. Following this launch, our next Battlefield experience is planned for launch in Q3 FY17. We want to give Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline players more time to enjoy these games and immerse themselves in a game, the live service, and the community.","Next holiday, we will launch a new blockbuster, Star Wars Battlefront, from our DICE Studio is slated to release in EA's third quarter FY '16. We will detail more of our upcoming title plans in the quarters ahead, as it is shaping up to be an exciting year. For now, I will hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our Q2 financial performance.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.22 billion, which was 17% higher than the prior year's results and 7% above our guidance. The excellent performance was led by FIFA 15, Madden 15, and The Sims 4. In addition to these key titles, catalog titles, including FIFA 14, Battlefield 4 and Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare, continued to perform well.","On a trailing 12 month non-GAAP basis, we delivered record net revenue, record earnings and record operating cash flow. Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased by 30% year over year to $453 million, 37% of this quarter's revenue. The trailing 12 month digital net revenue was another record, up 14% to $2 billion.","Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and free to play contributed $153 million, up 20% over the prior year, led by sustained momentum in our FIFA, Madden and Hockey Ultimate Team services, which were up 96% year on year. Over the same period, we have grown FIFA Ultimate Team 61%, Madden Ultimate Team 277%, and Hockey Ultimate Team 113%.","In addition, we saw great success in Asia with the continued growth of FIFA Online 3, up 89% year on year. Star Wars: The Old Republic also contributed to the free-to-play segment. As a reminder, FIFA online is still in beta in China with our partner, Tencent; thus, we are not yet recognizing revenue. The financial success of our digital business follows directly from the strategy Andrew discussed in his remarks of building live services to engage players. These live services are also increasing the longevity of our games.","The strength of Ultimate Team in Q2 was mainly due to catalog titles and Ultimate Team revenue associated with the new releases of FIFA, Madden, and NHL is expected to start contributing meaningfully in Q3. Mobile generated $115 million for the quarter, up 11% over the prior year. $105 million, or 91%, of this was from digital extra content and advertising. This was up 35% versus the prior year and continues to more than offset the decline in the premium business. Premium full game download revenue was just $10 million, down 62% compared to the prior year. Full game PC and console downloads generated $94 million, up 71% over the prior year. Although the percentage varied considerably by title, platform, and geography, the trend towards full game downloads continues.","Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue contributed $91 million, up 47% over the same period last year. The ratable recognition of Battlefield 4 Premium continues to be a driver behind the year-on-year comparison. EA Access is performing above expectations, although little revenue was recognized in Q2, following its launch in the middle of the quarter.","Moving on to gross margins, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 66.1%, an increase from last year's 61.7% and better than our guidance of 65.5%. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to growth in our digital business, both full game downloads and extra content, and by The Sims 4 launch.","Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $497 million, $2 million below prior year and $33 million better than our guidance. Our lower operating expenses compared to guidance were largely driven by quarterly phasing of key expenses in marketing and contracted services, combined with continued cost discipline.","We expect some of these marketing and services costs to be incurred in future quarters. With regard to the year-over-year comparison, bear in mind that The Sims 4 drove more marketing expenses than the titles in the same quarter last year. In addition, some marketing expenses originally planned for Battlefield Hardline were shifted into Q4 as we refine our launch plans for that title.","More generally with regard to expenses, we believe there are still many opportunities to improve our profitability. We are focused on generating operating profits, as well as revenues, and this has increased our emphasis on driving our digital and live services businesses. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.73 per share, far exceeding our guidance and prior year, due to strong revenues, higher gross margin, and continued cost control.","The beat was primarily driven by the strength of our key franchises, outperformance in our digital business, and the power of our deep catalog, coupled with continued spending discipline. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.39 billion or approximately $7.65 per share. 67% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $183 million versus last year's use of $6 million. On a trailing 12 month basis, operating cash flow was a record $1.15 billion.","During Q2, we repurchased 2.6 million shares at a cost of $95 million. As a reminder, our $750 million stock buyback program was initiated in May and has a two-year timeframe. The current rate of purchases keep us on a track to complete the full $750 million in that time.","Now turning to guidance, due to our strong first half of the year performance, we are increasing our full-year guidance. For fiscal-year 2015, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue will increase by $75 million to $4.175 billion and our non-GAAP EPS will increase by $0.20 to $2.05 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of approximately 21%. This increase in our total-year guidance is driven by the continued strength of our core titles, our catalog business, our digital live services and our continued focus on operating expenses.","In addition, this guidance reflects our plan to ship Battlefield Hardline during the third week of March 2015. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.375 billion in revenue and $2.06 in fully diluted EPS. Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $850 million. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a new free cash flow forecast of approximately $750 million.","Guidance for our third quarter is now non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.275 billion, a 19% decrease compared to last year's $1.57 billion. Last year's third quarter was exceptional in that it saw the launch of PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and six major next-gen titles from EA. Launches this quarter include Dragon Age: Inquisition, NBA Live 15 and on mobile, Peggle Blast and SimCity BuildIt.","Our non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 70.5%. Q3 operating expenses will be impacted by the phasing of some of our operating expenses from Q2. We expect our total non-GAAP operating expense to be $515 million. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.90 per share, as compared to $1.26 last year. Our Q3 guidance for GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.1 billion, as compared to $808 million in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.41, as compared to $1 loss per share in the prior year.","As a follow-up to Andrew's comments on our title slate in FY '16 and FY17, we are planning to release Star Wars Battlefront in Q3 FY '16 and our next Battlefield title in Q3 FY17. This provides us with a major first-person shooter title each year and allows us to focus on still increasing earnings progression in the coming years. This also allows our Battlefield titles to enjoy the long life we have seen historically through our core gameplay and extended services.","We will provide detailed yearly guidance on our title slate, as we normally do, during our fourth-quarter earnings call, but we felt that more clarity around our plans for Battlefield and Star Wars franchises would be useful at this time. In the last two years, we have achieved major improvements in the Company's operating model, dramatically increasing cash generation and profitability.","We're building a solid foundation for steady earnings growth as we focus on player engagement, our continued digital transformation, intelligent investment in new IP and the leverage of our catalog in an increasingly digital and mobile world. We\u2019re very excited about the future of the industry and of Electronic Arts."," Now I will turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Blake. Looking ahead, there are three distinct principles that drive our strategy today. As I said at the outset, we are constantly focused on our commitment to put our players first. The foundation of this commitment is delivering amazing and innovative new experiences for our players both from fan-favorite brands and new IP. Battlefield Hardline will be a fresh new direction in the Battlefield universe coming in Q4.","We\u2019re excited to deliver Star Wars Battlefront to fans next year, and in recent months, we have shown new projects in development from studios across EA. We continue to invest deeply in new experiences, both near term and long term.","Second, as we accelerate towards our digital future, we are transforming the way people play games. For the past several years, we have been developing EA's digital platform, the technology foundation that allows us to deliver live services for games like FIFA and Battlefield while building player relationships that can last for years, instead of days or weeks. That same foundation also enables new player-centric ways to discover and try new experiences, including EA Access and Origin's Great Game Guarantee, Game Time and On the House programs.","The digital transformation is unlocking new potential in platforms, content models, and modalities of play, and with our investments in technology and services, we feel well prepared to continue delivering new opportunities for our players. Third, the pursuit of our goals requires that we operate as one team that is faster, more focused, and constantly evolving. We are changing how we develop, engaging with players through alphas, betas and other programs to seek out more feedback.","We\u2019re changing the shape and skill set of our workforce, and combine the art of game making with the science of managing dynamic live services. We continue to increase our speed, while improving discipline in our operations. As an organization, we are learning, adapting, and evolving to not only be an innovative leader in gaming, but also to build meaningful long term relationships with our players.","After a dynamic and rewarding first year as CEO, I'm even more energized for the future of Electronic Arts and this great industry. Now Blake, Peter, Frank and I are here for your questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Edward Williams at BMO Capital Markets. Please limit your question to one question and one follow-up. Go ahead, your line is open.","Edward Williams \u2013 BMO Capital Markets","Just quickly if you guys could dive in a little bit on the digital adoption, Blake, you made the comment that there was a wide range in performance from game to game. But if you can give us a little bit more color as to how it is looking in the various games compared to prior cycles and if there is any key nuances from market to market?","Blake Jorgensen","I think clearly we are seeing more of it here in the US than internationally, just because, I think, of bandwidth speeds and the adoption of digital downloads, music and movies and others. We've tended to lead that. The interesting note is remember we had a fairly large SimCity game last year, and then The Sims game this year and so you're still seeing growth even though you had two PC titles back to back in those quarters.","So you\u2019ve got to assume that there is stronger movement on the console titles across the board. We are seeing that on both platforms, Xbox and Sony, and we are seeing it across all genres of the games we\u2019re having not just our most current games, but also some of our older games that are in the catalog.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Go ahead, your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Nick on for Stephen. Thanks for taking the question. With FIFA online still in beta testing in China with Tencent, is there any update on the timeline for when that actually goes live? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","We will probably see \u2013 it really depends on both the performance in beta and timing from \u2013 coming from Tencent, but it's most likely late in Q3 or early Q4, but results in the beta as Andrew mentioned, have been very, very exciting for us. It looks like a strong product and clearly that product has done extremely well in Korea and we hope to replicate a similar view in China. I do think, as we\u2019ve said in the past, it's probably six to 12 months before we really see momentum there and we have a long term view. The game of soccer in China is growing in popularity and we think that means real strength for the long run in that business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, your line is open.","Mike Olson \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Without giving anything away like competitively, can you provide some details on what the extra development time for Battlefield Hardline will result in or what kinds of things you guys are focusing on there? Then secondly, you had a strong growth for full game downloads in the quarter. Can you give us a general sense for what you expect the percentage of full game units that will be downloads versus packaged goods over the next several quarters will be?","Andrew Wilson","I will take the first part of the question, then pass to Peter to get the digital download piece. At a macro level, what we discovered as we went through the beta phases with Battlefield Hardline and play testing feedback and the various game shows that we showed it at was that the cops and criminals fantasy that was the foundation for the game resonated very, very strongly with not just existing fans, but new players to the Battlefield franchise.","But the feedback was also somewhat universal that we should go deeper with that fantasy and really deliver against that to a greater degree, and what we have done is given the development team that time to go back in and really look at how to truly deliver on that cops and criminals kind of gameplay as it exists in a Battlefield world.","Peter Moore","The second part of your question as Blake said, it varies from genre to geography, but right now with the increased adoption of Gen-4, we\u2019re seeing anywhere between 10% and 15% of our net sales through digital channels full game download and as we get into the holiday and beyond, we can only imagine that is going to increase. So we're pretty optimistic that that number will increase over the next few quarters as per your question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post of Bank of America. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Ryan Gee \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","This is Ryan Gee calling in for Justin. My question is on your R&D investments, encouraging to see that it continues to trend lower, curious to think if there is any point in this cycle where it should start to reverse and you start to actually reinvest in R&D. Then as a follow-up, what percent of your R&D or your development budgets right now are going towards new IP to leverage the new consoles versus existing franchises? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","I guess the most important thing to remember about R&D is that we are changing and reprioritizing all the time the things that we do. And so if you see movements up or down in R&D, that may mean that we've changed the priority in the development schedule, not that we are actually cutting back true R&D spending. We may have ended the cycle of development on one product and are waiting to start on the next cycle on another product. Be careful to let anyone quarter's movement of R&D up or down worry you about new IP development or get you locked into a lower R&D long term.","I think in general what we\u2019re trying to do is develop great IP that has live services connected to it, which extends the life of the gameplay, and that may mean over time that our R&D as a percentage of revenue comes down, but that's really driven by the fact that the revenue per product is going up dramatically over time as we're extending the life of those products. We are going to continue to prioritize the R&D across both our console products and our mobile products and our PC products, and you will see R&D spending slowly climb up in a dollar level over time, but most likely as a percentage of revenue continue to stay flat to come down.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Crum of Stifel. Go ahead, your line is open.","Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","Blake, as far as the revenue guidance is concerned, you beat the quarter by $80 million. You raised by $75 million. I see the $15 million FX detriment you are forecasting for the balance of the year. Are there any other puts or takes you can point to reconcile the updated revenue guidance you provided? Then as a follow-up, I noted a slowdown in mobile. It looked like it dropped sequentially. Is that just timing and do you still expect to grow mobile 20% or better in 2015? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","So I guess conservatism isn't a fair answer there, Drew. I think most important is the fact that we are going to ship Hardline the third week of March. That leaves Hardline as really just the first sell in into the channel in the US and in international markets.","We probably will get no replenishment that late in the year and a lot of the digital components of Hardline will fall into the coming year. So we are not overly aggressive, because of that decision, around the timetable. The second is \u2013 while we\u2019re very optimistic about our business, we're also trying to be very conservative in our forecasting and maintain our vigilance around driving the digital side of our business.","Today, it's still hard to forecast all of the digital trends and thus we are I think, defaulting towards the numbers that you are seeing. But we\u2019re very excited about both the third quarter slate and the fourth quarter slate and I think the reality is that we will tend to see longer service drawn out across products which will spread revenues out across the quarters unlike having it all grouped in the third quarter as we saw historically.","What was the second part of your question, Drew?","Drew Crum \u2013 Stifel Nicolaus","The second question was concerning mobile. I think you originally guided to 20% or better growth in fiscal 2015 and it looked like it slowed down sequentially. It actually declined from the first quarter and your second quarter. Just wonder if you're still confident you can grow mobile 20% or better this year.","Blake Jorgensen","I will let Frank answer it around the product, just one quick math item. Just remember that the premium side of our business, the paid downloads which are really a leftover from our original mobile business, they are still a drag on the overall growth. That drag has now gotten down to a fairly small number, but it dropped 62%. It's down to $10 million. When you look at mobile without that drag, it's up 35%.","Now quarter-over-quarter or sequential quarters, you got to be careful because we have products that ebb and flow in every quarter, but let me let Frank address some of the products and, most importantly, some of the new products we are seeing in mobile.","Frank Gibeau","Yes, I think Blake said it very well there that the premium services side of the business, which is where the future is and where we are focused, is growing 35% in that quarter and in that year. It was largely tied to a timing issue.","The products for sports came later in the quarter, and as you know freemium games don't have big pops initially like a packaged goods game. They tend to grow very nicely over time. If you look the individual products, we saw some very good results year over year on FIFA and on Madden.","Overall, you saw in the case of EA SPORTS a jump of over 250% in terms of the engagement metrics. So if you look at a year-over-year comp between titles, you are seeing a lot more effectiveness in terms of the services that we are running, much better focus on value and engagement for our customers, and as you look at the way that the rest of the SKU plan and title plan will unfold over the next period of time. We\u2019re very confident that those growth numbers will be possible.","We\u2019re very focused on that growth, but we want it to be oriented towards value and sustainability. So we\u2019re always looking at engagement as the primary metric there to make sure that the products and services that we are building really hit customer expectations and create services that can endure for multiple years like we have with The Simpsons and Sims FreePlay and Real Racing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company. Go ahead, your line is open.","Mike Hickey \u2013 The Benchmark Company","Just curious if you could talk a little bit to how you see the key drivers or what the key drivers for growth in fiscal 2016?","Andrew Wilson","I think that we have a tremendous new slate of titles that we are launching. We talk about Star Wars Battlefront as well as the rest of our sports portfolio that continues to grow. We have got the ongoing growth in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One console generation. We expect that will continue to be very healthy, Need for Speed will be back in a year with having had a full two-year development cycle the first time in its history. We expect that we will be able to continue to scale the live services and the ongoing engagement that we drive for our players.","So when you think about that at an IP level, at a platform level with console and mobile growth, and our live service growth, we feel like we have some strong levers to work with for FY '16.","Blake Jorgensen","I guess I would add to that the continued growth of FIFA Online 3 in Korea, China and FIFA around the world in general and mobile FIFA Ultimate Team, which has rolled out, as Frank mentioned, continue to contribute to the growth of the FIFA franchise, which we see as very important for us.","Mike Hickey \u2013 The Benchmark Company","Then just as a follow-up, can you speak to the future of your Titanfall franchise?","Andrew Wilson","We have announced that we have a continuing relationship for Titanfall, but we\u2019ve nothing more to announce at this time.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim O'Shea of Jefferies. Go ahead, your line is open.","Tim O'Shea \u2013 Jefferies","Just looking at that Star Wars license, I was wondering if you could articulate the strategy with respect to how many different AAA franchises we might expect to see over the life of that license. In addition to the Battlefront shooter, are you working on any other games in different genres? Any chance we could see something like an RPG, maybe even a reboot of BioWare's Knights Of The Old Republic? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Andrew Wilson","Again it's a great IP, a fantastic relationship and we certainly have plans to do a number of different things as part of that relationship that are going to deliver great ways to interact with that IP for players. At this time, we have announced Star Wars Battlefront, that is our focus and nothing more to announce at this time.","Blake Jorgensen","If you go back to the original announcement when we struck the deal with Disney, it's clearly a multi-year franchise. Disney is looking for us to help support the broad effort of bringing back the Star Wars franchise, and it's across mobile, social, tablets, online, consoles, across all venues. So you can imagine that we're going to look for many ways to leverage the franchise and help that franchise grow over time.","Tim O'Shea \u2013 Jefferies","Then just quickly, any color on that big jump in engagement for Madden? The 89 million games to-date, up 48% year over year. How big of a role does Ultimate Team play in terms of driving that engagement? It sounds like Ultimate Team is really working for you guys. Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","Yes, there are really two vectors created that jump in engagement. This year the team embarked on a journey to create a better onboarding flow for the game in general and get more people into the game and enjoying it than we have done before and then from that point of enjoyment, provide Ultimate Team as a way to engage and socially connect with their friends around the sport they love. And the combination of better onboarding and heightened social interaction are probably the two greatest drivers of increased engagement in Madden this year.","Blake Jorgensen","We saw this year for the first time that Madden, which normally stops gameplay after the Super Bowl \u2013 we rarely sell a lot of Madden after the Super Bowl and we can see on the servers that people aren't playing much. This year we saw Madden play, primarily due to Ultimate Team, all the way up until we shipped the new Madden. We saw big spikes around the draft in May and we continued to see gameplay even through the summer, as people were engaging with beauty of the Ultimate Team concept and the ability to engage with their friends as a way of continuing to stretch out that engagement.","Peter Moore","Just on that point, this is Peter, to Blake's point exactly, Ultimate Team for years has stretched out our engagement with FIFA all the way through to the next installment of the game. We haven't had that luxury with Madden, but in the last year and certainly our expectations for this year do exactly that. Post-Super Bowl, the numbers of engagement were superb and our retail partners were reporting strong catalog sales as a result of that. So we really feel now our NFL game feels like a 12 month a year service rather than a one-off game that is played three or four months a year.","Frank Gibeau","Just to add on, mobile Ultimate Team is really serving as the centerpiece for FIFA and Madden there and has driven the year-over-year gains in engagement and audience size. So, Ultimate Team works across multiple platforms and geos and has proven to be a great engine of growth for us.","Blake Jorgensen","And if you love defense you could play defense a lot better now than you could before on Madden.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Hardiman of Longbow Research. Go ahead, your line is open.","James Hardiman \u2013 Longbow Research","Maybe just give us a little bit more details, if you can, on EA Access. Do you think that having a positive impact on your annual sports titles? Are there any people that may have bought a title, but didn't after the demo period \u2013 any chance that gets picked up by Sony platforms or are those negotiations ongoing? And then I had a quick follow-up.","Peter Moore","That's exactly what is happening. We\u2019re seeing both empirical and anecdotal data that people now who are members of Access and of course, have access to games like FIFA and Madden, who've said that ordinarily they wouldn't have gone out and bought them, are now experiencing them and enjoying them and our belief is the next time around when the games are launched, they will actually buy them. It's turning into an incredible sampling program for us if you will, and obviously the value for money is there.","As regards the Sony question, nothing to talk about right now on that, but I will say that EA Access is surpassing all of our internal expectations with regard to subscriber numbers and it's delivering exactly what we thought which would be a great way for gamers to get great value and experience more games.","James Hardiman \u2013 Longbow Research","Peter, you talked about that digital mix on consoles of 10% to 15%. Just help me clarify. The last couple quarters, you had talked about similar numbers on the next-gen consoles. Is that 10% to 15% across consoles, in which case it seems like a pretty big increase? Is it just on next gen, in which case it seems like it is flattish despite some commentary that suggested that it might be growing?","Peter Moore","That's purely next gen. I'm referring purely to next gen what I talk about 10% to 15% and we are seeing that number grow. As Blake said in the outset, it varies by genre and it also varies by geography, depending on quite frankly, the quality of your Internet speed in downloading multi-gigabyte files. But we\u2019re seeing each quarter that goes by as we ship more games, we\u2019re seeing a steady increase in digital full game downloads.","Blake Jorgensen","I guess I would be careful with the number and trying to get a trend out of it. One, since it is just very new and, two, there is not that many titles out there. For us, we ship a lot of FIFA into Europe. If people are doing less full game downloads in Europe either because FIFA is a big title that a lot of retailers use to bring traffic into their stores or because Internet speeds are slow, be careful that you don't use that as a data point that implies that it's either flattened or not. We think the trend based on what we hear from consumers, as well as what we\u2019re seeing in our own product is continued direction toward full game download.","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Doshi of CRT Capital. Go ahead, your line is open.","Robert Goodman \u2013 CRT Capital","This is actually Robert on the call for Neil, just a couple questions. On Hardline, wondering just beyond what you are addressing with the game, what progress you\u2019re seeing on the development team and when we might be able to expect the second beta there? Then\u00a0also, if you could provide a little more color on some of the expenses that shifted out of 2Q and should go into 3Q both in terms of the scale and the specific investment areas. Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","With respect to the game, again, as I talked about earlier, a lot of what was happening was taking what was a really solid foundation for a game and really doing our best to deliver on the fantasy that was the cops and criminals gameplay mechanic. The team is going through in both single player and multi-player and done a lot to enhance that and make sure that comes to the forefront and delivers an experience that is interesting both to Battlefield fans and new players alike.","With respect to the team themselves; they have a great deal of passion around this. There is a lot of great people on that team and I'm energized every time I spend time with them and hear them talk about what they're doing and then see how they are delivering that at a gameplay level.","Blake Jorgensen","As far as expenses, what we have said is that some of the expenses associated with either product marketing or contracted services and as a reminder, we often use contracted services late in the development cycle for testing or debugging of a product \u2013 some of those expenses got pulled forward as we moved Battlefield Hardline forward and some of the marketing expenses got phased as well. Also, some phasing around the holidays as we want to make sure we're having great promotions around the holiday timeframe.","Then obviously some of it got put into our raise of guidance as a real savings to the quarter and we will try to be as transparent as possible going forward on what we think is phasing and what we don't and that's really the core pieces of that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Creutz of Cowen. Go ahead, your line is open.","Doug Creutz \u2013 Cowen","I was wondering if you could give a little color of people who are playing your Ultimate Team games on mobile, how many of them are also console players? Then I guess vice versa, how many of your console players are playing Ultimate Team on mobile? Is there more opportunities there to try to cross sell people who are in one experience to get them to also be in the other experience? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Doug, I thought you were going to ask about Madden. Let me let Frank answer the mobile question.","Frank Gibeau","It's something that we are tracking and watching. It's a little early right now honestly to give you a definitive answer because the game on mobile is out and it's so new. What we've found to date is that there is a very loyal following that will play Ultimate Team everywhere, but a lot of the mobile activity is incremental to what we have already established on consoles and on PCs, which is great news. So, it's something that we will track over time and report back on, but early stages are that most of it is incremental.","Andrew Wilson","And for a little bit more color there, part of our core strategy is to offer our biggest IP as unified and united experiences across platforms where people can play on one platform or many, but interact with a single community across the globe on those platforms. We believe that kind of social interaction and that engagement is the way forward for our industry.","Peter Moore","I'm reminded there is also the FUT web app, as we call it, which is a companion app that allows you to be able to manage your FIFA Ultimate Team via mobile, separate to the mobile game itself. But no matter where you are, 24 hours a day, you can manage that FIFA Ultimate Team mobiley.","Blake Jorgensen","I think one interesting thing we have watched as we roll out mobile in Korea alongside of FIFA Online 3; it has actually grown both businesses. It just increases the understanding of the Ultimate Team mechanic and the game itself, and we are doing our best, as Andrew mentioned, around onboarding to educate people about the excitement of Ultimate Team. There is still a lot of people that don't understand it.","They understand Fantasy Football. They understand playing or trading card mechanics, but they haven't seen how it works in a game, and so we are trying to do a better job of that onboarding, and we feel that across all platforms will help grow all platforms.","Operator","Our next question comes from Adam Krejcik of Eilers Research. Go ahead, your line is open.","Adam Krejcik \u2013 Eilers Research","First one is, have you guys disclose what percentage of your total non-GAAP revenues now come from Asia and where do you see this going in the next year or two? And then the second question is on mobile. It looks like your MAUs have been trending higher I think from 130 million, 140 million, now 155 million this most current quarter, but the smartphone and tablet revenues have been pretty stagnant or flat here. So are you actually seeing lower paying engagement in ARPU levels or is there something else going on? Additionally, how do you think about the CPI environment on mobile? It tends to be increasing quite a bit here. How do you guys view the mobile install landscape? Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","I will start with the Asia question and then I will let Frank to address the mobile questions. On Asia, we don't break out our revenues. It is obviously the smallest part of our international business. Europe is obviously very strong, primarily due to the strength of the console business there. Asia as far as console markets, really is \u2013 and Australia, New Zealand, Southeast Asia are really where the bulk of the console players is and Japan where the biggest markets, China and Korea, tend to be more PC, free to play and mobile.","Our strength there has been partnering with third parties \u2013 Nexon in the case of Korea for FIFA Online 3 and Tencent in China. So we\u2019re in early days there, but we see a huge opportunity, particularly to play off of some of our strong IP, not just FIFA, but games like Need for Speed. Our Plants vs. Zombies franchise is very popular in China and you'll see us focusing on both mobile and free-to-play games in those marketplaces through partnerships or through iOS and Android distribution over the coming years.","Frank Gibeau","Let me take a couple of your questions in line here. As you noted, yes, MAUs have had a very nice growth trend, hitting 155 million in the last quarter in terms of monthly active users. If you parse out what Blake had called out earlier, the freemium revenues within that overall mix are actually up 35%, so MU growth and freemium revenue growth are both doing nicely. We\u2019ve a lot more to do. We are proud of what we have done, but we know we can do better, but that's how I would start to think about how those two are trending.","We still have a bit of this overhang of getting past the premium side of the business, which should be in the rearview mirror pretty soon here. As it relates to your argument about \u2013 or your question about CPI, one of the competitive advantages we have at Electronic Arts is we have this incredible diversity and portfolio of brands that have huge audiences out there, and we are able to organically attract people into those brands and into our network much more efficiently than a lot of other mobile gaming companies out there.","So as the cost of install or the cost to acquire continues to rise, we have a bit of an unfair advantage in that our brands naturally attract and as well, we\u2019ve a network that is very large in size. Last year, we installed over 635 million games, that generates an audience that we can reach out and touch very effectively and communicate with as they increase their engagement in our games.","So if we can keep them in our network, that compounds the advantage that we have in organic acquisition. Those would be two of our offsets in a rapidly growing CPI world that other mobile game companies don't have and we're going to maximize those leverages. That leverage, by investing more in our network to provide more engagement opportunities and more value to our customers, at the same time as we release more of these branded hits like FIFA and SimCity BuildIt.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks all for joining us and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

My name is Jennifer, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Call. Thank you. Mr. Chris Evenden, Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thank you, Jennifer. Welcome to EA's second quarter fiscal 2018 earnings call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO, and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model and a transcript.","With regards to our calendar, Blake will be speaking at the UBS conference in San Francisco on Monday, November 13; the Credit Suisse conference in Scottsdale on Tuesday, November 28; and the NASDAQ conference in London on Tuesday, December 5. Our Q3 fiscal 2018 earnings call is scheduled for Thursday, January 25, 2018.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company.

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","We have changed the name of our net sales operating metric to net bookings. This came up in a recent discussion with the SEC as part of their ordinary course periodic review of our filings. We also believe that this change will enable our industry to better align on terminology. We have not changed how it is calculated.","Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. It was a strong second quarter for Electronic Arts. Excellent launches for our EA SPORTS titles and growth in our event-driven live services across all major platforms continued our momentum for the fiscal year-to-date. Revenue and earnings were above our guidance, highlighted by continuing digital growth and strong ongoing execution to deliver for our players around the world.","The impact of the digital transformation is accelerating across the interactive entertainment industry. Players today are looking for more choice, more content and more fun in experiences that continually evolve with the way they want to play.","Capturing these opportunities is at the core of EA's strategy, creating extraordinary new games, content and experiences, wrapped in services, accessed through more platforms and more business models and powered by innovative technologies. These are the key growth drivers that uniquely position EA to lead this industry.","EA's Q2 results reflected our focus on these growth areas. Our new EA SPORTS titles drove more downloads and deep engagement, our mobile portfolio continues to strengthen and our event-driven live services continue to deliver the experiences our players want.","Beginning with EA SPORTS and Madden NFL 18, players are loving the combination of an emotional story mode, greater depth and more competition. We had 25% more players engaged in Madden Ultimate Team through Q2 year-over-year. And our competitive gaming player base has grown by over 30% in the same period.","FIFA 18 launched in late September, reaching players across more than 50 countries and igniting the global soccer community. The depth and precision of the Frostbite-driven gameplay are just the beginning for FIFA 18, with much more to come as programs like Squad Battles, FUT ICONS and Ones to Watch are already driving strong FIFA Ultimate Team engagement.","NBA LIVE 18 was a strong reentry into the market and continues to captivate a growing base of NBA fans. And with NHL 18, the new NHL THREES mode helped us reach an entirely new audience, with 60% more first-time EA players joining through Q2 over the previous game.","This quarter was an outstanding demonstration of the ongoing opportunity for our EA SPORTS franchises to drive growth through expanded reach, new experiences and more competition.","On mobile, our portfolio of deep, high quality and long-term experiences continues to strengthen in an increasingly competitive market. In Q2, Madden NFL Mobile saw unique players grow significantly year-over-year, as we kicked off a new season in the game.","In-game events in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes throughout the quarter continued to drive high levels of engagement across the community. Both of these games charted in the top 10 grossing games on the App Store and Google Play dozens of times throughout the quarter. In addition, FIFA Mobile topped 113 million players live to-date. And fans are anticipating our annual update to that game that comes in Q3.","Our communities are expanding. Our players are deeply engaged, and our strategy to deliver a portfolio of mobile games that players love to spend time with is showing its strength.","Across our portfolio, event-driven live services are enhancing the experience for players, keeping them together with friends, extending the fun and giving them choice in how they want to play. The global Battlefield community has tens of millions of unique players continuing to connect and play with their friends across different games in the franchise.","In The Sims 4, monthly average players are up more than 40% year-over-year and anticipation is high for the console game launching in Q3.","As these communities and many others in our top franchises continue to thrive, our subscription services like EA Access and Origin Access are bringing more players from across our network to join in. Our subscription player base continues to grow. And you should expect us to continue driving this model to more platforms going forward.","We are now well-positioned for the holiday quarter. We will add the momentum with two massive new experiences, a new event-driven live service and more competition.","First is Need for Speed Payback, launching on November 10. An all-new story drives this experience with a narrative, characters and explosive moments that will excite a broad audience of players. Combined with deep customization, a huge open world and a rich multiplayer experience, this is one of the biggest Need for Speed games ever created. Trailer views are up more than 100% over the previous title. And the community is excited to jump into this new Need for Speed.","On November 17, Star Wars Battlefront II will launch worldwide. This is a game that is nearly three times the size of the previous Battlefront, delivering an untold Star Wars story in our single-player campaign, multiplayer battles and dozens of ships, settings and heroes from all three Star Wars eras.","As you'll remember, there is no Season Pass for Star Wars Battlefront II. Instead our event-driven live service will be free for all players, delivering new environments, new heroes, in-game events and more to everyone in the community. This new ecosystem as post-launch content is built around player choice and designed to keep the community together and extend the experience for many years to come.","As we run the live service, we will continually work with our player community to ensure the player experience remains rich and balanced. This began with a beta in early October, where millions of players got their first taste of 20 v 20 multiplayer, enabling us to learn a great deal and make some key adjustments to balance and progression. Now our sights are set on launch and delivering a Star Wars game like none other in scale, depth and service to fans around the world.","Competitive gaming will continue to grow in our portfolio in Q3, with more ways to play and watch. As you may have seen, the Madden NFL Club Championship is the first esports competition to feature a full roster of teams and players from a U.S. professional sports league. And tournaments to represent all 32 NFL teams are already underway.","We have also launched a Madden Ultimate League for elite players, further expanding the Madden NFL competitive footprint for players, sponsors and broadcasters.","On the FIFA side, we just announced the EA SPORTS FIFA Global Series that kicks off in November, our landmark ecosystem of online tournaments, official league competitions, and an all-star event on the road to the FIFA eWorld Cup 2018. And this spring, we will kick off competitions in our third major franchise with Battlefield 1 Incursions, a bespoke competitive gaming environment designed in partnership with our community. We're excited for the holiday quarter and to continue a strong year of innovation and leadership for our players and for Electronic Arts.","Now I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew. We're pleased with the performance of our business through the second quarter, which added strong digital growth to the dependable results we expect from our sports titles. In particular, we saw a notable shift to digital purchases in our sports titles, and strong growth in our Ultimate Team of event-driven live services.","I'll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.","EA's net revenue was $959 million compared to $898 million a year ago and above our guidance by $4 million. Operating expenses were $611 million, $27 million lower than our guidance, driven by the phasing of our marketing investment.","GAAP operating loss was $41 million compared to an operating loss of $49 million a year ago and resulted in a loss per share of $0.07, $0.11 better than our guidance. Note that given our GAAP share results were a loss, our share count was 309 million shares. Had we reported a profit, the diluted share count would have been 312 million shares.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $52 million, down $70 million from last year. The decrease was driven by timing of collections. In contrast, operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $1.082 billion, our strongest ever performance measured at the end of a second quarter, and $479 million above last year's.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $30 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $22 million. Remember that the FASB rules associated regarding the treatment of stock-based comp have changed and this affects how we classify our cash flow. However, all these comparisons are made on a like-for-like basis. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.","During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.3 million shares at a cost of $153 million, leaving $928 million in our two-year $1.2 billion buyback program we began in May. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.4 billion, with 35% of this balance held onshore.","Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $1.179 billion, up $81 million on the prior year and $19 million above our guidance. Exchange rates have improved over the last 12 months, but this tailwind is offset by the effect of our hedging program, resulting in a net FX headwind of $10 million compared to the year-ago quarter. Performance over guidance was primarily driven by our mobile live services, The Sims 4 and by Ultimate Team.","Digital net bookings were $579 million, up 19% on the year ago period and a new record for the second quarter. The main drivers of the increase were Battlefield 1, Ultimate Team and Madden NFL 18 full game downloads. Digital net bookings now represent 63% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, compared to 57% in the prior year.","Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net bookings in turn. First, live service net bookings were up 22% year-on-year to $310 million. This increase was driven by strong growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Team and in Battlefield 1, FIFA Online 3 in Asia and The Sims 4. In addition, our EA Access and Origin Access services continue to see rapid growth.","Mobile delivered net bookings of $150 million, up 9% year-on-year. This was a Q2 record and also drove the trailing 12-month net bookings to a new high. Growth was primarily from Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes and Madden Mobile.","Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $119 million, 28% higher than last year, driven by Madden NFL and Battlefield 1. 36% of our unit sales were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to just 30% a year ago.","FIFA 18 launched just days before the end of the quarter, but based on the first three weeks of sales, it was about 25% digital, up from 16% in the comparable period to FIFA 17. The digital portion of Madden sales also increased 9 percentage points year-on-year to 34%.","Turning to guidance. Our expectations for full year GAAP revenue remains $5.075 billion. However, we're raising our earnings per share guidance for the full year to $3.63. We're raising our operating cash flow guidance from $1.575 billion to $1.6 billion.","We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $120 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.48 billion. Although our expectations for net revenue are unchanged, we are raising our guidance for net bookings from $5.1 billion to $5.15 billion, driven by the strength in Ultimate Team. The difference between GAAP net revenue and net bookings guidance is driven by revenue deferrals.","For the third quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.135 billion, cost of revenue to be $521 million and operating expenses to be $690 million. OpEx is up year-on-year primarily due to continued investment in existing and new genres and in existing and new live services. This results in a loss per share of $0.21 for the third quarter. Note that this is calculated using the basic share count of 309 million. Should we report a profit, the diluted share count of 313 million will be used.","We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $2 billion. This is down 3% year-on-year with growth in live services offset by the effect of different product launches. Looking further ahead, our growth priorities continue to be the expansion of our live services, including the integration of our esports business across many other titles, the addition of new genres such as action, new business models like our subscription business and to continue to deliver profitable growth in our mobile business.","The core of our fiscal 2019 is in a full slate of sports titles and their associated live services, plus new live services from Star Wars Battlefront II. We will add the next Battlefield game and moved into the action genre with Anthem. We expect our subscriber base to continue to grow and our new mobile titles to benefit from players looking for deeper experiences with higher production values.","As you start to build your fiscal 2019 models, remember that our event-driven live services continue to be the bedrock of our business. Live services, including mobile live services, were nearly half of our next bookings over the last 12 months. Including our recurring sports titles and catalog sales in the calculation takes us to a total of over 75% of our annual net bookings, leaving less than a quarter of net bookings delivered through the sale of our remaining frontline titles.","In addition, our live services are growing strongly. We forecast 10% to 15% growth in fiscal 2018 and we're tracking well ahead of that. We're excited by the progress we're making and the impact it will have on fiscal 2019, particularly given the success we are already seeing in esports driving Ultimate Team revenues and next year's FIFA World Cup in Russia, which is sure to drive interest in soccer around the globe.","In conclusion, our sports titles have once again shown their value in delivering a stable and dependable performance. In addition, this quarter demonstrates how they can also drive the digital transformation within our business, both with regards to downloads and to highly enjoyable event-driven live services. As such, they offer a window into how all our games will evolve over the months and years to come.","Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Blake. Today we reach a global connected community of more than 350 million players worldwide. In the future, we envision a global network that engages more than 1 billion people in play. Our path to achieve this is clear, continue to deliver amazing games and content across more platforms, offer dynamic services that enhance the experience, engage a global audience through competition and more content and drive disruptive new opportunities to expand how the world plays and watches games. In each of these growth vectors, EA is uniquely positioned with the talented teams, creativity and technology to lead our industry.","Creating groundbreaking experiences for our players across more platforms and more geographies continues to be at our core. From visually stunning, deeply immersive games like Star Wars Battlefront II and our next Battlefield to ongoing innovation in our EA SPORTS titles, we're advancing the state of the art. We will continue to expand our mobile portfolio with more high quality experiences and games that can reach a larger audience of players around the world.","We're also producing experiences that will blur the lines of how our people play, like our shared-world action titled Anthem, and our new IP in development at Motive. Through this growing portfolio of games that push the boundaries forward, we are positioned to offer some of the most captivating experiences in all of entertainment.","Surrounding these games are services that power the choice, connection and community that our players seek. Event-driven live service like Ultimate Team, Star Wars Battlefront II seasons and our EA SPORTS mobile titles continue to enhance and expand our games for many years of play. Our global communities for The Sims and other franchises thrive on the connections, interactions and creations shared between players. And for players seeking new community and the next great experience, our subscription services will continue to expand and remove friction in a crowded digital world.","Competitive gaming and esports then introduce more opportunities for the world to engage with our games and content. Today, our Madden NFL and FIFA tournaments are elevating competitive sports gaming to the world stage with the energy and drama of high-stakes competition. Next, official competitions will ignite our Battlefield community. Competitive gaming will integrate into more of our expenses and more of our franchises in the future, continuing our focus to make stars of all our players and expanding our ecosystem of content to engage the massive esports audience.","We're also building for the future, continuing to invest in our technology platform, our Frostbite engine and our Player Network to deliver this growing collection of content wrapped in services. Our labs and central technology teams are also exploring disruptive new concepts to advance the way we play, including super games, the notion of a metaverse and how the cloud can deliver dynamic experiences to players on every platform.","At EA, we believe that entertainment is a fundamental human need. We also believe that games, by their ability to drive social connection, self-actualization and competition, are the single best form of entertainment. With amazing games that reach across more platforms, more geographies and more business models, with live services that provide many years of fun, with competitions that engage a global audience, and disruptive innovations that will continue to evolve the way we play, we believe EA is well positioned to be the entertainment platform of the future.","Now Blake and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher D. Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right, great. Thank you. I just had a couple. So for digital downloads, I think you called out year-on-year changes for FIFA and Madden in excess of 5 points year-on-year, which I think has been a long-term guidance for mix shift in console revenue. Do you feel like we're reaching any sort of inflection in digital downloads? And is 5 points per year still the right way to think about that shift over time?","And then just secondly, for Star Wars Battlefront, I was hoping if you can maybe talk a little bit more about how the beta went? What type of feedback you got from the community during that process? And maybe any changes that you've made to the in-game monetization mechanics since the beta? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Hey, Chris, this is Blake. I'll address the digital download piece, then I'll have Andrew do the Star Wars piece.","We were very pleased and a bit surprised at the strength of digital downloads, both for FIFA and Madden. FIFA, in particular, since it's such a global game and sold in many markets where digital is not as strong as it is in some of the more mature markets. So it's great to see the movement towards digital. And we attribute that to some digital-only promotions that we did, some special digital packages, as well as the continued involvement of everyone with Ultimate Team, which is 100% digital, and I think that's driving the adoption.","Overall, we're continuing to see the 5% number look conservative. It did last year. And it's on track to look conservative again this year. So to us, that signals that we're certainly not slowing in digital. And we might be meeting a inflection point where our consumers are starting to just pick up that pace.","So we're very optimistic about where it's going. You clearly can see that in the gross margin differences as you look at our business year-over-year. And we'll continue to do everything we can to push the digital business.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So Star Wars Battlefront II, feedback from the beta and the added assets that we've put in the marketplace have been very strong. Feedback on gameplay was very positive. The beta was very robust and probably one of the most stable betas that we've had. And again, the core reason why we put betas into the marketplace is really to test the robustness of the infrastructure and systems on which a game of this size and magnitude will run on.","As we've looked at the feedback on the graphical quality, the overall gameplay and assets around single player that we've launched since then, everything is very, very positive.","There was of course the conversation around loot boxes, which is not a Star Wars Battlefront II specific conversation, but more one that the industry is having with players across the global community. And we are engaged in that conversation, engaging with our players on a daily basis as we think about that.","There's really two conversations going on there. One is about value. And in a world where a player pays $60 for a game, will there also be value in the ongoing digital ecosystem that comes for many years? When we think about value, we look at Star Wars Battlefront II and we say, we start with a game that's nearly three times the size of the last game. We take what much of the content that would've been gated behind a Season Pass, and we offer that to the community for free. So we feel very good about the overall value proposition focused on keeping the player community together.","Then as we think about players that are playing the game for many years post-launch and the digital ecosystem and the event-driven live services that they participate in, it comes down to the second conversation, which is, does the digital ecosystem offer the opportunity for an individual player in the community to pay to win?","And balance and fairness inside of gameplay is very important to our community. And it's very important to us. And it's kind of a benchmark by which DICE builds games. And we have seen that in the many DICE games, multi-player games we've built over the years.","When we think about this, it really comes down to what are the things that you can earn, what are the things that you can buy, and how do we manage progression through that process? And while we will be making adjustments based on feedback from the beta, which is great, and we'll continue a daily dialogue with our players to make ongoing adjustments for many years to come, as this event-driven live service continues, we feel very good about the fact that you can earn almost everything in the game.","And more importantly, key elements that drive progression can only be earned in the game. But there will be an opportunity for players who come in to also enhance and extend their experience through the ongoing digital economy.","And we believe that what we've got with a core base game that's three times the size, what would have previously been gated behind Season Pass is now free for all users, with a focus on keeping a community together, and an event-driven live service that we expect will continue for many years to come that is built around player choice and focuses around a world where players can earn everything they need to progress through the game, is the right way to balance this.","And so we feel very good about that. And we'll stay connected with our community as we move through the coming weeks, months and years.","Christopher D. Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. Appreciate the commentary around the number of Ultimate Team players in Madden. I was curious as to hear about increases in payer penetration across FIFA Ultimate Team and Madden, and kind of what has worked to kind of bring on more players that start paying. And what do you think are the biggest hurdles or points of friction you still need to overcome?","And secondly, just any comments or kind of like commentary on what went on around Visceral Games? And the state of the live action creation portfolio right now?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","All right. This is Blake, again. I'll start on the Ultimate Team one, and then Andrew can address Visceral. Ultimate Team, the number one driver continues to be bringing more people into the base game. And we believe the single player added to Madden this year as well as the single player last year and this year in FIFA were big drivers in bringing people in and introducing them to how to play the game as well as how to play Ultimate Team.","And we found the flow of people starting to play Ultimate Team has continued to grow and then people who realize that spending some money in Ultimate Team is actually a lot of fun, and that continued to grow. And overall, that's been across all of the Ultimate Team sports but it's been most prevalent in both FIFA and Madden.","I think the other thing to remember is we're getting better and better each year at the live events that we design and run, and those events are more and more fun and bring in more people. And that, plus the fact that we build all of our esports around Ultimate Team has allowed us to continue to drive the business, as everyone who is interested in esports and playing in an esports tournament, either online or in person, has to practice as well and build their Ultimate Team for the esports business and that's what helped drive it as well.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So on Visceral, again, anytime you close a studio, it's a very, very tough decision and something that we take very seriously and we spend a lot of time working through before we make such a decision. But it does happen from time to time as part of the creative process. And during the development process of the game that they were working on, we've been testing the game content with players, listening to their feedback in terms of what and how they wanted to play and really tracking that closely with fundamental shifts in the marketplace and we are seeing an evolution in the marketplace. And it became clear to us that to deliver the experience that players wanted to come back and enjoy for a long time, that we needed to pivot the design.","You may have heard the conversation around single player versus multiplayer or single player versus live service and this wasn't about that conversation. It wasn't about this was just a single-player game or it needed to be a live service, it was more about how do we get to a point where the overall gameplay experience was right for players. We still believe strongly in a Star Wars IP, Star Wars Battlefront II as you will have heard we're very excited about. We're also very happy with some of the assets and content that was created as part of that game development and we'll be looking at how we can better utilize that in line with fan and player expectations in the future.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks. So, I think Blake, you previously talked about the cross-currents in your mobile business and how your older games like The Simpsons are no longer really growing as rapidly but the newer games like Galaxy of Heroes are. So can you talk about where we are in terms of that mix shift between old and new? It seems like your mobile revenue growth has accelerated for the second quarter in a row, which makes me think that the older games must now be less than 50% of the total and shrinking in terms of the overall contribution.","And also Andrew, can you update us on what the plans are for the launch of the new mobile version of The Sims? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah, so I'll talk about the first part and then I'll let Andrew get the The Sims piece. Clearly, The Sims is an exciting addition to the mobile business and for us and we'll see that some time in the coming spring. We also have some unannounced titles that we're working on and so you'll see those. I think all of those will help drive the growth over the next few years, if not longer.","A couple of things, I mean, yes the drag from some of the older titles have slowed, but the reality is some of those titles have just stayed around for a long time because they still do great business for us. The key to our mobile business, and I think different than some other people in the industry is, we drive our business just like our console and PC business to be profitable. So we hold up high standards on profitability. We invest around marketing expenses, around a profitable model, so we don't simply try to build the mobile business in an unprofitable way like we've seen some of the people do in this market. And that's something that's not going to change.","And we're not going to try to drive top line growth simply with zero profitability. That doesn't do anything for the shareholders. And so you'll see us continue to have steady growth. We've got great products coming down the path in the future. We're very excited about The Sims. I'll let Andrew talk about that.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So The Sims is going really well. It is still in soft launch and we're receiving valuable feedback on the game and incorporating adjustments both in terms of kind of a core engagement profile in the game as well as how the game monetizes over time. The Sims are a very valuable brand for us, and a very variable IP. And it's a genre in which we are essentially unchallenged on any platform for that matter.","And so, we want to make sure that we get it right with our community and we're seeing very strong uptick in the kind of metrics that we need, and we expect to launch it in the spring. And the good news for us, given the strength of The Sims brand, we still have The Sims FreePlay which is doing really well for us on mobile.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And just since we're on The Sims, I'll just throw in one more, is that as you can see or hear from the prepared text, we mentioned The Sims a couple of times, The Sims 4 as a major driver in the growth in the quarter. We're continue to be very pleased with how The Sims 4 and all the extra content has performed and we're very excited about the Sims 4 console version that will be out later this quarter. And I think that bodes well for the overall Sims franchise both in console, PC, or all, console, PC and mobile.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Gee with Barclays.","Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. The first one is on mobile. The acceleration and the pickup in mobile revenues that you saw this quarter, it's a nice positive and glad to see that that's driven by in-app purchases. Have you guys considered the potential for mobile advertising in any of your games whether it is The Sims or other sports titles? And then, if that is a meaningful contributor to your business today, could you help us quantify or think about that opportunity going forward?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah.","Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then the second question is for Blake on guidance. It sounds like with the sports full game downloads doing much better and the mobile business accelerating, then as you guys said, live services is certainly tracking ahead of your outlook, you should really see some strong digital revenue mix benefiting margins going forward, and I'm not sure that that is really as apparent in the guidance. So it makes sense that Star Wars is a gross margin headwind for next quarter, but is there anything specific or unique about fiscal 3Q this year that's going to drive any sort of op margin deleverage that we should keep in mind? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Okay, so first on mobile. We've been doing advertising in some of our mobile games for a long time, many years. And that total advertising number is under $100 million. It is a good business. We operate on a simple principle, which we will not do other mobile game advertising outside of our own games. That is different than what other companies do. Our goal is to keep people inside our network of mobile games. And so if we're going to do mobile game advertising, we would do that simply to steer people to other games inside our network, and that's not going to be advertising dollars for us. It just minimizes our outside marketing costs.","But we do do some mobile games. We have some games that we don't do advertising in, and we're continuing to look at opportunities to grow that. But the biggest challenge is most people play mobile games anonymously and anonymous advertising is at very low CPMs versus very structured advertising that you might see out of a Google or a Facebook, where they have strong intent information on the consumer. There maybe some data that we can build that. We're thinking about it in a lot of ways. But right now it's still at a fairly base level.","On the guidance, a couple of things to just look at. One is I encourage people to go back and look over the last five years. I think coming out of Q2, we've always been fairly conservative on our guidance going into our largest quarter of the year, Q3. And I don't think we've had any different behavior in how we've given guidance over those last periods of time. And so I don't think there's any messaging whatsoever. I think raising our guidance by $0.10 on the bottom line is a pretty powerful raise and $50 million on the top line. And I think it's consistent with how we've operated historically and signals the positive view we have on the back half of the year.","And the split between Q2 and Q3, I challenge you guys on the phone to start doing your models a little more finely and listening to us a little closer on what we tell people. We phase our revenue for you every quarter, and I think we're getting much more \u2013 we have a much better ability to predict our revenue because of the large component of live services. And so we're probably going to be better at our guidance over time. So I'd just keep that challenge there to you. Next question.","Operator","Your next question is from Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. First, for Blake. Q3, can you go through the puts and takes on the 3% decline in revenues? I know you had two big titles last year, one big one and one maybe medium one this year. Talk about maybe your expectations for Battlefront versus Battlefield.","And then Andrew, World Cup is obviously next year. You've launch FIFA. Are you thinking about that as a live services event? And how will you capture incremental users and maybe dollars around the World Cup? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah, Justin. I think most people know that Battlefront, or excuse me, Battlefield 1 last year was a smash success for us and we had a huge Q3 because of that. We also had Titanfall, which while it didn't meet our original expectation, still sold very well. And so with Star Wars Battlefront II and Need for Speed and Sims 4 console, you just can't comp against the strength of Battlefield 1 last year. It's obviously a big quarter for us. Guiding net bookings to $2 billion is huge and the fact that it's only down 3% year-on-year with the strength of Battlefield 1 last year, I think is a huge positive.","And live services obviously continue to grow. We're seeing strength across the board there. But we still have some unknowns. We don't yet know how the Battlefront II live service will monetize. We'll find that out over the next quarter. We'll be able to give people a better sense of that in Q4 or Q3 when we talk. But that's part of the unknown. And The Sims 4 on console, while people are very excited about it, we'll just need to see how well that sells. So those are probably the unknowns in the mix versus last year as well as the scale differences.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","On World Cup, we don't have any news to announce right now, but EA SPORTS, we have a long tradition of celebrating the World Cup and bringing it to life for fans, stretching back to really the World Cup 1998. So as it gets closer, the world's largest sporting event, we'll announce more details on how we'll continue this tradition.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question is from Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question, maybe two. One, going back to the digital commentary from before, I wanted to understand, normally in the December quarter, you see a little bit of a mix shift back sometimes to packaged goods with gifting around the holidays. Do you think we've seen the type of tipping point where digital penetration might power through some of the seasonality we've seen around packaged goods over the last couple years? That's number one.","And then number two, just coming back to the mobile business, I want to understand a little bit of the mix of how you think about allocating marketing dollars there between user growth versus driving more in-game monetization, just to understand a little bit how you frame ROI on the marketing spend in the mobile business? Thanks guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So Eric, I'll address the packaged mix and then Andrew can address the mobile piece. So on packaged mix, obviously Christmas or the holidays is always going to skew towards more physical. People want to have a gift to give someone. But we do know that while Star Wars Battlefront I skewed more heavily than we typically see, we think Battlefront II may not skew quite as much, because the breadth of the game.","It addresses some of the interests that the hardcore players wanted. It's got more. It's got space battles. Many of the things that the hardcore and the traditional first-person shooter audience played were not as strong in the first Battlefront, where this there's more of it. So we might see a skew that helps bring that up a little bit, but we don't know for certain yet. We do know there were a lot of people that were both hardcore and the younger audience playing in the beta, so our sense is that we could see a slight skew. We haven't assumed a big number, skew difference in our guidance, but our hope is, is that could ultimately help the margins a little bit in the quarter.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So in terms of mobile marketing, we've got a very finely tuned model that the teams are constantly updating to ensure, as Blake talked about earlier, we maintain the level of profitability that we believe is appropriate for our mobile business and continue to drive that business profitably. And so when we think about it, most of our programmatic digital spending is around acquisition. But that's done with a profitability metric in mind, and done in a world where we're trying to attract the right cohort of people who ultimately will monetize and drive ongoing profitability.","We work on a more conservative approach than some people in the marketplace do. Our lifetime value model operates over a shorter time span than some people in the marketplace. And we do that simply because we believe it's better balanced to drive short-term, medium-term and long-term profitable growth of our overall portfolio of titles.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I think the other thing to remember is we're trying to build a mobile game that has deep and long engagement. If you look at Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, we know that people play for a long time and they play almost every day. And it's driven by the events that we put into the game every few weeks.","That's the key to the game model versus a model in which you have to feed the beast all the time with new people to keep the core users engaged. These are games that are really built around a much more engaging loop that people could play over a long period of time.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question is from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, good afternoon. I had two questions. First, Blake, I hate to pin you down, but would you be willing to share how many units you're assuming for Star Wars Battlefront II in fiscal 2018? Is that still 14 million, I think, was the previous number? And then second...","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Go ahead. Sorry.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","No, go ahead.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I was just going to say, let me try to answer it. And then I'll let you say or ask your next question and even a third question, if you want.","So we're giving guidance on units once a year at the start of the year to help people size things. We're finding units are becoming less and less meaningful to us, because obviously there's a difference between a digital unit and a physical unit. Obviously, we've been surprised on the growth of digital units. And it's all about the live service at the end of the day as well.","And so assume that any change in our unit guidance for any game, including Battlefront II, is built into our annual or quarterly guidance changes that we've put in place. And so focus on the revenue guidance and not unit guidance.","So now let me let you ask your next question. And I'll stay quiet until I hear it.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","All right. Sounds good. So you've had a lot of success with digital add-on content. But there are other areas that could have a significant impact on the business in the coming years, like continued growth of full-game download mix, subscription, streaming games from the cloud. Which of those opportunities are long-term drivers that you're most focused on? Or maybe there's some others I didn't mention. Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I would say all of the above. Clearly, all of those are important to us. We're actively working on the extra content piece. You can see that in the numbers that we've put up over the last few years. And where, as Andrew talked about in the call and in his question-and-answer component around Star Wars, we spent a lot of time trying to build out a live service model for Star Wars Battlefront. And we'll see how that plays out.","And you can imagine we're thinking and working on live service models on many of our other games. It's critical, because that's how the consumer wants to play the games. And that's why we're driving them that way.","Subscription obviously is very important to us. We've been doing a lot of work on Origin Access and EA Access. And as Andrew mentioned, you'll most likely see those on other platforms. And you'll most likely see additional content coming into those subscriptions and some exciting things to come there. But we believe that's a very important way for more consumers to enjoy more games over time at a very reasonable price.","And then streaming, ultimately there's a lot of opportunity there. It may be a few years down the road still. But that, plus things like subscription or live services, go together very well. And you can imagine that we are spending a great amount of time, both in our technology world and in our games development on how games would operate in that kind of an environment.","So more to come on all that. But I think all of those together, plus the base business that we have today, bodes extremely well for our business and the industry in general. But we're very focused on how do we evolve this model over time to be as profitable as possible and as consistent and repeatable as possible. We think that's what investors want. And we think that delivers the best game services to the consumer.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And one addition there as we think about long-term drivers, just a little extra context as we think about this. You may have heard me say before, one of the greatest disruptions in the consumption of entertainment media in the last five years has been the combination of streaming plus subscription, and that we are thinking very seriously about that.","You're seeing us do work in subscription and you've heard us talk about the work that we're doing at a technology level around the infrastructure and services that we would need to facilitate a subscription around games.","And the one thing that's often lost when we have this conversation is that unlike linear media, the subscription fee paid is not the total value of what a player might expend as they enjoy the games they play inside of subscription.","Because of our live service offerings, the subscription really is about onboarding a large community globally of committed, connected players, who not only play the games in the subscription, but also participate in the live services.","And so we believe long term, while it may take us some years to facilitate that at the kind of scale that we expect it to evolve to, in the same way that digital music and digital movies have evolved, the upside for the interactive entertainment industry is uncapped by virtue of the value of live services that are born inside of a subscription.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks a lot.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. So looking at FIFA Mobile, 113 million users, a very big number. Just wondering if you could talk where that game stands today in terms of monetization? And what's the timeline going forward for when it could become a real contributor? And I think on console, FIFA's roughly triple the size of Madden. Would that conceivably hold true on mobile as well?","And then can you just discuss \u2013 second, can you discuss the launch plan to support Battlefront II? Just wondering what we should expect in terms of marketing? Whether you should get any boost from around the movie marketing? And then whether there's any plan to discount the game to drive unit sales.","And then finally, just a quick one for Blake, it's a follow-up to Mike's question, just wondering if you would share how much Battlefront live services revenue is embedded in guidance? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Okay. There was a lot there. Let me try and start. So FIFA Mobile, you started with 113 million users, how do we think about that with respect to Madden. What you heard from us in the prepared remarks is that Madden NFL, in its third season, continues to go from strength to strength. The reality is, is that we had had a couple of false starts on Madden even before the first season in the current iteration of that franchise on mobile. But in its current iteration, it's spent a great deal of time in the top 10 through Q2, and I think was number one on a number of days also. So very, very strong. And we're really starting to understand how to truly support and entertain a community of Madden players on mobile.","FIFA, in a few weeks will launch, again on mobile, for its second season. And you might remember that when we launched FIFA last year, we knew that even though it followed a similar mechanic and a similar design construct to Madden, that given the global community and the nuances that exist around football or soccer globally, that we believe it was going to take sometime to tune. This is a long-term play for us. Football or soccer is the biggest sport in the world. Mobile has more players than any other platform in the world.","And we believe that this is truly a global opportunity and as we think about this in the West and the East, we are committed to this for the long term. We expect that we will see monetization grow in the coming year, but even if it took us three seasons in the same way it has with Madden, that would still become completely fine for us, because we are growing it profitably and soccer is not getting any less popular on a global basis.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And I think to the point on triple the size, I'm not going to give you a forecast there. But what I would say is soccer is truly a global game and growing in places like China, where we may never have a console market and where PC free-to-play is not growing as fast as it once was, but mobile is continuing to grow very fast. So there's a scenario that says FIFA on mobile could be much larger than 3x Madden. And our hope is that between current FIFA on console, current FIFA on the online market in Korea, Japan and China and Southeast Asia plus mobile would be a huge market for us.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So in terms of movie marketing around Battlefront II, and do we hope to get a benefit from that, the answer is absolutely yes. That's part of the reason why we do a license to a great IP like Star Wars. What you may have noticed is that Disney have just released the first major trailer for The Last Jedi. It had really, really strong and positive feedback. They are marketing this title on a more compressed timeline. And we're seeing the anticipation build for the movie in the same way we're seeing anticipation build for the game.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And on discounting, let me just make it really clear right now so all you guys don't have anything to write about on Black Friday. We bring the game out right before Black Friday so you will most likely not have discounts at Black Friday that we pay for. That doesn't mean that you might not see some stores choose to discount games on Black Friday out of their own pocket.","We will most likely discount the game like we did last time around the movie launch, and maybe you'll even see some selective discounts around the holidays, either Thanksgiving or Christmas. That's the way the games business always has worked. And so if you see the title on discount, don't read anything into that other than the fact that that's the way you sell games in the holidays.","In terms of the live service, I can't break out the actual forecast, but I would say it's not large for Battlefront II. Partially in the quarter, because we'll just get it going in the quarter and it will really start to drive the live events coming out of the quarter into the fourth quarter. So we really won't have a good sense of how well it's doing or how large it can be until probably at the tail end of the third quarter and really the tail end of the fourth quarter. But we'll keep you going. But it's not in a position that it's a large component of the fiscal forecast or the quarter forecast.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Laura Martin with Needham.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi, there. Can you hear me okay?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. Super. So you guys have had FIFA for about two decades and I'm curious about historically when the U.S. has not been in the World Cup, what the impact is on your game sales, player engagement lengths.","And then secondly, your marketing was well lower than we expected. And I'm wondering, could you give us update? Is that a timing shift, or should we be taking our marketing spending down next quarter as well?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","The marketing piece, it's all timing shift. I think we talked about in last quarter. We're doing marketing, a broader marketing and different types of marketing all during the year. And so it's less concentrated around launch time. I think overall, we brought our marketing spend down. You've seen that over the last few years, but don't assume that it's going to be down across the board in the back half of the year. So some of it might not be spent, but most of it is phasing, so.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","In terms of the World Cup, again, we're disappointed. I'm Australian, but I feel American. I've been here a long time and my kids are American so I feel for them. Although, I might say Australia really makes the World Cup. So I've lived with that dream for 43 years. The reality is, is the World Cup is the world's largest sporting event, and it's followed by all people around the world who love soccer or football depending on what they call it where they come from.","And really, does it heighten their enjoyment if their national team is participating? Of course. But we don't see people stop watching a World Cup just because their team is not there. And as you think about the U.S. in particular, we are a very multicultural country, and even now as we think about FIFA, the most played teams are from Spain and the UK., and the most played players are also non-American players. So we don't expect a huge impact there, but for my kids and for me, I'm disappointed that the U.S. won't be there.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Maybe one follow up.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Sure.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Sorry. So I was really intrigued by the statement that you made saying that the biggest disruption is streaming plus subscription, and you're saying that onboarding a large community of committed players lets you elevate the number of players. And I'm curious, is the value driver in your mind bringing new people onboard or getting more money from super fans, because it's an uncapped revenue stream?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","What we've seen in our subscriptions as we look at this is there's really two types of users of subscriptions: Those that do it because the friction is so low, you'd be mad not to do it, and those who do it because they are power users. In traditional linear media, you do not get the value out of a power user by virtue of the fact that subscription value is capped.","We see subscription also doing the same thing in the context of games that we see this inside of our games, is we see gamers coming and participating in our existing subscriptions because the friction is low, the quality of the games is high and the opportunity to play games that they may never have played before is just too enticing for the value proposition.","We also see players who come into the subscription as power players, who play multiple games. And in many cases, I think more than 75% of cases, played games they've never played before. They also participate in the live services of those games and drive additional incremental live service revenue on top of the subscription value.","And so, as we think about this on a go-forward basis, we actually think about it capturing both of those categories that you mentioned. The kind of casual user who is looking just to access without friction and the power user who's looking to actually play everything and really invest a great amount of their time in the entertainment value that we provide.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. Very helpful. Thanks.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","All right. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thanks very much for the question. Just curious if you could give us a little bit of a range for all your titles that come out in a given year for console, what percentage of revenue is the $60 versus the add-on content live services dollars? And I know that could vary by game, but if you could sort of give us a range of how it plays out over a two-year period?","And then secondly, wondered if you could give a little perspective on the competitive gameplay that you're going to have coming out for Battlefield 1 in the spring?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So let me hit the first one really quick. It really varies. In some titles, you'd have a 10% to 25% uplift off of the core, so $60 plus 25% of that. In some titles, they're going to be 125% or 150%. It also varies dramatically by region or geography because you have different spend capabilities around the world. So it's kind of hard to pare it down.","Obviously, Ultimate Team is at the high end of the spectrum because it's so engaging and we're running so many events that it just keeps people coming back. So yes, it's hard to generalize. But it's really, we think about it really as how do we keep engaging players. And if they're engaged, they'll probably spend some money along the way and we want to make sure we've got people deeply engaged in something that they love. I'll let Andrew touch the second one really quickly and then we'll do one more question.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So, for Battlefield, we don't have any new announcements for Incursions. It's currently in closed alpha and we're going to talk a lot more about that as the year progresses. But the things we've talked about so far is it will be a five-on-five player focused on contained small-scale battle. And it's unique in the fact that it will have both infantry and vehicle combat. And the feedback from the community so far has been really, really strong and positive, and we're integrating community feedback into this game. And again it comes off a great foundation. Battlefield is one of the great multiplayer games in our industry and Battlefield 1 was probably the greatest multiplayer game in the first-person shooter category last year. So we're very excited about the opportunity.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So one last question, so I can go trick-or-treating.","Operator","And our final question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hey, Blake and Andrew, congrats on your quarter. Appreciate it.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Mike.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Just, I gasp at asking you an accounting question, Blake, but revenue recognition on your FIFA sales, the digital was up. I think last year, you delayed the recognition of that into Q3. Is that somewhere this year?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, we don't formally delay it. We have a digital cut off that's a few days before the end of the actual end of the quarter, and that's just the way we work with our first parties. And so most of the FIFA digital revenue will come in Q3. The bulk of the revenue would either be people who pre-ordered a digital title or purchased digitally two or three days early because they were in EA Access. But almost all the regular digital purchases both for FIFA and for Ultimate Team are in Q3.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Got it. Good. One more follow-up for me, thank you. I know you have to be delicate to your retail partners, or your physical partners at least. But clearly the progression here to digital seems to be picking up some speed. Maybe it's inflecting. Who knows. But it looks like at least GameStop is working pretty hard to compete against new game sales by introducing a subscription plan on used. So just curious your thoughts on if at all, that could be disruptive to new game sales for you.","And also curious, feels like maybe despite some sales, maybe there's over ordering of product over the holiday, which maybe is a catalyst of some of the promotions that we saw last year. Curious if you can do anything to manage that, and how reactive you can be to digital promotions in response?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, despite the fact that we've talked a lot about digital, it's an important part of our business, we still want to have great relationships with our physical retail partners out there and we think we do around the world. I can't comment on GameStop's intentions relative to their new program. I don't even really have the details about it yet.","But we're obviously, we're very cautious of how we ship into all retailers. We've always been that way. We don't want the channel to be overly full, which would create discounting or could ultimately create financial problems for smaller retailers. So we've always watched that closely and we'll be careful again this year.","The beauty of digital, as I think you were indicating, is we can be pretty fast and reactive. We can do one-day sales. We can do special promos in certain regions or countries. We can do a lot with digital in a short term that you can't necessarily do with long term. Most of our long-term plans for retailers are locked up six to 12 months ahead of time. And because you've got point-of-sale materials, you've got promotional flyers that go into newspapers, all of those things have to be prepared. And so we set those up well in advance and work with the retailers very carefully on those.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So with that, I'll call it quits so everyone can enjoy their Halloween and I appreciate everyone coming on the call this time. We'll talk to you in late January. Thank you.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Cheers.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call and you may now disconnect."],"8048":["Electronic Arts Inc.

My name is Chantal and I'll be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q3 Fiscal 2020 Earnings Conference Call.","Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your call.","Chris Evenden","Thanks, Chantal.

Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we've posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks.

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise stated.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Chris. It was an excellent third quarter for Electronic Arts, with new games like the outstanding Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, as well as our dynamic live services for FIFA, Madden NFL, Apex Legends and The Sims 4, we delivered unmatched depth and breadth to players over the holiday season.","As a result, our revenue and earnings for Q3 were above our guidance, growing significantly year-over-year for the quarter. We're raising our full year guidance for the second time this fiscal year and we are on track to post a very strong year against our original projections for FY 2020.","What we delivered to players in Q3 reflects the breadth and strength of our business, our focus on quality experiences and a deep commitment to execution. We're growing our IP portfolio with more great new games, our live services are among the most popular and highest performing in the industry and we're expanding to more distribution channels, so we can connect more players to the games they love.","As a result, players are deeply engaged in our top games, sentiment scores are strong and we are building momentum in the growth areas of our business. I'll touch on a few highlights here. Our portfolio of Star Wars games across all platforms has never been stronger. Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was the action adventure game that fans were looking for this holiday season.","Respawn delivered an expertly crafted high-quality experience with outstanding gameplay that thrilled players, made many of the game of the year lists and sold beyond our projections for the quarter. In addition to Jedi: Fallen Order, the quality of the Star Wars Battlefront II experience is shining through as well.","Two years and dozens of content updates later, spanning all three trilogies and more, critics have re-reviewed the game to high scores, player sentiment is exceptional and the Celebration Edition helped to drive performance at Battlefront II that was significantly above our Q3 expectations.","Our communities in both Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Star Wars: The Old Republic are thriving as well. The power of the Star Wars franchise continues to endure and grow across generations and geographies and we look forward to continuing our momentum with Disney and Lucasfilm.","It's nearly one year since we took the industry by storm with Apex Legends and the strength and opportunity of this IP and live service continued to grow. Apex is an outstanding example of the innovation across our portfolio. Seasons of new content are coming at a regular cadence for the growing global community.","Season three was bigger than season two, with higher peaks in daily active users. Within those seasons in-game events are engaging players with content and challenges that show the imagination and creativity that we are continually pouring into the experience.","We're also expanding the Apex universe with more ways to play and watch. We have plans to reach more platforms in FY 2021 and there's a lot of excitement in the esports community for the Apex Legends global series that is now underway. We're pleased to have Lenovo as an official sponsor for Apex competitive gaming joining Gillette, Snickers, Pizza Hut and other major brands and broadcast networks partnering with us on our esports portfolio.","It's been a great year for EA SPORTS around the world. Madden NFL 20 and FIFA 20 are both demonstrating how exciting and fresh our sports games can be for new and established fans alike. Madden NFL 20 is our most successful game ever in the franchise, setting multiple records for player engagement and the highest net bookings through a holiday quarter.","Our FIFA franchise also grew year-over-year in Q3. VOLTA Football brought an all new dimension to FIFA 20 and the updates to FIFA Ultimate Team have been deeply engaging for fans with fight matches up nearly 40% year-over-year from launch through Q3.","FIFA 20 is also the number one most engaged title in our subscription services. We're now getting ready to launch two major additions to the FIFA 20 experience with a prestigious South American club tournaments CONMEBOL Libertadores and CONMEBOL Sudamericana as well as the E-Libertadores a new expansion to our FIFA 20 global series esports competitions. In addition to South America, Asia is another growth market for our FIFA franchise with FIFA online up significantly year-over-year in Q3.","In other dimensions of our portfolio, we now have more than 20 million unique players worldwide in The Sims 4 life-to-date. Our eighth expansion pack for the game Discover University continue to demonstrate the creative ways we can add to this experience for our amazing Sims community. As did the surprise addition of the child from the Mandalorian series on Disney+ just before the holidays. Meanwhile PvZ: Battle for Neighborville and Need for Speed Heat both brought fun and new experiences to fans around the world.","Our people are our greatest resource at Electronic Arts and this year has been a demonstration of how the creativity and technical expertise of our teams working together around the world allows us to deliver an unmatched breadth of entertainment to players.","From FIFA to Star Wars, Apex to Madden to Sims to Need for Speed and more, we have the titles that fans around the world recognize and love to play. The addition of great new games and experiences is also vital to growth and we're excited to do that in the year ahead through more of our own IP with partner in indie content and some more surprises to come.","Live services are delivering value for players and continuing growth for our business. Our teams are among the best in the industry it is constantly building on feedback to expand and enhance the experience for players. With content updates and in-game events in Ultimate Team, creative and original new seasons in Apex Legends that expand the game and its characters, new content in The Sims 4 that continues to add player choice and more content across our top mobile titles around the world, live services will continue to be a key focus and growth driver for us in Q4 and the year ahead.","With the strength of our IP and live services we're well-positioned for growth as the audience expands and diversifies into new forms of content. We are bringing our games and IP to new regions including continued mobile growth in Asia and plans to launch Apex Legends in China.","With our subscription services now available on three major platforms and coming to Steam in FY 2021, we're expanding our leadership in high-value low friction subscriptions for more players. And with FIFA and Madden continuing to grow as leading esports properties, we're bringing Apex Legends competition to the global stage and we have exciting plans for new content in esports as we move into the next fiscal year. We're looking forward to finishing this year strong, delivering for players, and continuing our growth into FY 2021.","Now, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks Andrew. EA successfully launched three games last quarter: Need for Speed Heat; Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville; and of course, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. That brings the total for calendar 2019 to eight. Launching eight major games at quality in a year is a substantial undertaking, but that number only tells part of the story.","For example Battlefield V, we launched a whole new theater of war with maps, vehicles, weapons, and more driving a major shift in engagement. For Star Wars Battlefront II, we introduced game-changing heroes, fan favorite reinforcements, exotic planets, and epic new ways to play across three cinematic eras.","For Apex Legends, we launched three seasons of content including three new legends, five in-game events, three town takeovers, and a whole new map of six new game modes. Delivering quality entertainment at this level testifies to how well the teams are aligned across the company and the way in which we unite to achieve our goals. And it works; we had another great quarter with record net bookings and live services as a whole and in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams in particular.","Apex Legends is having a fantastic season and we delivered a new hit with the launch of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. As a result, we generated record operating cash flow over the last 12 months.","EA's net revenue was $1.593 billion and operating expenses were $724 million. GAAP operating income was $361 million and resulted in earnings per share of $1.18, $0.26 better than our guidance.","The year-on-year increase in OpEx was largely driven by variable compensation which flexes up and down depending on company performance against plan. Remember that the true-up in Q3 last year was negative that combined with a positive true-up this year creates a $58 million swing year-on-year. There was also underlying growth in R&D as we continue to invest in game development.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.104 billion, up $150 million last year. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was a record at $1.898 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $28 million resulting in a free cash flow of $1.076 billion. See our earnings slides for further details on this information.","During the quarter, we repurchased 3.1 million shares at a cost of $305 million. We've now returned to shareholders over $2 billion of the $2.4 billion in our two-year buyback program that we began in May 2018. We will announce our future plans on our May earnings call.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.6 billion. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.978 billion, up 23% on the prior year despite a $39 million FX headwind.","Sales of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order significantly beat our expectations. We had forecast 6 million to 8 million units for the fiscal year, but to hit the high end of that in the third quarter and now we anticipate selling around 10 million units in the fiscal year, a very strong result for a single-player action game. Madden NFL 20 is delivering the best performance in Madden's more than 30-year history. Average selling prices were strong across the portfolio, with discounts smaller and applied later in the year.","Diving into digital net bookings. Digital net bookings were $1.444 billion, up 20% on the year ago period. Digital net bookings now represent 77% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis. This compares to 74% in the prior year. Live service net bookings were up 27% to $993 million. Nothing illustrates the changing nature of our business model like the growth of our live services and $993 million is an all-time high.","Growth was led by Apex Legends, but closely followed by double-digit growth in FIFA and Madden Ultimate Team. Growth in FIFA online in Asia was also extremely strong. Mobile delivered net bookings of $134 million, down 6% year-over-year but above our expectations, driven by titles across the breadth of our portfolio, particularly in Asia.","Including our IP-licensed deals, such as the one for Command & Conquer: Red Alert in China, mobile is up year-on-year at constant currency. With many promising titles in incubation at EA, we are excited about the opportunities ahead for us in the mobile market.","Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $317 million, 16% higher than last year. Growth was driven by increased game sales, plus the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 47% a year ago. We continue to model underlying annual growth of around 5 percentage points for digital.","Turning to guidance, we expect full year GAAP net revenue to be $5.475 billion and for diluted earnings per share to be $9.90. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.725 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $140 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.585 billion, $135 million above where our expectations were at the start of the year.","We now anticipate fiscal 2020 net bookings of $5.15 billion, up $25 million over our prior guidance and up $50 million from where we started the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.325 billion, cost of revenue to be $257 million and operating expenses of $724 million.","OpEx is down year-on-year, reflecting the two new IPs we launched last year. This results in a diluted earnings per share of $1.05 for the fourth quarter, using the diluted share count of 293 million shares. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.152 billion. This is slightly down year-on-year with broad-based strength this year, offset by the massive launch quarter for Apex Legends and Anthem last year.","Looking forward to fiscal 2021, our goal is to continue to grow net bookings and underlying profitability, even as we invest in new platforms. We anticipate live services to be the primary growth driver, followed by the launch of new content across our broad range of genres. We're launching four sports titles including new games in our blockbuster FIFA and Madden franchises; four other titles that draw from the breadth of our IP and we'll also publish four titles globally from smaller developers.","Finally we expect two new mobile titles to make it into soft launch. We expect growth to accelerate in fiscal 2022 as we leveraged the growing base of next-generation consoles with the launch of a new Battlefield. This is on top of the launches of FIFA 22 and Madden NFL 22 plus new and ongoing live services and other titles.","We create long-term value by growing strong live services, launching new content and expanding our reach. This broad-based model reduces our dependency on individual titles, decreases risks and enables us to deliver financial results for our shareholders through a constant stream of high quality entertainment for our players.","Now I'll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks Blake. We're delivering for our players and our business is growing. Our foundation is great IP that excites and engages hundreds of millions of players. We've added the breadth and depth of our portfolio with great games like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order and the innovation in FIFA, Madden and our ongoing franchise is helping us reach new fans and grow our total player base.","We're looking forward to delivering more amazing games from our top franchises, new IP, new partner indie titles and some other surprises in FY 2021 and beyond. Live services extend and enhance the experience for players in their favorite games and enables strong ongoing growth for our business. We design experiences for longevity, creating communities where our players love to connect, share and compete with friends for months and years to come. Our live services for Apex Legends, EA SPORTS Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Star Wars and more continue to grow in player engagement and will bring more great creative content and in-game events to those communities throughout the year ahead.","Great games and strength in live services also position us well in additional growth areas. New consoles are coming and we'll be ready to leave with some of our top titles. Our esports portfolio will expand to four franchises this year with content designed for a wide audience and a growing range of sponsors.","We continue to add to the value of our subscription offerings, reaching more play through more distribution channels and expanding to audiences in more geographies with IP that they can't wait to play. It's an exciting time of growth in the interactive entertainment industry and a great time to be making amazing games and bringing them to more players around the world.","Now Blake and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer & Company. Please go ahead.","Andrew Uerkwitz","Thanks, gentlemen for taking the question. Looking at the past two Star Wars games, one was a massive multiplayer; one was obviously a big single player. Seems like sales numbers initially are roughly the same but one's got live services, one doesn't. How has that shaped the way you think about future game design as we head into the next console with a big focus on live services?","Andrew Wilson","Great question. And part of the reason why we have this breadth and depth in our portfolio is because as the player base continues to grow, so do their motivations. As we think about making games, we think about the motivations of why people want to play; inspiration, escape, social connection, creation, self-improvement all these types of things. And as we start to look at the broader player base and we think about each of the cohorts within that we're looking to build experiences that satisfy their needs and motivations. And what we've come to understand particularly with Star Wars is it's a really, really big fan base. And while social interaction competition and multiplayer is really important for a large part of that fan base, what we have seen through the last quarter is it also is that inspiration and escape model that living the Jedi journey, the Jedi story. As we think about this on a go-forward basis, you should imagine that we will continue with the breadth and depth across the IP in order to meet the needs and motivations of that broad player base.","Andrew Uerkwitz","And if I could just ask one follow-up. As we think about live services, but also more distribution channels more -- easier hopefully cheaper marketing. Should we expect EA to launch more than eight games when we look out three, four, five years or is kind of like is eight a good number?","Andrew Wilson","I would start by saying eight is a lot. If you think about the various game launches across the industry, there are not many companies that can come together and launch that kind of breadth at that kind of quality with that strength of execution. And so we feel really good about that number.","The other thing that's important to understand is this also has a layering effect. So, as we launch games that have live services that last one, two, three, and in some cases, four and five years, the build that we get over time and the predictability and longevity in our revenue stream is really, really strong. And so I think eight is probably a pretty good number. Some years there might be a few more of that, some it might be a few less than that, but we feel really good.","The other thing that we're starting to see is that with the reach and the network power that we have with subscriptions and our ability to reach players in this high-value low-friction business model, we now have a lot of other third-parties and Indies coming to speak with us about distribution of their content.","And so while I feel really good about our capacity to continue to execute and deliver great high-quality content and potentially more than many others in the industry, we're also going to have the opportunity to reach our player base with these very new and interesting titles from third-party and Indie developers.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. And what I would add to Andrew's comment is remember one of the major strengths of our business is a deep catalog. And a deep catalog is based on not just this year's games or last year's games, but maybe even games from two or three or four years ago.","And we sometimes see north of $1 billion in catalog sales in the following year. That's very powerful to us. It's very profitable. And it is critical in continuing to maintain the brands that we have built. And fans will come into games at many different levels either through direct purchase or through subscriptions. And that deep bench is something that creates a lot of value which I'm not sure people always think about as we're thinking about the value of the overall business.","Andrew Uerkwitz","Got it. Thanks gentlemen and congrats on the quarter.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks.","Chris Evenden","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Matt Cost","Hi guys, it's Matt on for Brian. Congrats on the quarter and thanks for taking the question. The first one is just on the mobile business. It seems like you made some great progress, obviously, on constant currency growing year-on-year. Can you talk about sort of what you're seeing in that business and maybe any thoughts you're having on potentially partnering with other mobile app developers and some of your competitors have seen some success recently following the strategy like that particularly in terms of going in markets like Asia. And then if you could just quickly an update on Project Atlas? Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. So, obviously, rolling mobile out in China, you need to have a partner. And we're -- as we've said in the prepared remarks today that we're working with a partner there and we're very excited about the opportunity. That partner is also helping us develop a mobile Apex for the globe. And -- well, more to come on that in terms of timing, but that's also a big upside for us. We have not built a lot into our forecast for next year on that, because the timing is always uncertain. But we do believe that there's a lot of opportunity there.","Obviously, we'll also do a PC version of Apex in China through that same partner. But we will selectively use partners where possible. We have some great studios. We think we can continue to build great games. But where possible, where a partner can either increase the time to market, or help us in markets where we don't necessarily have the ability to go to market ourselves, like China, we will use partners. And more to come on Apex and any other titles that might fit in that.","Andrew Wilson","Just a couple of other thoughts. We've talked in previous calls about kind of a three-pronged strategy around mobile, the first pillar being an underlying belief that we were not monetizing our mobile games at a level that may be some of the best-of-breed inside the industry had and that we were going to have a real focus on that.","I would tell you our studio leadership team has brought some really, really high-powered compelling leaders from the broader mobile industry into the company. They are coming in and working with our teams and just changing a philosophy around how we think about the creation of really compelling content and the monetization of that content. And we're starting to see that pay out. And you should expect that we'll continue to focus in an area and get more out of the existing mobile titles that actually performed really well in the marketplace and we maybe haven't been as focused on.","The second pillar has been -- we are a game development company. We have spectacular IP that has mobile appeal and mobile application. And we have a number of mobile titles in development that I'm actually very excited about. Two of which, as we said in the prepared remarks, will go into soft launch in the next year or so and there might be some others that get in a little earlier as well.","And then third, we continue to look at opportunities for partnership and acquisition. There's not a lot of those out there as it turns out, but we're trying to make sure that we're in every conversation. So we do -- mobile continues to be a focus for us and we do believe there's a growth opportunity ahead.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. On Project Atlas, the other part of your question, you'll continue to hear more from us about streaming and other components of Atlas. We're in tight connection and conversations with all of the players that are doing streaming. We're very excited about where it's going and the potential, as well as how we can continue to improve the tools that people use inside of the subscription models that we put in place.","So a simple reminder, our goal is to be on every platform and to offer our great products to consumers, wherever they want to play them as long as we can play -- provide them at a quality level that we're comfortable with. So you're going to hear and see a lot more in the next coming year.","Matt Cost","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raymond Stochel with Consumer Edge Research. Your line is open.","Raymond Stochel","Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. Is there anything that you can discuss as far as VOLTA. Can you give us an update on monetization for VOLTA. And then, any more details on FIFA Ultimate Team being up double digits this call. Is that like-for-like as far as first launch? And then, what would be driving that growth? Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","We're very happy with VOLTA. VOLTA brought in a whole set of new players and engage them in new and interesting ways. As we've also talked about a lot in past calls, as we think about building live services, we really think about building engagement first and monetization to follow.","As I say, I think that what the team did with VOLTA this year is really, really strong. They've taken some great learning from feedback they've received from the community and we'll continue to build on that in the years to come. And while we don't have any announcements yet on monetization, a lot of player feedback is that they would also like to see the opportunity to extend and enhance that VOLTA experience in a way they do with other live services. So we're excited about what that might bring.","Blake Jorgensen","And what I would say on Ultimate Team and this is not just FIFA, this is Madden and this is NHL and our other games. The thing you need to remember on Ultimate Team is we continue to refine and improve the weekly or monthly events that we're running on Ultimate Team that bring people into play.","People won't play Ultimate Team if they are not having fun. And so the key is how do you build an event that they're going to have fun competing and interacting. It's a social network and it's all about the design of events. And I think the team continues to get better and better every year either refining existing events or adding new events and that's what really drives the overall monetization in Ultimate Team across all of our sports. And it's the thing that people sometimes don't understand when it comes to live services that it's not about the monetization. It's about how do you create fun for people to be able to come in and enjoy that social connection and that competition with others. And that's what really drives that across all of our live services.","Chris Evenden","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, good afternoon. Two questions. First gross margin. Maybe you could provide us with the puts and takes, the bridge from last year to this year? And then also on the other titles that you did have guidance for, any update to that guidance for those titles? Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah. So gross margin's really simple. We sold more Madden, more FIFA and more Star Wars Jedi than we expected. And all three of those are royalty properties, so we had to pay royalty on them. Royalty gets booked in gross margin. That's a good problem to have. I'd take that all day long, because obviously it's driving the overall business and the profitability of the business. So nothing more than that. It's pretty straightforward.","I don't think we have any new news on guidance for anything else. Obviously we've tried to give people some sense of what next year looks like. As I said in my prepared remarks, we would like to -- our goal is to drive both top line and bottom line guidance and we think we've set up a slate of properties for next year to do that. And we've also provided people the knowledge that Battlefield's coming the year after that, which should also drive growth the following year. And we see that as a big positive for as we've said the continued plan to try to have a strong growth, top line bottom line cash flow as we go forward.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Alex Giaimo with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Alex Giaimo","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. Hoping to dig into Apex aspirations a bit more without getting too bogged down into the F 2020 or F 2021 guide specifically how should investors be thinking broadly about the growth aspirations for that franchise. I think you've mentioned in the past that you view it as a 10-year franchise and it's obviously early, but should we think about it sort of as a modest straight-line grower moving forward or is it a bit more lumpy? And then just given the free-to-play nature of that game hoping you can just update us on how the profitability of Apex compares to the broader profitability of EA as a whole. Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes, it's good questions. I mean as I think Andrew said we're just getting into our one-year anniversary in the game which is fantastic. We've been very pleased with where the game is. The team has done an amazing job of continuing to innovate and add content and also leverage an incredibly engaged audience to try to feed them and give them things that they wanted to continue to play in the game and excitement and surprise.","We will continue that journey no different than we've done with live services. You -- people sometimes forget Ultimate Team was like an $8 million business 12 years ago. And our goal is to always be innovating and improving over time to try to grow the business and that's how we're thinking about Apex. And we've continued to bolster the team with new talent, new live service talent, but also make sure that the existing team is very focused on how they're building out the business and rewarded for their great efforts there. I mean it's just an incredible job they've done.","It's hard for us to predict. If you would have asked us a month ago, six months ago, we probably wouldn't have known and we still don't know, but our goal is to continue to grow that business and to maintain. But when we come to our May guidance, we'll try to give some people some sense of it.","What we are -- we're going to stop talking about monthly or weekly or daily active users because I'm not sure what anyone can do with that information. And if anyone questions that I they go back seven and a half years ago to my very first quarter at the company where I said, we will take away metrics that don't make sense for investors. And we're not necessarily trying to hold back any information, we're not signaling anything. We just realized that we want to make sure you're not doing something with numbers that don't make sense. We'll try to give you as best guidance as we can. We want to grow the business. We think it's got a long history to it, but more to come and we're very excited and very optimistic about where the opportunities can go with Apex.","Andrew Wilson","Just a small add. At a game level, as we look at the industry and the games that have actually lasted a decade or more, things like League of Legends, things like CS: Go, things like DOTA 2 to continue to engage huge populations of players around the world.","There's really kind of three core pillars of those games; really compelling and identifiable characters, a truly compelling world, and competitive skill-based highly social game plan that continues to evolve and emerge over time as players continue to get better in the game. They are the three core tent poles of Apex Legends as again and as we think about the year -- the next year and the year after and we add new geographies and we had new platforms, again, as what Blake said, it's hard to predict exactly how that will grow, but our belief is that we have growth ahead and we're very, very encouraged and excited by the fact that the team gets better and better at answering needs of the players. Season 3 was bigger than Season 2. We expect Season 4 will grow again and we're excited about what will come. ","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. And you mentioned our comments in the past around, we're trying to build a long term franchise. At the end of the day, we would much rather have something that lasts for many, many years -- doesn't -- is not a boom and bust. And that's how we're trying to design the business.","The team is very aligned with that. And if it can turn into essentially an annual shooter for us as part of our franchises. We think that's huge value to the overall company. So that's how we're looking at it and how we're approaching it. And we think everyone's aligned around that and more to come.","Alex Giaimo","Thanks, guys.","Chris Evenden","Thanks. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Cohen with Stephens. Your line is open.","Jeff Cohen","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Could you talk about how big of a driver Jedi: Fallen Order was for new subscribers to origin access? And then, broadly, just, can you talk about how churn has trended within your subscription products?","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. So remember that it's the premier subscription that gets frontline titles. Which is only part of the overall origin access model and not in the Sony or Microsoft program. Obviously, it added to it, but its early days. So it's hard to understand if people came in and then went out, because they're still playing the game.","We have not seen big changes in churn. It's been a big question for us, because we don't have titles coming in every single month from our portfolio. So you're always going to wonder about churn. But it's -- we're continuing to grow the subscription business on Origin as well as on our partners.","And we think any time we've added new content, that drives people in. Even -- we believe when we put Jedi in the regular subscription, which will be still months from now, we're sure that that will also bring people in. And the most important part is -- what we found out is, people actually come in for certain titles.","We know this because we watch the data before they joined the subscription and after. And we find out they play titles that they've never played before and then start playing them a lot. So we've reduced the barrier of trial. They don't have to go and buy the game, they actually get a chance to just try it inside the subscription. And that's a huge win, as we start to build people into new, either games or genres or sports that they've never played before, because it only increases the growth of their interest in playing great games.","Jeff Cohen","Thanks, Blake. Congrats on the quarter.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust. Your line is open.","Matthew Thornton","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Without getting into maybe any specific dates or even titles specifically, maybe to give us a little more update just on kind of how you're feeling about the pipeline, maybe, relative to where we were 6, 12 months ago that the products that are out there across the various studios. Any color there would be helpful. And then, just coming back to Sims and Apex in particular, Blake, I think, you had talked about those franchises doing, call it, $300 million to $400 million for the year. Are those still reasonable ending points for those franchises? Thanks, guys.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. I would say, they're definitely reasonable franchise points for those franchises and both are doing -- continue to do well. The Sims added an expansion pack in the fall that has done extremely well. And it is just an amazing business that continues to grow, as more and more people come in. And then those people go backwards by expansion packs from history as well as by the new expansion packs and it just builds on that social network that we've effectively created inside The Sims. And we'll see similar behavior with Apex even though it's not expansion packs. More and more people come in each season and start to gain excitement around what they're seeing and build around the social network.","No more color yet on the forward looking. Obviously you can assume that the base set of sports games will be in every year. Obviously next year we're going to -- we've said we'd most likely add at least one new sports game. And we have some third-party games we will have in for next year, and a couple of things that we haven't yet announced. But as we said earlier, we're very focused on growing both top line and bottom line both next year and the following year as well as future years. But I just want to give people a sense that we've got a fairly extensive set of titles that people should get pretty comfortable on going forward. And, obviously, we're also working on a lot of our famous franchises that will come in the future plus some continued new franchises that we'll continue to add and live services associated with all those.","Andrew Wilson","Yeah. Just as a kind of an add to that, again we benefit from a large number of very well-established studios with great teams with a track history of delivering really high-quality content. So as we think about Maxis and BioWare and Motive and DICE and Respawn, and our EA SPORTS studios there are titles in various stages of development across all of those studios and more.","I also talked about a number of mobile titles, a couple of which will come in to soft launch next year. But I would tell you I'm more excited now about our mobile pipeline than I have been for a number of years. And again I would say also that mobile is an unpredictable marketplace and it's very challenging. And all companies have discovered that. But I feel better about what I'm seeing coming out of our mobile studios now than I have for a number of years. And so we feel very good about the long-term trajectory of where our studios are going and the amount of games and new and creative IP that we have in the pipeline.","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah. And you guys, kind of, imagine and you've seen this historically in console transitions. As new consoles come out -- I don't want to get ahead of our great partners Microsoft and Sony, but you should assume that the power of those consoles are going to be a lot better than the power of the existing consoles, which means a really simple thing, we can do a lot more.","And so you will start to see things over the next couple of years that we're doing with games that will blow people's minds. And that's the fun part of this business because we are going to see so much innovation, not just with us but across the whole industry. And that's why you've seen growth across the software business as part of this overall video game business in every single console cycle over the last what 20-plus years. And so that's where people sometimes get hung up.","They get too focused on the short-term and not think about what's transpired historically. And the power of the new consoles is going to be substantially greater than the existing consoles, which means we can just do a lot more. And it's going to be fun and great to see how our existing games will evolve like a FIFA or a Madden, but also see how new games will evolve or be developed under that much higher power.","Matthew Thornton","Appreciate the color guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Gee with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Ryan Gee","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. A couple on live services. So first very encouraged by the outperformance of Star Wars Jedi from Respawn. So, you guys now have a large player base into which you could generate some additional revenue. So, what is the opportunity ahead either for to generate live services revenue from that in fiscal 2022 and\/or maybe some sort of add-on content pack for that game?","And then as it relates to live services from Ultimate Team, the sequential acceleration to double-digits last quarter, are you guys able to see how much of that is a function of just easier year-over-year comps to the Ultimate Team business versus execution getting players further down the conversion funnel and getting higher spend out of existing payers. Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes, let me hit the Ultimate Team one first and then maybe Andrew can address the Star Wars Jedi. Ultimate Team really has benefited from more people and more engagement versus once again trying to change the ARPU in some fashion. We're very conscious about not trying to get people to spend beyond what their spend levels are. And so the best way to get people is to get people to spend in that is to engage them in better and more events that they're excited in.","And so as I said earlier, the team has been very good at trying to design new events, add new events, and keep people really excited about playing versus trying to get more money out of on any single event. And I think that's been our biggest single driver plus growing the overall base of FIFA over time and the number of people that are into Ultimate Team.","I mean we're -- more and more people play Ultimate Team and we think that's very engaging for them. But it's not all that different than what you see in traditional sports where people are highly engaged with the underlying sport. These are hard-core sports fans and this is what they want to do and that's why they engage in Ultimate Team.","Andrew Wilson","On Star Wars, no announcements of anything at this point, but what I would say is you're right we have a very, very strong player base a very engaged player base who feel like what they've just had the ability to experience as one of the most compelling Star Wars experiences of their life of any formal media.","I would also highlight it is a single-play game. So, any kind of live service or additional content would be different than what we would see in an Ultimate Team or an Apex Legends. But this team who is working on this is one of the most creative teams in our company and certainly in the industry who are thinking about where to take this journey next for players that love this style of play.","We're excited by what we're going to come up with and in the meantime I also think that this will be one of the strongest catalog sellers for this company over the coming years and will almost certainly help continue to grow our subscription as it moves into our various subscription offers across platforms.","Chris Evenden","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Mario Lu with Barclays. Your line is open.","Mario Lu","Hey guys. Two questions on my end. One on the Switch and one on Sims. So, Nintendo today announced that the Switch exceeded 52 million units shipped worldwide which is similar or more than the Xbox One. So, therefore, should we expect EA to publish more titles on the Switch going forward? As I understand currently there's only three EA titles on the platform including Unravel, Fe, in the legacy version of FIFA.","And then secondly on The Sims, the success of Sims 4 is very intriguing to me since the industry is filled with multiplayer experiences. And Facebook recently actually announced that they're coming out with Horizons, a social experience in VR and that kind of reminds me of the Sims online which launched 18 years ago. So, any thoughts on relaunching an online version of the franchise, given its large popularity? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","So let me hit the Switch question and then I'll go into the AR question on Sims. So we are very pleased with how well the Nintendo has done with Switch. I mean, people love the platform. They enjoy it, it's great. And remember there are a lot of people that have both, the Xbox and a Switch or a PlayStation and Switch, because it, in many ways, provides a different experience, particularly a way to access great Nintendo software.","We are always looking and discussing with Nintendo what else we can put on the platform. And as you can imagine, as the platform grows, our interest in adding content grows for that platform. But we're also conscious of the fact that the top-selling titles by a long shot or all the Nintendo software, which is fabulous software, but it helps us balance sort of the realities of how big our markets can be there. But trust that we're looking at that. You will hear some more things in the future about what we're putting on the platform. And we're very pleased with how it's grown alongside the growth of both Sony and Microsoft's platforms.","Andrew Wilson","Great question on the Sims. A little known fact, I guess, for many -- the Sims will be 20 next week. And that Maxis team and the teams that have been part of Maxis over the years continue to deliver unbelievably innovative and creative content for a constantly growing Sims community globally.","As we think about The Sims, again, I referenced the motivations of why we play games earlier, inspiration, escape, social interaction, creation, self-improvement, competition. Typically what the Sims has done is really focused on fulfilling the motivations of inspiration, escape, creation, self-improvement, these type and not necessarily focused as much on social interaction and competition.","But a few things are in fact true over the years. One is that, The Sims community has continued to grow. And with the broader social platforms continue to connect with each other and share what they do in and around the game they play. And we've seen that manifest in games like Sims FreePlay, which was a more social experience for us.","And we're also seeing that the competition nature of The Sims is also rising up. And we're seeing people compare and contrast, not competition in the traditional sports sense, but how they create and what they create and how they use their imaginations and what they're able to build inside of their Sims universes.","And so as Maxis continues to think about The Sims for a new generation across platforms in a cloud-enabled world, you should imagine that while we will always stay true to our inspiration, escape, creation, self improvement, motivations, that this notion social interaction and competition, like the kind of things that were actually present in The Sims FreePlay -- sorry, in The Sims Online many, many years ago, that they will start to become part of the ongoing Sims experience in the years to come.","We're very excited. This is a game that, it really doesn't have any competition in its category for delivering and fulfilling these motivations for players and we think it's a tremendous growth opportunity for us for many, many years to come.","Blake Jorgensen","And the one thing that we have with The Sims, that we have with all of our games, but probably the most with the Sims is, its incredibly engaged community. And The Sims team has done an amazing job interacting with the community and trying to understand what they want.","And so, it allows us to develop expansion packs, additions, whatever it is, or game approaches, that is really coming from the community and we will continue to encourage that. So as we see interest or demand that allows us to go chase that as we develop the product. And I think that's an amazing thing that you don't necessarily have in all games and The Sims is a leader there for us and it makes it such a fabulous opportunity to continue to feed what the community wants.","Mario Lu","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Mike Ng","Hi. Thank you very much for the question. I just had one on unit sales. If you look at full game downloads plus packaged goods, it looked like that was up $168 million year-on-year. And it seems like the key moving parts for Star Wars, Need for Speed more than offsetting Battlefield V. I was just wondering if there are any other factors to consider whether those were catalog sales being better or worse or pricing or the digital shift impacting unit sales that could help us think about things that may have impacted units for the quarter? Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah. Well, clearly digital sales continues to grow. I would -- I'd say remember Star Wars tends to skew a little lower digitally than our average titles just because a lot of the gifting that goes on at holidays. And live services, obviously, was a big driver. But if you thought -- if you think about our expectations as we mentioned we over delivered on Star Wars, we probably under delivered slightly on Plants vs. Zombies but that's one that will sell well over a long period of time. So in a relatively small title so that wasn't a big driver. And then Need for Speed's, kind of, as we expected.","We did as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that this year we had stronger pricing than we have in the past and we did discounts later in the season than we did in the past. And that was part of our strategy, but it also helped across the board as we look -- as you look at overall revenue.","Mike Ng","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel. Your line is open.","Drew Crum","Thank you guys. Can you update us on the progress you've made with FIFA Online 4 in China during the current fiscal year, and how big of a role that plays growth for fiscal 2021? And when you get back to the $200 million annual run rate?","And then separately with some of the management changes you've made at DICE and I guess specifically Vince becoming the Director of the LA office, how involved will he in Respawn be with the development of the next Battlefield game? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah. So quickly on the on FIFA Online, we're still running both FIFA Online 3 and FIFA Online 4 in China. That has not impacted the business that much. In fact we're pretty close to getting back to our historical level. We've shut off FIFA Online in Korea. And FIFA Online 4 there has responded very well. We had strong growth year-over-year in the quarter for that and it was mainly driven by Korea.","We will play it over the next few quarters as to when and how we're going to shut it down in China. But we're conscious that we don't want to disrupt the consumer there. And right now both Online 4 and Online 3 are doing well in that marketplace. So more to come on that. But we're pretty close to back to where we were and we're really excited about the growth that's coming off of FIFA Online 4 both in Southeast Asia and in Korea that we're seeing and even in China. So, more to come there, but that's kind of the quick answer.","Andrew Wilson","Good question on Vince and Battlefield V. You might recall that we announced that Vince was leading a creative council for the organization. What this creative council does it kind of operates like a brain trust like was happening at Pixar and really brings creative leaders across the company together to review and comment, be constructive, and help and provide insight across the broad set of creative initiatives that we have going on.","And Vince is very proactive in that and very involved in that and that's having a tremendous impact across the company and helping us drive this kind of aligned focused push against both quality and execution.","With him taking on DICE LA, traditionally DICE LA have been supporting DICE Stockholm, but they have a great creative team there and great creative leadership and have also been incubating some other things and we're very excited about those things and Vince will be deeply involved in those as he takes on leadership of that.","And then with the leadership change that we made in Stockholm, we've got really strong traction against the next Battlefield game. I'm really -- I talked about this last call. I'm really excited about what that team is doing. And David Rota who is leading the studios in Europe now is also having a really strong impact and the team is going to do some pretty amazing things.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company. Your line is open.","Mike Hickey","Hey Andrew, Blake, Chris congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking my questions. I had one on Vince that you kind of answered it, but maybe you can go a layer deeper. Obviously, he's a super talent to guy. I mean his success in the shooters truly genres is truly remarkable with Medal of Honor, Call of Duty: Titanfall, Apex Legends, obviously founded Respawn. I guess just your thoughts on Respawn ex-Vince how that studio continues to behave and the leadership there?","And then at the new DICE studio, it sounds like they're going to rebrand that or rename it. You mentioned that perhaps he's inheriting some games in development, therapy development preproduction, but I'm curious if we can look forward to sort of AAA from Vince in the shooter genre emerging in two to three years.","And then I guess broadly speaking new consoles, Blake, great to hear your excitement on new consoles coming to the market and what that means. I share that. It's also seemingly a good time to come out with new IP. So, thoughts, I guess, broadly on how you think about new IP on the front end to console cycle? Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. Just to be clear Vince hasn't stopped working at Respawn. He's still running Respawn. We're asking him to do more and part of what Laura Miele has been doing is trying to make sure Vince has all the resources that he needs. And so giving him the chance to oversee DICE LA also gives them the opportunity to pull resources into the Respawn team if he needs to.","So, there are probably, I don't know, how many new IP ideas we're incubating. So, more to come on all of that. Everyone's pretty excited. But I don't want anyone to be mistaken that expanding Vince's remit means in any way that he's not overseeing Respawn. He has got a great team there. He's got a great management team there. We continue to bolster that team. But he is still very helpful every day at Respawn as well as helpful across our entire portfolio. So we're very excited about he and the whole team as to how they've integrated into the company. It's never easy to be a small company and get acquired by a big company. And I think what the Respawn team hopefully has found out is that, we're actually not bad guys and we're pretty fun to work with. Bad people, sorry, didn't mean to say bad guys, because Laura's a really good lady.","But I just want people to know. I mean, we try to leverage -- and it's not just Vince, its people across our entire portfolio. We try to leverage our best sports experts, our best managers wherever they are. And that we've got a collection of quite a few of those people and that's what we can continue to produce the games that we produce every year.","You don't put out the best of biggest sports games in the world year-after-year on time and on budget if you don't have amazing people doing that. And Chris is telling me I got it shut it off, because we're out of time. But there was one last -- one was one part of your question Mike that we didn't get to. We lost you. All right. All right, everyone. Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","Talk to everyone next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"8044":["Electronic Arts, Inc.

My name is Mike, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q3 2019 Earnings Conference Call.","Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Chris Evenden","Thanks Mike. Welcome to EA's third quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO, and Blake Jorgensen, our COO and CFO.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we've posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model, and a transcript.","With regards to our calendar, our Q4 fiscal 2019 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, May 7, 2019.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, February 5, 2019, and disclaims any duty to update them.","During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Note that our results reflect our adoption of ASC 606 as of the beginning of fiscal 2019 and for more information on this change, please see the accounting FAQ we have posted on our IR website.","Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks Chris.","The gaming industry continued to grow through the holiday quarter in our fiscal year 2019. It\u2019s been a highly competitive year, with lots of great new content for players around the world. In the face of this competition, we had significant challenges in Q3 and did not perform up to our expectations. We expect these challenges will continue to impact our performance in Q4, which has led us to lower our full fiscal year net revenue guidance today.","Let me first discuss our challenges and the adjustments we are making to address them, then I will discuss the opportunities ahead.","We'll start with Battlefield V. We made some decisions on launch timing and key features of this game that we felt would improve the quality of the experience. For context, Battlefield V was designed from the beginning to offer a long-term live service.","In August, we determined that we needed some more time for final adjustments to the core gameplay to fully deliver on the potential of the live service, so we moved the ship date to November to accommodate those goals. Unfortunately, the later release date meant the game launched deeper into a competitive holiday window where heavy price discounting was a big factor. In addition, we also made the decision to prioritize other features, including a single-player experience, at launch over a Battle Royale mode. This year, Battle Royale modes became incredibly popular in shooter games. As a result of these decisions, we struggled to gain momentum and we did not met our sales expectations for the quarter.","Importantly though, the Battlefield franchise is strong. More than 27 million fans have played our Battlefield games this fiscal year-to-date. Our focus is now on bringing more of these players into Battlefield V with new modes and great content through our live service.","In March, we'll kick off our third chapter of updates in the game, which will include, amongst other things, Firestorm Battle Royale. This will be a unique take on the royale genre, integrating unique Battlefield characteristics including strategic squad gameplay, varying objectives, and vehicles. We're responding to our players in Battlefield V by delivering the content they want most into the live service, on a cadence that will fuel the community with fresh new experiences for many months to come.","Next I'll touch on mobile. While the mobile market is strong and expected to continue growing nearly 10% next year, the dynamics have become increasingly challenging. The data we have indicates that the average age of Top 20 titles is greater than three years, and that it\u2019s harder than ever for new games to break through.","With our latest release, Command & Conquer: Rivals, we had positive soft launch results, but since global release it has not driven installs organically at the levels we anticipated. We are now working to bring more players into that game. We continue to be committed to mobile. We believe in the value of our franchises in the marketplace, and we are doubling down on these games through live services. We are also putting our best teams on bigger projects, and exploring additional ways to create and iterate quickly. We have always focused on profitability in mobile, and we are evolving to better position ourselves for growth in the future.","Our performance in Asia was also not as strong as expected through Q3. In Korea, FIFA Online 4 is performing well, with monthly average players exceeding the trajectory of FIFA Online 3 in a similar period from launch. Given nuances in the Chinese market, our transition to FIFA Online 4 has been slower than anticipated, and FIFA Mobile is still in early stages after launching in the market. We have long-term strategies with robust content plans for both games that, combined with the popularity and growth of soccer in the region, we believe will fuel further growth.","FIFA continues to be a growing business for us. In fact, we sold more units of FIFA last calendar year than any year before, and we welcomed four million new players into our FIFA ecosystem on console and PC. Our plans for FIFA 18 were aggressive in a World Cup year, and we ended up selling an additional 2.4 million units of FIFA 18 throughout the year, with the intention of converting those players to FIFA 19 when it launched.","The conversion has been slower than planned, leading to unit sales that were effectively flat year-over-year. In a year where there was intense competition and many iterative titles were challenged, FIFA 19 still became the best-selling console game in Europe last calendar year. Even on a flat year-over-year install base, FIFA Ultimate Team has performed well, and it accelerated in January with our most successful Team of the Year event ever. Our competitive gaming programs are also adding strength to the franchise, with our expanded FIFA Global Series already garnering 80% more total minutes watched compared to last fiscal year, along with new sponsor engagements and partnerships with industry leaders such as Eleague, Gfinity, and PGL. We continue to be very positive on the strength of FIFA and FIFA Ultimate Team around the world.","We made some calculated decisions that did not work as planned in Q3, and we did not execute well in other areas of our business. Against the backdrop of a very competitive quarter, the combination of those factors led to our underperformance. While we are disappointed with the results, we understand where our challenges are, and we are deeply focused on applying the strengths of our company to address them going forward.","We are a learning organization. Over the last six months, we've made organizational changes to shape our teams against our priorities for the future. We've made operational changes to better position ourselves to effectively drive live services and serve our player communities. We've made creative changes, including the formation of a Creative Council to strengthen our creative decision-making. And we will continue to make refinements in each of these dimensions as we focus sharply on execution across the company. The future of this industry is strong, and so is the future of Electronic Arts.","As you saw yesterday, we just launched Apex Legends, a new free-to-play Battle Royale game from Respawn. This is very exciting for us. Built from the ground-up to bring innovation to the genre, there are so many unique elements of Apex Legends, from the characters, to the gameplay mechanics, to the teamplay construct. To compete in the highly-competitive Battle Royale space, we also deliberately chose a different go-to-market strategy to surprise and delight players around the world. The launch yesterday was EA's biggest reveal ever by peak concurrent viewers, and it quickly became the number one game on Twitch. The Respawn team has a strong plan for Apex Legends that will engage fans for a long time to come. As the live service evolves, Respawn also plans to launch a premium game this year that is a new twist on the Titanfall universe. More to come on that in the months ahead.","Also this month, we will launch Anthem, BioWare's epic new game. Our teams at Bioware have poured so much passion into crafting every aspect of this massive new IP. Millions of fans played more than 40 million hours of Anthem in our recent demos, and we're very pleased to see the excitement in retail and digital channels reaching higher-than-expected levels. Anthem has been on dozens of lists for the most-anticipated games of 2019, and the full game launches on February 22.","Looking ahead to FY20, we have a large slate of new games, beginning with some big new additions in our next FIFA title. There was great energy and engagement from NFL fans throughout this past season, we're excited for our plans with the Madden NFL franchise. We will continue innovating and driving our NHL and NBA LIVE games deeper into the fabric of their respective sports. We'll have a new game for our Need for Speed fans, and a new title in our PvZ shooter franchise on console and PC.","In addition to Apex Legends, another team at Respawn is set to deliver Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order this fall. This game's development is led by the former director of the God of War series, with a team of veterans from some of the industry's biggest action-adventure games. It\u2019s very far along in development, and having spent time with it recently myself, it plays spectacularly well. This game truly captures the fantasy of becoming a Jedi, and we will have a lot more to share soon.","In FY20, we're also set to deliver more content and new experiences in more live services than ever before. We're excited to continue building on the success of our Ultimate Team modes for EA SPORTS. Our Sims franchise continues to thrive in live services \u2013 our Sims 4 community grew by 4.8 million unique players last year, our monthly active players continue to grow year-over-year, and we just crossed $1 billion in lifetime revenue for the game.","We continue to have strong expectations for The Sims going forward, and in FY20 we're bringing at least 20 new content drops and expansion packs to our Sims games across PC, mobile and console. We will continue to support Battlefield V and Anthem throughout the year, and Apex Legends will bring seasons of new content and much more to its players. With the breadth and depth of our live services offerings, we are focusing on delivering more of the content that resonates with our communities to drive additional upside opportunities in FY20.","This is a challenging second half of our FY19. We are making critical adjustments to sharpen our focus on execution, and to ensure we are well-positioned to deliver more great games and services to our players.","Now I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks, Andrew.","When we guided the year last May, we had high expectations for Battlefield V, we expected to grow our existing mobile titles and had anticipated launching two new mobile games. As Andrew outlined, it didn't play out as we planned. We decided to move Battlefield V into a difficult launch window against heavily discounted competition; and on mobile, we moved one of our titles out of the year. C&C Rivals is ramping slowly, and we made changes to Madden Mobile that reduced monetization. On top of this, unprecedented competition for players' time impacted the growth of our titles.","However, the performance of FIFA and FIFA Ultimate Team was a bright spot, with the franchise proving extremely resilient in the face of intense competition. In addition, we set a new third quarter record for operating cash flow over the last twelve months.","I have decided to give additional details this quarter about which parts of our business are, and are not, performing up to our expectations. I'll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of the business. To compare this quarter's results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.","EA's net revenue was $1.289 billion, below our guidance by $86 million. Operating expenses were $634 million, $96 million lower than our guidance, driven by variable compensation and related expenses, and some phasing of marketing expenses.","GAAP operating income was $242 million, and resulted in an earnings per share of $0.86, $0.25 better than our guidance.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $954 million, up $105 million from last year. Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $1.563 billion.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $21 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $933 million. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.","During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares at a cost of $292 million, leaving $1.59 billion in our two-year $2.4 billion buyback program we began last May.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.2 billion.","Life to date, FIFA 19 full game unit sales are roughly flat to FIFA 18, and slightly below our expectations. We believe the underperformance was driven by the intense competition throughout this year. It is possible that the success of the World Cup promotions pulled FIFA 19 sales into FIFA 18, given that, during calendar 2018; we sold more copies of FIFA than ever before. Fiscal year-to-date sales of FIFA 19 are approximately 20 million units, and we've also sold over 3 million units of FIFA 18 this fiscal year. And, as Andrew said, FIFA 19 was the best-selling console game in Europe in calendar 2018.","FIFA Ultimate Team delivered its best quarter ever, up 6% from last year's Q3, which was an all-time high due to the addition of esports. Although fewer people than expected have bought FIFA 19, average spend per payer is up over last year's title. Madden Ultimate Team is up double-digits life to date.","As Andrew discussed, the desire to make changes to Battlefield V led us to move its launch into a more difficult window, and prioritizing the single-player campaign over Battle Royale also hurt sales. As a result, we sold 7.3 million units in the quarter, about 1 million less than comprehended by our Q3 guidance.","However, people play Battlefield for a long time, and we're in this for the long haul. Battlefield 1 still has nearly 4 million monthly active users, and Battlefield 4 has nearly two million, more than five years after its launch. When we released the Season 2 content in January, Battlefield V became the largest Battlefield game ever. And we have an exciting live services plan ahead of us, with the launch of the Firestorm Battle Royale game mode in March and continuing through fiscal 2020. The live services content presents an opportunity for upside as we look to sell more copies of the base game and players invest in cosmetic changes to their characters.","Battlefield V drove fewer Origin Access Premier subscriptions than we had hoped, given the difficult launch of the game. We remain committed to subscriptions, and we look forward to attracting further subscribers with the launch of Anthem. We are using the launches this year to help us drive the evolution of the service.","We entered the year expecting strong Mobile growth, but a combination of a delayed game and underperformance means the business will end the year down.","The mobile market is characterized by a small number of highly successful games together with a long tail of much smaller games, many of which merely break even or actually lose money. Our focus has been, and continues to be, on building profitable franchises. Our business continues to be profitable, but growth is unpredictable in such a market. We continually review how we might improve the performance of this business.","We launched Apex Legends, a Battle Royale experience in the Titanfall universe, yesterday. It's free to play but a day in is too early to talk about the power of the business model. The Respawn team has executed well to deliver an innovative take on the Battle Royale genre. They have enthusiastically driven the creation of one of the few large-scale free-to-play experiences on console, and we have a great live services to come.","Digital net bookings were $1.199 billion, down 3% on the year-ago period. Strong digital sales of Battlefield V compared to Star Wars Battlefront II were more than offset by the decline in our mobile business and the extra game launch in last year's third quarter. Digital net bookings now represent 74% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 67% in the prior year.","Live services net bookings were down 0.4%, to $784 million. FIFA Ultimate Team grew, but did not offset the decline in Battlefield 1 live services and FIFA Online in Asia.","Mobile delivered net bookings of $142 million, down 22% year on year, with declines across our portfolio. We had made some changes to Madden Mobile in order to broaden its appeal, but monetization fell. We continue to work to turn this around.","Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $273 million, 5% higher than last year. Growth was driven by the ongoing shift to digital, in particular, for FIFA 19, for which sell-through is 27% digital, life to date, compared to 21% for FIFA 18 last year. Overall, 47% of our units sold were through digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to just 37% a year ago. Because Battlefield V skews much more digital than Star Wars Battlefront II, we continue to model underlying annual growth of about 5 percentage points.","Turning to guidance. Our expectation for full-year GAAP net revenue is $4.875 billion, and diluted earnings per share of $3.20. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.35 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.225 billion.","We now anticipate fiscal 2019 net bookings of $4.75 billion. This is below our previous expectations, based primarily on performance to date of Battlefield V, mobile, and Origin Access. We model Anthem units in the 5 to 6 million unit range, and do not model material net bookings for Apex Legends in the quarter.","For the fourth quarter, we expect net revenues of $1.163 billion, cost of revenue to be $265 million, and operating expenses of $715 million. OpEx is up year-on-year, primarily due to the launches of two major titles as opposed to one last year, and increased investment in R&D. This results in diluted earnings per share of $0.56 for the fourth quarter using the diluted share count of 303 million.","We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.17 billion. This is slightly down year-on-year, with Anthem offset by broad-based weakness.","Our experiences this quarter have reset our expectations for growth this year and next. And that means we must make some hard choices about investments. Nevertheless, this quarter has shown that we will continue to be a business with great brands that enable us to generate strong cash flow for investors.","In fiscal 2020, we will continue to innovate in our sports titles, with growth for them expected to be in the range of flat to up 5%. In particular, FIFA 20 will include some significant new features, and we plan for both FIFA and FIFA Ultimate Team to grow over this year. We will drive the Titanfall universe forward with Apex Legends live services and a premium game later in the year. We will launch Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, a new Plants vs. Zombies shooter and a new Need for Speed. We have modest expectations for Battlefield and Anthem live services, given that they are not yet proven. We continue to refine mobile live services and work on new games.","Overall, we expect net bookings to grow low-single-digits and the underlying profitability to grow in line with that. We will provide further details and a P&L forecast when we report in May.","To sum it up, FIFA stands out as a robust franchise through a tumultuous year in the videogame industry. We are making changes to improve execution and we're refocusing R&D investments to projects with near to medium-term returns without impacting our long-term vision. Meanwhile, we're looking forward to giving Star Wars fans the opportunity to live the life of a Jedi in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, to continue to innovate our ever-popular PvZ brand, and deliver another action-packed installment of Need for Speed.","And now I'll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks Blake.","The gaming industry is strong, and it continues to grow. New genres have emerged and become massively popular. Free-to-play is reaching across more platforms and geographies. Subscriptions and cloud gaming are strong future growth opportunities. And above all else, great content continues to be the lifeblood of our industry.","As Blake and I have talked about, we are experiencing a difficult second half of FY19. We're disappointed with our underperformance. We are confident in our overall strategy, but we are making deliberate changes to our organization, our operational processes, and our creative focus to address our challenges.","Importantly, we are confident and excited by our incredible portfolio of strong brands, our talented teams, our commitment to live services, and our pipeline of new games. We have a slate of EA SPORTS titles that have performed well even in light of increased competition this year. FIFA in particular continues to demonstrate its leadership as a top title in the industry, and it is growing as a business. We will build on the continued success of our EA SPORTS portfolio with significant innovation and new ways to play in FY20.","We have our deepest line-up of new IP in more than a decade. We're very excited about the opportunities we have with Apex Legends, Anthem, and Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in the year ahead.","We're also set to bring new games and live service content to some of our fan-favorite franchises. In FY20, we will have new games for our Need for Speed and PvZ shooter fans. We plan to bring a lot of great new content to the passionate and growing player base in The Sims 4, and we're focused on exciting more Battlefield players with upcoming additions to Battlefield V. We will also double down on live services in our top mobile franchises, while pushing forward with new projects and taking the necessary time to set them up for success.","Our belief remains strong that the combination of subscriptions and streaming will be transformative to the future of gaming, and we are well-positioned for that evolution. Earlier this fiscal year we added a new frontline tier to our subscription offerings for PC players, and in the year ahead we plan to offer a subscription service on another major platform. We have a lot of great content coming in FY20, and we're excited for more players to experience it through our subscription programs across more platforms.","Our industry is growing, and we know expectations for EA are high. As we take action to address our challenges, our underlying business is strong, our pipeline is robust, our teams have amazing talent, and we're confident for the future.","With that, Blake and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions].","Your first question comes from Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs.","Mike Ng","Great, thank you for the question. I have two, just one for Blake and one for Andrew. Blake you mentioned that given the more tempered view on growth for next year, EA is making some hard choices out of investments that you're making, you discussed some of the things that you\u2019re focused on but I was just wondering if you could give us little bit more color on areas of the business that you may be pulling back on? And then for Andrew, I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the premium Battlefield Title for next year, it seems that in fiscal 2020 Respawn will now be operating or launching three titles between that one, Apex, and Star Wars, could you just talk about Respawn capacity for that? Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","So on the investment side, our view is we need to constantly be looking at the performance of all of our different lines of business and where those lines are performing as well as we want. We are focused on making some changes. We are focusing also on the pace of some of the investments, we're not changing our strategy, we're still following the notion that we\u2019re building a subscription and a network world that's prepared for both the existing platforms and future platforms like streaming. It's just the question of the pace. We want to make sure that we're very focused on the most important thing which is great content. Without great content delivery models like subscription or platforms like streaming don't mean very much. So I think, think about our approach as trying to double down on making sure we're building and delivering content and great live services experiences across console, PC, and mobile.","Andrew Wilson","On the second point, you mentioned Battlefield, I think it was tight and full that you\u2019re referencing. We have continued to invest in Respawn, on which Respawn did the acquisition. They now have two fully stocked teams one focused on the shooter genre and one focused on action adventure. They also have the benefit of a lot of EA scale and central resources, groups like EA Digital Platform, content development services which is kind of content and Q&A, security publishing et cetera.","And well, I don't have more to share on the particulars of what would come in for Titanfall. What I would say is Respawn are a tremendously creative team, they always anticipated that Apex Legends would be a spectacular game in the Battle Royale genre and that they would use that as a ramp point to continue to innovate and deliver a truly creative take on what Titanfall is in a premium context later on the EA.","Blake Jorgensen","And I\u2019ll answer that first just looking at Apex Legend should give view a context of what a superior set of game developers sit in Respawn. This team of people is exceptional and the type of game they've built and the innovative level of that game. And second, you'll start to see in the next few months glimpses of the Star Wars game and I think you'll be blown away by what you see. We've played 20 plus minutes of it last week and it is exceptional in terms of its like level of polish depth and what living inside of the Star Wars world is a Jedi and I think people will be blown away by.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Post from Bank America Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post","Great, thank you. We think about Battlefield two years ago is a runaway hit and it wasn't very competitive and then this year obviously Battlefield V this. Just can you talk about a little bit how much you attribute to really the competitive dynamics versus game execution and how can EA improve execution on its titles going forward so that you don't have that misses like the last two years. Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","I think it's a really good question. And I think that there is certainly an element of the market and competitive nature of the market that amplified or magnified so much challenges we've had. If I think about Battlefield 5 more holistically, I think we did not do a great job of building momentum early in the project. And I think about this not just in the context of development but I think about this in the context about broader execution against the entire campaign. Our launch didn't resonated strongly as we would have liked it to with players and we were never truly able to catch-up and as our competitors continued to build momentum whether that was Fortnite or Red Dead Redemption 2 or Call of Duty we continued to kind of store from where we needed to be.","I think you combine that with a move of the title, again I think that we made the right decision to move the title and service of the quality of the game and on balance those that bought into the game really enjoyed it and the game was better for that move. But the combination of a poor start in our marketing campaign together with what I think was a longer development cycle that put us into a more competitive window and the amplification that competitive window against some of those underperformance factors is how we resulted in Battlefield.","What I can tell you is we've gone back and we just completed our global publishing and marketing meeting for the year ahead, just last week. And part of what we have done there it's having far more real conversations early on. Getting the center of not just the production cycle of the game but what is the craving center and how we bring that game to market. And you should expect that we will be more innovative and more creative around both AL marketing campaigns and how we bring games to market and more diligent in our operation against execution of the project plans around development of video games on a go-forward basis. I mean something we are taking very seriously across the full -- the full landscape of development.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Handler from MKM Partners.","Eric Handler","Thank you very much and just a follow-up to Justin, he brought up some good points, how big of an issue do you see with marketing and significant changes need to be made here as you think about particularly marketing in the holiday quarter we saw you had issues several years back with Titanfall 2, despite the fact that was a good game from a ratings perspective. You had decent ratings for Battlefield V and maybe you could talk about what needs to change with marketing or is it just date selection, how are things going to evolve there? And then as a follow-up maybe you could talk about your mobile strategy in the past, has been more of choosing to go for singles and doubles. And in this environment can singles and doubles still work or do you have to go for the big home runs there?","Andrew Wilson","Okay. There is a lot in there. Let me start with marketing. I think what you have seen from us is some tremendous marketing across our portfolio, it is how FIFA was able to rise in the way it did through the year, it's how our sports franchises even in the phase of stiff competition still performed well. What I think when we go back and analyze what happened with Battlefield V and Titanfall 2, I think we failed to come to a true creative center of a campaign that was compelling for players. And we spent too long getting to that point. And by the time we got to lunch and we didn't have that creative center for the campaign, we had lost ground against that competitors. Our holiday quarter will always be competitive, in the past we have competed very well. What we have seen this year is that, we had some big misses early on and they gained momentum in terms of the impact ahead of our business over time.","As I just talked about with Justin's question, what we have done is gone back and built a formal robust process around how we find our creative center, it's called the reason to play and Chris Bruzzo, our CMO, and his entire organization have restructured the entire marketing conversation from the inception of game development through full campaign. And we expect that will put us in a significantly better position on a go-forward basis.","In the context of mobile and I think what you heard from us the prepared remarks is mobile is a tremendously powerful market place, it's a growing market place but we are seeing that it's getting harder and harder to break into that market. What we are seeing is that many, many thousands of games are launching and that only a few are finding success. And even great games are failing to break through.","What we're also seeing however is that two things are becoming true. One is that additional focus on existing live titles can deliver tremendous profitability over time and you should expect that we will do that. We're also seeing that patience is important. Some our competitors are having their games in the market for 12 months or 18 months and building and adjusting to drive growth in that space, and you should expect that from us also.","But what you did hear from us is that we will be focusing on best team on the big opportunities because in order to breakthrough gamers expect not just a really big brand, not just innovation in gameplay but they expect really big gameplay proposition and part of what we doing on a go-forward basis is focusing on some of those much bigger opportunities.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes, I'll just remind people that sports like it is in our core console and PC business is a critical component of long-term success in mobile I think life today we've generated over $1 billion in sports business and the beauty of that business is evergreen, it restarts every year and we're trying to continue to grow that with FIFA, with Madden, with NBA around the globe and that's the focus that we're going to continue to step into and trust we don't step up thinking we're going to hit a single or double we\u2019re always focused on trying to hit home runs and we\u2019ll continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Uerkwitz from Oppenheimer.","Andrew Uerkwitz","Hi, thanks gentleman. Can you talk about how cross play, cross progress is expected across the portfolio? And then, in particular, I see you're limiting either Apex or Anthem's potential. And then secondly, Andrew talked a lot about competition, one way to kind of solve increased competition is M&A. So could you talk about any updated thoughts on M&A? Thank you guys.","Andrew Wilson","So again, we think the cross play and cross progress is going to be a very important part of that future, and you should anticipate that we'll be doing more in that space. What AL information would suggest to us is that there is an tremendous amount of play across devices but that overrule liquidity in any gaming community is a good and positive thing even if it\u2019s only a few people or small portion of the community that utilizes that. We absolutely are looking to that in the context of Apex and we'll be looking at that across our portfolio with time and we think about franchises with tremendously large communities like FIFA and think that they would absolutely benefit from cross play and cross progress as more and more people come into these big communities.","Blake Jorgensen","And on the M&A front, we're always looking at virtually every opportunity that comes through. I think Respawn presents an example of how it's worked extremely well for us, we've had great integration with their company and we're obviously seeing the fruits of that now and will continue through the next year and longer.","Our view is continue to stay close to everyone, be in dialogue, so if there is opportunities that come up we're looking at those opportunities, we're always going to be focused on creating value for shareholders in our M&A discussions and sometimes private companies expectations on valuation don't match the public realities in the marketplace particularly in this last year as public market valuations have change dramatically for ourselves and others in the industry that hasn't necessarily been reflected again in some of the prior market valuations but we think over time that might and we want to make sure we're looking for some of the great properties that we know are out there and we're going to continue to do that. And part of the reason we're continuing to maintain the cash balance and the capital structure that we have is to be in a position to be at the table for any of those great properties that might come to market in the future.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju","Thanks. So I guess Andrew bigger picture Qubole is working on a streaming platform, Amazon also seems to be doing the same, I would presume Apple probably has ambitions here as well, so it seems like you as a content producer will have a lot more distribution outlets and optionalities from who will be wanting your content on their platform. So can you give us some perspective on how your distribution costs or I guess the platform royalties may change over time and how quickly that may change? And Blake can you give us a little bit more color on where you are in transitioning the FIFA Online 3 users to FIFA Online 4, where the status is that -- where the status of that is in between Korea and China as well as what may be the latest feedback from your distribution partner in regards to the regulatory environment in China? Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","Okay. I'll take the first one, you're right. There are a number of people or a number of entities working on streaming technology. We believe that is a good thing to the extent that we can massively increase the total addressable market of gamers and get to a point where 2.5 or 3 billion gamers exist, and they currently play in more devices can play in almost every device they own. We think that is a great thing. We also have technology that we have been developing internally that we think will actually be able to accelerate that through our partners and accelerate our ability to reach more customers through cloud service and cloud gaming.","In terms of kind of platform growth, I think it's too early to tell what we're seeing right now with some of the players in the marketplace and it seems to be a competition for who can charge content creators less money to distribute their content. I don't know what that net out, I think that will be good for us over time. I also think that increased total addressable market, our potential for more liquidity platform royalty structure combined with our ability to offer a robust subscription offering to many, many hundreds of millions or even billions of players over time represents a very, very big and strong opportunity for our future.","Blake Jorgensen","On Online 3 to Online 4, I think Korea, as Andrew mentioned, moving people faster from 3 into 4 and starting to grow 4. China, we are being more cautious along with our partner Tencent but some of the regulatory hurdles are starting to get cleared across the industry which I think will help us speed up that transition from 3 into 4. I was hoping that it would be fully transitioned by the end of this quarter and clearly if not, we think it's going to probably continue at least through the next quarter or maybe early next year but we do view that the long-term play there is a positive one particularly with the growth of soccer in that marketplace.","Stephen Ju","Okay, so Blake, just as a clarification when you talk about next year clarification, it's your fiscal year not calendar?","Blake Jorgensen","Yes, fiscal year exactly. So we will give you more update when we talk next quarter but my hope is it's not a headwind for us next year and actually becomes a tailwind for us.","Stephen Ju","Understood, thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","Fiscal year, thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jeff Cohen from Stifel.","Jeff Cohen","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Could you talk a little bit about what kind of operating margins we could see on the revenue that you expect from Apex Legends versus the revenue you get from a normal upfront game sell, I think it should be higher given that it's all digital? And then if you guys could give us some guidance in terms of maybe how to think about the sizing the potential for that game, that would be great as well?","Blake Jorgensen","Yes, I mean both of those are pretty hard after one day only because we don't have a lot of areas to look to that actually pegged, it's different business than say our largest Live services Ultimate Team. Ultimate Team you have people are predisposed to spend because they bought the base game coming in, so the payer ratios I think as we've talked about are much higher than what you would see in a pure free to play game like a mobile game where they are in single-digits.","Our hope is obviously we have high engagement and high number of users and the combination of those two things should drive what we believe is very profitable revenue, you are correct having all digital and having that come through either directly, our origin platform where there's no platform fees or through third-party platforms will help depend on what the ultimate profitability is but I think overall it should be very strong.","It's just hard for us to size that market more to come on that over the next couple of months as we get closer to doing guidance for next year. As I said we put very little revenue into this quarter four because we just didn't know but by the time we give guidance in May, we will have a much better sense of what we think that will be based on the number of users coming in and then those users that are spending across the Live Services that will continue to roll out.","Andrew Wilson","Well it is early, what I can say is that in the first 24 hours we had over 2.5 million unique users trending past towards 3 million unique users and nearly 600,000 peak and current users kind of in the middle of a Tuesday, so it's very early but the response to the game has been very, very strong. We've been the number one views game on Twitch since launch and player sentiment seems to be very, very high right now.","Jeff Cohen","Thanks guys. Yes the game definitely seems to be off to a strong start, will that revenue run through the live services line in the model?","Blake Jorgensen","Most likely, yes.","Jeff Cohen","Okay.","Blake Jorgensen","So you probably see obviously some growth there next year, if it's additive and successful which we think it will be, I think as Andrew was saying we're very excited about it, it's just so early, we don't want to put too much into the model yet and it's really not built when I gave that guidance earlier on low-single-digit or mid-to-low-single-digit for the total business that doesn't really anticipate a huge number for our live service business yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.","Ben Schachter","Hey Blake, I was wondering if you could just talk about the use of cash a bit more, you talked about M&A but given where the stock is should we think it would be more active in buyback? And then Andrew maybe you could talk a bit about China, is FIFA really the only opportunity for you guys there or should there be anything else, just any broad comments on Fortnite and how that's impacting you guys and the big holiday? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes, I will start Ben on the buybacks. I mean, we are two-thirds of the three quarters way through the first year of our $2.4 billion program which is a double of the last program, we've doubled our pace of buybacks and we're tracking to that. We will, as we have done I think consistently over the last few years review the buyback with our board at the end of our fiscal year and determine if we should continue on existing buyback or if we should increase it and that will be based on what our outlook is for the future as well as the cash flow generation. We spend less time focused on what the current stock price is, we want to be in the market every single day which we are and track to the buyback that we've made the commitment to the Street and we'll look at reviewing that each quarter as or -- each year as we near the end of the fiscal year so more to come when we give guidance again.","Andrew Wilson","And on China, I think as everyone would acknowledge, China is a very particular marketplace. We certainly see robust growth opportunities for FIFA but we also know that we did a small partnership deal around Command & Conquer mobile game recently that is performing very, very well in China. We know that the Plants vs Zombies brand is very strong in China as is the Need for Speed brand. And as that market continues to evolve and mature, we are seeing that brands like FIFA, brands like Need for Speed, Plants vs. Zombies, Command & Conquer and potentially The Sims, may have tremendous appeal there and working through plans on how we execute against that over time.","Operator","Your next question comes from Drew Crum from Stifel.","Drew Crum","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Can you talk about your expectations for live services going forward, it was fiscal 3Q the bottom and would you expect to see improvement in the out quarters and if so what are some of the drivers for improvement? And I guess separately on Anthem, you were pretty upbeat coming out of the last earnings report being three weeks away from launch having gone through the beta testing, have your expectations for the launch changed in any way and if so how and why? Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","Yes. So on live services remember it's a collection of items as we mentioned FIFA, Ultimate Team has largest quarter in history in Q3, Madden's continued to grow strong the counter is the offset in Battlefield 1 live services which are dying down as the tail of that live service is coming down. And we yet to ramp up Battlefield V live services and I don't, as I mentioned we don't have a large number in there for monetization on Battlefield or Anthem live services because we just don't know yet how those will perform. We're cautious that we want to not put too much revenue in until we really see that revenue.","So hard to say now our goal is to continue to grow live services obviously and we think Ultimate Team still has a lot of room to grow and some of the things that we're doing with both the FIFA and Madden for next year should help continue to drive with Ultimate Team growth in those two products as well as I just mentioned possibly some upside from Apex and Battlefield V and Anthem.","In terms of Anthem outlook, I think I mentioned five to six million units which is consistent with how we thought about it last quarter and we are comfortable with that based on what we're seeing and outcome of the demo. Both demos lot of excitement around and lot of interest people are realizing it is a game that's unlike any other game they've ever played. The opportunity to work with different suits, to fly, to go into the water I mean it is fabulous mechanics as you're playing the game, and people are enjoying it quite a bit. And so more to come as we learn more but we think there is a great opportunity not just this year for that game but that should sell well for a long period of time as we add more content through the live service plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick Johnson","Hey, good afternoon. I was hoping that you could talk about the in-game monetization strategies to be employed in Apex? Also any metrics that you can give us on Origin Access Premier help to understand your progress there. Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","So again, Apex is a free-to-play game and so many players may choose and continue to play all the way through the game and earn in-game currency so that they can level up and buy new unique cosmetic items for their character in their world.","There's going to be a couple of different modernization opportunities inside of Apex. There will be a revolving direct purchase option that will allow you to buy cosmetic items and at times buy new legends. None of those items will give you an advancement in play is not a play to win mechanic. It's really about differentiating game play and differentiating how you look in a world of a big and robust community.","In addition to that there will be Apex packs which is similar to a loot box mechanic where should you not wish to purchase direct, you can go in and buy items as part of a loot box mechanic. There will be repeats in that. So there's a whole system to insure that you always get something of value and again all will be cosmetic and in places you will get things through the loot box mechanic that are at a cheaper rate than buying through direct purchase.","The Respawn team have been very, very thoughtful around it, they've looked at a lot of great monetization strategies throughout the game industry. They've come at this with the opportunity to allow players who got to play the entire game for free, if they so choose, to direct purchase to get the things directly that they want, if they so choose all to use a loot box mechanic to experience that surprise and delight would have built in buffers and backups to ensure that players always receive something of value and that players aren't getting a whole bunch of duplicates through that system.","I'm actually really proud of what team has done and I think what we're seeing from early feedback from players is that they're on to something really special that's wide variety of users again. We expect that many, many tens maybe at some point hundreds and millions of people will look play this game and it was important for them to think through it, they are completely proud of where they got to.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Hickey from Benchmark.","Mike Hickey","Hey Blake, Andrew. Thanks for taking my questions, guys I appreciate it.","Andrew Wilson","You bet.","Mike Hickey","First I guess on Apex Legends, I guess congrats what an awesome deal, it's really hard to be surprised and your marketing efforts there were -- from Respawn were definitely exceptional buzz is high, I guess looks like Respawn also has a fair amount of work done on a content roadmap we have sustained some engagement, I was curious how you think maybe longer-term in extensions Mobile Asia, esports related to Apex in the Battle Royale genre. And also curious if you feel that there might be a tension between the Battlefield, Battle Royale experience and one that you just served with Apex Legends? Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","Great question. First is that Apex Legend is being built from the ground up with a view that it has the potential to engage and entertain hundreds of millions of players. And when you look at the game and I was watching being streamed early today, that's mesmerizing to watch. When you watch great players like Ninja playing the game, it's pretty special and exciting to watch, one of the more exciting games I have ever had the fortunate viewing. And so you can see very clearly as you watch and you play the game, that there are going to be opportunities to take the game in different directions over time. esports will almost certainly be part of that additional game modes, the impact of additional legends over time, great view content will have an impact.","As I said earlier, we are looking at how to take the game to mobile and cross play over time. And I also expect that this game will have tremendous value in Asia and we're in conversations about that. Some of those conversations as you might guess are new. We took a very deliberate strategy around how to launch this game. Again in a world where we have not executed as well on some things through the past six months as I would have liked, I think the development of marketing teams executed against this extraordinarily well and surprised a global industry.","The development team was very cautious about building a completely different game and wanted to make sure by the time they launched this game into the marketplace, it would surprise and delight players maybe how to play from day one. Our marketing team will also be very conscious that when you start talking about the innovative nature of this game, the core play, the squad play, the in-game mechanics, the communication system all the things that Respawn has done that we wanted to be very careful not to tip out hat or show our hand to the competition. We're going to come out with a truly innovative and creative game. And we also knew that the break into what it is a very competitive marketplace, we had to do something truly innovative with the launch.","I think the teams have done a tremendous job there and you should expect that we had very big and robust plans for this game and it will branch in a lot of different directions over time.","Blake Jorgensen","I just mentioned today in a tweet that they are planning on a premium product, we mentioned that today as well later in our fiscal 2020 that continues to evolve Title for our Universe. And I think there's a lot of exciting things on the roadmap that you'll learn more about in the coming months.","Andrew Wilson","And to the second part of your question around Battlefield Firestorm, we think that these while they sit inside the Battle Royale kind of genre, two very different types of experiences. What we've seen is the community who want to play these types of games is hundreds of millions of people strong. We think there is an opportunity to deliver the fast-paced play that is Apex Legends and where that game goes to a big part of the community. And then also the strategic play, the vehicle play, the things are unique to a Battlefield Battle Royale mode will offer differentiation of play for a different part of that community, and at some level there may also be some cross over. But given the size of the community, given the very different types of gameplay even inside the Battle Royale genre, we believe those two modes can fit very well together in the community.","Mike Hickey","I appreciate that.","Andrew Wilson","One more question.","Operator","Your last question comes from Tim O'Shea from Jefferies.","Tim O'Shea","Yes, so thanks for squeezing me in, I just love to hear your thoughts on the pros and cons of free-to-play and how full price games can perform in an environment where AAA content is given away for free. You obviously mentioned in the intense competition and looking at the fiscal 2019 outlook packaged goods which seems like a decent proxy for full price, it does imply a sharp step down here and just maybe a follow-up but what do you think is the right mix of business models going forward, we sort of articulate your vision around streaming games being streamed from the cloud, we heard you articulate a vision around subscriptions and now you surprised us with this big free-to-play game. Thank you for the questions.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes, I think remember the packaged goods decline is really just that digital shift and the shift towards more and more parts of our business having Live services. I think the issue around free-to-play is to make a free-to-play game work well, you have to have a huge audience, we believe Apex has the potential of that but there are many games out there that sell anywhere between 3 and 7 or 8 million units that are very successful games but those audiences aren't big enough to support a free-to-play game like you see in Mobile for example. Typical mobile games we see 80, 90 million downloads of a client, that's how you make a mobile game work and a free-to-play economics work. We always believe there's going to be multiple models.","There has been for many years, Asia's been primarily free to play but big games and big marketplaces but as you look at some of the more successful action oriented games of this past year like God of War, Spider Man, those are games that most likely aren\u2019t free-to-play style games because they're not big enough to sustain those types of economics and we think people want to consume games in different way, some through purchase, some through subscription, some through streaming purchase, or streaming subscription, and some through free-to-play models across many different platforms.","So we think it's a great way to continue to grow the industry, we think Fortnite help grow the industry another free-to-play games and this is an opportunity for us to try to participate at it.","Tim O'Shea","Thanks Blake. And also --","Blake Jorgensen","Go ahead, sir.","Tim O'Shea","I was just going to say thank you for the additional disclosure to this quarter.","Blake Jorgensen","Okay, good, thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","And I hope we had a chance to talk to everybody in the coming days and I appreciate everybody's time and we will talk soon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

You may begin.","Rob Sison","Thank you, and welcome to EA's Fiscal 2013 Fourth Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Larry Probst, our Executive Chairman; Blake Jorgensen, our CFO; and Frank Gibeau, our President of Labels. Peter Moore, our COO, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call and a transcript.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of May 7, 2013, and disclaims any duty to update them.","Throughout this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable GAAP measures for certain non-GAAP measures to be discussed are: For Q4, net revenue of $1.209 billion; digital revenue of $453 million; gross margin of 74.4%; operating expenses of $591 million and resulting EPS of $1.05 per diluted share. For the full fiscal year 2013, net revenue of $3.797 billion; digital revenue of $1.44 billion; gross margin of 63.4%; operating expenses of $2.288 billion and resulting EPS of $0.31 per diluted share.","During this call, unless otherwise stated, the financial metrics will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now I'll turn the call over to Larry.","Lawrence F. Probst","Thanks, Rob. As most of you know, I have agreed to serve as EA's Executive Chairman while the Board of Directors searches for a new CEO. In this role, I am focused on 3 key priorities: First, completing a fiscal '14 operating plan with a disciplined approach to cost control, along with growth on both the top and bottom line. Blake and Frank will take you through the details shortly, but I'm pleased to say we have locked a plan that delivers higher revenue while keeping our operating costs essentially flat. Doing that in the middle of a hardware transition will be a challenge, something we've never done in the 31-year history of this company, but we are committed to making it work.","Priority number two is to help drive the process in the Board of Directors' search for a new CEO. We don't have any specific news to share today on the timeline or candidates. However, I can tell you that both internal and external candidates are being considered.","Third and most important is to ensure EA is well positioned to deliver the best games and services on the next-generation consoles. Over the years, we've learned how great games delivered early in the cycle of a new platform can build strong and enduring relationships with our audience. This transition will determine market leadership for the rest of the decade, and we intend to win over consumers with world-class entertainment experiences. We have a saying at EA: \"Transition is our friend.\" This is a time when we tighten our belts and position the company for future growth and success. We cut operating costs, sharpen our product focus and made strategic investments in next-generation consoles, mobile and PCs. The world is changing, and technology is about to take another big leap forward. Our goal is to capitalize on this opportunity by delivering high-quality games and services to our consumers on their platform of choice.","With that, I'll hand it off to our CFO, Blake Jorgensen.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Thanks, Larry. First, I'd like to begin with Q4 results. During the March quarter, the packaged goods market on the West continued to be soft, characteristic of what happens during a console transition. EA's total Q4 non-GAAP net revenue was $1.04 billion, which was within our guidance. In the quarter, we saw solid sales for SimCity, most notably from direct downloads. However, Crysis 3 and Dead Space 3 came in below our forecast. Compared to the same period last year, net revenue was up 6%, driven mainly by our digital revenue. EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue increased 45% year-over-year to $618 million. Trailing 12-month digital net revenue was $1.66 billion, representing growth of 36%. Our digital business continues to be a diversified mix of high-growth, profitable segments.","Breaking the digital revenue down by type shows the following: First, full game downloads contributed nearly $100 million, up 65% compared to the same period last year. Full game downloads have typically been driven by PC products, and this quarter SimCity was a key driver of that growth.","Second, extra content and free-to-play contributed $224 million, up 45%, led by sustained growth in FIFA Ultimate Team and solid results from Star Wars: The Old Republic and Bejeweled Blitz. This revenue relates to business on PCs or consoles where consumers can enhance or extend their gaming experience by buying additional digital content, including virtual characters, virtual goods and map packs associated with console, browser-based games or MMOs. Our Star Wars: The Old Republic game is a combination of free-to-play and subscription business models. Both models are performing well. The game has attracted new free-to-play members and total active users are up. We continue to deliver new game updates for the community every 6 weeks, helping drive subscribers and free-to-play consumers to the game.","Third, our mobile business generated $104 million for the quarter and was up 21% over the prior year. Smartphones and tablets were a major portion of the revenue accounting for $79 million of the $104 million total, growing 27% year-over-year. Real Racing 3 successfully launched simultaneously on iOS and Android, while The Simpsons: Tapped Out continued to be a key contributor. We remain focused on this segment due to the significant global growth in the smartphone and tablet markets.","And fourth, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $191 million, growing 54% over the same period last year. The significant increase is primarily due to the recognition of $121 million of the full year's Battlefield 3 Premium subscriptions. We recognize this revenue in Q4 when we delivered the fifth and final expansion pack entitled End Game. As a reminder, the majority of the development and delivery costs were recognized in previous quarters.","Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin was 74%, in line with our guidance and up almost 10 percentage points over the prior year. Battlefield 3 Premium subscription revenue accounted for approximately 30% of this improvement, while the remaining gross margin expansion was due to a focused effort to reduce online support cost and solid results from the rest of our digital revenue offerings.","Operating expenses for the quarter were $540 million, $15 million higher than our guidance. We were above guidance due to charges associated with operating expense reduction actions and costs associated with the resignation of our CEO. Our cost reduction plans will reduce our overall headcount by approximately 10%. In total, $16 million of expenses were recognized in the quarter related to these actions. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.55 for the quarter, slightly below our guidance driven in part by the $16 million in severance costs.","Our cash, short-term investments and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $1.68 billion or roughly $5.60 per share. Approximately 60% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held outside of the U.S. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $233 million. For our full year 2013, operating cash flow was $324 million. Fiscal year '13 capital expenditures were $106 million, resulting in free cash flow of $218 million, more than double than what -- from last year's total.","During Q4, we repurchased nearly 1 million shares at a cost of approximately $13 million, bringing the total shares repurchased under the current program to 22 million shares at a total cost of $278 million. As a reminder, the current $500 million share repurchase program was initiated in August 2012.","Before we discuss guidance, we want to address a few housekeeping items. First, as we finalize our financial plan for fiscal year '14, we reevaluated the classification of certain operating expenses based on our current management operating structure. As a result, the company reclassified certain operating expenses, primarily headcount and facilities costs, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. These reclassifications are a resulting -- resulted in our financial disclosures -- are reflected in our financial disclosures and do not impact the company's consolidated operating results or our cash flows.","Second, we have stated in previous calls we are developing our games as a service model to create a deeper relationship with our customers. We've clearly seen success in this initiative as consumers are playing our games online over longer periods of time. However, this longer period affects the length of time over which we are required to recognize GAAP revenues. In fiscal '14, we will be lengthening this period resulting in approximately $500 million of net revenue being deferred into fiscal '15. This longer service period has no impact on our non-GAAP revenue or cash flows.","And third, the continued growth in our digital business is having a long-term benefit to our corporate tax rate, such that now we view our long term non-GAAP tax rate to be 25% instead of 28%. This change in our long term non-GAAP tax rate favorably impacts our fiscal 2014 guidance by $0.05 per share.","Turning to guidance. I'll start with a brief overview of the gaming sector for this current calendar year. We estimate that the worldwide gaming market will continue in the mid-to-high single-digit percentage for the calendar year 2013. This is driven by continued digital market growth, offset by packaged goods declines as we reach the end of the current console cycle. In Western markets, the growth will be flat because the console transition has a more significant impact than it does in the rest of the world. For fiscal year 2014, we plan to release 11 major titles, including the highly anticipated Battlefield 4 and the Sims 4 compared to 13 titles in fiscal year 2013. Along with these major titles, we will release approximately 15 mobile titles on the iOS and Android platforms. Frank will provide you with more detail on our title plans for the coming year.","Starting in fiscal year 2014, we are changing our guidance approach, providing investors with a single point estimate for each of our key metrics. GAAP revenue for the fiscal year is expected to be $3.5 billion, and we expect GAAP loss per share of $0.97 per share as a result of recognizing GAAP revenue over a longer period of time. And as a reminder, we do not differ any cost of sales. Non-GAAP revenue for the fiscal year is expected to be $4 billion, and we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.20 per share, which reflects the change in our long term corporate tax rate. With this change, non-GAAP diluted EPS -- without this change, non-GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.15 per share. This guidance forecasts over 5% of total non-GAAP revenue growth. We believe this reflects the current softness in the packaged goods market and the challenges associated with the anticipated console transition.","Segmenting the sales provides further insight to the key drivers of our full year revenue. Packaged goods and distribution revenue is estimated to be approximately $2.3 billion, up 7%, driven by Battlefield 4 this year versus Medal of Honor in the prior year. The growth will be partially offset by the decrease in the number of announced launches and a tempered view of our current generation of launches as we are in the late stages of the console cycle. Digital revenue is forecasted to generate over $1.7 billion, up 4%. Growth of our digital revenue is masked by the decline of our subscription business due to the $121 million of Battlefield Premium that was recognized in fiscal year '13. Our digital business would show a much higher growth if we had recognized Battlefield 3 Premium ratably.","Breaking down our digital revenue into its 4 primary categories, we see sustained growth in the key areas. Our mobile revenue is expected to grow over 30% as the smartphone and tablet market continues to expand at a significant pace. In addition, we plan on launching more titles and content. Frank will provide more insight into our mobile offerings. Full game downloads are anticipated to grow over 25% due to the Battlefield and Sims launches, both historically strong PC franchises with a high level of direct download attach rates. Extra content and free-to-play will be flat year-over-year, due to the reduction in the number of social game titles and given the console transition. We are now placing greater emphasis on mobile and less on social games. And lastly, subscription revenue is expected to decline approximately 20% as we recognized a full year of Battlefield 3 Premium in fiscal year '13. Based on this segmentation, digital revenue will be approximately 43% of our total revenue. The anticipated heavier mix of packaged goods revenue does impact the gross margin growth and, therefore, we are forecasting gross margins to be approximately 66%.","GAAP operating expense for the fiscal year is expected to be around $2.32 billion, flat over the prior year. Non-GAAP operating expense for the fiscal year is expected to be approximately $2.15 billion, essentially flat to the prior year. This includes our investment in next-generation consoles, as well as the development cost for the newly announced Star Wars titles, and it is the first time during a console transition that our operating expenses are being held flat. It should be noted that included in guidance is approximately $25 million of severance payments. The majority of this expense will be recognized in the first quarter. These payments relate to our Q1 efforts to reduce operating expenses as part of our goal to expand our operating margins.","Focusing on Q1, GAAP revenue is expected to be $875 million as compared to $955 million in the prior year. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $0.33 a share as compared to $0.63 per share in the prior year. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $450 million, an 8% decrease over last year's $491 million. In the first quarter of fiscal '13, we benefited from continued strong demand for Mass Effect 3 compared to this quarter's only new title, FUSE. Despite the decrease in revenue, gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 62%.","Operating expenses will be impacted by the severance payments, and we expect our total non-GAAP operating expense to be $530 million. For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP loss per share of $0.62 as compared to the loss of $0.41 per share last year. $0.02 of this quarter's loss is due to the change in tax rate.","Looking at the phasing for the year on a non-GAAP basis, we expect a heavier concentration of revenue in our fiscal third quarter compared to previous years. We will have fewer console launches and with Battlefield 4 launching in the holiday period, Q3 will be a larger revenue quarter than in prior years. Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal year '14, we are forecasting operating cash flows of approximately $400 million and capital expense of approximately $100 million. We expect free cash flow of $300 million versus $218 million in fiscal 2013.","Now I'll turn the call over to Frank.","Frank D. Gibeau","Thanks. As Blake noted, it was a challenging year with both hits and misses on the product front. However, we're proud of our overall product quality, our progress in digital and our record for creating blockbusters across multiple genres and on multiple platforms. Additionally, the investments we made last year in next-gen technology will deliver great games this year. Now I want to offer some color on Q4 and a look ahead to the games we're developing in the new fiscal year for consoles, mobile and PC.","I'll start with Q4 and SimCity, a great game that has recovered from a challenging launch. The short explanation for the launch is that the initial rush of consumers overwhelmed our gaming service, disrupting the consumer experience. As we stabilized the game and improved service in the first week, fans continued to pour in. So far, we are ahead of forecast, with more than 1.6 million units sold through to customers. The digital story is particularly strong, nearly 50% of those sales were high-margin digital downloads. The key takeaway here, SimCity is a highly resilient global franchise with a long service life in front of it, but we learned our lesson and are now building better processes to anticipate that service demand. This will not happen again.","Also in Q4, we had some success that affirms our belief in the ongoing growth of the mobile and PC platforms. On mobile, The Simpsons: Tapped Out developed by our Bike [ph] studio continues to perform at the top of the Apple app charts and the Google Play Store, with more than 13 million installs. With the recent Android release of The Simpsons, it hit 5.4 million DAUs at its peak across both leading mobile platforms. And our latest content update, Whacking Day, has been well received, suggesting another great year ahead for The Simpsons: Tapped Out.","Another breakthrough mobile title is Real Racing 3, a visually stunning game from our Firemonkeys Studio. This one has registered more than 30 million installs to date and was the #1 racing title on iOS last month. In April, we received and released an update to address fan requests for more cars and a cloud save feature, which allows players to transfer data between multiple devices. Another title developed by our Firemonkeys Studio is Sims FreePlay, an EA-owned IP and despite having launched nearly 1.5 years ago, it is stronger than ever. The game has more than 55 million installs. And after 18 months, the audience and revenue is still growing. The trend line on mobile is hard to miss with thousands of new titles added every month, consumers accept nothing short of top-quality games. Our strategy is to give them exactly that.","We are also seeing traction in Asia with FIFA Online 3 and a powerful new publishing partnership with Nexon. FIFA Online 3 is the #1 online sports game in Korea based on both traffic and revenue. This one went into open beta in December, and it's still ramping with more than 3.1 million registered players already. In the year ahead, we have focused our creative teams to deliver high-quality games on HD consoles, mobile and PC, while further tightening our cost structure. This improved focus allows us to do this while keeping our operating expenses essentially flat. This will be the first time in the history of EA that we've executed against a console transition without a significant increase in R&D.","In fiscal '14, we will release 11 major titles across consoles and on the PC. This includes our core sports titles: Madden, FIFA, FIFA Manager, NBA Live, NHL and NCAA Football, as well as Need for Speed, Battlefield, Command & Conquer, and from our partners at Insomniac, FUSE. And as we announced yesterday on EA's blog, we will publish the Sims 4 on PC in early 2014.","Regarding next-generation consoles, we are under a nondisclosure agreement with our platform partners. However, we're planning a full reveal at E3, including more next-generation titles in development for fiscal '14. This will include breakthroughs in graphics and gameplay for some of our biggest franchises, including Battlefield, FIFA, Madden, NBA Live and Need for Speed. We plan to unveil new titles from EA SPORTS, BioWare and DICE, and a first look at some brand new games.","In March, our DICE Studio debuted Battlefield 4 with a stunning 17-minute demo entitled Fishing in Baku. Critics were blown away by the advanced physics and graphics and fans demonstrated their support. Pre-orders are going extremely well. Join us at E3 for a deeper look at the title that will define the next generation of gaming, Battlefield 4.","I also wanted to call out a big accomplishment by the teams that built the development engines for our next generation of games. Frostbite 3 engineered at DICE and a brand-new engine from EA SPORTS. These world-class tech stats are powering all of our development on the new systems. They provide an enduring common technology that saves cost, fosters efficiency and provides spectacular physics and graphics for our games. This isn't a vision. These engines are fully functional right now and powering the games you'll see at E3 in June. You'll hear more about Frostbite 3 and our new sports engine at our E3 investors breakfast in June.","One more positive milestone is the recent licensing agreements we have reached with partners in our sports businesses, including FIFA, the PGA TOUR, the NHL and NHL Players' Association. Together with our long-term agreements with the NFL, NFLPA, NBA, CLC and the UFC, this bodes well for fans who will continue to get games with all the teams and players they love.","Next, this year is a big year for our PopCap studio in Seattle, beginning with the highly anticipated Plants vs. Zombies 2 and an all-new title from the Bejeweled team. We'll also see mobile titles from EA SPORTS and a continued release of new content and features for our 2 existing blockbusters: Real Racing 3 and The Simpsons: Tapped Out.","On PC, we are developing an incredible new version of our classic Command & Conquer Generals, powered by the Frostbite 3 engine, featuring an amazing array of units, armies, generals, deep PVP modes and maps with physics-based destructible environments. Moving on to the Sims 4, the Sims is one of EA's most enduring franchises, with more than 150 million games sold since it debuted in 2001. We listened closely and designed a game that incorporates the incredible feedback from our players. First and foremost, the Sims 4 will be designed as a single player offline experience, with integrated community features that allows players to connect and share their creativity in compelling new ways. However, it will not require that players always be online to play the game.","Finally, big news yesterday from Disney and EA. We have an agreement to develop and publish several new games on the epic Star Wars franchise. Millions of Star Wars fans all over the world are waiting to hear more about these games. We are not releasing details about the games today, but some of our most renowned and innovative creative teams are working on ideas in the Star Wars universe. DICE and Visceral will produce new games joining BioWare, which is already developing games for the Star Wars franchise. The new games may borrow on films, but will be entirely new stories and new gameplay. Powering it all will be our Frostbite 3 game engine.","With that, I'll hand it back to Larry.","Lawrence F. Probst","Thanks, Frank. To summarize, EA is in very good shape. At the core is a great team delivering innovative games and services. We have invested in product quality, digital delivery and sustainable leadership on console, PCs and mobile. In recent weeks, we underwent a reorganization to focus our product portfolio and reduce our operating costs, and we have constructed an ambitious but achievable business plan for our employees and shareholders. Best of all, we have an incredible lineup of games and services for our consumers.","With that, Blake, Frank, Peter and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess first off, curious now that you're talking a little bit more about the next gen, how should we expect EA's consumer online service in Origin fit together with some of the other platforms that have similar online services and platforms like Sony and Microsoft? And then secondly, sounds like you're seeing some better traction in The Old Republic since the switch to free-to-play and was hoping you could provide a little more color on some of the stats from the game, perhaps with a breakout as between free-to-play and the subscription side?","Frank D. Gibeau","Sure. This is Frank. I'll start with the second question first. As you know, last year we took a new approach in Austin by introducing some new pricing models to Star Wars: The Old Republic including a free-to-play model for our fans. Since it was introduced in November, we've added more than 1.7 million new players on the free model to the service, and the number of subscriptions has stabilized at just under 0.5 million. The really interesting thing that's happening inside the service right now is monthly average revenue for the game has more than doubled since we introduced the free-to-play option. And as we look forward, we're going to continually invest in new content for the service for players every 6 weeks or so. We just recently released Rise of the Hutt Cartel as our first major digital expansion, and it's reviewed extremely well, and it's selling very well. So it's early days, but we're very cautiously optimistic about how the conversion to free-to-play has gone for Star Wars: The Old Republic. As it relates to online services and next-generation platforms in your first question, there's not a lot of details I can give you on the call right now. We want to wait until E3 happens, and we start to get more public about what's possible with these next-generation platforms. But just know this, Electronic Arts is a content company but it\u2019s also a platform company. It's a company that is invested in building out capabilities that is allowing us to connect consumers across multiple platforms. And so that part of our mission still remains true, but we'll have to wait until E3 to give you more detail on how that manifests itself inside the next-gen platforms.","Peter Robert Moore","Yes, and Colin, let me address the Origin question. Just to update you on the installs, we're now at 47 million, of which 27 million are on the PC and then 20 million on mobile. And as you might imagine, with Battlefield 4 coming this year, we're expecting a very strong comp year-on-year on Origin. We love the fact that we can interact directly to our consumers through the Origin platform, and you can expect to see a ton of new consumer-friendly gamer-friendly upgrades in the feature set this year.","Operator","Edward Williams from BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a couple of quick questions. Larry, I was wondering if you and Blake can kind of follow up on your comments with regards to kind of your confidence level in the cost structure as we enter this console transition, given as you pointed out, Larry, that it's been 31 years, you haven't been able to keep costs flat on a year-to-year basis. And then secondly, Frank, if you can tell me a little bit more, just clarify for me a little bit more about Star Wars in terms of which platforms the games actually can be playable on?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Let me start. This is Blake. I'll start with the operating margin question around the console transition. I think as everyone knows, we've given guidance over the last year that we were spending roughly $100 million a year on next-gen development. We've continued to include that in our expenses. What we've done is we've gone through a very detailed process to eliminate expenses associated with products that either aren't growing or aren't large enough or aren't on platforms that we feel are long-term viable in the industry. And then we've also focused on how to minimize costs around the support structures inside the organization to make sure that the studios are getting the core funding for developing games. And so we've tried to consolidate our marketing organizations. We've tried to consolidate our G&A support to make sure that we have a very lean structure. And we've taken those actions during the last 2 quarters to try to tee us up in a position where we'd be able to announce to you that we're going to hold our costs flat for the coming year. We're very confident of that. And for those who know Larry, he's a very tough manager. And so he's holding the executive team to that goal, and we're very focused on continuing to look for ways to bring our operating costs down to continue on the journey of expanding our margins.","Frank D. Gibeau","On the -- this is Frank. On the second question about the agreement with Disney. We are not offering any additional details on which titles we're doing right now, but I do want to clarify and call out one thing that we do have rights to make the games on all platforms: console, PC, mobile and tablet. So for the products that we're building, you can expect that you'll see them across all of those major platforms. And we're very excited about the studios, at DICE and Visceral and BioWare are really fired up, and we're excited about this opportunity and how it fits into our overall portfolio.","Operator","Justin Post from Merrill Lynch.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Blake, maybe you could reconcile the $0.85 this year to the $1.15 next year x the tax change. What are the big, big drivers and how confident are you in that $1.15? Is there an upside case to that number that you guys are thinking about and maybe what are the potential risks?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Justin, so I think -- let's start with the top, at the revenue line, the $4 billion in revenue we believe is a realistic revenue number within the guidance or within the confines of a console transition. As I said, we've tempered our views on the Gen3 titles, particularly our sports titles which will be out in the early fall. We also are very optimistic about Battlefield 4. The pre-orders look very strong, and we've had great reaction to the demos, as Frank has mentioned. So we're confident about the revenue line and that represents some serious growth across all of our different components, digital and packaged goods. On the OpEx side, we're also confident primarily because some of the cost actions we've taken and the fact that we fully baked in estimates for marketing expenses associated with both Gen3 and Gen4 titles, the costs associated with developing the new Disney Star Wars titles and the continued expansion of the mobile titles that Frank mentioned in his topic. So all in, I think we're in very good shape. The CapEx line is pretty consistent with what it has been in the past. And so we're fairly confident that we can deliver those subject to massive change in the market in the next couple of quarters. But based on what our expectations are for a smooth transition and primarily Gen3 revenues for us for the year, we're fairly confident of that.","Lawrence F. Probst","To answer your question about risk, I think the primary issue relates to the next-generation consoles and the questions are when and what kind of quantities and what sort of price point. But we think we have planned conservatively around that issue and around those questions, and we have a high level of confidence in the guidance we provided.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And one maybe follow-up. How are you thinking about the Sims 4? Is that a really important earnings driver in the year?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Well, it's clearly 100%-owned IP. As SimCity, that was in Q4, it's an important earnings driver in the fourth quarter. But I would take our announcement now a full -- almost a year ahead of schedule that we're very focused on making sure it's delivered in the quarter and will be delivered in a way in which we think consumers will gravitate to the title. And we'll see both strong packaged goods, as well as digital business in that title.","Operator","Arvind Bhatia from Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I had a couple of questions. First of all, I was wondering if you guys can talk about Battlefield Premium, what you're assuming for fiscal '14 relative to fiscal '13? And then a couple of product questions on the NBA Live product. It's coming back. It's in your lineup now. Maybe a quick update on where that is in development?","Frank D. Gibeau","Sure, Arvind. This is Frank. I'll take both questions. On NBA, we're very focused on getting into the NBA business in a significant way this year. It's a very competitive category. We're the clear market leader there. So you'll learn more about our plans on NBA at E3, and we're very excited about that. As it relates to Battlefield Premium, we have no announcements at this time as it relates to a potential premium program for Battlefield 4. We can tell you that premium on Battlefield 3 was accounted for in fiscal '13. It was a very well-received platform and subscription that the customers really liked and enjoyed. It was great value. So that would be the texture and color I'd give you on premium.","Blake J. Jorgensen","What I would add -- and this has nothing to do with Battlefield 4 premium announcement. This is just a pure accounting statement. The accounting team here has been very focused on how do we recognize subscription revenue over time or on a ratable basis associated with the life of the subscription to try to avoid the lumpiness of the Battlefield 3 Premium. We know that frustrated people that they didn't see it until the end quarter, and so we're working to try to smooth that if we have future products like that.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","One quick one for Larry. Larry, you've gone through several transitions in this business. The technology leap we are about to see that you mentioned, how does that compare to what we've seen in the past and just give us your comfort and confidence level in what we are about to see in the coming generation.","Lawrence F. Probst","In many respects, I think this is similar to what we have seen before. I mean, obviously these next-generation consoles are going to be more powerful and deliver more exciting and more fulfilling entertainment experiences. And obviously, these are companies that we have worked with historically and have good relationships with. So I think a lot of similarities to previous transitions. We're excited about it. As I said in my earlier comments, we think it's really important to get out of the box quickly with a portfolio of products that will drive market share for us and hopefully delight our consumers. So we're looking forward to it, and we think we're going to have a great reveal at E3. Frank?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, the only thing I would add is that in comparison to last transition, we're in a much better state as a company in terms of our development. As I mentioned in my remarks, our investments in Frostbite and EA SPORTS over the last year has really put us in a position where the technology side or the engine side of this transition has largely been derisked. And so we feel very good about how we're heading into this console. We're in much better shape this time than we were last time.","Operator","Doug Creutz from Cowen.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, maybe you could comment on -- you had a pretty big divergence between some significant revenue growth in Europe in the quarter versus decline in North America and what was driving that? Were there specific titles or industry conditions and so forth?","Peter Robert Moore","Doug, it's Peter. I think a lot of it was the strength of our catalog in the quarter, particularly of FIFA in Europe continued to do extremely well. You saw our numbers on FIFA digital, particularly FIFA Ultimate Team. And that has a stronger bias towards the European market than it does towards the North American market, although North America is growing rapidly with the FIFA franchise. And we have great hope and expectations that, that will continue in fiscal '14. But I think you can point to strong catalog, growing digital, particularly in the European market that we're seeing now as those individual markets start to really come up to speed with their broadband distribution, not only through our own platform, Origin, but our third-party e-tailers in Europe. And again, as I say, through FIFA, I think those were the core drivers that you saw the discrepancy between North America and Europe.","Blake J. Jorgensen","I think you're seeing the continued growth of FIFA as a product, and as we mentioned, the continued playing of that product all during the sports calendar. The old days of people playing for a quarter or maybe even 2 have gone away and the combination of FIFA with FIFA Ultimate Team has created an amazing consumer experience that continues through the entire sports year. And in the case of soccer, that's almost 12 months. That's just a fantastic business for us, and we're very excited about the coming sports calendar.","Operator","Brian Pitz from Jefferies.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Yes, it's Tim O'Shea for Brian Pitz. Just wondering if the Star Wars deal reflects a strategy shift away from internally developed IP? Or was that decision to acquire the license more opportunistic given Disney's decision to shut LucasArts? And I have a quick follow-up.","Frank D. Gibeau","This is Frank. As it relates to our overall portfolio, this is very complementary to our wholly-owned IP plan. Wholly-owned IP is the centerpiece of our portfolio. We're going to continue to invest and grow that. The Star Wars products and ideas that we have for that business line are very complementary to what we are currently planning over the next couple of years. And it gives us a real opportunity to reach new markets and new audiences that potentially will be very accretive over the long term.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And then quickly, I know you mentioned the 11 announced titles for fiscal '14. Just wanted to clarify, are these the only titles that are included in guidance? Or maybe is there something like a new Star Wars title? Or you mentioned some new games that might be announced at E3. Are those baked into guidance at all?","Blake J. Jorgensen","The 11 titles are what we're basing our guidance on, plus the 15 mobile titles that Frank mentioned. So obviously, mobile's a large portion, but that is what we're basing guidance around. And if you feel like there\u2019s a title that's missing, that's because we probably don't have it in our title plan for the year, were trying to be fairly focused this year and make sure that we get the Gen4 titles off the ground when those boxes are available.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Got it.","Frank D. Gibeau","And in the case of Star Wars, it is part of the guidance as well.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, the Star Wars expenses are in there. But obviously, we're not planning on shipping any title in FY '14.","Operator","Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray.","Andrew D. Connor - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","This is Andrew Connor on for Mike. I would ask about the console cycle and just understanding how most estimates suggest the new consoles are going to ramp slowly, so would just be curious how important to you really the current gen installed base is going to be really this fall, this holiday and next year? And then you alluded to E3 in talking about being able to talk about more next-gen titles. I'm just curious what you're expectations are in terms of the total number of sort of console titles after the next-gen consoles are out. And then lastly, obviously FIFA is doing very well globally and we're approaching a World Cup year, so just wanted to hear your sort of preliminary plans on calendar 2014 as it relates to FIFA.","Frank D. Gibeau","This is Frank, I'll step through. I think there's about 4 questions there. In terms of the ramp on next-gen consoles, it's way too early to tell or forecast whether it's slow or fast. We're big believers in next-gen consoles being a key growth driver for -- we're looking at in terms of the overall market. So I don't think you can characterize next-gen consoles would grow slowly or fast. We'll learn more as we get further into the year, at E3 and beyond. As it relates to current gen platforms, I think we launched a PlayStation 2 version of FIFA about 2 years ago. Very profitably and that was a good product for what customers were looking for. The current gen platform is going to stick around for a while. It will be a viable platform much like PS2 was a very viable platform for an extended period of time. So it will not dry up and go away immediately. It'll be there as an existing platform for us to continue to publish games against over the next couple of years. As it relates to FIFA and an upcoming World Cup year, as you know, in the past we have done World Cup editions of the FIFA franchise. We have nothing to announce at this time on this call, but it's clearly going to be a soccer mad year next year with the World Cup coming and with the continued expansion and popularity of the Premier League and the other leagues around the world. So we don't see any slowdown happening in the soccer business for a while.","Peter Robert Moore","Andrew, this is Peter as well. Let me just add in from a sales perspective on consoles, and I've been through a couple of hardware trans, not as many as Larry, but a couple of hardware transitions myself. And typically what we see here, you're seeing a little bit of a polarization of the marketplace right now. The top 10 titles taking more and more of the unit revenue. In calendar year '12, we saw 49% of our total revenue occupied by the top 10 titles. And from that perspective, that will probably continue on a polarization basis until, to Frank and Larry's point, we learn more about next-gen announcements in -- at E3. You typically see a little bit of a slowing down of the current gen and then once next gen is out, you actually see an increase again. And we saw an actual -- when we looked at the numbers from the last transition, we saw an increase of 10% in the post-year launch of the current generation. So from that perspective, we're pretty bullish the current gen continues in its 8th year, pricing seems to be holding up well. So from the perspective of continuing to drive against Xbox 360 and PS3, we're extremely bullish.","Andrew D. Connor - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","And if I could just ask a question on the total console title count with the addition to maybe some Star Wars games moving forward and NBA Live, do you expect the total console title count to increase during the next gen or is it going to kind of continue to be at this reduced level?","Frank D. Gibeau","My expectation -- this is Frank. My expectation is that as the console transition gets through this year and expands, you'll see our title count go up.","Operator","James Hardiman from Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Two questions. First on the guidance. Maybe Blake could take this one. From a cash flow perspective, talk a little bit about the uses there. Share count was down I think 20 million shares fiscal '13 versus '12 and your guidance is actually turning out a little bit much better cash flow it sounds like you guys are guiding to. How should I think about that? What are the other potential uses for that cash if not free cash -- share buybacks, I should say, or is that just conservative guidance at this point?","Blake J. Jorgensen","We're not building into the guidance any share buyback forecast. We tend to do our guidance without that. You can assume that since we\u2019re only about halfway through our buyback program we'll continue to look for ways to return cash to shareholders. The CapEx, as I said, it's pretty consistent with what it was last year, around $100 million. And so assume that everything is free cash flow below that until you see future buyback. As we do those, we'll report in to you each quarter what those buybacks were and how much we spend on them.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Great. And then a question for Frank on Star Wars. Obviously, you're extremely limited in terms of what you can say with regards to licensing arrangements, but can you tell us just a little bit directionally how the royalties may compare with the new Star Wars agreement with regards to maybe some of your other license-based games? Is this going to be a margin enhancing relationship? Or could it dilute margins a little bit? Obviously, Lucas has historically been known to charge a little bit of a premium in terms of royalties, but how does this fit in with the rest of your portfolio?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, I can get into too much detail on how it compares and contrasts other than to say that the business plan that we looked at over the long term in this agreement was very good for Electronic Arts. It will contribute both top and bottom line growth. And as it relates to margins, we are very comfortable with making this investment, in making this commitment.","Operator","Ben Schachter from Macquarie.","Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research","Just a couple of questions for Larry and one for Blake. Larry, within the context of the financial history of EA over the past few years versus when you were last CEO, just wondering, at a high level, if you could help us understand your philosophy around guidance and around sort of leading the company internally and externally. And then long-term margins, there was no discussion about that on the call. In the past, you've achieved 20%-plus. Is that something that you're targeting again? And what are the key factors that could make that happen? And then, Blake, just help me understand that the guiding to flat OpEx, even though you just had pretty significant headcount reductions, just how does the math work there? Why don't we see OpEx going down?","Lawrence F. Probst","With regard to philosophy about planning and guidance, I would say my philosophy is to be conservative and exceed expectations. As we mentioned, as we went through the script, we've taken a hard look at the organization. We have really focused the product portfolio. We've made some adjustments in terms of headcount and operating expenses. My job is to make sure that we're growing the top line and the bottom line and rationalizing headcount and cost in conjunction with revenue. I think we've done a really good job of that in nailing down our fiscal '14 plan. I said earlier, we have a high level of confidence in the guidance that we provided, and we're excited about the product portfolio this year and future years going forward.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Both on the margin and the guidance question. On the margin question, clearly, we've been very public about our goal to continue to march towards a 20% operating margin, if not higher. And that's a combination of continued expansion on the gross profit line. Digital is a major driver there, as well as our investment in the back office abilities to deliver our digital platform. And all of those are on track. The gross margin for the forecast is dampened slightly by the fact that Battlefield is such a large product for us, a number of units that will skew towards more packaged goods just because of its size and that counters the gross margin growth in some way, but we'll continue to be on that path. I think the key to remember on the operating expense forecast is Gen4 investments that we're making, plus investments in a couple of key products during the year. So you should assume that we'll spend more money marketing Battlefield than we did Medal of Honor, for example, and continuing to build out the digital platform and the mobile platform. As I think Frank said, investing in 15 mobile titles. All of those are what I would call increases in operating expenses. We counterbalanced all those by decreases in expenses associated with the organization and with some products that we're stopping. That's allowed us to hold OpEx flat, but those would be the reasons you're not seeing an OpEx coming down during the year.","Operator","Eric Handler from MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC, Research Division","Just wondered how we should be thinking about the catalog business this year and how it sort of plays out as you get closer to the transition of a next gen cycle? And also when you look at your cash and when you ended the year nearly $1.7 billion in cash. Let's say you generate another $300 million or so in free cash flow, how much cash do you really think you need on hand? And as a follow-up to a prior question talking about allocating the cash. Is acquisitions -- are those really viable at this point going forward? Or some of the other uses you might have for your cash.","Peter Robert Moore","Eric, this is Peter. I'll talk about catalog. It's always a strong pillar for us to lean on as we head to a transitional period, and this year will be no different. As I mentioned earlier to a previous question, catalog was very strong for us in Q4. We expect it to be strong again in Q1, primarily because we have but 1 major release in FUSE. And then as we head into the transition and hopefully into next-gen consoles by the holiday, depending on what's announced in the next few months, it will still continue to be a large part of our business, but then our focus obviously moves to the front line titles. Our back end of the fiscal year is heavy laden as it typically is with our new releases, so we'll transition our publishing teams on the ground to focus on front line.","Blake J. Jorgensen","On the cash question, we're very comfortable with the current cash balance. As a reminder, about 60% of that's offshore. We do have a convert outstanding that we think about all the time as a bill coming due at some point in the future. But also I think most important, we're very focused on the internal opportunities that we see today. We have purchased businesses over the last few years, and we've been spending our time trying to figure out how best to integrate those and leverage those. PopCap, for example, huge opportunity with the Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled franchises. And we're really focused on how we get our best value out of those existing franchises versus worrying about going out and buying something new. Our goal is to return cash to shareholders, and we'll do that in whatever is the most efficient way to do it at the right time. But you should continue to see buyback programs and very much a focus on generating cash flow over time.","Rob Sison","Thank you much for joining our call, and we'll catch up with you next quarter.","Blake J.

Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-K for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, July 26, 2018 and disclaims any duty to update them.","During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now that our Q1 results reflect our adoption of ASC 606, this does not materially impact our net bookings metric, but does change our GAAP reporting in several ways. Prior periods have not been restated. For more information on this change, please see the accounting FAQ we've posted on our IR website.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","We've had a strong start to FY2019. We continue to expand our network with creative new games, launched a new mobile game on the WeChat platform, and had deeply engaged communities in our live services.","Revenue and earnings for Q1 were above our guidance, and we are looking forward to bringing more new experiences to our players throughout this fiscal year.","Our strategy continues to center on delivering a collection of amazing games and content wrapped in services with more ways to play, watch, share ,create and connect that enable us to grow our global audience.","Among our top titles, EA SPORTS FIFA continues to demonstrate unique ability to engage more than 100 million players across geographies, platforms and generations. During the quarter, we launched our World Cup content update for FIFA 18, and engagement was very strong with more than 15 million unique players on PC and console alone joining into playing.","In addition, we launched FIFA Mobile in China this quarter, including real-time PvP, culturalized live service design, and enhanced social features. It's still early days, but this has quickly become our strongest ever launch in the Chinese market, reaching number one on the top downloads chart for iOS in China and showing best-in-class engagement on the WeChat platform.","We have momentum across all platforms for our FIFA franchise, as we have just launched our latest season update in FIFA Mobile and FIFA 19, including the Champions League arrives later this quarter. From existing titles to unique new experiences, we introduced amazing content to our network throughout Q1.","Our Sims 4 community grew 35% in unique players year-over-year as we continue to deliver new content packs and updates as part of our ongoing live service. With the breadth, depth and size of the Sims audience on mobile, we're now fulfilling different motivations across two distinct games, giving fans and newcomers alike more of what they love about the franchise.","In another dimension of our portfolio, our EA Originals and EA Partners programs are helping indie developers reach a global audience. More than 2.6 million players experienced the cult hit A Way Out from Hazelight through Q1. And we also launched Unravel 2, another beautiful game from Coldwood.","As we strive to deliver experiences that amaze and inspire players around the world, we are continually expanding EA's portfolio. EA PLAY, our three-day event in early June, was a great success. Fans that joined us in Hollywood were able to go hands-on with demos and other experiences for a dozen different games, including Anthem, Battlefield V, the EA SPORTS portfolio, Command & Conquer Rivals, and more.","Across the globe, fans viewed the trailers and player-generated content of our games released at EA PLAY more than 165 million times. Media and critics were also excited by what they played, with our games receiving more than 60 awards, including Best of Awards from E3 Game Critics for Anthem, Battlefield V, and FIFA 19.","Beginning in late June and into early July, we conducted our first public Alpha test for Battlefield V. The results exceeded our expectations, with high demand leading to three times our planned number of participants joining the test. Feedback was highly positive, with players able to truly feel the advancement that DICE has been focused on in the game play. This type of early play opportunity is now foundational to our development process as a great way to engage the community and enable them to provide input we can build on as we move through development. We are planning more hands-on opportunities with Battlefield V prior to launch.","We're also pleased with the excitement that is building for Anthem, our new IP set to launch in February. Our EA PLAY demo sessions for Anthem were packed from beginning to end, and we're continuing to see great interest and anticipation from fans wanting to learn more.","BioWare is building incredible depth and gameplay innovation into this new shared world experience, and we look forward to sharing much more with our players in the months ahead, including pre-launch opportunities to jump into the game.","As we move further into FY 2019, we are continuing to push the boundaries and pioneer for our players. Origin Access Premier launches next week, a first-of-its kind subscription service that will include unlimited access to our newest PC titles. We believe strongly in the transformative nature of subscriptions. In a network where subscriptions can reduce friction and help give players ready access to more great content, we are enabling developers from EA and beyond to bring truly amazing and immersive new experiences to a global audience.","We're developing more new IP and bringing new teams to EA that can deliver more new and unique experiences. And we're continuing to work with more of the best creators across the industry to add more third-party games to our subscription services.","In Q2, we will also launch new EA SPORTS titles on console and PC, major content and gameplay updates to our EA SPORTS mobile games, and continued updates to FIFA Online 4. In Competitive Gaming, our franchise are uniquely fulfilling the tremendous demand, widespread appeal, and longevity of traditional sports in the context of esports.","Next week is the FIFA eWorld Cup Grand Final, the pinnacle of this year's competitive FIFA season that has seen participation from more than 20 million players from 60 countries and 80% more average viewers so far over last season. Our next season of Madden NFL competitive gaming also kicks off this quarter, with the second year of the 32-team Madden NFL Club Championship and broadcasts set for the ESPN network.","We are continuing to evolve and grow our competitive leagues and programs at an accelerated pace. With every game, every service and every experience, we are continuing to take steps towards our vision to connect a billion people in playing. We look forward to sharing more updates in the quarters to come.","Now, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","We started another years strongly, with a first quarter beat on net bookings and on profitability. We continued to deliver on our growth strategies, with a focus on new genres, on China, and on building new live services.","This quarter, at EA PLAY, we announced significant progress across all three vectors. We gave players a deep look at Anthem, our upcoming action game. We launched FIFA Mobile on the WeChat platform in China. And we announced Origin Access Premier, a new subscription service that will include access to EA games from the day of launch or earlier. I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business.","To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tab in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.14 billion, compared to $1.45 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $57 million.","Operating expenses were $622 million compared to $552 million a year ago primarily driven by new product development as we continue to invest in new IP. Operating income was $300 million and diluted earnings per share was $0.95, $0.31 above our guidance.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $120 million, down $56 million from last year driven by additional investments in R&D, the timing of cash received and higher cash taxes. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $32 million resulting in a free cash flow of $88 million.","Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $1.6 billion. See our earnings slides for more cash flow information. During the quarter we also repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $300 million leaving 2.2 billion available on our buyback program.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5 billion, up 11% year-over-year. Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $749 million, down $26 million from the prior year but $29 million above our guidance.","The outperformance relative to guidance was driven by FIFA Online 3, A Way Out, and Battlefield 1. The year-on-year delta was driven by the Mass Effect: Andromeda sales captured in the year-ago quarter partially offset by FIFA Online 4, The Sims 4, and A Way Out.","Digital net bookings were $693 million up $12 million on the year ago period. The increase was driven by FIFA Online 4, The Sims 4, and A Way Out, partially offset by Mass Effect Andromeda.","On the trailing 12-month basis, digital net bookings now represent 69% of our business compared to 63% a year ago. Looking at the components of this quarter's digital bookings in turn, Live service net bookings were up 7% year-on-year to $450 million.","This growth was driven by FIFA Online 4 and The Sims 4 as we looked to broaden the base of recurring revenue. Millions of people played FIFA 18 as a result of the World Cup mode in FIFA Ultimate Team.","Engagements were up, players were up, but ARPU was lower than we'd expected due to the World Cup mode focus on acquiring new players.","Sales of the base game rose above our expectations and we had the highest daily active users in the game's history. We're pleased that it was so successful at both bringing back lapsed players and introducing new players to the FIFA game as the Ultimate Team. And this positions the franchise very well as we prepare to launch FIFA 19 and look to the European leagues kicking off.","Both EA Access and Origin Access continue to grow. We reached a significant milestone in our subscription strategy next week on July 30 when we launch Origin Access Premier. We look forward to discussing its performance as we add frontline titles to the subscription.","Mobile delivered net bookings of $147 million, down 2% year-on-year due to slight declines in older titles, partially offset by the ramp of FIFA Mobile in Asia. Monetization in The Sims Mobile has started slowly, consistent with prior Sims launches, and the team continues to grow the game by adding exciting new careers, activities, events, and other attractive new content based on feedback from our community of millions of Sims fans.","We are encouraged by the performance of FIFA Mobile on the WeChat platform in China. It's still early days but the game delivered one of the highest grossing days ever for any of our mobile titles and hit number one in the IOS download charts. We work very closely with Tencent to bring it to market and we're taking our learnings from this into FIFA Mobile worldwide.","Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $96 million, 14% lower than last year due to the Mass Effect: Andromeda sales captured in the year-ago quarter. 40% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months, up from 34% a year ago.","Now turning to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for the full year despite the strengthening of the dollar since last quarter. At the time, exchange rates were $100 million tailwind relative to the prior year. At today's exchange rates, that has returned to zero suggesting $100 million headwind to our net bookings guidance.","However, our current guidance assumes this headwind will be offset by general weakening of the dollar through the remainder of the year or improved bookings from our business. It should also be noted that there is less risk to the bottom-line because of our hedging strategy.","We are holding our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.82 billion with CapEx still expected to be $125 million and so free cash flow would be about $1.7 billion.","For the second quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.27 billion, cost of revenue to be $436 million and operating expenses of $674 million. OpEx is up 10% driven by the continued investments in our growth strategies. This results in earnings per share of $0.48 for the second quarter.","We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.16 billion. This is down slightly year-on-year driven by the strength of our Battlefield 1 sales in the prior year and the timing of the recognition of bookings in Asia, as well as FX.","We're pleased with how we started the year, the progress we are making on our growth strategies, and the continued growth of our recurring revenue, and there's a lot to look forward to in the coming months.","We'll launch Madden NFL 19 in August and FIFA 19 at the end of September. Battlefield V is coming in October, and all three will be available on Origin Access Premier several days ahead of their launches. Incidentally, this is the first time in over a decade we're making Madden available on PC.","FIFA Online 4 continues to ramp in Asia as does FIFA Mobile. And we are continuing to build excitement for Anthem ahead of its launch in February. In esports, as Andrew mentioned, we will be concluding the EA SPORTS FIFA 18 Global Series with the final in London next week, and we have a full schedule of events coming up for FIFA, Madden, and more. Looking further into the future, we continue our pioneering work in cloud gaming and other advanced technologies.","Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Blake. This is an amazing time to be making games and entertainment. As we saw last month at EA PLAY and E3, the energy and creativity that defines this industry continues to reach new heights. Innovation is enabling us to break through barriers to expand the accessibility of games and grow an audience in the billions.","Through more ways to play, create, compete, watch, and share, the thread of social connection that is unique to games is becoming even stronger and bringing players deeper into global communities. The digital transformation to take games from finite to infinite experiences, and each day our opportunity at EA is to turn incredible ideas into entertainment that will inspire the world to play.","In this world, creativity moves quickly and we constantly keep focus on our players. New IP and fresh new experiences are our lifeblood. In addition to amazing games coming this year like Battlefield V, Anthem, our latest EA SPORTS titles and Command & Conquer rivals, we have new IP development for all platforms.","Across EA Worldwide Studios, Respawn is developing Star Wars: Jedi Fallen Order for FY 2020 along with another new project in the pipeline. Motive is developing new IP. Our mobile studios are working on several new titles, and we have more projects under way. At the foundation of every experience will be choice, fairness, value, and fun that ensure we are delivering for our broad and diverse player audience.","We are also pushing, I think, farther as the expansion and transformation of games continues. Subscriptions will bring more choice, reduce friction, and add value in a world of ever increasing content. And with Origin Access Premier, we are breaking new ground for the industry.","Esports is bringing massive audience into the excitement of competitive gaming, and through our leading IP we have global momentum that we will continue to expand with new competitions, new broadcasts, and more partners.","Technology like cloud gaming, advanced AI, and machine learnings will change the way that games are made and played. We are continuing to invest in these areas of the core of our Player Network to connect players around the world to the best entertainment and to each other. We're excited for the future as we seek to amaze our players and continue leading the growth and transformation of this great industry.","Now Blake and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. It's Matt Costa (18:54) on for Brian. Thanks for taking our questions. I have a few. First is how large of a contributor was Ultimate Team to live services in the quarter? And connected to that, how are you thinking about the impact of Fortnite and trends with younger and female players? And then the second is what are you seeing as the biggest areas of dollar investment this year and into next year obviously between new IP subscriptions, et cetera? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. We \u2013 thanks, Brian, yeah, thank you. We typically don't break out Ultimate Team on a quarterly basis, but you should assume that Ultimate Team is over 50% of the live services component in any one quarter and certainly in the quarter that we just closed out. And I'm going to let Andrew take a crack at the Fortnite question if you'd like to do that.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Sure. So what we have seen is that Fortnite continues to what we believe expand the audience. We saw incredible engagement in our games for the quarter. As we talked about, we had over 15 million people join our World Cup mode in FIFA.","And so our expectation is that as they continued to expand the audience that provides tremendous opportunity for us going into the holiday season, particularly as we think about launching Madden and FIFA and Battlefield into what is a growing player audience.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. And the only thing that I would add to that is without a doubt it's been a phenomenon in the industry, and I'm sure it's taken up people's time. We had a hard time pointing to exactly where that's impacted our business, but I'm sure it is taking up people's time across the industry.","But we also know that that means more and more people are brought in to play games and will enjoy games in the future, in particular first-person shooter games down the road. Can you repeat your second part of your question? I'm sorry I didn't write it down.","Unknown Speaker","Yeah. No problem. So how are you thinking about the biggest areas of dollar investment this year and the next year between new IP subscriptions streaming?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, the bulk of it's driven around new IP. That's where the biggest dollar spend has been going, i.e., building new studios and bringing in new people to help build new IP. That feeds ultimately the subscription business with more content. We are looking for extra content outside of our own IP, i.e., things like the Warner Bros. content that we bring in. And most of that content is based on \u2013 the expenses are based on how much it's used inside of the subscription. So that's more variable in some respects.","And then underlying that is all of our network infrastructure including security which continues to be an important part of our spend base. And while it's not as big as our new IP development, it's just critical to how we operate as a networked company now and in the future.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","The one piece I would add to that is that in terms of our digital platform, we've had a meaningfully sized team working on that over the last five years on ID, commerce, infrastructure, data security. And as they have continued to build on that platform, in addition to what is increased investment, we're also reprioritizing those resources against some things like subscription like cloud gaming, like AI, like machine learning.","And so while it doesn't show up as an incremental investment, by virtue of having completed a number of the broader foundational technical issues in the area of ID, and commerce, and data, we're able to now repurpose that talent against some of these new strategic opportunities.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thank you.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Chris Merwin from Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you for taking my questions. First for the mobile business I think net bookings were down only slightly year-on-year but you had a very successful launch of FIFA Mobile in China during the quarter. Can you just help us understand the impact of that title in the quarter, how it performed relative to your expectations, and how you're thinking about it contributing for the rest of the year in the context of your guidance?","And then just secondly, I know it's still very early days. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what you've noticed from the early adopters of the Origin frontline subscription. Are you finding that they're playing more of your games? Are they spending more in those games? Just curious how that's been progressing. Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. Let me hit that first because that one's easy. We don't know yet because it doesn't get turned on until next week. We do know though from our EA Access experience and our Origin Access experience for non-frontline titles that we find people play twice as many games for twice as long and spend twice as much money as they did outside or before they joined the subscription. And that's what led us to believe that frontline titles would be also very advantageous to the subscription, as well as help drive new users into the system.","So we'll have more to say over that over the next couple of months. I think remember we've got Madden going in in August, FIFA in September, Battlefield in October, and then Anthem in February. Those are the four PC-based titles that will go into Origin Access Premier. And we really won't have a full sense of that until after all four of those titles are in but we'll try and give people updates along the way to the extent that they're meaningful and new information.","In terms of FIFA Mobile, we're incredibly excited but it's still early days. The impact to the quarter was certainly above what our guidance was but not a large number because it is still early in that rollout. But clearly, as we stated, both the size of some of the days we saw and the chart positions we saw, and probably most importantly, the feedback we're getting from the consumer as well as our partner, Tencent, all implies that we've got a very exciting future for FIFA Mobile.","But I would caution everyone to be careful. We've built that into our guidance for the year. We believe that it's going to be a strong contributor longer term. But as you've seen with FIFA Mobile around the globe, it takes time to build these and tune these models to get them exact. So they really outperform what we've just seen historically. So more to come on that but early days are very exciting on it.","Christopher Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Matthew Thornton from SunTrust.","Matthew C. Thornton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question, guys. I guess, first, when you think about the fiscal 2020 slate. You talked a little bit about the Respawn Jedi title releasing that year. Just curious, is there any room between Respawn and the sports portfolio. Is there any room for another major release or should we kind of block that out to fiscal 2021?","And then secondly, just coming back to Origin Access Premier, obviously at EA PLAY and E3, a lot of conversations were around subscription, streaming, and consolidation. I'm just curious what the conversations have been like coming out of those events since you announced Origin Access Premier just in terms of conversations with the other publishers and just industry chatter. Any color there would be helpful. Thanks, guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. So be careful that you don't take 2020 to be literal, as Andrew described it, because we're not giving guidance on 2020 yet. And I think Andrew did say there are other things coming. So more to come on that. We don't like to give everything up in the first quarter of this year. We got to deliver this year first. But trust that there's most likely other sizable titles -- one or two other sizable titles coming. And we'll see as we give guidance and we'll give some more color on that as we get into later this year before we ultimately give guidance at the start of next year. I don't know if you want to touch on subscription, Andrew?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah, sure. So, again coming out of EA PLAY, there was a lot of conversation on Origin Access Premier. And certainly from a gamer standpoint, the feedback was very, very positive in terms of the opportunity to access more great games at great value with reduced friction. And we expect that that will be a big plus for gamers over time. And like subscription businesses, it will take time to build, but we believe in the long-term potential of that as we have seen to be true \u2013 with linear based media like TV, movies, and music.","In terms of the conversation we've had with other developers and publishers, I would say that the feedback is mixed. I think we are in a unique position by virtue of the depth and breadth of our portfolio and the many, many, many hundreds of hours of gameplay that we can offer with our own portfolio to take this step forward for the industry, and we do believe we're leading and pioneering for the industry.","Some developers and publishers that we have spoken to are very, very excited about the opportunity to access this highly engaged player base that will deliver tremendous lifetime engagement into this live service.","And other developers and publishers, I would say, are in a wait-and-see approach. As I've said before, I think the greatest disruption of the consumption of entertainment media, in the last five years of the combination of streaming plus subscription, we're starting with subscription and we're leading from there, and we're investing in streaming over the long term. And my sense is that as we're able to grow the TAM as a result of this, engage players for longer with greater value at lower friction that we'll see continued uptake and participation in services like this.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question, Erica.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Gee with Barclays.","Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First one, I guess, you guys significantly outperformed your earnings guidance for this quarter, but I believe the outlook for the full year remains unchanged. Now I know that there's a lot still to come, so I appreciate the conservatism. But it'd be great if you guys could just confirm especially whether or not your outlook for any titles has come down and since you guided back in May specifically for Battlefield, Anthem and for Ultimate Team, and I have one follow-up.","Unknown Speaker","Sure. So I think you've been around for a while, Ryan. I think once in the last five years we've raised guidance coming out of first quarter. First quarter is 15% of our business and you know our conservative approach, so we tend not to do that. We have not changed our outlook on titles. I would say the caution is what I mentioned on FX. We came into the quarter and gave guidance thinking we finally have a tailwind on FX. And due to, I believe, much of the trade war chatter and maybe further chatter on Brexit, we've seen a dramatic change in both the pound and the euro, as well as the other underlying currencies, and that's created a headwind for us versus a tailwind. Now I think we're not changing our guidance because we're not certain how long that will last. But it's the overall view on the market versus a fundamental view on any specific title or business.","Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Makes sense. And then I guess live services was up 7% during the quarter, and I believe you guided to 10% to 15% for the full year. So it would be great if you could help us kind of bridge those two growth rates together. Maybe what are the puts and takes for fiscal 2Q? And then as you get out into the holidays, it's going to drive that reacceleration in the back half, whether it's going to come from live services like subscriptions in Origin, maybe Ultimate Team or Battlefield, if you can rank order those, that'd be great.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, it's probably all of those. It's hard for me to rank order because we tend not to give individual live service forecasts. You should \u2013 I think you all know, but start of the sports season is the real peak of live services for sports, the first two quarters coming out for both FIFA and Madden and hockey as well and NBA for that matter. And so you tend to see that as the products are rolled out. The first quarter tends to be the slowest quarter. We actually had a lot of engagement, as Andrew mentioned and as I mentioned on the call, but less monetization just because the design of World Cup. And remember, only about half of World Cup was in the quarter versus half in the second quarter. So we're still sticking.","We don't change our guidance by sector, but I would say we're still comfortable with the guidance that we've provided on live services and we're very excited about where it's going particularly that driven by esports, as well as new live services that we'll start to roll out on new products as we bring them to market.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe following up on that and following up again on the commentary from your prepared remarks, on live services, it was interesting to hear that you can also use it as a mechanism for user acquisition, driving user engagement. Can you give us some color on how you think about either turning the knob on monetization versus turning the dial on engagement and user growth through live services as opposed to just going purely from monetization against time spent? Thanks, guys.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Eric. I think it's a great question. And certainly the nature of live services is transformative to our business and transforming how we think about acquisition engagement of players over time. And certainly, we think a lot about the lifetime value of a player and the lifetime engagement of that player versus simply a point-to-point transaction or a point-to-point unit sale. And as we looked at World Cup and we went back and we looked at many of the previous World Cups, and I've been working on that business since 2006, what we came to understand was that typically it was an opportunity to bring in a lot of new players and introduce a lot of new players through the spectacle and pageantry of the World Cup to the world of soccer and the world of interactive soccer through FIFA. And as we designed the mode this time around, we certainly had that in mind and had been highly successful, I would say, in acquiring and reacquiring less players as part of that engagement.","What that meant through the process was that we had lower monetization than we might do typically as part of FIFA Ultimate Team, but we knew it was an opportunity to bring in a whole new group of players into FIFA more broadly and work with them over the many, many years to come as they continue to play the game.","And what I can say is certainly coming out of the World Cup we have seen our core players, as well as millions of our newly acquired players move back into the core FIFA Ultimate Team experience, and we're excited about launching a new game later for them this year and introducing them two new aspects of Ultimate Team certainly as those include Champions League content.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on a strong Q1 for you. Just two little ones here. Curious if you had any potential VR monies from Battlefield V in your guidance in fiscal 2019. I have a quick follow-up.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Did you mean that are we planning a VR experience for Battlefield?","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","No. I was referring to Battle Royale.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I think we talked with E3 about bringing out Battle Royale mode for Battlefield. We haven't announced exactly when that will come out, but we did say that we would have one.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And it seems like Battlefield V, you've created a fairly full value proposition, single player, all the multiplayer aspects that a franchise player want. And now you're adding the Battle Royale mode which obviously is a new addition.","Just curious, when you think about, I guess, how strong these Battle Royale games are in terms of creating player communities or basically expanding TAM which you've talked about before, they're often monetizing and, of course, you have a couple of really strong incumbents with Fortnite and PUBG.","So how do you think about, I guess, a tethered free-to-play Battle Royale which appears to be what you're going to do with Battlefield V versus a stand-alone offering at a reduced price perhaps similar to a PUBG or a free-to-play offering similar to Fortnite, we could sort of maximize the TAM and monetization. Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. I mean, right now we're focused on \u2013 for Battlefield, we're focused on creating as a mode in the game. No different than the other modes that we have in the game. We may have lots of other things that come out over time for Battlefield. I think we're really focused on how do we continually build live services around all of our games. And you'll see some of that for Battlefield in the comings months and once the game is released.","I would say we're interested in possibly experimenting with a essentially free-to-play standalone game that might be in a shooter genre or another genre, but I don't think that's how we're looking at the Battlefield stuff right now. But you'll see more to come on that in the coming months and years.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And what I would say about our Battlefield community is it's growing and diverse community who are looking for many different ways to play the game, and that might be through single player, that might be through traditional multiplayer modes or that might be through what we discussed in a newly developed Battle Royale mode. There are also other new modes that we're developing, again DICE is one of our most innovative studios. We're continuing to build and look to deliver innovative multiplayer components to that game. And as we come into October, we'll be talking more about this, but you should expect that we'll be delivering a full featured game that features all of the traditional components of a Battlefield game in addition to new modalities of play including Battle Royale and delivered in a way that we believe we want to play which is not just what you get at launch but in the context of a live service over time. And we're excited about what we're able to do there.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","All right. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Ben Thatcher from Macquarie.","Ed Alter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi. This Ed Alter on for Ben. Can you discuss how the commission rate paid to platform holders differ across mobile consoles and particularly China? And if there's any opportunities you see that you can leverage or scale to improve those rates over time?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","We don't disclose that but I think people will have a pretty good sense of what the rates are for Apple and Google and Tencent. And it's a different model within Sony and Microsoft but effectively similar levels across all the western ones. The Chinese Eastern, Tencent and others are different, but I think most people have a perspective on that. So...","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, thanks. So, Blake, I know it's early, but can you talk about the differences between the FIFA Mobile game that's available in China versus what's available everywhere else? In terms of how monetization in China might be better or worse different, presumably ARPU might be lower versus the Western markets. So wondering if the conversion rate to paying users is materially different? Also, can you help us think about the impact for the Champions League to the guidance parameters? Is this purely going to be just more events around the midweek games or are there different modes that you're planning, et cetera? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So why don't I take the first part and then I'll let Andrew do the Champions League piece. It's early days and so I'm going to hold off on giving you any general statistics. But I would say in terms of how the game is different, it's much more localized than we've done in other markets. And part of that is just the uniqueness of the Chinese market and the uniqueness of the fact that many people in China don't yet know all of the intricacies in play or in rules of football. And so part of what we did is try to make the game much more understandable and much more Chinese-centric around how games are sometimes played. It had local content as well, which FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Online 3 do in their respective markets.","And so I would say the biggest driver has been localization. But it's still too early to start sort of understanding what all of the metrics are going to be. We'll think about how we can describe that as we get a better sense of it without getting down the path of dealing with individual game metrics, which will probably drive you guys crazy. But I think, all in all, the localization component that ourselves, our teams in Asia and Tencent helped on has been a huge benefit for that marketplace versus where we've been tuning internationally with a base game that we have from the West. This is a much more depth in localization that we've seen in other markets. And we did that because the opportunity and the size of the potential there is so large.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And in terms of Champions League, for many who follow the sport Champions League, maybe the most popular and powerful soccer league, if not sports league, in the world, bringing together the best clubs in Europe and the best footballers in what is a magnificent tournament. And so, you should expected us \u2013 I talked about in the prepared remarks, we have over 100 million players across platforms and games and generations in FIFA. And you should expect that we are thinking about how we can enhance and extend all of those experiences with Champions League content.","That might be something as simple as what we've done in FIFA console this year and doing a completely new and progressive remix of the Champions League theme song all the way through the manifestations in story mode and general single player, multiplayer modes, all the way through into Ultimate Team and live service events over time. We're really excited about the inclusion of the Champions League. It's the first time we've had it, I think, in over a decade. And we believe our fan base, given the popularity of that league, again will also be very excited with how the team has delivered an interactive experience across various platforms and games.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And as you know, Ultimate Team is driven by the weekly events that we host. And obviously the Champions League gives us a whole new opportunity for new events to be able to add to that roster. So, that's very exciting for us. And we think this is not just a one-year play. This is something that will continue to help evolve FIFA over time.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Gerrick Johnson with BMO Capital Markets.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Hey, good afternoon. I just want to clarify. I thought I heard Andrew say that FIFA had 100 million players. Is that accurate or is that the total EA SPORTS franchise?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","No, that's accurate. So, when you think about \u2013 a lot of the times when we talked about FIFA, we talk about FIFA in the context of console in the West, and certainly being placed in the West. It's easy to think about FIFA in that context. But remember also, we're on FIFA Mobile in the West and in Asia. We have a very, very successful PC free-to-play online game in Korea, Southeast Asia and China. And as we look across the entire platform, we thought it was important that we start to think about FIFA in its true capacity across the franchise, and it's over 100 million players.","Gerrick L. Johnson - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. Thanks for the clarification.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes. Thank you very much for the question. Good afternoon. Blake, I'll preface this by saying, I'm not complaining. You purchased $300 million worth of stock in the quarter. You generated about $90 million of free cash flow. So, I mean, you didn't really dip \u2013 didn't have to dip into your existing cash at all. At this point, what are you thinking about what it would take to maybe accelerate the buyback a little bit?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","We're only one quarter into our two-year $2.4 billion buyback and I'm already getting requests to move it up. No surprise. I appreciate that you prefaced it by saying you weren't complaining.","We've always focused on trying to have a systematic program, not an opportunistic program, to consistently return capital to shareholders. We target that with our board every year. We've revised it every year and increased it every year. We just brought \u2013 started this new program, which is a doubling of our old program. And our view is we'll take that through the year, see how that performs, and revisit it at the end of the year, and decide if we should continue to buy back more stock or not.","We're always trying to balance the need for cash for potential M&A activities or investments versus returning that cash to shareholders. We think the balance that we've hit now is about right. But we're always adjusting and thinking about that to make sure we are at a minimum covering dilution from share-based compensation. And our hope is that we will clearly do more than that in the coming years based on the level that we're at today.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","So, along those lines, I mean, you guys have made two seemingly small acquisitions. One, could you give us a little bit of detail on those two companies that you've acquired? And secondly, are you starting to see a little bit more movement in the M&A environment?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Unfortunately, we're not seeing a lot of movement because I think the industry is \u2013 everyone's doing so well, no one's really forced to try to rethink their direction, and staying in most cases in either a private position or as a standalone public company. That may change over time, and we're always watching that. We look at every major deal that comes through, and we have a team of people that are out in the marketplace all the time looking at players. The two acquisitions we did, you're correct, they're very small.","The acquisition of the streaming assets from GameFly was a unique opportunity for us to buy technology that was essentially the middleware in streaming, and we believe it's critical to be able to stream to many different devices over time. And that's a team of people based in Tel Aviv, Israel and they're fabulous at what they do, and it was an opportunity to buy that team and the technology that they've developed, but it was less than $50 million.","And then, the second piece is a very small mobile business that we've actually been working with, called Industrial Toys. I've talked to a few people that thought we were getting into the toy business, so we're clearly not getting in the toy business, so don't panic. But it's a group of people, one of the original founders of the Halo series. And they've been working for us on a mobile product that \u2013 as a work-for-hire studio. And we've been very impressed with that team, and with the quality of the people and their ideas of the things they're working on. I won't yet tell you what they're working on, but you will see something in the next couple of years coming out of that studio, we think is pretty innovative in the mobile space. So, we're very excited.","We look at a lot of mobile businesses like that for great talent and great opportunity versus buying a specific product per se. And we knew those people well because we've been partnering with them. And so those are the types of things that we'll be constantly doing but, unfortunately, most of those are fairly small and longer term in vision. But we want to make sure we keep enough dry powder in case something does change. And if we find that there aren't really any opportunities, once again we'll go back and revisit the return to shareholders plan.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Drew Crum from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So, wondered if you'd be willing to size the annual net bookings run rate for FIFA Online 4. I think in the past you've provided some context around the size of FIFA Online. And then, separately, one of the popular features in Fortnite has been cross-platform playability. Is that something you intend to include in Battlefield V or any other EA games? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Sure. I think FIFA Online, we've talked about both the growth particularly in China as well as the success in Korea. And it's still too early to size what FIFA Online 4 looks like. Right now, it's tracking very similar to FIFA Online 3. And there's always a transition period because you need to tell the consumers there that their currency doesn't translate across the two programs. And in a few markets, we're actually running both simultaneously to allow people to move off slowly versus immediately ship them on. So, trust that it's still small and relative to our 5.5 billion or 5.55 billion guidance, but growing very fast, particularly in China.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","In terms of cross-platform play, again we are seeing the same thing. And remember, we have a vision on a 3- to 5-year time horizon where a great portion of game experience will exist in the cloud and be pushed to every device you own. And the game experience you have won't be measured by local CPU or GPU but will be measured by screen size and session time you have, and will drive tremendous liquidity in the market \u2013 in a player base. And I think we are to deliver very different types of experiences as a result of a cloud gaming offering.","In the near term, you should also appreciate that we're looking at key franchises in terms of how we could deliver cross-platform players in a similar way that Fortnite has, especially some of the titles have a broad and diverse player base. Households typically have one console, so the ability to bring PC to console and console to mobile into that play experience can bring families together, can bring friends together. And we think it's an important part of our future development profile both in terms of mobile games that we have today moving up per se to console and PC, and console and PC games being playable in mobile. And so, I expect more from us on that front in the future.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Tim O'Shea from Jefferies.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Yes. Thank you for taking my question. So, Andrew, you talked about connecting a billion people a day. So, my question is, how does your cloud-based gaming, the streaming service, how does this contribute to expanding your addressable market and eventually connecting a billion people? And then, just a follow-up on FIFA Mobile. Obviously, great success in China. Just wondering how that success might impact on your thinking about the opportunity that you do see in China over time and is it reasonable that we might expect to see more of this type of launches going forward. Thank you.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Great question. And typically my verbiage is a billion people in play versus a billion people a day. But I guess that's the very next step beyond getting them to play with us is getting to do it every day. And you should expect that that would be our objective upon reaching a billion people in play. Certainly, we believe that cloud gaming delivers a tremendous opportunity to do that. So, right now, depending on which figures you look at, but there's probably somewhere between 2 billion and 3 billion people playing games on mobile devices. So, discrete experiences, they're playing for a couple of minutes a day; and where the core part of that population are playing games like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes for 90 minutes a day.","Our belief is that, over time, that player base will continue to mature. We're seeing some of that with Fortnite right now, where we're seeing mobile players move up to a PC or a console in terms of the immersiveness and complexity of that experience. And you get co-players on big screen HD games to come down and spend more time on mobile devices.","So, as we think about cloud more broadly, it's about capturing more of that TAM, so expanding the TAM across our portfolio, delivering that \u2013 delivering greater access to games, a tremendous value to our players with far lower friction. And for us, that's going to be a meaningful growth opportunity for Electronic Arts in the future.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","In terms of FIFA Mobile, clearly both ourselves and Tencent have been very pleased with the progress of the title, particularly a sports titles because there are not many sports titles in the marketplace. Also, you can imagine that we're having discussions with them on what other titles we might be able to put into the market. We have worked with them for some time, and worked with them obviously on FIFA Online on the free-to-play PC game. And so we're looking at other of our mobile franchises that might work in the marketplace if they were culturalized or localized in some fashion.","We're very focused on continuing to try to grow that business and grow our partnerships with both Tencent and other players there to try to build that footprint. We think it's one of the biggest growth market opportunities for us around the world, and you'll see more products in the coming years, I think. I think, right now, the focus is on FIFA because it's still early, but we do think there's opportunity beyond FIFA. For example, our Need for Speed franchise has always been very popular there. The Plants vs. Zombies franchise, the Sims franchise have all been popular in China. And if there's ways to leverage what we're doing across those franchises, we'll certainly look at that.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","We also believe that, as we think about subscription, subscription is a relatively nascent business model in Asia right now. More broadly, I guess, more free-to-play model there. But what we are seeing is a rise of premium game engagement. And we also believe that as we think about Origin Access Premier and we think about the portfolio of games that we have that may traditionally not have had an audience by virtue of their business model in Asia that there is opportunity there also.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ryan Goodman - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey. This is Ryan Goodman for Justin. Thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple on Battlefield and then one on mobile. For Battlefield, in the commentary, it sounds like the early play tests are actually going pretty well. So, just curious if you had any color on pre-order activities to date, how that's tracking versus your expectations. And then, second question on Battlefield, it's more in the content release strategy. Last year, with Battlefront II, there was a little pushback with the initial player and game progression system out of the gate. So, just curious, is there anything you can share with us in how you're thinking about the content release strategy or cadence with Battlefield?","And then, separately on mobile, just \u2013 we're a couple of months into the Pre-Alpha in Command & Conquer, and you had the Rise to Power Pre-Alpha. Just would like any feedback you're seeing there, player reception, just anything to share there. Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. We don't tend to directly comment on our unit forecast. What I'd tell you is we look at lots of different components, including pre-orders, but pre-orders continue to be less and less important in a digital world, but we do observe that. We look at everything that people are saying about the game, their intent to purchase the game, and communication around the game as measures of where it's going. We're happy with those.","We're also excited about the number of people that played Command & Conquer, coming out of E3 when we allowed people to play it. It's early days there, but what we're hearing is it is an amazingly fun game that really gets people excited, particularly in groups. And so it made up opportunities beyond just individual game, and maybe more of a group game or even esports opportunities. So, we're excited about that, and it's in full test now and being finalized, and you'll see it later this year.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","In terms of content delivery for Battlefield V, and you referenced Battlefront II, our objective in Battlefront II is to deliver a large full featured experience at launch that has the opportunity for players to continue to engage in new and fresh content over time, and we've continued to deliver that.","As we've talked about before, we had some issues with the progression system and the monetization system which we've since learned from and fixed, and launched a completely new progression system in that game. And the teams continued to work, and we announced new content including Clone Wars content at EA PLAY, and we're encouraged by the reception that we've had as a result of that. So, you should imagine that we have learned from that experience.","And as we think about the launch of Battlefield V, again, our objective is to launch a spectacularly built game that is full featured with single player, where traditional multiplayer modes and new innovative multiplayer modes, including Battle Royale, over time. And while the base game that we launched will be large, deep and full featured, that we also understand that players expect to play these games for many months and sometimes years later, and that we have a long-term service plan in place for the delivery of ongoing content and ongoing modes at play.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So, we'll take one last question.","Operator","Your last question comes from Evan Wingren from KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Blake, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that ARPU in live services was a bit lower than you'd expected on Ultimate Team. I wonder if you could just give you a bit more color there in terms of what you saw in the components and how you're thinking about that going forward? And then I have a follow-up.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. So, the pickup was just in FIFA. Actually, we had a very strong Madden Ultimate Team quarter, which is rare for the first quarter, so we enjoyed that. That not a huge business in the last quarter of the year before the football season starts. But in FIFA, we've \u2013 as Andrew mentioned, we brought a very large number of new or lapsed users into the game and into Ultimate Team. But we remind people \u2013 I think we've tried to temper people's enthusiasm around this when we first gave guidance \u2013 is that people oftentimes play Ultimate Team for months or years before they spend money, partially because they're learning how to play and they're having a lot of fun and they don't really understand how much more fun they'll have if they spend a little bit money. And so what we saw was more people in the game than we expected, but those people did not spend as much money or have money at all. And our view is that that's still a positive because we now see post Ultimate \u2013 or post World Cup, the Ultimate Team business continuing to grow and engage, and we think that's real positive coming out of the World Cup.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And just to clarify, so you're not implying that people that do see value and pay for things in the game, that didn't actually trend worse than you thought or decline?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","No. No, I think the only thing you could probably assume is that someone in Germany who really enjoyed playing Ultimate Team probably didn't play after the Germans lost. And I can't quantify that for you but \u2013 or U.S. people who weren't even in the market may not have played as much. But that's the fun and excitement of World Cup, you have these unknown outcomes that keep people excited. But now the core continues to engage in Ultimate Team. And now we believe we're growing the core with some new players that came in through World Cup.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And the follow-up was, you mentioned free-to-play and experimenting with that. Unless I have missed that, that's the \u2013 kind of the first time I've heard you speak about that. Could you contrast that with the subscription effort that you're doing? Is the thought there that that could be potentially moving towards a freemium like offering? Or is it really a separate endeavor, I guess, that you're looking at? And perhaps, what type of resources are you willing to put against an effort like that? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. I think \u2013 remember, we've been building free-to-play games in Asia for 10 or 15 years. We have a long experience there, and FIFA Online is a great example of that but we have other opportunities that we've had over the years in free-to-play there. We have a free-to-play mode inside Star Wars (01:01:25) business that we run for years as well. You can either subscribe to it or have a free-to-play version. We're always looking at new models. And my implication was, don't assume that we're going to do something immediately in something like Battlefield. But you should also assume we're looking at a lot of the franchises that we have or older franchises and asking the question, is there an opportunity to have a free-to-play version of that? So, more to come, nothing to announce in the next few quarters. But you will see things, we'll start testing sometime over the next year or so.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Well, great. Thank you, everyone, for your time, and we look forward to seeing everyone over the next few quarters and talking to everyone at the end of October.","Operator","Thank you.

My name is Christine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q1 2020 Earnings Conference Call.","Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Chris Evenden","Thanks, Christine. Welcome to EA's First Quarter Fiscal 2020 Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO and COO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after this call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, a financial model, a transcript and an update to the accounting FAQ.","With regards to our calendar, our Annual Shareholder Meeting will take place on Thursday, August 8, here in Redwood Shores and our Q2 fiscal 2020 earnings call is scheduled for Tuesday, October 29. This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company.

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Chris. We delivered a strong start to FY '20. Players were deeply engaged in our top franchises with growing communities reaching new peaks of engagement fueled by content and in-game events in our live services. As a result, our operating results significantly exceeded our expectations for the first quarter. We're thrilled by the great experiences that players are having in our games, and we're looking forward to delivering a lot more throughout the fiscal year.","Interactive entertainment continues to grow and expanding global player base [indiscernible] and tailwinds for the industry. With this backdrop, the core drivers of growth for EA are the depth and breadth of our portfolio and IP, our expertise in live services, our leadership in subscriptions and competitive gaming that expands our reach and drives deeper engagement. We're also continually strengthening our foundation of great talent and technology. I'll touch on some of these drivers with a few highlights here.","Let's start with Apex Legends. We have a massive global audience continuing to engage in this high-quality free-to-play experience. Apex has tremendous gameplay at its core and we've built it to have longevity as a live service that will continue to drive engagement over time. In our live service, we're delivering seasons of new content, a collection of new content and updates that begin to roll out at the start of each season and continue throughout the course of several weeks and months. We launched Season 2 in early July, including a robust Battle Pass offering, a new character and additions to the environment. And to date, it had outperformed our expectations with significant growth in daily and weekly active players. In each season, there are in-game events that are additional drivers of engagement such as the event coming in the next few weeks that will bring new content and deliver one of the most fan-requested features since the launch of Apex. There will be more updates and in-game experiences in the weeks to come for Season 2 and Season 3 is shaping up to be even bigger. All of these elements, the fantastic core gameplay, seasons of new content and additional in-game events are designed to continually excite and engage the Apex community over the long term.","We're also expanding into additional growth opportunities for Apex Legends. Esports will bring new drivers of social interaction and competition to the Apex ecosystem. Interest from teams, broadcast partners and sponsors is strong and we've had great success with our first exhibition event, including a competition at the ESPYS that was broadcast on ESPN and ABC. We'll have around 8 teams from around the world participating in our first official competition in September. Our plan is to bring Apex Legends to China and a worldwide mobile launch are also on course, and we will share more on our plans in the future. In our EA SPORTS portfolio, our franchises like Madden NFL and FIFA are delivering for core fans, innovating to reach new players and leading our growth in esports.","Looking first at Madden NFL. We continue to see deep year-round engagement in the franchise. Live service events and tie-in content with the NFL Draft drove growth in new players joining Madden NFL 19 in Q1 and also deepened engagement in Madden Ultimate Team. We're now just days away from launching Madden NFL 20. The innovation in this year's game like the new Superstar X-Factor abilities, new personalized career campaign and the more fluid core gameplay are all designed to appeal to new and existing football fans.","Madden NFL esports also continue to drive growing viewership. Players in our Madden NFL competitive ecosystem engaged 4x more than noncompetitors last season and our events drove record broadcast and digital viewership. We're now looking to build on that success with the Madden NFL 20 Championship Series. We have partnered with all 32 NFL teams, our competitions are aligned with key big NFL season and we're welcoming major sponsors, including Pizza Hut, SNICKERS and Starbucks. Finally, the latest season of our fan favorite Madden NFL Mobile game launches tomorrow. And this year, the game is bringing back some of the classic modes that fans love as well as new innovation in social call play and customization. Through great experiences on console and PC, the ever-popular Madden NFL Mobile game and our leading esports programming, Madden NFL continues to reach and engage a wide audience of fans.","Our FIFA franchise had a strong -- had a very strong Q1 with players deeply engaged in our Ultimate Team live service. Our biggest in-game event, Team of the Season, had more than 3 million players logging into FUT daily to play, the highest daily levels we've ever seen for this event. Esports of FIFA is exploding as well with our competitive modes growing faster than any other mode in FUT. Momentum is strong across our entire FIFA esports ecosystem and next week's FIFA eWorld Cup finals will be the culmination of a season that has engaged 17 official lead partners, players from 20 different nations, more than 30 live events and more than 60 million total views to date. ","Looking ahead to September, FIFA 20 is set to expand our FIFA platform with a brand-new dimension of the game for players who want more personalization, customization and community. VOLTA FOOTBALL brings a street style of experience to the franchise where players can build their own characters, express themselves and play different forms of the sport in different environments around the world. That's in addition to major advancements in the core experience designed to deliver the most authentic football gameplay we've ever produced.","FIFA 20 will have an unmatched breadth of top leagues, teams and players included in the game, a continuing differentiator of the authenticity in our FIFA franchise. Our licensing program is built on the strength of multiyear relationships and careful consideration of the most important players, teams and leagues that our fans love to see in the game. From console to PC, to our FIFA Mobile games in the West and China, to our FIFA Online offerings in Asia, FIFA continues to be the way that hundreds of millions of players around the world come together in their shared passion for soccer.","Our Sims 4 live service also continues to be a rich and rewarding experience for our players and a strong platform for growth. The Sims 4 continues to be one of the great owned IP success stories of our portfolio and we are planning for FY '20 to be our biggest year yet of new content. Knowing that, we gave more fans a chance to get into the game through a one week promotion in May to download the base game for free. Almost 7 million players downloaded the game during that time. In addition to the base game promotion, total expansion and game pack downloads also increased 55% year-over-year in Q1. We launched our seventh expansion pack, Island Living, in late June and has already become one of the best selling packs for The Sims 4. We are fortunate to have an incredibly vibrant and creative Sims community on console, PC and mobile, and we are continuing to double down on this amazing franchise to reach new players and open up exciting new dimensions of The Sims this year.","Subscription services are expanding across the industry as well. We're a pioneer and a leader in this space, having just launched our subscription on a third major platform with EA Access on the Sony PlayStation 4. We believe subscriptions can be transformative to the player experience and the gaming industry over the long term as they offer tremendous value and choice to players and greater flexibility in the games we bring to market. Our PC subscription already includes more than 220 games, 140 of which are from third-party developers. We are continually adding to this with new games from EA, from indie developers seeking to expand their reach through our EA Originals program and from our third-party partners ready to reach more players through our services. We're also working to expand our subscriptions to even more platforms.","Mobile continues to be a growth opportunity for us. Live services are a key aspect of our mobile business with franchises like Madden Mobile, FIFA Mobile and The Sims continuing to drive strong ongoing engagement. Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes has grown to nearly 80 million players launch-to-date. Galaxy of Heroes has the most deeply engaged community of all of our mobile games and we plan to continue delivering great new content and in-game events to grow the audience this year. We've also just started pre-alpha testing for Plants vs. Zombies 3. In a market where discovering an acquisition can be challenging, Plants vs. Zombies is one of the most beloved brand in gaming. To date, we've had more than 1 billion downloads worldwide of PvZ games in mobile and we're looking forward to bringing something new to fans around the world. We're continuing to prototype and develop more bespoke mobile projects as well as new concept for cross-platform play. The mobile space is complex and competitive and our focus is on bringing more innovation and unique new experiences to mobile players.","In addition to the franchises and live services that I've already mentioned, we'll be delivering many other new experiences to players throughout the remainder of this fiscal year. NHL 20 is launching in Q2 with hundreds of gameplay advancements as well as new competitive and multiplayer modes. We'll take the wraps off our new Need for Speed game heading into Gamescom in a few weeks. We have a Plants vs. Zombies shooter title coming to console and PC later this year. And the excitement and anticipation for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order has been strong coming out of EA PLAY in E3 where the game received 45 award nominations and great vibes from the player community. Respawn's track record speaks for the high-quality games they develop and they have created a brand-new Star Wars story that will be a lot of fun to play when it launches this holiday.","From the core game to live services that extend and enhance experience, to new ways to engage through subscriptions and competitive gaming, our focus continues to be on strong execution and delivering innovation, quality and fun for players at every turn. We're fortunate to have some of the greatest and most creative talent in the industry driving our effort to continually learn and improve. With robust, best-in-class technology powering our efforts, we're also in a position to scale and evolve with the changing needs of our players.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks, Andrew. We delivered operating results significantly above our expectations this quarter. And at high level, those results were driven by broad strength across our core franchises. Apex Legends continues to delight players and we are pleased with the impact of Season 2 since its launch on July 2. This quarter's result demonstrates how the power of our portfolio strategy, combined with extra content, deliver strong results even in relatively quiet quarters. I'll report the specifics of our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.","EA's net revenue was $1.21 billion compared to $1.14 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $79 million. Operating expenses were $607 million compared to $622 million a year ago, primarily driven by lower sales and marketing, partially offset by continued investment in new IP. This was significantly below our forecast, driven by timing of advertising spend. Operating income was $415 million compared to $300 million a year ago and above our expectations. Diluted earnings per share was $4.75, up over 400% year-on-year. Underlying EPS was well above our expectations, driven by net bookings, gross profit and operating expenses. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $158 million, up $38 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $45 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $113 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $1.59 billion. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.","During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.2 million shares at a cost of $305 million, leaving $979 million available in our buyback program. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.19 billion, up 4% year-on-year.","Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings for the quarter were $743 million, approximately flat year-on-year. It was $53 million above our guidance, driven by strength across the board with strong performance from our core franchises and live services. Digital net bookings were $701 million, up $8 million on a year-ago period. On a trailing 12-month basis, digital net bookings now represent 76% of our business compared to 69% a year ago.","Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital bookings in turn. First, live service net bookings were up 12% year-on-year to $504 million, led by Apex Legends and The Sims 4. FIFA Ultimate Team was up 11% year-on-year at a constant currency or 5% at actual exchange rates. Diving into the detail, Season 2 launched for Apex Legends at the beginning of Q2 and we're pleased with its performance with regard to both sales and engagement. We will continue to add content during the quarter with a major event in mid-August, and Season 3 will begin next quarter. We are also increasing investments in content development and marketing to continue to drive growth in Apex Legends.","FIFA Online outperformed our expectation. FIFA Online 4 performed well in Korea and Southeast Asia where we have fully transitioned from FIFA Online 3 to FIFA Online 4. Meanwhile, FIFA Online 3 outperformed our expectations in China, and we are positioned well for switching over to FIFA Online 4. Finally, as Andrew mentioned, The Sims 4 base game promotion delivered nearly 7 million new installs, and we remain on track to have the fifth consecutive year of growth in The Sims 4 following its launch in 2014.","Mobile delivered net bookings of $122 million, down 17% year-on-year, driven by aging titles. Although down year-on-year, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes outperformed our expectation and maintains a highly engaged user base, leading us to be optimistic about performance and a huge year for the Star Wars franchise with new TV shows, movie and theme park launches. Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $75 million, down 22% year-on-year due to last year's launch of A Way Out and FIFA 18 World Cup promotions in the quarter. 47% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. Although this is up 7 percentage points year-on-year, we continue to model an annual shift of 5 percentage points, given how strongly digital Anthem -- strongly the digital side of Anthem was during the launch last quarter.","Before discussing guidance, I'd like to highlight that there were three income tax events in the quarter that impacted our GAAP Q1 results and our full year GAAP guidance. Please refer to our press release for those -- for details on those tax events. As a result, we expect to recognize a $1.7 billion benefit in the fiscal year, which is $200 million better than we included in our guidance last quarter, although the phasing of the benefits between Q1 and Q2 has changed since we gave that guidance. $1.08 billion of this amount was recognized in the first quarter and the remaining $620 million will be recognized when the Swiss tax rates change, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. We do not expect the above events to impact our FY '20 operating cash flow or our management tax rate for fiscal 2020.","Now turning to guidance. Except for the increase of our tax benefit of $200 million or $0.66 a share on GAAP EPS, we are reiterating our guidance for the full year. We continue to expect The Sims 4 and Apex Legends to each deliver net bookings in the $300 million to $400 million range. We are holding our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.575 billion, with CapEx still expected to be $125 million and free cash flow of around $1.45 billion. For the second quarter, we continue to expect net revenue of $1.315 billion, cost of revenue to be $407 million and operating expenses of $679 million. This results in earnings per share of $2.60 for the second quarter. We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.23 billion. We're very excited about the Madden NFL launch and the upcoming Apex Legends event and the launch of FIFA 20 with VOLTA FOOTBALL at the end of the quarter.","We over-delivered this quarter as a result of the performance of our core franchises. These evergreen live services provide a tremendously solid base for our business and enable us to invest in new opportunities to innovate and to take risks. We are unique among our peers in this and it is no consequence that we are a leader in cloud gaming, subscriptions and in the strength of our player networks. People will only engage with our games if they have fun playing them, and we continue to invest in keeping them fun, whether it's in major innovations such as VOLTA FOOTBALL in FIFA or new modes, events and legends in Apex Legends or even adding laundry to The Sims 4. We aim to give players content they want to play. If we're successful in that, we're successful as a business.","The combination of core plus innovation plus fun will drive our success through the year. Coming up in August, we have more live services for our newest franchise, Apex Legends, and the latest installment in one of our most storied Madden NFL. FIFA 20 launches right at the end of the quarter. The following quarter, we have a new IP, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Simultaneously, we continue to invest in more new IP and new technologies and new business models. We believe we have the right ingredients in place to deliver fun for our players and success for our business. And I look forward to reporting on our progress to you next quarter.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Blake. The world loves to play games. As the global gaming audience continues to grow and spend more time with the games they love, interactive entertainment is an increasingly important part of our daily life. At the heart of this is social connection, the unique ability that games have to connect and inspire players to be part of a shared experience. New platforms, new technologies and new ways to engage will continue to fuel growth for the industry. And through these opportunities, we are positioning EA to lead.","It begins with great games that can fulfill the motivations of a diverse global player base. We continue to invest across our portfolio to deliver the depth, breadth and quality of experiences that players seek. Our top titles across sports, simulation, shooters and racing connect hundreds of millions of players on console, PC and mobile. We create experiences in some of the most popular owned IP in the industry, including The Sims, Battlefield, Need for Speed and Plants vs. Zombies. We've introduced powerful new IP like Apex Legends and we are building new licensed experiences like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. Our pipeline is full of innovative new projects for our current franchises, new IP and plans to revisit some of our fan favorite brands as we continually work to bring more high-quality games to our players across a growing number of platforms and devices.","Live services enable us to build powerful communities where players come together and continue to share in the experiences they love. We've had great success building deeply engaged long-term communities in Ultimate Team, The Sims, Battlefield, Star Wars and more. And now, we're adding that with our massive player base in Apex Legends. Each live service is different, designed uniquely for the community it serves. They also enable us to continually learn from our players, their feedback and their motivations so we can drive more innovation and creative exploration in the future.","Interactive entertainment today transcends the act of playing a game. New ways to engage like esports are becoming just as important. With FIFA and Madden, we have the largest esports ecosystem in sports games, and Apex Legends is going to be a major new addition to the global competitive gaming scene this year. We believe that our games can make competition accessible to everyone with the opportunities to bring competitive play to more of our franchises. And we look forward to delivering for more players, viewers, sponsors and broadcasters around the world.","With games becoming an increasingly important part of our lives, subscriptions offer compelling new value proposition for players. Other industries have demonstrated how subscriptions fundamentally shift consumer behavior. We consume more television content in different ways because of video subscriptions. We consume more music in different ways because of music subscription services. We believe the same is happening with games where subscriptions can offer access to great content at great value with tremendously low friction. When combined with cloud streaming, the barriers are lowered even further, making it even more compelling to jump into new games and connect with new communities. ","The subscription opportunity is powerful for both players and game creators, and we're continuing to invest in our leading services on console and PC.","In addition to more great games, passionate global communities and new ways to engage, there will be more transformative shifts on the horizon. The content push of progress and innovation is what sets this industry apart from every other form of entertainment. With our teams of incredibly talented developers, artists and engineers, we are working to drive creativity, quality and fun through every aspect of the player experience now and in the future. We look forward to sharing more updates in the months to come.","Now, Blake and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju","So Andrew, Blake, it seems like FIFA Online is on a recovery path right now, but this game is still distributed only in Korea, China and Southeast Asia. And I think we have talked about this many times before, the opportunity should be global. So can you tell us where you stand between either FIFA Mobile or other things you may be doing in the background? Because it seems like the demand for this game should be multiples of the audience that you are reaching right now.","Andrew Wilson","So again, I think we think about FIFA as a platform that brings together soccer fans or football fans depending on which country you're from together to share in their passion for the game. In any given market, that might mean going to them in different ways with different games on different platforms or different business models. Right now, we entertain probably a couple hundred million people. We see an opportunity for growth there certainly, but when you think about the offering that we have across console, PC and mobile through premium, through live services like Ultimate Team, through access to the game in subscription and free-to-play on mobile and PC in Asia, we feel like that we -- we feel like we have really strong offerings for a global player base.","You should imagine that we're always thinking about how we can attract more users to the platform. That's why we are working on VOLTA for this year. We think that that's going to bring in a whole new range of players who love the game but want a different type of play than the traditional 11-on-11. And as we think about more focus going to mobile over time, we also expect that we'll continue to grow that business.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Mike Ng from Goldman Sachs.","Michael Ng","I'd like to better understand how you're tracking against your $300 million to $400 million bookings guidance for Apex Legends and The Sims. How much did you realize in the quarter? Are you about 25% of the way there? And how should we think about the phasing throughout the rest of the year?","Blake Jorgensen","Well, I think as we said last quarter, you should expect that the first quarter was smaller [Technical Difficulty] remaining three quarters, Q2 through Q4, because we were still, one, experimenting; and two, we didn't have as much content. Clearly, quarter two has more content in it. We talked today about a major event that's coming in a few weeks in August that will clearly continue to drive the engagement and content, which tends to drive monetization. And you should assume -- Andrew mentioned that Q3 will have even more than Q2, so we're going to continue to build that. I would assume that the back three quarters of the year are probably all about the same size based on what we know today and larger than the first quarter. That's all I can really tell you because it's just early days and we're only one month into -- or less than 1 month into Season 2 right now. But everything's tracking to plan or better for us, and so we're very confident on the $300 million to $400 million on Apex.","Obviously, Sims, we've called out that it's in the same range of $300 million to $400 million. We didn't do that before, but we wanted to remind people that our business is not based on Apex Legends alone. It's very important to us, but it's still a relatively small part of our overall business. And franchises like The Sims have been continually producing that range of revenues because we run them as a live service. And we want to make sure people understand, we have confidence in building a live service around Apex and that will continue to grow over time and we'll continue to update you as we learn more.","But we know we've got amazing engagement. We have 8 million to 10 million people on a weekly basis playing the game. That's huge for us on almost any game that we see. And we'll continue to take advantage of that, keep them engaged and playing everyday.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian from Baird.","Colin Sebastian","For me as well. First, on Apex, I was wondering more specifically what you see in reengagement with some of the early players in terms of what has drawn them back into the game? And then secondly, Sony made some comments today on third-party software sales, reducing their outlook a little bit. Was just hoping for any color from your end in terms of the preorder environment for some of the titles or the retail environment overall.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. I'll hit the second piece. Andrew wants to talk about the Apex engagement, if you want.","Andrew Wilson","Yes. I would just come back to the comments that Blake just shared. And we have between 8 million to 10 million people engaging in this game on a week-by-week basis. That is large by any measure. It makes it one of the -- probably the most engaging games. We have continued to see great fan sentiment inside that game. And we expect to continue to grow that audience over time. Again, when we think about Apex Legends, we set out to build something with longevity. And at the very core is a great gameplay experience. And we know that long-term engagement involves the ongoing release of new content and the ongoing running of events, both of which the team at Respawn are doing with great success, but the very core of that is a great gameplay experience. And we're building this in a way that we expect to continue to grow and continue to be a meaningful part of our business for a long time to come. And the sign of engagement that we see today lead us to believe that's possible.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. We think about this as almost like an annual title. We will continue to innovate that game and evolve that game over time and hope to believe -- I believe that we have a 10 year run ahead of us or if not more. There's so much potential and ways to change that game over time and add to that game. We think that there's just huge potential in that and that's how we're managing it. In terms of the news around Sony, I have not seen the Sony news so I don't know exactly what they said. We're not seeing any softness in our demand metrics around our titles. And thus, the reason that we reconfirmed our guidance for the full year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Matthew Thornton from SunTrust.","Matthew Thornton","Blake, maybe one for you and then one for Andrew, if I could quickly. Blake, just in terms of the other guidepost for the year, you talked about Apex, you talked about Sims. I think last quarter you gave us a couple more guidepost around mobile down 10% to 15%, some of the frontline unit assumptions as well. Just curious if there's any changes in those kind of assumptions versus three months ago. And then, Andrew, maybe if you could just talk just really quickly about the VOLTA mode within FIFA and how you're thinking about that impacting engagement? But also monetization, how we should kind of think through that? Any color there would be helpful.","Blake Jorgensen","So no changes on guidance. We're pretty consistent with all of the numbers that we provided at the start of the year. And all the metrics that we've seen are leading towards that and we're feeling confident about it.","Andrew Wilson","And on VOLTA, again, I go back to some earlier comments, is we do see FIFA like a platform and we do see our opportunity to bring together hundreds of millions of football fans around the world to experience football in a way that is meaningful to them. We do that across platforms. We do that through business models. We do that through different access models and different play models. And what we recognized with the platform at this juncture was that there was a lot of really hard-core football in there. And we expect that, that will continue to be the most meaningful part for much of the FIFA playing community.","But there was also a whole group of football fans that wanted a more casual style of play. And we built that model to attract new fans. And what we have seen over time, as we have put new modes in the game, and I will use The Journey, our story-based mode that we did a few years ago now, when we started that mode, is that it brings in a whole new set of players that come in to fulfill different motivations in the game. And ultimately, they become part of the community and the richness of that community and typically move into the more competitive modes in the game like FIFA Ultimate Team and the competitive esports modes inside of Ultimate Team. And so we think about VOLTA that way.","So our expectation is not that there will be an impact on monetization over the long term, but rather we are growing the aggregate size of the FIFA community. And that typically, what happens as we grow that community is those players become part of it, become enriched by it and then move more deeper into other modes in the game like Ultimate Team and our competitive esports modes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey from Benchmark.","Michael Hickey","I guess on Apex, I've got a ton of questions. I'll try to limit it to a couple. But I was hopeful -- I mean, given the sort of profile of the game, the competitive aspects of it, esports is sort of a no-brainer. It's great to see you guys start to move forward to your first, I guess, state of mind in September, but maybe some more color in terms of how big esports could be in terms of driving engagement, monetization and maybe overall player feel for Apex. And then, I guess, just another add-on, mobile in China, is this still a possibility in '20? Or is this more of a fiscal '21 event now in terms of expanding insulated opportunities [indiscernible]?","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. Let me hit the mobile one real quick and I'll let talk Andrew talk about esports. We did not put anything in our annual guidance for either mobile globally for Apex in China and that's because we are still obviously working with a partner but we don't have timing set up, but I would assume it's a '21 event in both cases. We'll give you more knowledge or more input as the quarters go on this year as to how that timing will evolve, but right now, I would assume nothing in '20.","Andrew Wilson","On esports, again, what we see around the esports community more broadly is the most successful titles are those that have very, very large global player bases where social interaction and competition are at the very core of the experience. And again, I go back to Apex Legends is built as a really, really unbelievable phenomenal game in the first-person shooter category, which has, as its core motivation, both competition and social interaction. And of course, it has a million-strong global audience. So we feel very good about its appeal and its application to an esport. We've also had a series of events and our -- and we'll have our first competition featuring 80 teams later in the year.","And as we think about engagement, again, as we've talked about with FIFA and Madden, engagement of competitive gaming players is typically 4x to 7x higher than noncompetitive players. So our expectation is that not only will the esports component help fuel the existing community and drive higher engagement there, but it will ultimately attract new players and new viewers and new spectators and drive higher engagement there as well. So we feel like it's going to be a very important part of the global community over the long term.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Gerrick Johnson from BMO Capital.","Gerrick Johnson","I guess the obvious question no one's asked yet, bookings should be by $50 million, EPS by $0.30, gross margin by 240 basis points, so why no increase in full year guidance?","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. I mean it's a good question. I think we've only raised guidance coming out of the first quarter probably once in my tenure here. And it's rare because it's such a small part of the overall year. I would -- if you look at the phasing that we do in our guidance, we basically just dumped it into the fourth quarter, not for any real reason other than that's supportive. It's no -- it's almost all catalog and we just don't know, but it's still small enough that we wanted to at least remain conservative in how we forecast. And based on what transpires in Q2, we'll then decide if we should change guidance or not, but that -- it wasn't much more complicated than that.","Gerrick Johnson","Okay. Can I just dig into the gross margin for a second? That outperformed by 240 basis points, so what drove that?","Blake Jorgensen","So we have done a faster and better job than we expected on controlling the online cost of revenue, particularly with Apex, but continue across all of our platforms. When we first started Apex, remember that you have millions of people playing, so they can be expensive games to operate, and we called that out in our Q4 earnings conference call. The team led by our CTO, Ken Moss, has worked hard to try to continue to bring down those costs through either different partners or simply how we're operating the game, and I think we've done better than we thought. And we had a bigger digital quarter than we actually expected. We tend to play in around 5% growth of full game downloads, for example, and it was higher this year -- or this quarter. And our digital business was stronger than we had expected, so that really drove it across the board.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ray Stochel from Consumer Edge Research.","Raymond Stochel","Not just about Apex, but across all of your content that you're building, how are you thinking about the cadence of updates? Do you think players these days have expectations for a faster content drop cadence than prior? And do you think those expectations are too high now? And what changes do you need to make to hit or come close to those elevated expectations?","Andrew Wilson","I think it's a really good question, certainly one that we see and hear a lot. The reality is we build games for a lot of different communities, and every single community is different. Some communities, of course, like a FIFA community, have a natural cadence of events that occur in the real world that we tie things to, and that makes sense for that community. A community like The Sims has a longer cadence flow. Again, we're set to have the biggest year in terms of content release this year, and we've continued to grow that franchise since launch, but it is not typically a weekly cadence of content because it doesn't make sense for that community. If we think of a game like Apex, again, it is, at its core, a great game, and so a lot of the ongoing engagement exist because it's built as a great competitive game. And so when we think about that, we think about seasons not as a onetime event, but seasons as kind of a kick-off -- as a series of events that happen kind of over weeks and months of time.","We feel really good about where we're at with Season 2 on Apex. We think that we're learning as we go. Again, this is -- remember, FIFA Ultimate Team, we started this what is now over 10 years ago. It started very small. We've got much better at engaging with the community over that period of time. And now, Ultimate Team is this tremendous business for us. The same is true for The Sims, which launched in 2014. We get smarter and better in terms of understanding how to fulfill the motivations and the desires of our players. And we expect that we'll continue to learn and get better with Apex as well.","One thing that we do try and avoid is that we end up purely as a content furnace with our games. We try and make games that have great gameplay that engage at their very core, and then we're able to build on engagement and fulfill motivations with additional content and additional events. But we try and avoid wherever possible finding ourselves in a position where content is the only means of driving engagement because we just feel it's harder to build longevity with that type of model over time. And we've learned that through over 10 to 15 years of live service experience.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Cohen from Stephens.","Jeffrey Cohen","Thanks for the incremental color on The Sims. It feels like that franchise would be one that would do really well on the Nintendo Switch. So I'm curious how you guys determine which platforms you'd bring the game to or games to? And is there any reason why you wouldn't want to bring that one on there?","Andrew Wilson","Any time we're evaluating platform conversations, we are really looking at a couple of things. One, does the game really fit the profile of that platform in terms of the control or the community ecosystem? Two, do we think the community playing on that platform would appreciate the game to go there? Or would they prefer to play it somewhere else?","We have a lot of data that would suggest a great many Switch owners also own a PlayStation 4 or an Xbox One or a PC and very often choose to play the games that we make on those platforms even though they have a Switch and they enjoy a lot of great content on the Switch. And so there's always an evaluation process that goes on a case-by-case basis. And I wouldn't say that The Sims would never go to the Switch, but I think we're doing really, really well attracting Sims players. As we said, we did the promotion in the last couple of months and brought in 7 million new Sims players that we expect will engage in that community on a platform that is really tailored to user-generated content, creativity and customization.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Todd Juenger from Sanford Bernstein.","Todd Juenger","Can I visit just a little bit at Respawn, just the resource question? It's something we get from investors a fair amount. And so obviously that studio is being taxed with some really important stuff. So I guess would love to hear your thoughts on how resourced the Apex Legends effort is, either in terms of bodies or dollars or whatever you can say? And where did that come from? And did any of that get pulled from the Star Wars effort? And just to reassure us that you've got enough on all of that. And why don't I leave at that? It's a pretty broad question.","Andrew Wilson","Okay. Good question. I would offer a few pieces of feedback that I think will make you feel better about life. The first is that there are multiple teams at Respawn, very different teams as well. Again, Apex Legends is a fast-paced multiplayer first-person shooter and has a bespoke team specific to that type of game. This is the team that had worked on Call of Duty many years ago, had launched Titanfall, and now Apex Legends. So this is very much their particular skill set. The Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order team is a completely different type of team led by Stig, who had been a game director on God of War, and it's all about the single player journey fantasy of being a Jedi. And so they have two discrete teams. And there's actually a third team at Respawn as well working on some new things.","In addition to that, this is where scale matters in this industry. In Electronic Arts, we have a very large central group that can provide art, engineering and design help if needed across the company, and we have a number of live services teams also across the company that are well-suited for the creation of new content. And so the combination of individual teams inside Respawn that are individually staffed with their specific games in mind and the global scale of EA and the central resources that we have to help across art and engineering, we feel very, very good about our ability to sustain the needs of our global player base.","Blake Jorgensen","We've also pulled teams from outside of Respawn to provide them resources on development if they wish to do so -- as Respawn wishes to do so. We have a large DICE team in LA, for example. We have a large live services team in Vancouver. And what we've tried to do is perfect our organization to be able to work long distance as well as in the middle of a studio. And so we've given them the opportunity to pull on any resources they want. And they're very, very conscious about how to make sure they've built the best game and they use the resources very effectively to do that, but they -- there's no shortage of resources relative to what they need.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from UBS.","Eric Sheridan","Maybe another big picture question. As you think medium to long term on the shift you're trying to execute on towards more subscription services and cloud-based distribution models, how do you also think about allocating resources against that longer-term goal versus maybe the shorter to medium-term transition where the industry could go through another console cycle next year and how you think about aligning resources and assets inside the company against both those transitions?","Andrew Wilson","Another good question. And so I would start with it doesn't matter what the platform or the distribution model or the business model. What matters is that we build great games. And we are doubling down and working with great diligence across our studio organization to ensure our teams have everything they need to build great games. And that will continue to be our focus near-term, medium-term and long-term.","In addition to that, again, given the scale of this company and the leadership of our CTO, Ken Moss, and what we've talked about with Project Atlas some months ago, is we're also investing for the future to ensure we don't find ourselves out of position. As a company, we started to invest in our digital platform over five years ago. I think we're still the only developer publisher with a unique ID system that carries with our players regardless of game or platform they play on. We have a single data scheme and data platform across the company and single infrastructure in security and transaction engine and these types of things.","So we've been working on this model for some number of years to ensure that we are ready for the future. Now, as we think about cloud and subscription, again, we went out -- we bought a small company out of Israel that really gave us a head start in how we think about cloud fabric. We've been working on learning an organizational structure around subscription. And so we feel really good about our future there.","But at the end of the day, we continue to be focused on making great games. We have seen the value of great games in games like FIFA and Madden and The Sims and Apex Legends, and we expect that we will continue deliver great games and -- but ensure that we have the technology backbone there to when the industry is ready.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. I think we've obviously been doing tests and learning along the way. So we started with our subscription on EA Access on Microsoft. We've learned a lot from that. Obviously, rolled out on Origin. And then, as Andrew mentioned earlier, we just rolled out on Sony. And each of those rollouts have gotten easier and easier because we understand the technology better, but more importantly, what the consumer wants. And so it becomes more of the muscle memory of the company versus having to start a new initiative from scratch.","We're working hard on moving -- building games for next year on Gen 5. I think it's obvious. I think everybody in the industry is doing that. As has happened in the past, not all games come out on Gen 5 immediately. And obviously, with games like Madden, you'd probably bring the Gen 5 game out when the Gen 5 console ships, not when Madden itself ships, but we'll be ready on Gen 5. We're very excited about it and we've been working on it for some time.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alex Giaimo from Jefferies.","Alexander Giaimo","I was just curious if we can get your updated thoughts on the overall mobile strategy. It looks like mobile bookings were down another 17% year-over-year. I know a lot of that is due to the aging of some legacy titles. So maybe just provide some color on what you're seeing there. And then with all of the smaller mobile developers out there, is this a sector where M&A might make sense?","Andrew Wilson","Yes. A good question and either -- we've not had a material shift from our stated strategy over the last couple of quarters. I think we continue to see the mobile industry grow. It's a very meaningful part of the revenue profile, of the contribution, but it's also extraordinarily competitive and it's very tough and we've seen a lot of large-scale mobile games and mobile companies in pretty serious decline over the last 6 to 12 months. We have a mobile business that still has an operating contribution of 40%. So it's very, very profitable as a mobile business. And we've held on to that and we feel very good about that.","But if we think about our strategy, I would talk about it in three core categories. One is that we have some tremendous games in live service mode, and what we're seeing is the average age of the top titles on mobile is actually getting older as those games scale and it's harder and harder to break in. So when you look at games that we have like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes or Madden Mobile or FIFA globally, we feel very good about our ability to grow those live services over time and really work hard to ensure that we're filling -- fulfilling the community.","The second element of that is, is that we are in a world where acquisition of new players is really, really tough and it's really hard to break into the mobile charts. We're really focusing on our IP that we believe has real resonance inside the community, and again, like Plants vs. Zombies, which has been downloaded over 1 billion times, is absolutely a candidate there. And you should expect that we will focus on our IP that we think can break out in what is otherwise a very costly acquisition market.","And then third, I think you are right. There are a number of smaller mobile companies out there who have the capacity to build some great games but maybe don't have the marketing firepower to actually break into the market or the network of players that we have that they could access. And I think there will be an opportunity for some M&A over time. I don't think that's an easy path, but we're certainly out there and talking to a number of different players about how we might accelerate their otherwise senior objectives.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. If you had to think about it on priorities, I mean clearly, as we mentioned, we'll have a new Plants vs. Zombies game, a high priority for us; Apex going mobile, and that's globally a high priority for us. And FIFA and Madden remain super high priorities because they're two of our largest games. And as we talked about earlier, the global opportunity for FIFA, including China, is very large. And so we're spending a lot of time there and we'll continue to do that.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Clay Griffin from Deutsche Bank.","Clayton Griffin","Blake, I just want to follow-up on what you talked about in terms of learnings coming out of -- on Microsoft EA Access and just if we can get an update on what you're seeing in terms of user behavior. I know it's early days with Sony, but what you're seeing there, relative willingness to engage with live services on those platforms. Any color there would be helpful.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. I mean what we first saw and has pretty much stayed true across almost all of the platforms is that people ended up playing twice as many games as they did before they joined the service, which is kind of a no-brainer because that's what you would typically see, say, on a Netflix or a Spotify or others because you've reduced some of the friction of trial essentially. But we also find that people played their games a lot longer, meaning they found a game that they really enjoy playing that they didn't know about. And so it's the discovery aspects of where a service goes which helps a lot. And then if it has a live service on it like in Ultimate Team, they start to spend more money than they did before they went into the service. And part of that might be subscription behavior where oftentimes people think they're getting things for free and are willing to spend on them, and sometimes they just -- they found something they didn't know that they wanted to play and they get deeply engaged in it. And so we're trying to reduce the friction of trial to see new games and to learn about things that they didn't know or didn't want to spend money on getting in by giving them an amazing economic value to start a subscription, and that's stayed true across all of the platforms.","And the one other piece is that you were going to wrestle within any subscription is how do you manage the churn over time and you've got to curate dropping content into the subscriptions at a fairly predictable rate so people will stay in. And we've been trying to do that by bringing third-party content in to help fill in the places where we don't have content because we don't necessarily have content every quarter. And we're thinking about how games might even change in terms of how they're developed over time to better match subscriptions. So you have more to come, but we're in a really good position. We have more subscribers than any other service in the industry by a long shot and I think a lot better experience base because of that.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak","I have two. The first one is you talked a little bit about resource allocation, kind of going back to a couple of the earlier questions, the one from Eric. Can you talk to us a little bit about what percentage of the overall R&D budget or headcount is sort of being attributed toward new potential franchises and new IP just so that investors would kind of get an idea for what could be in the pipeline as we head into 2021 and beyond? And then the second one, on NBA Live, just philosophical thoughts about potentially going free-to-play on that.","Blake Jorgensen","Why don't I start with the first one? I'll let Andrew take the NBA question. We would say, as a rough allocation, it's probably 20% of our R&D budget. That's always hard because do you call VOLTA new IP? We certainly do internally, but it was part of this -- the FIFA team that have developed and evolved that product versus a brand-new IP from scratch that we may be working on, like an Anthem, for example. We try to do both where we're evolving games with new IP and new gameplay modes, but we also try to make sure when we're thinking about games for 2000 -- our fiscal '25 and '26 and '27, way out, where there may be a small group of people starting to ideate and generate the concepts, but you don't scale it up for a couple of years until you really get it to a status or a place where you think you are ready to build the game. But we've always kind of mixed it that way. And it's a balance between inside game teams, as I mentioned, as well as stand-alone teams that we're developing that didn't exist before. But we're comfortable with that mix.","Andrew Wilson","Yes. On NBA, we've seen some speculation but -- around free-to-play, but we don't have anything to share at this time. Our game team has been working hard. As a company and as an EA SPORTS brand, we remain committed to basketball and our partners, the NBA and the NBA Players Association. And our game keeps getting better and better every year, and we'll be excited to bring NBA Live 20 to market soon.","Blake Jorgensen","All right. Well, thank you, everyone. We'll talk to everyone either during the quarter as we see you around the country. Appreciate all your interest. And we'll also talk to you next quarter at the earnings call. Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

Now I'd like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Rob Sison, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Rob Sison","Thank you. Welcome to EA's Fiscal 2014 Second Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO. Peter Moore, our COO; and Patrick S\u00f6derlund, our EVP of EA Studios, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings releases are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call and a transcript.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company.

I'm happy to be here today and pleased to join my first earnings call as CEO of Electronic Arts with positive news to report. Before I get into our results and a few other thoughts, let's take a moment to recognize the launch of Battlefield 4 in North America today, the culmination of efforts by the incredible teams at our DICE Studios.","Patrick S\u00f6derlund and his team have done a spectacular job to deliver a game that not only represents the pinnacle of this console generation but one that is also a defining title for the next-gen consoles launching in November. We're also launching Battlefield 4 Premium across current-gen and next-gen consoles to extend and enhance the experience, making this the biggest Battlefield ever. Congratulations to the team. We are proud to add Battlefield 4 to the list of hit titles, including Madden NFL 25, FIFA 14 and others that were delivered to gamers this past quarter.","As we get started here today, I'll cover a few things: a quick top line of our Q2 performance and key drivers; the opportunity in front of us and how we're positioning EA to deliver great games and services; and a quick look at EA's goals for the rest of FY '14 and beyond.","Turning first to our quarterly results. EA delivered Q2 revenue and earnings above our guidance. Digital revenue, cost controls and delivering against our product plan all contributed to a very strong quarter. However, much of our work for this year remains ahead of us as we prepare to launch our titles for the next-gen consoles this holiday.","Digital revenue remains a major driver in our overall performance as we deliver games and live services for our core brands across multiple platforms. We are tracking to meet or exceed our goal of generating more than 40% of our total non-GAAP FY '14 revenue from our digital businesses.","From a product perspective, we delivered successful on-time launches in the second quarter for our major console titles from EA SPORTS, including NCAA Football 14, Madden NFL 25, NHL 14 and of course, FIFA 14. Madden NFL 25 and FIFA 14 also launched on iOS and Android this quarter, and of course, the much-anticipated Plants vs. Zombies 2 landed on iOS in August.","In line with our previous guidance, our current-gen EA SPORTS holds [ph] has seen some initial softness in sell-through, a trend we expect in moving into a console transition. However, this is tempered by the unique opportunity we have with versions of Madden NFL 25, FIFA 14, Battlefield 4, Need for Speed Rivals and NBA Live 14, all launching on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in November.","Cost control measures delivered better-than-expected results in Q2, coming in $51 million ahead of our guidance. Our operating margin expansion effort is a great indicator of our increased financial discipline and focus on growing EA's bottom line. We are confident that we can continue to move faster and further than we already have on a go forward basis.","With these factors driving our current outlook, we are raising full year guidance today. Looking ahead, EA is in a strong position as we move into a momentous season for our company and the gaming industry at large. Our studio teams put the finishing touches on powerful -- on a powerful lineup of titles for Xbox One and PlayStation 4. We continue to be encouraged by the market reception and growing consumer excitement.","The latest indicators from Microsoft and Sony, along with pre-order data, shows strong demand for the new consoles. Both Sony and Microsoft have also committed that they will continue to fully support the existing PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 platforms.","Meanwhile, our industry is far more dynamic and diverse moving into this console transition than ever before. The global player base for mobile games is expanding, and we're also seeing strong performance in PC-based free-to-play games around the world. Our strategy is directly aligned to each of these key growth opportunities: next-gen consoles, mobile and free-to-play PC.","EA's blueprint for success is visible with fan favorite brands such as FIFA, where we offer experiences tailored for each of these environments. FIFA 14 for consoles, including Xbox One and PlayStation 4, FIFA 14 for iOS and Android mobile devices, as well as free-to-play online experiences for PC such as FIFA Online 3 in Korea.","Tens of millions of fans are engaging with our games every day. These titles are live services, with connected features and new content, keeping the experience fresh for players long after launch.","Recent changes that we've made to EA's structure will help us more aggressively capture these opportunities. Key studio leaders, Patrick S\u00f6derlund and Lucy Bradshaw have been elevated to lead our development efforts across next-gen consoles and PC. Frank Gibeau is leading a consolidation and double down of our mobile efforts. COO Peter Moore continues to lead and transform our operational and polishing teams and bring our games to market. And Rajat Taneja, our CTO, continues to lead development of our world-class technology platforms.","While not dramatic changes, these refinements will help us better leverage our IP and integrate successful development practices across our entire portfolio.","In a moment, I'll hand over to Blake to walk through the specifics of our financial results. With this is my first quarterly call as CEO, I wanted to take a moment to speak about 3 elemental beliefs that I have for EA moving forward.","First, delivering amazing games and services for gamers must be at the core of everything we do. The central strand of our DNA that defines who we are and the experiences we work to create. Our reputation as a company is built on our ability to develop strong relationships with players through the games we make, and we are committed to strengthening that bond.","Second, EA's biggest strengths are our people and our strategy. Our deeply talented developers and business leaders are the lifeblood of EA, enabling us to bring powerful IP like Madden, FIFA, Battlefield, The Sims, Star Wars and more to gamers around the globe. Combined with our strategy to take these titles across different platforms, geographies and ways to play, EA has a foundation for decades of healthy growth.","Third, making games profitably is vital to EA's future. Simply put, we owe great games to our players and strong returns to our shareholders. Each of these beliefs is borne out of my experience as a passionate, longtime employee of this company, having had the benefit of working in multiple parts of our business across a number of continents. These are the defining characteristics of a new era at EA, one that I am incredibly excited to lead for our gamers, for our teams and for our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake Jorgensen.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Thanks, Andrew. Turning to our Q2 results. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.04 billion, which was above our guidance and 4% lower than last year. This quarter's revenue was driven by our sports titles and continued strength in our catalog offerings like FIFA 13, SimCity, Star Wars: The Old Republic and Battlefield 3.","In line with our guidance, all of our sports titles except for FIFA 14, sold in less than the prior year. Lastly, positive foreign currency gains of $9 million also added to the revenue upside.","Q2 non-GAAP digital net revenue also contributed to the quarterly -- solid quarterly performance. Digital net revenue increased by 11% year-over-year to $348 million. Our digital business continues to be a diversified mix of high-growth profitable segments. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 22% over the prior year to a record $1.75 billion.","Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each business. First, extra content and free-to-play contributed $127 million, up 11% over the prior year, led by continued growth in FIFA Ultimate Team, FIFA Online 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic. This revenue relates to businesses on PCs or consoles where consumers can enhance or extend their gaming experience by buying additional digital content.","One exciting trend to note, our year-to-date results for each of our sports Ultimate Team businesses, Hockey Ultimate Team, NCAA, Football Ultimate Team, Madden Ultimate Team, and of course, FIFA Ultimate Team, demonstrated revenue growth year-over-year. However, our decision to sunset several of our social titles offset some of this growth, as we saw revenue declines from The Sims Social and SimCity Social.","Second, our Mobile business generated $105 million for the quarter, up 19% over the prior year. Smartphones and tablets continue to represent a majority of the revenue, accounting for $87 million of the $105 million total, and growing 34% year-over-year. The Simpsons: Tapped Out, The Sims FreePlay and Real Racing 3 continue to be key revenue generators, and the launch of Plants vs. Zombies 2 also contributed to our mobile revenue.","Mobile growth was dampened by a $15 million decline in our Japanese FIFA World Class Soccer business. This product was developed and hosted on social mobile platforms, and Japanese gamers have migrated to apps built natively for the iOS and Android platforms. Going forward, we are developing and will roll out games built for the iOS and Android platforms in Japan and other key regions.","Third, full game downloads represented $54 million, up 42% over the prior year. This revenue was driven by PC-centric products, strong demand for SimCity, as well as the deferral of Q1 SimCity revenue into Q2 were the drivers for the significant increase.","And fourth, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $62 million, down 16% over the same period last year. In the previous year, the Star Wars: Old Republic was a subscription-only based MMO. This year, some of the revenue was recognized in the free-to-play category, as we expanded this title to be both a subscription and a free-to-play business.","Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 61.7%, up over last year's 60.1% and slightly better than our guidance. The improvement was due to our growth in digital, lower processing fees as we move away from the social business and the benefits of our new digital platform.","Operating expenses for the quarter were $499 million, down $82 million from last year and $51 million lower than our guidance. Lower operating expenses this quarter illustrates that our cost control programs are taking hold. However, we believe all of this benefit should not be factored into the full year results.","There continues to be risks associated with the transition to next-generation consoles. These risks could impact sales and marketing and R&D expenses. In addition, some of our positive variances are due to phasing of marketing expenses into the holiday quarter.","As we continue to manage expenses and headcount, we are progressing towards our goal of flat to down operating expenses, something we have not previously accomplished in a console transition year. Achieving this goal will help our efforts to deliver operating margins above 20%.","The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $0.33 per share. EPS exceeded our guidance of $0.12 per share due to lower operating expenses, stronger revenues and slightly higher gross profit margins. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $1.42 billion or approximately $4.60 per share. Roughly 60% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held outside of the U.S.","Also, as seen on our GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation, this quarter, we recognized a $40 million GAAP-only charge for the expected litigation settlement and license expenses related to our college football business.","Net cash used in operating activities for the quarter was $6 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $342 million. During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. We remain committed to our program, and as a reminder, it is the $500 million share repurchase program initiated a year ago. At this point, total shares repurchased under this program remain at 22 million, at a total cost of $278 million.","Now turning to guidance. Last week, we announced that Titanfall will launch in this current fiscal year, while The Sims 4 will be released next year. We do not expect this change to have a material impact on our previous non-GAAP guidance, as the launch date and the Q4 forecast for Titanfall is broadly similar to that of The Sims 4.","Non-GAAP revenue and gross margin guidance remain at $4 billion and 66%, respectively. However, due to the favorable results of our cost control efforts, we are now estimating operating expenses to be reduced to approximately $2.1 billion, and we are raising our EPS guidance to $1.25 per share.","The GAAP guidance is expected to be $3.55 billion in revenue and a loss per share of $0.72. As we have pointed out in past quarters, our consumers are playing our games online over longer periods of time. And this longer period affects the length of time over which we are required to recognize GAAP revenue. This fiscal year, we are lengthening this recognition period, resulting in an estimated $450 million of net revenue being deferred into fiscal 2015. This longer service period has no impact on non-GAAP revenue or on cash flows.","With respect to Q3 guidance, GAAP revenue is expected to be $775 million as compared to $922 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be $1.42 as compared to $0.15 per share in the prior year. Again, this is primarily due to the longer revenue recognition period. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $1.65 billion, a 40% increase over last year's $1.18 billion.","Our fiscal third quarter is expected to account for more than 40% of our full year revenue. This quarter, we are launching major titles for current and next-gen consoles.","Our Q3 non-GAAP revenue guidance is being impacted by certain upgrade programs we have rolled out in connection with the console transition. We are required to defer revenue associated with our current-gen marketing programs that allow consumers to buy a next-gen game at a discount. As a result, we believe there will be some deferral of revenue into Q4 as some gamers delay taking advantage of this upgrade program.","Our non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 68%, better than prior year due to our digital growth and revenue mix. Operating expenses will be impacted by the phasing of some expenses from our previous quarters. We expect our total non-GAAP operating expenses to be $600 million. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.22 per share as compared to $0.57 last year.","Regarding cash flow, we're maintaining our estimates for fiscal '14 operating cash flow and capital expenditures of at least $400 million and $100 million, respectively. This implies expected free cash flow generation of over $300 million or approximately 1.4x what we generated in fiscal '13. While the higher EPS guidance should generate more cash flow, the $40 million GAAP-only charge related to our college football business that I mentioned earlier, will likely offset this benefit, causing us to maintain our previous projections.","In summary, we recognize the first half results were ahead of our guidance, but as I noted earlier, the upside is driven mainly by our cost control programs taking hold, and phasing some of our operating expenses into the second half of the year.","Q3 represents more than 40% of our total non-GAAP revenue and 98% of our annual EPS. Similar to the World Series, where the remaining game or two will determine the season for Peter Moore's beloved Boston Red Sox, the next few months will determine the success of our fiscal year. Our team is battle tested and ready, and today we are sending our ace, Battlefield 4, to the mound.","Now with that, I'll turn it back to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Blake. Q2 was an exceptional quarter for EA. With digital growth, improved cost management and a slate of successful titles giving us strong momentum moving into the second half of the year. Our attention is now looking forward to our next-gen launches, ramping up our mobile effort and positioning our long-term IP development to deliver amazing new experiences to our gamers wherever they want to play.","When the next-gen consoles begin to ship next month, EA will deliver an unprecedented lineup in the launch window. Battlefield 4, Madden NFL 25, and FIFA 14 will be available Day 1 for both PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. NBA Live 14 and Need for Speed Rivals then join our next-gen roster just a few days later.","In March, we'll launch Titanfall, a thrilling new first-person action experience from our partners at Respawn Entertainment. In mobile, games like Plants vs. Zombies 2, FIFA 14, The Simpsons: Tapped Out and Real Racing 3 are showing how major brands can break through the cluttered ranks to continually engage players on smartphones and tablets. We will lean heavily into our key brands as we double down on mobile development to accelerate our growth in this vital segment.","In the last 2 weeks, you've also seen several announcements about our product slate for the remainder of this year and into FY '15. We are refining our focus on our biggest brands and great new IP in development, including The Sims 4, EA SPORTS UFC, FIFA World Cup and Dragon Age: Inquisition.","Looking further out, we have a strong pipeline of new IP taking shape, including Star Wars: Battlefront. At our core, we're resolved to continue strengthening EA's relationship with the hundreds of millions of gamers that play our games around the world. Every day, we hear from our gamers about what they'd like to see next from EA. This feedback is incredibly valuable and shapes our decisions about the games we make.","Providing great experiences for our gamers, supporting our talent and executing on our strategy, as well as delivering profitable growth. These are the fundamental beliefs that define EA today. Combined, they drive us to deliver every day on commitments to our most important stakeholders; a commitment to support our talented teams as they create the absolute best games and services; a commitment to do the work needed to be known, loved and respected by gamers for the games that we create and a commitment to deliver profitable growth and continually improved returns to shareholders. I look forward to sharing our successes with all of you in the years to come.","With that, Blake, Peter, Patrick and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird & Company.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","First off, just the launch of Battlefield. Wondered if you can comment on some of the initial feedback, and if the game has ended up in line with your own quality expectations. And then secondly, Andrew, I'm wondering if you can expand a bit on how you see the next-gen cycle impacting EA and the direction that you're taking the company. And moving to the studio level, maybe Patrick, along those same lines, how do you guys see this playing out in terms of the expense structure and the development structure?","Patrick S\u00f6derlund","I'll start, Patrick, I'll start the, on the Battlefield question first. It's very early. We launched the game yesterday in North America. It's coming out in a couple of days in Europe. Early signs are positive, the reviews are strong. I think we have to reflect upon what the DICE team in Sweden have built. It's a game that's we're launching on 5 platforms. It has features that have never been seen before in a game, like you can connect via tablet and play the game in a meaningful way. There are other features, like 64 players in 60 frames that console players will see for the first time. And overall, the reviews, as I said, have been positive. We're seeing a 9.5 from Gametrailers, we're seeing a 9.5 from Machinima, we've seen a 9.0 from Joystiq and on. Peter can probably comment more on market dynamics, but from a product perspective, we're very pleased with it.","Peter Robert Moore","Yes, Colin, it's Peter. As to your question of where we feel, from a publishing perspective, the market has embraced it. We've certainly hit our planned sell-in numbers. If you hit Retailer, and I know you do, you'll see end caps and aisle stuff, you've seen our marketing on television and online. To Patrick's point, it's still early. We've just shipped in the last few hours, obviously in the United States and Canada. We're yet to ship in Europe, and we'll have a better feel for initial sell-through by the end of the week. But so far, so good. We feel all of the core elements are in place. As you've seen with other AAA launches in the last few weeks, current-gen seems to be holding up. We are very, very excited and you've seen a lot of footage that Patrick and his team at DICE had put out on next-gen. We're also excited about what we're seeing on pre-orders for that. So from our perspective, when we look at what the key dynamics are right now, feeling very good. I can tell you that on Origin, the PC version, the preorders are up 35% versus Battlefield 3, and that's a good precursor for the PC version of that game. And we're seeing strong engagement online already for the PC version of Battlefield 4. But early days yet, Colin.","Andrew Wilson","And certainly to answer the question around next-gen and the strategy for the company, I'd start by saying this is my third major transition at this company. And so I've had the great benefit to see the good, the bad and the ugly as we've come through transitions. And certainly coming out of the last transition, we were resolute in our desire to ensure that we didn't have that kind of challenge again. So as we approach this transition, I would say we started work earlier than we ever had done before, and we worked more closely with both Microsoft and Sony throughout the entire process. And the end result is, we have a launch slate of games that are the best transition games that I've ever seen come out of this company. And so as I take that and look forward, I think we are starting this console generation far stronger than we ever have done before. And the platform and the foundation that we have built, I believe, is going to serve to ensure that we can deliver great games to gamers for many, many years to come.","Operator","Edward Williams from BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A quick question, looking at next-gen consoles. What's your thought as to the relative significance that we'll see out of next-gen consoles for revenues, for properties such as FIFA, Madden, Battlefield this year? So how do we kind of gauge what to expect on those or next-gen, call it, 5 months of the year?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Let me start at it, and then I'll have Peter talk a little bit about the market. I think as you know, we've guided that next-gen for fiscal '14 is a relatively small part of our overall business. Clearly, we'll be putting out 5 next-gen titles this quarter. We'll have a better feeling for how quick the uptake is and what the attach rate is to those. And we believe things like Battlefield will do extremely well in next-gen. But we also understand that the market's going to take time to build. And so our forecast for full year assumes relatively low next-gen, uptick of our core business. Pater, you might want to talk about what you see so far...","Peter Robert Moore","Yes. So Edward, you and I had been through many of these transitions together, and you're familiar with the way that this thing climbs and builds into your installed base and then the attach rates. When I talked to our friends at both Sony and Microsoft, and I'm trying to get some indications in the numbers that are going to be available for sale by the end of our fiscal year on March 31 and I aggregate them, I think I can squint and see 10 million units combined, very easily. Both Sony and Microsoft are proposing that this could be their best launches ever as regards their production numbers and their ability to globalize this business quickly. So we feel bullish about our ability, to Blake's point, of having 5 truly next-gen titles available for that. As regards to attach rates, we typically, as you know, see maybe 3 titles per unit. And depending on how aggressive bundling goes on with the first parties, but I don't see any indication that there would be any less than that right now, from what we're seeing and hearing from our retail partners. So I think overall, we feel very bullish. We've got the right product at the right time. We have not had some of the problems some of our fellow publishers in the industry have been getting. Our quality title's ready for next-gen. We feel, as we've said on previous earning calls, we're well ahead of this transition and we're going to nail it. So all in all, again, early days with either of them, both to launch yet, but feeling good about product quality from their end, production quality from their end, franchise quality from our end and our ability to attach strongly to the boxes by the end of the fiscal year.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, great. And then, Blake, if you can comment a little bit the phasing issue, with regards to marketing. How much have you kind of scaled back your marketing that you traditionally would've spent at this point in recognition that these new consoles are launching in November?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Well, our guidance originally had already made some adjustments for the new boxes being launched at Christmas time. And we're trying to be prudent in all our expenses, as you know, and there's a small amount of phasing that's going on. It's not a huge number, but we wanted to just be careful that you guys don't roll all of our savings for the first half of the year into the back half of the year. We're also, as we've talked about, trying to save some dry powder for further marketing if it's required during the holiday season, because we fully appreciate it's going to be a competitive timeframe for titles amongst all the publishers.","Operator","Justin Post of Bank of America.","Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Ryan Gee actually in for Justin. Blake, this is probably a question for you. Talking about the softness you are seeing on the current-gen titles, I'm wondering for 3Q, how much of the guidance assumes that you make up some of that shortcoming on next-gen with sports titles, be it Madden or FIFA, how much do the next-gen console launches help you in 3Q? Or is it really just predicated on the frontline titles hitting? I'm just trying to get a sense what the risk for how that quarter, if maybe Madden or FIFA don't see much of a bump?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, no, I mean, we've -- as we started the year, we forecasted that all the sports titles, with the exception of FIFA, would be down. And that has -- year-to-date, that has proven to be exactly as we had forecasted in line with our guidance. We are assuming that will continue in the back half of the year, and thus the mix that we originally forecasted on Gen4 versus Gen3 will continue as we guided and as we're continuing to observe in our guidance at $4 billion for the full year. I would say if there's greater interest in next-gen boxes or the software attach rate, it's higher than that's upside for us, because we have not built that in as a critical component of our business plan for the year since most of our titles shipped before the next-gen boxes. So long-winded way of saying, it's basically in line with our original guidance, and we're still seeing that play out in the marketplace, and we're confident going forward that, that will be consistent in the back half.","Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then looking ahead, just to the next-gen, it might be a little early but you guys have already talked about Star Wars and we know Titanfall is coming. I was wondering if you can give us a sense for, really, your next-gen endeavors beyond those 2, either talk about your -- percent of resources that are being allocated towards next-gen, or maybe even just the number of titles you guys have in the works. One of your competitors today talked about the number of next-gen titles they have coming. So if you could do anything around that, that would be great.","Andrew Wilson","So I don't know that we've got a lot to share at this point, other than you can expect us to continue to invest behind the big brands that we've talked about today. The second piece I would say is, that we are continuing to invest heavily, both in our Frostbite engine and our Ignite engine and our underlying digital platform. And while we certainly have incubation going on through the company, we believe that those engines, in and of themselves, will ensure that any products that we bring out in the future will certainly be genre-defining and hopefully industry-defining titles.","Blake J. Jorgensen","And we have, I think as you know, we've talked about, without specifics on timing, we've talked obviously about titles like UFC, which is being developed and introduced next year. Obviously, a FIFA World Cup. We've talked about Dragon Age, and obviously, the Star Wars titles, ultimately in the future years. And so there's a lot going on. And much of our cost base is turning from Gen3 development to Gen4 development. Historically, that's been a problem for us, this time I think we've managed it extremely well, and that's why we're able to hold our cost down. And we'll continue to reduce our cost in Gen3 development as our Gen4 takes over the full development. But we will have Gen3 and Gen4 titles in the mix for a long time to come. Just as no different than we'd still ship the occasional Gen2 title that we're still making. So it's part of how we operate the business. And I think we've had a very good handle on the cost in that shift, and should help us continue to bring our cost down in the future.","Operator","Doug Creutz from Cowen & Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wonder if one of you could talk, maybe about FIFA a bit. I think in your prepared comments, you certainly implied that your selling for FIFA in the September quarter was not down year-over-year. We've certainly seen some evidence that the sell-through has been weak. Could you maybe talk about how that's trending, is embedded in your December quarter guidance, maybe a little bit less than re-orders of FIFA than you might normally expect to see in a year?","Peter Robert Moore","Hey Doug, it's Peter. Yes, I mean, we've hit our selling numbers. As you know, our sell-through right now was a little softer than we projected, but nothing that we didn't expect ultimately, given the commentary you've heard from Blake here. I think the important thing to look at here is data that you can see is engagement levels that we're enjoying on FIFA right now, and they're certainly up year-on-year versus FIFA 13. Why is that important? Because of the amount of digital revenue we can continue to drive. You know very well the importance of FIFA Ultimate Team and the other Ultimate Teams that Blake alluded to in his prepared comments and how important that is to the growth going forward. Engagement is what we're looking at right now. FIFA has got a very long tail, and next-gen will give it a boost on top of that. But we're ready for an exciting next-gen FIFA. You've seen the trailer this week that we launched. We think that helps us enormously. And current-gen, certainly, on a global basis, on a global title like this, still, it will be very important for a number of years to come. So yes, selling was a plan. I think replenishment will continue. Engagement is above plan, which is very important to us and we'll continue to push hard as we always do.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, and I think remember, as well that we're doing some bundling with Microsoft in Europe around Xbox One. And while we think we've done a good job of predicting, it's hard to determine, in fact, how much that may have impacted sell-through in any key markets. And that product, obviously is built into the Q3 and Q4 forecast. But remember also that part of the reason that Q3 revenues shifted into Q4 is some of the upgrade programs where we've -- we're providing a upgrade for users from a Gen3 title to a Gen4. We won't recognize that revenue until Q4 and thus some of the phasing difference.","Operator","Drew Crum from Stifel, Nicolaus.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So Blake, I wonder if you could dig in a little deeper on the gross margin guidance for the third quarter, 68% looks relatively high to prior quarters. And we'd think it could be a little lower, given the console launch for Battlefield. And then, a question on Titanfall. We've got some history with The Sims. You're suggesting that the slate shift will be neutral to earnings. Can you talk about your assumptions or expectations for Titanfall? And can you let us know if this is a times exclusive or not?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes. So first on the gross margin. Gross margin guidance of 68%, relative to 66% in Q3 FY '13, excuse me, is it's higher for a couple of reasons. One, higher shift of packaged goods to digital, a mix shift -- overall revenue mix shift, and obviously, Battlefield is a very high-margin title relative to what we saw in Q3 of last year. So we're very confident in that gross margin forecast, and much of it has to do with both Battlefield and the digital piece. On Titanfall versus The Sims, a couple of things to note. First, with our partners at Respawn, who have done an amazing job developing what looks like a fabulous game. They've done a fantastic job keeping that on schedule and possibly even ahead of schedule in some ways. We saw an opportunity and a launch window in the fourth quarter because of some of the critical titles that were planned to be there moving out of the quarter, like Watchdogs or The Crew or some other titles, it looked like they're being delayed. Titanfall is a title that also has an amazing following already in the market. Ever since it was shown at E3, people have been highly interested in it. Microsoft wanted to include it in its marketing campaign associated with Xbox, which you're seeing in the market today. And all of that led us to decide to move it into the year. The Sims is a title that can be shipped almost any time in the year. The Sims 3 was shipped in June 2009. It can ship in the summer, in the winter, in the fall. It's a title that has a huge following. And we can always continue to develop, because much of that title is based on not just the base title, but also expansion packs. And so we'll use the additional time to continue to develop greater expansion packs and the product. In terms of the forecast, both products were expected to ship in the last part of the quarter, essentially the middle of March. So it's only 2 weeks of sales. In the case of Titanfall, it's a brand-new IP, and it's exclusive only, for the life of the title, on Xbox One and Xbox 360 and PCs. It's a first-person shooter, and 2 of the biggest shooters are our own shooter Battlefield and obviously Call of Duty, will have already shipped in the holiday. And so we're being somewhat conservative in our forecast for what the revenue is, and it's similar to what we expected for The Sims. Second, The Sims is a high-margin product because it's wholly-owned IP. Titanfall is obviously a product that we share the revenues and profits with Respawn. But as any of our developed titles through our partnership agreements, we typically invest in the title and expense those costs along the way. And so for the year, the profitability of Titanfall is similar to The Sims, because we've already expensed the bulk of that R&D. And thus the trade-off in profitability is equal, and we found that it was a good time to shift one for the other. And so that's the quick story, and we're extremely excited about both Titanfall and The Sims, and we think it's going to help make not just this year, but next year very, very strong.","Operator","Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Andrew, sorry to sound like a worrywart and Blake, you addressed this a little bit, but I mean, frankly, we're not used to seeing game release dates come early. It's usually the other way. So we're wondering if Titanfall is being rushed a little bit, and what extra steps you might be taking to ensure the quality is there? As this first release should hopefully be one of many. And Blake, in your quarterly disclosure, you have some off balance sheet liabilities reaching about $1.3 billion right now, so I'm just wondering what this is, and if you can give color as to where this is coming from?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, Stephen, let me start with the off balance sheet item, and then I'll have Patrick and Andrew talk to the Titanfall. Patrick's been very close to the Titanfall development. As a simple reminder, we always said Titanfall was spring of this year, so we were always planning either March, April, May, right in there, so it's not a big movement in title. But Patrick's been working with the team at Respawn, and he can talk to that. On the off balance sheet liabilities, I know that's a question that comes up because I've heard it from quite a few investors, as well as analysts. And people tend to worry about anything they see as off balance sheet. I think critical in our business is, we want to make sure people understand what our forward commitments are for any of our developer or licensor agreements. We have those with, obviously sports leagues, with athletes, a whole variety of people. The key to remember is, those are tied to products. So the risk would be, we stop making the product. And I don't think we're going to stop making FIFA anytime soon. And thus any of those future commitments that are associated with FIFA revenue, i.e. royalty on FIFA revenue, we would continue to be able to make. So the case out there that says, the off balance sheet liabilities are a problem, have to imply that we would actually exit products and be on the hook for those liabilities. And in most cases, they are tied directly to products like FIFA, like Madden, like Star Wars, where we have all intentions of making the product and all intentions of making a really strong products that will easily cover the royalties within the goals of our profitability plans going forward. So with that, let me turn it to Patrick and Andrew on the Respawn ship dates.","Patrick S\u00f6derlund","Yes, this is Patrick. So on the quality side, and if we're rushing a game, I would say no, we're not doing that at all. This is a very experienced, seasoned team, one of the best in the industry. They've got a bunch of great games under their belt. We have been monitoring and working with them for a long time. This has been a game that's been in development for multiple years. And all the data that we have in front of us suggest that this game will not only be highly rated, but very highly rated. So I feel better than I would normally feel at this time, on a game like this.","Andrew Wilson","And certainly, I think your perception is right. Throughout our industry, that might be different, but having seen the game, having seen what's coming, we are very, very excited about the launch of Titanfall, and truly believe it's going to define this platform generation from the outset.","Operator","Arvind Bhatia from Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","My question is on FIFA 14 Xbox One bundle in Europe. Blake, can you help us maybe understand the economics and the accounting a little bit better? Will the profitability of FIFA 14 with a bundle be very similar, maybe a little better, because you get some help from Microsoft? Or is it a little bit less, but you make it up on volumes? Just curious how it's all going to work.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, I can't comment on the specifics. What I would say is that it's a part of a Microsoft bundle, and so thus we're not reserving any sales reserves or price protection that we might normally reserve on a normal product in the channel. It's going in through a Microsoft box. But you should trust that we're not providing a major discount on the product. We want to maintain the profitability of the FIFA franchise, and that's critical to us. What we're really trying to do is help introduce new players to FIFA, and Microsoft is trying to build a bigger share in Europe for Xbox, and those 2 fit really well together. Peter, you want to...","Peter Robert Moore","Yes, I could, I think -- and the third leg to that stool is the fact that the more people that obviously get FIFA in their hands, the more opportunity we have to be able to provide them with the digital services, FIFA Ultimate Team, particularly in the European market where we see very strong engagement levels. So to Blake's point, this is about Xbox One being driven hard with a world-class game that gamers, particularly again in the European marketplace flock to. It allows us to get obviously 100% of those consoles attached to FIFA, and as a result, our attach rate to digital consumers in the digital services, in the form of FIFA Ultimate Team benefit us. So I think it's a win-win for both companies.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","One bigger picture, longer-term question for you guys as a management team. As you forecast and look out in this next-generation, I know that previously a lot of people were thinking this coming generation is going to be perhaps slightly smaller than the last gen. As you guys now think about everything you know, the titles that are coming out, the number of units, et cetera, in terms of consoles, has your opinion shifted at all one way or the other? Are you incrementally more bullish, you thinking the next cycle's going to be similar, bigger, smaller? Just curious how you think about the next 5 years or so?","Andrew Wilson","Yes, I think it's a great question. Certainly, as we look at this console generation, I think we, as a company, have always been excited about it. One, it's made us progressively more excited and more bullish, I believe, this would come through this year, is as we've seen the kind of energy and excitement at a consumer level, really start to resonate. I think it really started to heat up at E3. We saw an energy around our industry that haven't seen in a little while. It's certainly reached a roll by Gamescom, which is a consumer-driven show, and we really saw an energy there. And again, when you look at the success of a console generation through the combination of 2 things, great consoles and great software. And as I talked about earlier, I think that our launch software this time is head and shoulders above where we were last time. And certainly will, I believe, satiate appetite for gamers and actually grow the industry over time. So we are certainly bullish as we come into this platform generation, particularly as well as we have executed.","Blake J. Jorgensen","I think the other thing to remember is, we're a completely different company than we were during the last console transition. A huge portion, over $1.75 billion of our revenue is coming from digital, and what that really means is, we're looking for ways to not just diversify our revenue, but also to enter new parts of the market that didn't exist before, mobile, free-to-play PC. Many of these didn't exist in the last console transition, certainly were monetized like they are today, and we're trying to make sure we're focused on all of those areas. And we're trying to take our current product strength and extend that through building the life of the product at a much more exciting gameplay that goes on for 1 year or 2 years. We were selling, in Q2 of this year, Battlefield 3. And the reason for that is, Battlefield Premium, the love for the product and the excitement around the product. We'd like all of our products to have that type of life, that is extending the gameplay over time, and we think that's going to be critical to our success.","Andrew Wilson","Yes, and one more point, actually a couple more points on that, is that this is the third transition I've gone through, and both companies here have pieces of hardware that feel to me, certainly, from my experience, that the pricing can come down pretty aggressively over the next few years. Sony is starting off of a full $200 cheaper than they did in the previous generation. The services attached to these consoles now are incredibly sticky, and both companies are touting their entertainment features, which make this a must-have device, not just for hard-core gamers but for households, for families. And when you bring all of that together, I think our ability to be able, as a company, to take advantage of that is huge. But to Blake's point, we're a different company than we were 8 years ago when this previous generation started. And the diversification of our content offerings, our ability to deliver live services, allows us to be somewhat inoculated from the bumpiness of console transitions. And I think you're seeing -- you're certainly seeing that in this past quarter, and you're going to see that going forward here. But certain amount of bullishness that I think I certainly can talk about, and what retailers around the world talk to me about, versus maybe where we were 6 months ago when we were looking at this console generation transition.","Operator","Ben Schachter from Macquarie research.","Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research","A couple of high-level questions, and then one quick housekeeping one. I'm not asking for guidance but over the next few years, how do you think ASPs or ARPU can really differ on this next-gen versus the current-gen? And what are going to be the main key drivers for that? And then second one is just on mobile. Understanding that franchises and big franchises are key in mobile, but aside from that, what are the other big advantages that you can bring to mobile, because of the scale of EA?","Andrew Wilson","I'll take a crack at that. Certainly, I think it's hard to predict the average return per user over time, and certainly as part of the console generation. But here is what I would say is that our games are, in fact, engaging gamers for longer and with greater immersion than they ever had. As we think about the gamer that has a certain entertainment spend, a portion in their wallet from week-to-week, month-to-month, the more of their engagement time that we can drive, and the greater and deeper experiences that we can drive, we should almost certainly benefit from a greater proportion of that predetermined entertainment spend. And so as we look forward when we're thinking about developing games, we now always build games plus services. We're moving from product to product plus service. You've seen it in the trailing 12 to 18 months, and you will certainly see it on a go forward basis. And that's good for us, and it's good for gamers, and we believe that is the future of this company. When you think about mobile and what we can do there, again, if I think about how gamers play, they're -- more and more gamers are playing and they're playing for more and more time, and their desire for more integrated, immersive experiences with high fidelity controls, high fidelity graphics, stronger store reactions, just greater levels of engagement opportunity overall, that starts to play to our strengths. And so when we think about mobile on a go forward basis, some of the greatest things that we have been doing through the history of this company really start to become a strength, as the personality of mobile gamers advances and evolves, and as platform hardware increases in processing, GPU, output and memory. So all things considered, if you combine the services against console that we believe are the foundation for the future of this company, and you look at where mobile is going and how that plays into the strength of us as a company, that potentially some of our newer competitors do not share, we feel very good about the future.","Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research","Okay, and just quick housekeeping. I came on a little late. But Peter, I think you said, 10 million units combined for the next-gen. Was that your fiscal year?","Peter Robert Moore","That's the estimate for what I see, and speaking with our partners at Sony and Microsoft. Those are available for sale on the shelf by March 31 of 2014, yes.","Operator","Brian Pitz of Jefferies.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","It's Tim O'Shea for Brian. Just given the strong competitive launch in some of the new hardware on the horizon, I'm wondering if you can give us a high-level sense for what you're seeing at retail? To what extent do you see consumers trimming the spend? And I'm just curious if the EA SPORTS upgrade program might address some of this behavior. And then, quickly, do you think that we could ever expect to see this type of upgrade plan for other games, like Battlefield?","Peter Robert Moore","Yes, Tim, this is Peter. Certainly, what we're seeing now at retail is a great expectation on next-gen. In fact, I was in retail yesterday, and you can see, if you guys -- you all visit, how retailers, the big box guys like Walmart and Best Buy, the specialty guys like Gamesoft are getting ready for next-gen. I want to remind everyone on the call, this is the first time that we've had 2 major console launches in the same couple of weeks, never happened before with a magnitude that we're seeing. If you're paying any attention at all, I know you are on television, you're starting to see Microsoft and Sony gear up to what should be a massive investment in marketing over the period between now and the holidays. And I think retailers in particular are starting to see that. You've seen a recent AAA launch when you have the right content that catches the imagination of gamers blow through the roof. And I think that bodes well for retail. Certainly, we are enjoying the fact that they have clearly had a very strong month and that gives them the bullishness and the investment level to be able to invest, going forward, both in current-gen and next-gen. But I, for one, couldn't be more excited about what I'm feeling right now in the marketplace. Retailers around the world are gearing up with great anticipation. And our partners at Sony and Microsoft are about, I believe, to embark upon a level of unprecedented spend that we'd never seen in this industry yet, so I think it's all coming together very, very well.","Blake J. Jorgensen","And just a clarification, that is if I understood your question, we have upgrade programs on sports titles. We also have it on Battlefield 4 for Sony that's running through their program for Gen3 to Gen4 upgrade.","Peter Robert Moore","Yes, and just to be clear on that, if everybody's not familiar, it's a way of allowing consumers to invest in current-gen and yet protecting their investment if and when they get a next-gen box, in which in most cases, they can spend $9.99 and get the next-gen version of the same game.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes. So our programs are 2-fold, one is to protect people, the Ultimate Team investment, as it transitions from Gen3 to Gen4, as well as to upgrade people with the physical title or electronic title from Gen3 to Gen4.","Operator","Our last question comes from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","2 quick ones here. Blake, regarding the op margin target, you kind of reiterated, you've been pushing towards 20%-plus. Not to kind of put you on the spot, but would you be willing to offer under what kind of timeframe do you think about achieving that range of op margin? And then the other question on Battlefield. Obviously, Battlefield 4 shipped today, so I know you don't want to talk about Battlefield 5, but it would be important for fiscal '15. Can you just provide some thoughts on why it would or would not make sense to annualize Battlefield, versus coming out with another first-person shooter to fill its place every other year?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Well, I'll take a crack at the first part of the question and then I'll let Patrick, since he's the guy who's got to build it. I'll let Patrick answer the second part. So on the op margin, we've talked publicly about our goal of moving our operating margins into the 20s. And we've talked about that over a 3-year period without providing explicit guidance. This is the first year in that 3-year period, and we are making the right moves to start to move that number up. We obviously guided to a higher number, and we've been exceeding that in the first half of the year. We're very focused on, I would say we're all 100% aligned on making that happen. And it's a journey that we need to just continue to move on out through the next couple of years, but then on into the future. And it's going to require great products, stuff that consumers really gravitate to and love, and a huge portion of that being delivered either digitally or mobilely, as well as continuing to have built off a great franchise that we have like Battlefield and FIFA.","Patrick S\u00f6derlund","Yes, this is Patrick. So when it comes to Battlefield on an annual basis, I mean, from my perspective, this is a day where we just, today launched Battlefield 4. And obviously, there's been a lot of long hours that's gone into making -- getting it into the market. And again, I think it's a major achievement from our dev teams. I don't have anything to announce. To be honest, as it relates to Battlefield, apart from the fact that we need to lick our wounds a little bit on this one, enjoy the success and then come back at a later time.","Blake J. Jorgensen","We were highly conscious of the fact that if Battlefield is as successful as we believe it'll be, that, that sets ourselves up for a challenge next year. But remember, we're introducing NBA this year. We're introducing UFC next year. We have Sims next year, we would most likely, possibly have Dragon Age next year. And so a World Cup next year as well, and so there's a lot to fill, that these holes that Battlefield may create, which should be a good problem to have. But you'll hear more about our ultimate revenue and plans and title plans when we give guidance later in the year.","Andrew Wilson","And when Patrick said lick his wounds, that's Swedish for enjoy the launch of what is a [indiscernible].","Blake J. Jorgensen","So thank you, everybody.","Peter Robert Moore","Thanks a lot, everyone.","Andrew Wilson","Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

My name is Brandy, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q2 Fiscal '20 Earnings Conference Call.","Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Chris Evenden","Thanks, Brandy. Welcome to EA's second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our COO and CFO. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks.

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Chris. We continued a strong FY '20 with an excellent second quarter. Our latest EA SPORTS titles are captivating a growing global player base, and deep engagement in these titles and our ongoing live services fueled our continued momentum through Q2. As a result, our revenue and earnings per share exceeded our expectations for Q2, and we are raising our full year guidance today.","At Electronic Arts, we are focused on creating amazing new games and content, offering live services that extend and enhance the experience, and reaching more players when and where they want to play. I\u2019ll share a few highlights here of how we delivered against these focus areas during Q2.","First, let\u2019s cover our new games. EA SPORTS is innovating for a growing audience of fans. Madden NFL 20 is off to an outstanding start, growing year-over-year in player engagement, units sold and Ultimate Team. The excellent core gameplay and fresh new experiences in franchise mode are delivering for our loyal fans, while Superstar X-Factors and the all-new Superstar KO mode are resonating with a broader football community. With a launch that began earlier in the preseason and a second major beat at the NFL Kickoff weekend that brought more players into the game, we\u2019ve delivered growth across the board in Madden. Unique players were up 12% year-over-year in Q2, games played in franchise mode more than doubled to over 100 million in the same period, and Madden Ultimate Team unique players are up nearly 20% year over-year. Our Madden competitive gaming season has kicked off as well. Our major tournaments are aligned to key moments in the NFL season, we have a groundbreaking virtual stadium rights partner, and other major brands are partnering with us throughout the Madden NFL 20 Championship Series.","The innovation in FIFA 20 is also deeply engaging fans and bringing new players into the franchise. Total players in FIFA were up nearly 15% year-over-year in Q2, and with the addition of the VOLTA Football street soccer experience, new-to-franchise players have grown 7% year over-year. Enhancements to the core gameplay and Ultimate Team are also re-engaging more franchise veterans, with unique players in FIFA Ultimate Team growing 22% over last year.","People are playing more FIFA than ever before, with total in-game matches up more than 30% year-over-year. And as players continue to engage in the FIFA 20 experience and Ultimate Team, our FIFA 20 Global Series is kicking off in November, with millions set to compete in our unparalleled nine-month worldwide esports competition. Last season, more than 800 million minutes of FIFA esports content were watched, and with sponsors like Adidas and others breaking new ground with us this year, we\u2019re excited to reach an expanding audience with more great content.","We also saw growth across our broader EA SPORTS portfolio. With innovations in NHL 20 delivering for hockey fans, Hockey Ultimate Team grew year-over-year in Q2. FIFA Online in Korea had some of our strongest-ever months on PC, and we\u2019re also seeing growth in China.","FIFA Mobile has now been downloaded more than 250 million times life to date, following the launch of our latest season that includes 650 new in-game events. It was a very strong Q2 for EA SPORTS, and we\u2019re excited to build on that momentum throughout FY20.","Q2 also showed the strength of our ongoing live services. In Apex Legends, we continue to deepen our long-term investment in the game and its community. With each successive season of new content, we are building, adding to the experience, and learning. For the first season in March, we launched the Battle Pass, and began the regular introduction of new legends. In the second season in July, we brought more content, a map update, ranked leagues and larger events. The third season, which launched in October, is our biggest yet with an entirely new map, amazing events like the Halloween-themed content in the game now, and much more to come. Weekly average player peaks in Season Three are significantly above our Season Two peaks, and we\u2019re continuing to bring more new players into the game. Apex Legends is a major long term franchise for us. Since launch, we\u2019ve significantly expanded the team working on the game, and it continues to grow. Our pipeline of future content is packed with really fun experiences that will be delivered through upcoming seasons and a regular cadence of updates for the community. With the Apex Legends community now growing past 70 million players, we\u2019re focused on expanding to mobile, new platforms and new geographies, as well as launching an Apex competitive gaming program that we\u2019ll share details on soon.","The Sims 4 also continues to be an incredible long-term live service with a growing audience. Monthly average players are up more than 40% year-over-year in The Sims 4, and engagement across the franchise has led The Sims to surpass $5 billion in lifetime sales. The Sims continues to be one of the great franchises in gaming, and we have plans to bring new experiences to its amazing players for a long time to come.","We are also reaching new milestones as we seek to bring great games and services to more players on more platforms. The launch of EA Access on PlayStation 4 significantly grew our subscriber base through the course of Q2. We also announced this morning our plans to bring EA Access to Steam on PC, adding a fourth platform where players will be able to connect and get the benefits and value of our subscription service. This is a unique and exciting partnership with Valve that will enable us to bring PC players in the Steam and Origin communities together. Helping more players connect to our games whenever and wherever they want to play will be a continuing focus for us. We look forward to sharing more announcements about other platforms in the coming months.","For our holiday quarter of FY '20, we\u2019re delivering great new games and content across our portfolio. First, the irreverent new Plants vs. Zombies: Battle for Neighborville launched two weeks ago to praise from fans and critics, and we\u2019re looking forward to the holidays for this family-friendly game. In early November, Need for Speed Heat arrives for racing fans, blending street racing by day and underground racing by night, all with the deep customization that fans expect. Players have been getting primed through the Need for Speed Heat Studio mobile app launched this summer, where they have already customized more than 7 million cars, which can be loaded straight into the game at launch.","Then, on November 15, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order arrives worldwide. This game is coming to market at such an amazing time. From the launch of Star Wars: Galaxy\u2019s Edge at Disney theme parks; to the upcoming Disney+ series The Mandalorian; to ongoing games like Galaxy of Heroes, Battlefront II, and The Old Republic; to the culmination of the Skywalker saga in the upcoming film, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker, this is a year unlike any other for hundreds of millions of Star Wars fans out there. The one fantasy that many of those fans have been telling us they want is to experience the journey of becoming a Jedi and we\u2019re set to deliver that with Jedi: Fallen Order. The Respawn team have been pouring their passion into creating this new game in partnership with Lucasfilm, with characters old and new, and a story that is now an authentic part of the Star Wars universe. It\u2019s going to be a thrilling adventure to play, and with more than 140 million views to date of trailers and videos for the game, the community is eager to jump into Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order in just a few more weeks.","The holidays will also be a busy season for players in our live services. Our Battlefield V players will be able to jump into the expansive new Pacific theater, a major addition to the game that includes new factions, maps, weapons and vehicles, starting two days from now. And in Apex Legends, our EA SPORTS franchises, The Sims 4, Anthem and Star Wars Battlefront II, our communities will all have new content and new experiences to dive into during the holiday quarter.","Looking farther ahead, I want to share a few thoughts on FY \u201821 and our plans for the continued growth of Electronic Arts. We reach a massive global audience of players with our games today, and we have a core business fueled by live services that continues to grow. Next year, we will build on that with a full slate of new EA SPORTS experiences, including new titles that we are adding to our sports portfolio. New consoles are always an opportunity to drive more innovation in our EA SPORTS games, as our fans are eager to begin experiencing a new generation of play.","That will include our plans for NBA LIVE. With great support from the NBA and NBA Players Association, we had been working on an innovative new direction for our game timed with the All-Star weekend, an experience designed around new ways for players to engage, connect and create through basketball. Now, with greater understanding of the new platforms and what they can power, bringing social connection, accessibility, and player creativity to the forefront, we feel we can go so much further with the new design. So we\u2019ve decided not to ship an NBA LIVE game in FY '20. Instead, we\u2019re expanding our vision for NBA LIVE, and continuing to work closely with our NBA and NB Players Association partners on this new project that we\u2019ll share more details on next year.","Our live services will continue to grow and enhance the experience in our major franchises. We\u2019re expanding our Apex Legends team to deliver our content plans for FY '21, and we will reach new audiences through mobile and across Asia. We have ongoing growth expectations for The Sims 4, with new expansions and all-new ways to engage and grow the community. Our Battlefield franchise and its community are also a major focus for us, and we\u2019ll add new content and new ways to play Battlefield V in FY '21. Targeting new innovation that will be enabled by next-gen platforms and a growing install base on the new consoles, our next Battlefield game is set for FY '22.","We also have plans for new experiences that we\u2019ve not yet announced for next year, new titles and new IP for multiple platforms. Introducing new games will always be at our core, and we look forward to exciting players with unexpected new titles in FY21.","We will also be driving new opportunities to connect with more players through expansion our subscription services, new platforms, cloud gaming, and more. We\u2019re confident in the continued growth of our business at Electronic Arts through FY '20, FY '21 and beyond. We have a big holiday quarter ahead of us, and we\u2019re excited to continue a strong year.","Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks, Andrew. The strong results this quarter illustrate the power of our focus on live services and on our core franchises. Games are evolving, and the way people play them is changing. We had great launches for FIFA and Madden, and the quarter\u2019s story is dominated by live services that engage players over extended periods of time. Live services strength in Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, Apex Legends and FIFA Online drove performance significantly above last year.","I\u2019ll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter\u2019s results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.","EA\u2019s net revenue was $1.348 billion, above our guidance by $33 million. Operating expenses were $675 million, $4 million lower than our guidance. GAAP operating income was $268 million, compared to an operating income of $258 million a year ago, and resulted in earnings per share of $2.89, $0.29 better than our guidance. As a reminder, $2.11 of our earnings was driven by the tax benefit we disclosed previously. Underlying profit was much stronger than we had expected, driven by increased sales, lower operating expenses and a richer digital mix.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $37 million, up $163 million from last year. The increase was driven primarily by higher profit and faster collections. Operating cash flow for the trailing twelve months was $1.748 billion, $290 million above last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $27 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $10 million. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.","During the quarter, we also repurchased 3.3 million shares at a cost of $306 million, leaving $674 million available in our buyback program. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.9 billion.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.277 billion, up $55 million on the prior year, and $47 million above our guidance. Performance over guidance was driven by broad strength across our portfolio with notable growth in live services. Digital net bookings were $790 million, up 24% on the year-ago period, and a new record for the second quarter, driven by growth across our numerous live services offerings as well as an increase in full-game digital downloads. Digital net bookings represented 78% of our business on a trailing twelve-month basis, compared to 69% in the prior year.","Looking at each of the components of this quarter\u2019s digital net bookings in turn, Live services net bookings were up 50% year-on-year, to $493 million, another new Q2 record. The increase was driven by Apex Legends, Ultimate Team, in Madden, FIFA and NHL, The Sims 4, and FIFA Online, partially offset by the tail of Battlefield 1 DLC. EA Access is off to a great start on PlayStation.","Ultimate Team net bookings grew strongly year-on-year for both Madden and FIFA. Even adjusting for the fact that Madden had an extra week in the quarter, and both Madden and FIFA benefitted from early access sales on PlayStation through EA Access, both were up double-digit percentages over last year. Notably, given that we launched VOLTA Football in FIFA 20 and it immediately became the number 2 mode in the game, behind only Ultimate Team, weekly average users for FIFA Ultimate Team still grew 15% year-on-year.","Mobile delivered net bookings of $122 million, down 20% year-on-year, driven by aging titles. The segment outperformed our expectations, driven by new content in Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes. FIFA Mobile China, FIFA Online 4 Mobile, Madden Mobile and Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes all grew this quarter, and, subsequent to quarter end, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes had its second-biggest day ever.","Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $175 million, 11% higher than last year, another Q2 record. The digital portion of Madden sales increased 9 percentage points year-on-year, to 51%. FIFA launched just days before the end of the quarter, but based on the first 3 weeks of sales, it was about 34% digital, up from 29% in the comparable period for FIFA 19.","Overall, 50% of our unit sales were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the 12 months to September 30. This compares to just 42% a year ago.","Turning to guidance. Our expectation for full-year GAAP revenue is $5.410 billion, and earnings per share of $9.57. As a reminder, $5.74 of this is driven by the tax benefit we disclosed previously.","We expect operating cash flow of about $1.625 billion, $50 million above our prior expectations. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.50 billion.","With regards to business drivers, we have raised our net bookings outlook for the year to $5.125 billion. Live services remain strong, and we continue to expect Apex Legends and The Sims to both deliver net bookings in the $300 million to $400 million range. We\u2019re not passing through the full beat, primarily as the FX headwind has increased significantly and we have pushed NBA Live 20 and Respawn\u2019s VR Medal of Honor title out of the year. Together, these headwinds amount to approximately $100 million against our original expectations for net bookings.","For the third quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.51 billion, cost of revenue to be $482 million, and operating expenses of $733 million. OpEx is up year-on-year, driven by the negative adjustment to variable compensation a year ago. This results in earnings per share of $0.92 for the third quarter using the diluted share count of 295 million.","We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.94 billion. This is up 21% year-on-year, driven by live services, particularly Apex Legends and Ultimate Team, and because we have two launches in the quarter this year, versus one last year. We released the launch trailer for Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order this morning, and early reaction appears extremely positive. We\u2019re excited to bring this action title to Star Wars fans on November 15, and continue to model sales in the range of 6 to 8 million units. We are modelling Need For Speed Heat to perform similarly to previous titles in that franchise, with unit sales of 3 to 4 million units.","Looking further ahead, I\u2019d like to expand on the view Andrew gave you into our fiscal 2021 slate. We\u2019re doubling down on live services combined with our core franchises. We\u2019re investing in Apex Legends as our shooter in fiscal 2021. We expect to drive growth in all of our major live services next year, including Ultimate Team, Apex Legends, FIFA Online and The Sims. We will continue to grow our subscription business. We believe Apex growth will be driven in part by the continued expansion of content and by the launch of the service on new platforms, geographies and on mobile. As Andrew noted, the Sims is now a $5 billion franchise for us, and it continues to grow, driven by new content and new platforms.","Mobile growth will be driven by the ramp of our new Plants vs. Zombies title, sports on mobile, including FIFA Mobile in Asia, and Apex Legends, offset by aging titles elsewhere in our portfolio.","With regards to product launches in fiscal 2021, we will add at least one more sports title to our annual slate. We will launch Medal of Honor VR. We\u2019ll deliver some exciting remasters of fan favorites, including the Command & Conquer game we\u2019ve already disclosed. And we have two new unannounced EA Partners titles coming from third-party developers. In addition, we have other unannounced titles in the FY21 slate, we will give specifics nearer the time.","Overall, we expect to drive growth in net bookings and underlying profits for fiscal 2021. We will provide formal guidance on our Q4 call as usual. Growth in fiscal 2022 will be led by a new and very exciting Battlefield title. I introduced the quarter by discussing how player preferences have changed the way we build and deliver games. We\u2019re investing in games that people play for longer and engage with much more deeply. For example, the number of matches played in FIFA per player has grown nearly 10% year-on-year, and we expect VOLTA to grow that still further. Similarly, the time spent playing matches in Madden NFL 20 is up by about one third. We expect this strategy and focus will continue to drive growth and profitability for the company through the remainder of this year and beyond.","With that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks Blake. It is a great time to be part of the interactive entertainment industry. The excitement throughout the community for new experiences and innovation shows how games more than any other form of entertainment can bring people together. Billions of people, from every corner of the world, bring their passion to play, connect, compete, and share through games. Making that possible is what drives every single one of us at Electronic Arts.","Amazing games are the very core of our business growth. We have a powerful and diverse portfolio of games across genres, fulfilling a breadth of motivations for our players. From escape in Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, to competition though EA SPORTS, to social connection in Battlefield V, and more. Creativity fuels our future, and our studios have many more new experiences in development. New IP at Motive, new projects at DICE, Bioware, Maxis and Criterion, new mobile titles, new titles for EA SPORTS, new indie and third-party developer titles, all that will continue to excite and grow our global audience.","Live services extend and enhance the experience of those games. Apex Legends, FIFA, The Sims 4, Galaxy of Heroes and more of our top franchises have thriving global communities spanning hundreds of millions of players. We\u2019ve been pioneers in this space, building on years of expertise and success to deliver continuously evolving experiences fueled by new content, in game events, and fan-requested updates. Competitive gaming adds another dimension to the experience to play and watch, and we\u2019re building on our strength here with more of our franchises set to enter esports in the coming months. As players around the world play their favorite games for longer periods of time, robust live services will continue to be vital to the experience, and a growth driver for our business.","Reaching more players on more platforms is also a key driver for us. New consoles, cloud gaming, and more platform choices will continue to expand the addressable audience. We\u2019re thrilled to be bringing the EA and Steam communities together through the EA Access subscription, and we\u2019re working to reach more platforms in the near future. As cloud gaming continues to develop, through Project Atlas we are testing games streamed on public cloud infrastructure to ensure we are at the forefront of this developing space. We\u2019re also very excited to continue working with our first-party partners on their new platforms, where we\u2019ll be well positioned to deliver some outstanding new experiences beginning next year.","With some of the most talented, creative and passionate teams in the industry, we are building momentum. Our focus on making great games and live services for more players around the world has never been stronger.","Now Blake and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks for taking the question. Maybe two if I can. On the live services commentary, just want to make sure we are understanding the key messages on how much of the doubling down on live services has to do with existing franchises, which is how we should think about the key to investment and make against new franchises where you see pockets of the industry where you can extend into live services and broaden out the portfolio looking out over the next couple years? That's number one.","And, Andrew, you're coming on EA SPORTS, I'm just curious what you mean by the potential to broaden out the portfolio there as well. We saw a headline today about the MCAA and possible compensation of athlete. That's an area where you guys have historically had some success going back to football title from years ago. How should we think about the opportunity around broadening out EA SPORTS as well? Thanks so much, guys.","Blake Jorgensen","So let me take live server one first, Eric. You know, we have invested heavily in live services over the past 10 years. Obviously, we're seeing the benefits of that today with titles like Ultimate Team across all our sports and The Sims, obviously Apex is a new live service which we will invest heavily in to try to continue to grow that business. We view that as an annual shooter franchise effectively. And we're trying to build that as a 10 year business not one year or two year business. And we're very excited about the roadmap that the response team has put in place.","Beyond that, obviously FIFA Online in Asia is critical. We're announcing as we move from FIFA Online 3 to FIFA Online 4 in Korea rapid growth. We're still operating both platforms online 3, and online 4 in China and over time, we'll move to a single platform there. But we feel like we're out of the woods on the bad comp from last year and so we're starting to see good growth there. And we're looking at how do we extend live services across every single one of our titles that can be as successful or more successful than what we see on our sports titles and The Sims and Apex. That includes titles like Battlefield titles, the action game like Anthem and you\u2019ll continue to see improvements across that and we\u2019re excited about where that can go. It is how people want to play games. It is where we think we have a skillset that is different than many of the other game companies and we think we can continue to be very successful there.","Andrew Wilson","On the EA\u2019s SPORTS point, there are a number of EA SPORTS games that we\u2019ve worked on or developed or published over the years. Some of those sports, we\u2019re seeing strong resurgence and strong growth, and we\u2019re investing back in. It\u2019s an area of key strength for us as a business, and EA SPORTS teams have demonstrated an ability to truly engage a global population of sports fans. With respect to NCAA Sports in general, yes, we have been in that business before as well. We saw the news today as did you, we had fed into the NCAA Working Group. That news today was new to us. We\u2019re still digesting it. We would anticipate that there is still a number of things that would have to happen over the coming years before we will be able to get back into that business, but certainly we\u2019re watching closely.","Chris Evenden","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Olson","Hey, good afternoon. So, you guys talked a lot about what\u2019s coming into fiscal \u201821. I thought it might just be helpful to summarize fiscal \u201821 and how you kind of comp incremental titles launching fiscal \u201820. So, just kind of rattling through it, growth for Apex Legends, FIFA Online in Asia will grow Ultimate Team for both Madden and FIFA grow, Sims I\u2019m not sure if you were implying growth or not, a new sports title, Command & Conquer, NBA Live, VR, two new partner titles and maybe a couple of other titles that you can announce right now. Is that sound correct or was there anything I missed regarding?","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah, no, we were implying growth for Sims as well. We\u2019ve continued to grow that title every year for that since it was shipped what seven years ago and we feel that continues on. They\u2019ve got a really robust plan for continued growth. And there may be some other re-masters that we do along the Command & Conquer line that we just haven\u2019t announced yet. But that \u2013 we believe all that yield is pretty exciting fiscal 2021. And effectively, what we\u2019re doing is giving you some guidance on fiscal 2022, knowing that the Battlefield is coming then. And remember, the goal of Battlefield for 2022 is to really take advantage of a larger installed base of the new console. Bringing out Battlefield next year, where the new console base is fairly small, doesn\u2019t really give justice to the potential of the title. And so that\u2019s part of our driver and moving the title into fiscal 2022. So, think about it as multiyear growth model that we just tried to lay out for people, and we\u2019re pretty excited about it.","Michael Olson","Okay. And then just to follow-up on that. It sounds like you\u2019re implying Apex Legends will grow and still kind of some of the whole that not having the Battlefield will create. I know it\u2019s hard to quantify but kind of qualitatively, how much is a growth in Apex next year is dependent on getting the game approved in China and having success with the title on mobile as well?","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah, it\u2019s hard to predict when you get approval in China, so we don\u2019t know. So, I would assume that an Apex China console PC game is probably the tail end of the year, if not even the following year. We think, we\u2019ve got a faster pace on mobile globally ex-China. So, we would hope to see that in the year as well, sometime during the year, really depends on how long we keep it in soft launch. But we\u2019re obviously including those as we think about growth but the bulk of that growth is probably \u201822 verses \u201821 where we really start to gain traction there.","Michael Olson","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Alexia Quadrani with JP Morgan.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, this is David on for Alexia. Just within your live services results, is it possible to quantify it all the contribution that you\u2019ve seen from subscription in the quarter? And maybe how should we think about the trajectory of subscriptions going forward, just following the partnership with Valve you announced this morning? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah, I mean, subscriptions, I mean, live services so large, subscription is still a relatively small portion of that. We are around 5 million subscribers now and have grown much faster on the Sony platform than we did in the early days of the Microsoft platform. Obviously, there are more consoles out there now, so that helps it. But the Sony platform has grown well beyond our expectations, and we\u2019re very excited and they\u2019ve been a great partner for us. As Andrew mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to drive subscriptions across as many platforms as we can. We want to go where the gamers play. And clearly that was the driver of Valve Steam approach.","What we found is that subscribers engage more and spend more money at the end of the day. That\u2019s why it\u2019s such a great business model. They\u2019re very sticky. They tend to stay in the subscriptions longer and they\u2019re looking for great content and they find games they\u2019ve never played before then start to monetize in those games. And that\u2019s the reason we\u2019re so optimistic about it. But it\u2019s still a relatively smaller portion of the overall business because, obviously, in the quarter, almost $500 million of revenue, the big dominators there are Apex and Ultimate Team and followed by The Sims and FIFA Online in Asia, but it continues to be an important part of the overall life services business.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric Handler","Thank you very much and appreciate all of the details you guys have given on the call so far. A couple quick things, hoping you can help out with. One thing that was not mentioned was Titanfall 3 and has that been sort of integrated now into Apex Legends? Is that still being looked at as a separate title?","Blake Jorgensen","It certainly could be a separate title in the future where we really want to keep the team hyper focused on Apex because we see there\u2019s so much opportunity there. But \u2013 so I can\u2019t give you a sense of if and when it will come, but it\u2019s still a great brand and we certainly won\u2019t forget about it down the road.","Eric Handler","Okay. And then two other quick falls. When you talk about doubling down on live services for next year, you\u2019ve obviously been focusing on live services for a while, but is anything changing with regards to the amount of spending that you guys are doing or anything financially with the model as you double down on these live services?","Andrew Wilson","Yeah, I think there\u2019s really three, four changes. One is, we\u2019re seeing players want to apply and engage more. Again, over the last 24 to 36 months or even a little longer than that, you\u2019ve seen us focused deeply on live service and drive engagement into our games. And you saw that through last year, and we\u2019re seeing that pay off this year. And so, as we look forward, we\u2019re seeing players\u2019 events even greater intention to spend more time into those games. So, this really \u2013 there is two other broad changes. One is just how we developed the cold features inside that game and we\u2019re doubling down on those types of features that allow players to fulfil those cool motivations that drive alive service, social interaction, competition, self-improvement, creation, those things that really drive our live service business. And then we\u2019re doubling down on the teams both in terms of development and marketing in terms of how we bring those things to market. And what you\u2019ve seen this year is a willingness for us to do things slightly differently. If you take what we did with Madden this year, we launched the game earlier and we held another whole set of content for a different audience and marketed that differently, entitled that differently and released at around kickoff, and we\u2019re seeing tremendous success as a result of that. And so not only will we build a double down on the actual development of the feature set, we\u2019re also going to be speaking and communicating and marketing the content differently to gamers across the board.","Blake Jorgensen","And part of it is changing the talent mix. We\u2019re bringing in more people that have live service expertise. I think there\u2019s probably no one in the world that has better live service expertise than we do in sports. But you need to make sure you\u2019re bringing in talent that can support a team like Apex, support the Battlefield teams so forth. And that\u2019s important because the talent mix is very different and we\u2019ve been successful in recruiting some fabulous people into those teams and will continue to focus on that.","Eric Handler","Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju","Hey, thank you. So Andrew, I\u2019m just wanted to dig in a little bit more in terms of the decision making process that went into Battlefield skipping a year here. So \u2013 and I was wondering whether this is a conscientious decision to shift the direction of the franchise or is this more of a resource constraint decision? And should we still be thinking about those franchise or something that is still a two year or maybe even a three year cycle release or maybe more like a perpetual service like what you may have been intending to do with Anthem. Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","Good question. So, still that resource constraints, I\u2019ll say that up front, but it was a very thought through decision for us and there was a few factors that came into play. And the first is that we still see a burgeoning opportunity with Battlefield V. And as I talked about in the prepared remarks, we\u2019re about to launch a whole new theater of wall with the Pacific theater and the team is still really thinking about, how they can continue to drive that service on a going forward basis. So, we think there\u2019s opportunity still inside the Battlefield V experience, as it was built as a bite large service from the beginning.","The second is we now effectively have an annualized shooter Apex Legends and we see tremendous growth opportunity that can continue to engage, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, now over 70 million players. And as Blake talked about, we have opportunity to take that into other regions and to other platforms. And we think is a tremendous growth opportunity on that and want to make sure that we give that the time that it deserves.","And then third, as we thought about building for the next Battlefield. Battlefield has always been cutting edge, leading edge, both in terms of visual fidelity, and in gameplay and in multiplayer play. And as a team really began working against that. It became a parent to us that, launching into the next gen platforms was going to offer tremendous opportunity for innovation. But we really wanted to give the install base some opportunity to grow. And believe that in combination with the first three things I talked about launching battlefield in FY \u201822 is a really strong move for us and presents us with an opportunity for strong two years of growth.","In terms of the overall franchise direction, I don\u2019t think you should read into this a dramatic change in franchise direction other than it will be driven around live service as the nature of our industry now. It will be cutting edge. It will be high fidelity. It will be doing things in the context of multi-play and social play and competition that Battlefields to this point have not done. And we do believe it will be a really, really exciting title in FY \u201822.","Blake Jorgensen","Other things, Stephen is a lot of investors, I don\u2019t think fully appreciate the depth of our catalog business. As Andrew mentioned, Battlefield V, we want to continue to have that as a critical part of our catalog. You all might be surprised, but we have sold over 33 million copies of Star Wars Battlefront I and Battlefront II combined. That\u2019s a huge tale for our business going forward. And so we\u2019re very conscious as to how we think about staging when our games come out. And I think people get used to the annual cadence of sports, which works really well in sports, but we want to be careful on some of these other franchises that we give them the long life that they deserve inside our business and can generate great returns for us over a long period of time.","Stephen Ju","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Robert Berg with Berenberg.","Robert Berg","Hi. Thanks. I\u2019m really looking to dig a bit deeper in VOLTA and some of the early trends you may be seeing there particularly interested in two areas. I guess the first is clearly you\u2019ve seen excellent Ultimate Team KPIs in the period, but how much time a player spending in VOLTA versus your expectations, is it any more or less? And also interested in the appeal with any of some of the vanity items. Have you noticed particularly interested in customizing, any thoughts on setting? And a quick follow-on question if I can, Ultimate Team player growth, but in your opinion with any of this due to VOLTA or just general underlying growth there? Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","There was a lot in there I will do my best. First, we\u2019re very happy with VOLTA. Again and what we\u2019ve talked about over the years is our objective around our FIFA franchise more broadly as we think about FIFA is our platform. And how can we build features that attract new audiences to the game? We did that with the journey with story mode for a number of years. We did that with the World Cup content last year and we\u2019re doing that with VOLTA this year with the express purpose of bringing new fans into the game and reigniting the passions of laps fans, who may be not applied FIFA for some time. As a result of that, as we talked about in the prepared remarks, VOLTA is the second most played mode in the game. And games across the board engagement across the board is up in FIFA. So we\u2019re very, very happy about that.","In terms of what impact that has on Ultimate Team. What we do continually discover is that Ultimate Team as a mode with these core motivations of collection and competition and social interaction at the very core, often our players ultimately find their spending most of the time. And so, even as we brought players into the game around the journey, even as we brought players into the game around the World Cup content last year, and even as we bring plays into the game around VOLTA this year, we do see a positive impact that has on Ultimate Team over time as players come together with their friends and engage in what is, one of the most fun parts of the FIFA experience. And so our expectation is that we will continue to drive that growth. That Ultimate Team, all the work done in Ultimate Team in of itself drove growth, but the combination of that in bringing new fans through VOLTA effectively drove our Ultimate Team performance. And you should expect it will continue think about our FIFA franchise and our Madden franchise in this way around building new modes to bring people in, and then helping them find their friends in the modes they love the most.","Robert Berg","Okay, thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.","Drew Crum","Hey guys, good afternoon. So, you guys have talked extensively on the audience metrics for Apex. And you know that the weekly players were outperforming close to Season 3 launch versus Season 2. Can you comment on the motivation trends you\u2019re seeing there may be that gives you some conviction around growth in fiscal 2021? And then I guess separately, could you update us on your plans with Google Stadia? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Sure. So, I\u2019ll start on the first one and then Andrew can talk about Google. So, I think the key is you\u2019re thinking, we\u2019re seeing positive monetization trends. We\u2019re excited about where it\u2019s going and that\u2019s why we reiterated where our original guidance was. The key with Apex as any live service is, test and learn, test and learn. So, as Andrew described, we are continuing to add new events in each season to try to understand the spending patterns and what people like to spend money on and how much they\u2019ll spend, and will then tune those events overtime. So, there\u2019s going to be holiday themes events like the Halloween event that\u2019s going on now. There are going to be competitive style events. There are going to be gameplay style events, and then events associated with new characters or as you saw in this season or new map. All of that is along the lines of continuing to try to grow and build the number of players, the weekly average users, the frequency of play and the monetization that falls out of all those combined together. And that is a process that we\u2019ve done over the last 11 years on Ultimate Team. And I think we\u2019ve gotten pretty good at we\u2019re pretty excited about how we\u2019re doing that with Apex. So, more to come, but I think we\u2019re heading in a very positive path there.","On the Stadia, update?","Andrew Wilson","Yeah. On Stadia, no updates right now on Stadia. We\u2019ve got some old things coming, both in terms of our own tests, we\u2019re running as part of project Atlas and on the public infrastructure that we\u2019re being very happy about, and with some other cloud partners, who are launching some things in the future.","Drew Crum","Okay, thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mario Lu with Barclays.","Mario Lu","Hey, guys. Couple of questions, one on FIFA and one on mobile. So, glad to hear that FIFA Ultimate Team bookings is still expected to grow double digits next year. And you mentioned both as a number two mode, but I don\u2019t believe you currently monetize in that mode, as all the cosmetic items can only be earned by playing versus spending money. So, is there a possibility in the future to include a battle path or some friendly monetization mechanism in this mode as well? And on mobile, any overall thoughts on partnering with overseas companies like Tencent to help develop your mobile titles? And would that be included in your bucket of two titles from third parties next year? Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","So, on VOLTA, yes, we\u2019re seeing strong engagement in the visual content and the aesthetic content. We don\u2019t have a focus on the monetization of that content this year. As we have done over the years, the first objective is to attract new players. I think we\u2019ve done that very well so far. The second objective is to drive deep engagement of that player base overtime. And then typically, once you put those two things together, it ultimately drives monetization, but that\u2019s not our focus this year.","Blake Jorgensen","And just a couple of clarifications on your second question. So, we said double digits growth in the quarter for FIFA not for next year. I don't know what we're doing for next year. We're very excited that we can continue to grow. That's what we said. But we didn't give any sort of sizing on any of the products for next year. I will say that the double digit growth is healthy double digit growth. So I'm not talking about 11% here. We're 10%, we're talking about healthy double digit growth across both FIFA and Madden. And we're very excited about the continuation of that. And we're just reporting on that in the in the quarter. And in terms of the other two titles, those are third party console PC titles we were speaking of, not mobile titles. But you should assume that obviously for Apex mobile in China, we would use a third party. And I think as we've said, we're considering using a third party for Apex mobile globally, because obviously there could be some ability to have some economies of scale there by using one partner maybe.","Mario Lu","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Bank of America.","Ryan Gee","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Two quick ones, if I may. So if you look at revenue from packaged goods and full game download, it looks like that was down a little bit year-over-year, but you guys did report FIFA and Madden were up nicely in the double digits. So can you just explain the disconnect between sales in new games revenue being down and some of your new releases being up year-over-year? Was there any pressure on ASPs or was the catalog weaker? That's the first question. And I have a follow-up.","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah, so yeah, so full game download is actually up year-over-year 11%. So 275 million from 157 a year ago. The strength in that was driven by Madden and FIFA. Remember there's only a few days in FIFA. And remember as well FIFA, we did not ship gen 3 FIFA this year, it's the first year we've stopped selling gen 3 FIFA. So you can imagine there was some downward pressure on gen three. We also added PS4 into the subscription. And so you can imagine there was also some people playing FIFA through the subscription. And so we still see growth with those factors is pretty impressive. We are seeing you know, obviously, some of the older titles probably are dropping off even though they tend to sell well as full game downloads, but they're always an age, you know, on those so something like, you know, a FIFA 18 that someone might still buy as a full game download because they wanted the World Cup mode. You're seeing less of that. But overall, we saw growth across all the core franchises led by FIFA and madden.","Ryan Gee","Okay, that's helpful. So it sounds like it maybe is more helpful for us to look at subscriptions plus packaged goods revenue plus full game downloads revenue, because people are shifting in and out of each bucket year-over-year. So maybe that's a better way to look at your business going forward?","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah, I think the other thing to remember is, we're now over 50% of full games being sold digitally. You have to imagine that if you're a retailer out there, you are buying less full games. And historically, the business was built on, you sold in a huge amounts of games, and then those sold out over a long period of time and you oftentimes had to support that with marketing or sales reserves. That business has changed dramatically. Retailers are either buying less or maybe not even in business. And that's because people are buying things digitally. But that flattens the sales curve in some way for some of these games. And I think you'll see that across the entire industry, not just with us.","Ryan Gee","Okay, great. And then just my second question is related to DICE and Battlefield. So they're not going to have a title next year, is it fair to assume that they will still have something for next year as you think about the Star Wars Battlefront franchise if that could be some project for next year? And why would any project that you do have next year, would you not want that to benefit from the new console launches, as you mentioned that, you know, Battlefield 6 or what you might call it will benefit from a larger install base? And why wouldn't you just hold titles out everything till fiscal '22?","Andrew Wilson","Yeah, so I think there's a couple of things going on there. One is we're not announcing anything else that DICE is doing in specifics for next year. But you should imagine with a number of live services and play that will continue to support those. And Blake talked about the ongoing strength of Battlefront II, and I reference the ongoing strength of Battlefield 5. As we think about balancing the portfolio around titles launch next year, and titles that will get the greatest boost of later on, what we have seen is a greater propensity for sports game players to play across both generations of title and we've seen that lift. And some of the things that we really want to do in the Battlefield franchise as it relates to the new fidelity that will really show up well inside of a Battlefield game. We'd like to have a deep install base for. So it really comes down to balancing a whole range of different things across our portfolio. But we feel very good about the opportunity to grow the business next year, and have a Battlefield tall in FY '22 that will grow there well and deliver on what our fan expectations will be for Battlefield game on next gen platforms.","Ryan Gee","Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Ng with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Ng","Hi. Thank you very much for the question and for the color for fiscal '21 and '22. I just had two if I could. And the first is just on Madden. Could you just comment a little bit about how Madden compares to FIFA from engagement and content and monetization perspective? And whether you see the opportunity to close the gap there in the next few years? And second, with rises Skywalker being the last Star Wars movie until 2022, can you talk about how the timing of theatrical content affects your Star Wars strategy going forward, if at all? Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","So the Madden metrics are actually very similar to the FIFA metrics with one exception that the Madden metrics monetize better than FIFA because it's primarily a U.S. based sport and FIFA is very global. And so you obviously have economic differences. So the ARPU effectively is higher in the U.S. But the number of people who play Ultimate Team are very similar. The number of people who spend in Ultimate Team are very similar. And the timing of how people play relative to the sports season is similar. The other thing that FIFA has demand \u2013 FIFA is a longer season, right, you get a full nine plus months where you're not getting that long of a season in Madden. But we've done a good job of extending the events, post the Super Bowl to try to keep people engaged around the combine and draft and all those things that transpire. And we're stretching that engagement out. And so \u2013 but you know, even with hockey, we see similar patterns across the Ultimate Team. It's really at the end of the day, the revenue is driven by one the size of the game. Obviously, FIFA larger because it's a global game and two by the local economics around how much people are willing to spend relative to their overall spend patterns.","The second question?","Andrew Wilson","On the Star Wars piece, so well the rise of Skywalker is the last in this particular film set. You know, Disney had talked about having extraordinarily robust plans around that franchise over time. What we talked about was, you know, The Mandalorian coming with Disney plus the new movie And Galaxy's Edge in theme parks. And so our expectation is that in partnership with Disney, we will get the benefit of the ongoing plans around the continued development and provision of great content experiences for Star Wars fans for many years to come.","Michael Ng","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we have time for one final question. Your question comes from the line as Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company.","Mike Hickey","Hi Andrew. Great quarter guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I think last question like you gave a little bit more granularity on active players, it's 8 to 10 million weekly after season. You could update, that sounds like high, just want to confirm that? And then on your 300 million to 400 million for the year, that you reiterated. Can you give us some perspective where you are trending within that range as we sort of set the stage for growth for fiscal '21? Then I have a quick follow-up.","Blake Jorgensen","I can't give you any more than the range. But I just remind people that 300 million to 400 million is a small portion of 5.125 billion, so don't over index on it. Because if it was three and a quarter versus 3.75 versus 400, I don't think that's going to make a break the year. In terms of the user profile, I think Andrew mentioned that was very similar weekly average users still in that 8 to 10 million range. We're very happy with that. That's extremely robust. And you know one of the largest games that we've ever seen inside our portfolio and that continues on. It's very engaged and community. And, you know, you'll continue to see us add things that drive engagement like esports and obviously more content. And we feel like it's tracking as we would have thought.","Mike Hickey","Good. I guess the second question from me is, as you sort of gave us a perspective of '21, '22 fiscal, did see anything BioWare, or from BioWare, or Star Wars, Star Wars related IP games and development for console PC over the next couple of years, or if you think that or we should just assume that likely is going to expire? And then on BioWare I think Dragon Age is going to go up, any thoughts on that studio post Anthem looking at future releases? Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah, I mean, you should assume that there's, you know, Dragon Age out there, and we talked about it publicly that it's in the works and probably comes after fiscal '22. But, you know, we typically don't give multiyear guidance this early in the year or multiyear guidance period. So I don't want to start giving '23 guidance now that I've started a hint on '22. But you should assume it's out there and plans are underway for that product, as well as some other products. There's some other Disney stuff that might drop into \u2013 Star Wars stuff that might drop into '22 or maybe even earlier, but with more to come on that. We're still highly engaged around the Disney license. Believe it or not, we are close to a $1 million on Star Wars: The Old Republic, revenue from the start of its history. So you know, it's a business that just keeps on going. And we like those types of businesses and we're going to continue to layer those in and clearly Star Wars is part of that process.","Mike Hickey","Thanks a lot.","Blake Jorgensen","All right. Thank you everyone. We'll talk to everybody, either between now and the end of next quarter or the end of next quarter.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call.

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Chris. Electronic Arts was the leading console games publisher and most downloaded mobile games publisher in the world for Q3 FY 2017, driven by high-performing titles and tremendous engagement from our players. Our net sales and digital sales reached record levels for the quarter, and we exceeded our Q3 guidance for revenue and earnings.","The excellent holiday quarter for EA was a demonstration of the strength of our portfolio, with new titles, new content and new competitive gaming tournaments delivering great entertainment to players worldwide.","To touch on a few highlights, FIFA 17 was the top-selling console title in the world for 2016. We grew our FIFA player base significantly year-over-year through the addition of a new story mode, The Journey, Frostbite-powered gameplay and new experiences in FIFA Ultimate Team. More than 10 million fans have played The Journey, and FUT players are up nearly 10% year-over-year.","It was also an excellent year for FIFA competitive gaming. Our eSports competitions for players at all levels have led to dramatic increases in engagement among competitive players. Through Q3, FIFA 17 competitors were playing nearly three times more than the rest of the FIFA community, and we expect the excitement will continue as we add more competitions, more broadcasts and more content in the year ahead.","Battlefield 1 was our biggest Battlefield launch ever, delivering innovation, creativity and all-out warfare that players were looking for. The team at DICE created a truly groundbreaking experience that is driving massive engagement and growing our global Battlefield community. The unique player base of Battlefield 1 is more than 50% larger than that of Battlefield 4 in its comparable launch quarter, with more than a third of the players being new to the franchise or new to EA.","We also have a lot of excitement ahead for our Battlefield 1 community. Battlefield 1 premium players will have early access to our first expansion pack coming in March, and we'll continue to bring more maps, more armies and more amazing content to the game in the months to come.","Titanfall 2 delivered the next important step in this new franchise we are building with our partners at Respawn, a highly-rated, action-packed experience that has thrilled players in the year's biggest category. Player satisfaction scores for Titanfall 2 are among the highest in our portfolio, showing just how much fun players are having with the game. Titanfall 2 will be played for a long time to come, with new maps, modes and content updates continuing to expand the experience and engage our players. We're excited about our long-term plans for the Titanfall franchise.","We are building our mobile games today to have a long life with players through outstanding live services and dynamic content updates. For example, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes added ship battles and Rogue One content in Q3, driving average gameplay time per player to an unprecedented total of 155 minutes per day.","Our EA Sports titles in mobile are also great demonstrations of this strategy. Madden NFL Mobile continues to perform near the top of the iOS App Store chart in its third season. NBA Live Mobile and FIFA Mobile are also growing thriving communities with strong engagement. The combination of authenticity, great gameplay, and live services in these games is igniting the passion of sports fans worldwide. And we'll continue growing these communities with more sports-specific and geo-specific experiences.","These examples show our unwavering focus on connecting players to more amazing experiences across more devices and in more geographies. With fans playing the games they love for longer, we are building and supporting deep communities that thrive for many years after launch. Players in Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2 and our EA mobile titles are just beginning to engage in these long-term experiences.","Moving to Q4, we're excited to deliver the highly-anticipated Mass Effect: Andromeda beginning on March 21. This all new story of exploration in the Mass Effect universe will be brought to life in stunning detail using our Frostbite engine, with new characters, new environments, and a whole new set of possibilities to excite players around the world. Looking further ahead, we would like to provide you with a view of our top titles and plans for FY 2018.","We're thrilled to bring a new Star Wars Battlefront game to fans worldwide in 2017 holiday season. In the past two years, Rogue One and The Force Awakens have opened new storylines and captured the imagination of hundreds of millions of Star Wars fans. We've listened closely to our passionate Star Wars Battlefront community and have expanded our existing game with more great content and experiences since its launch. As that game continues to thrive, we have also heard our players' desire for even more depth and progression.","Our next Star Wars Battlefront will be even bigger, taking players into more locations and allowing them to play with more heroes and characters across multiple Star Wars eras. There will be new ways to play, including an all new single-player campaign and much, much more that we are excited to share with our players in the months ahead. To build a game of this magnitude, we've brought together three great studios, DICE, Motive and Criterion, and allowing their areas of expertise to deliver an amazing experience in the next Star Wars Battlefront.","We will continue to drive innovation and competition in our EA Sports franchises. FIFA 18 will build on the foundation we created with story mode this year, bringing players back to The Journey with Season 2, featuring new characters and new storylines. Our development team in Vancouver is delivering deeply innovative new experiences across this year's game, including an Ultimate Team, and creating the most emotionally immersive and connected FIFA we have ever produced.","Our Madden NFL franchise will transition to the Frostbite engine with Madden NFL 18, unlocking major visual advancements and new gameplay experiences that will excite dedicated Madden players, football fans and sports fans overall. Our complete roster of EA Sports titles in FY 2018 will include NHL 18, a new chapter of our UFC franchise, and an all new NBA LIVE game launching in the fall.","Our focus for EA's Competitive Gaming Division is to grow engagement in some of our biggest global franchises. With strong results to date, we will now expand EA Competitive Gaming even further in FY 2018, fueled by more competitions, new sponsors and broadcast partners and original programming. Players will be able to compete in dozens of competitions from online leagues to massive regional championships, like our FIFA Online 3 championship in Korea, to our biggest event yet on a global stage, including the Fight Championship Finals and the Madden Championship. We're also very excited to kick off competitive gaming events for Battlefield later in the year.","We're also excited to have a new Need for Speed title launch in FY 2018. We've given the game an extended development cycle to focus on innovation, and the Need for Speed team is pushing the boundaries of action driving with what we believe is the most exciting and best looking Need for Speed game we've ever produced.","We will continue to build our mobile portfolio, expanding on our success to deliver more engaging and fun mobile games in mass-market franchises with global audience appeal. Thriving player bases in our existing live services for Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes, EA Sports and more will receive major new content update throughout the year, and more in-game events will keep the games fresh, engaging and fun.","We're deeply committed to players in our Battlefield 1 and Titanfall 2 communities. Throughout the year ahead, we will continue to launch new content and new experiences to expand these vast and dynamic games.","At the end of the fiscal year, our BioWare studio will be delivering an all new IP. A clean-sheet design with new concepts, new game play mechanics and new stories, set in a unique new universe. This game has the potential to fundamentally disrupt the way people think about an action title, bringing friends together to play in an exhilarating new way. We're very excited about the future of this new franchise and its ability to attract a large global audience.","Our industry is poised for continued growth. The console market continues to strengthen. Mobile continues its expansion, and more companies are entering the space and investing in new platforms. These moves bring more choices to players, and EA is in a unique position of strength. With our Frostbite engine powering more of our portfolio, EA's games are some of the most highly rated in the industry. Engagement in our titles continues to deepen, and our global reach is expanding through competition and new ways to play.","We're also making games more personal, leveraging deep learning to build intelligence into our EA player network that will help players find their friends and connect with more of the games they want to play. We look forward to continuing our momentum through Q4 and beyond.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew. I'll start by reporting our results on a GAAP basis, then use our new operational measure of net sales to discuss the dynamics of our business. In addition, please reference the tables in our press release as we discuss GAAP results and the GAAP adjustments that may be applied to compare them with historical non-GAAP results. These can be used in conjunction with the financial model we have posted on our Investor Relations website to calculate measures comparable with our historical results.","We are delighted with our third quarter, which was driven by the blockbuster launch of Battlefield 1 and continued strong performance from FIFA 17 and FIFA 17 Ultimate Team. In mobile, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes outperformed our expectations. This resulted in record-setting performance for the Company, including our first-ever billion-dollar cash flow quarter. I will highlight other records as we go through the details.","EA's GAAP net revenue was $1.15 billion, compared to $1.07 billion last year. Net revenue was above our guidance by $24 million. Year-on-year growth was driven by Battlefield 1. If you had \u2013 if you wish to compare our current results to our historical non-GAAP revenue, you will need to add the change in deferred net revenue of $921 million to the $1.15 billion of GAAP revenue. Our cost of revenue was $516 million, including historic acquisition-related expenses of $18 million.","Gross margin for the quarter was 55.1%, up 6.1 percentage points over last year. The gross margin for our underlying business continues to grow, driven by product mix and the shift to digital.","Operating expenses were $637 million, up $82 million or 15% year-on-year, driven by increased marketing activities around the launches this Q3. The $637 million includes $48 million in stock-based compensation and $2 million in acquisition-related expenses.","Moving on to EPS. Because the GAAP revenue recognition standards require us to defer most of the revenue out of the quarter, but recognize the expense of launching games in the quarter, Q3 is only a breakeven quarter on a GAAP basis. GAAP adjustments to derive a measure comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $921 million change in deferred net revenue, $20 million in acquisition-related expenses, $48 million of stock-based compensation, and a management reporting tax rate of 21%. Note that had we reported a GAAP profit, our share count would have been $313 million.","Net cash generated by operating activities for the quarter was $1.11 billion, a new record for the company, and $226 million higher than the record set in the same quarter last year. The trailing 12-month operating cash flow was also a record at $1.37 billion. With capital expenditures of $124 million over the last 12 months, free cash flow was $1.25 billion in the same period. Please see our earning slides for further cash flow information.","During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.5 million shares at a cost of $127 million, leaving $156 million in our two-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter was $4.22 billion, with 42% of this balance held on shore. This is down slightly from 43% last quarter, the change driven primarily by the share repurchase and the greater cash generation offshore.","Now, I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $2.07 billion, a new record for the company. The outperformance versus our expectation was driven by Battlefield 1 and FIFA 17, offset by Titanfall 2. Battlefield 1 is on course to be our best Battlefield ever. Sell-through of FIFA 17 during Q2 and Q3 was 8% higher than FIFA 16 in the same period last year. And FIFA Ultimate Team sales continue to grow strongly. Like Battlefield 1, FIFA 17 is on course to be our best-selling FIFA of all time.","Digital net sales were a record $1.1 billion, up $288 million on the year ago quarter. The increase reflects strong growth in digital downloads and about $50 million of digital net sales from FIFA launch captured this quarter rather than in Q2 as it was the case in fiscal 2016. Digital sales now represent about 60% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis.","Looking at each of the components of this digital \u2013 quarter digital sales in turn. First, extra content and premium net sales were up 28% year-on-year to $462 million. As mentioned last quarter, this includes launch sales of FIFA Ultimate Team that were not captured in the same quarter a year ago.","Using Q2 plus Q3 as the measurement period, FIFA 17 Ultimate Team grew 22% over FIFA 16 Ultimate Team despite ongoing currency headwinds. At constant currency, year-on-year growth would have been 30%. This extraordinary growth in a major business is driven by innovations such as the story mode we had at the FIFA and by enthusiasm for the competitive gaming mode FUT Champions. In China, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play game, continues to benefit from the growing interest in investment and soccer there.","In mobile, we had a record quarter. Net sales were $174 million, up 7% year-on-year with growth again led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. Madden NFL Mobile, SimCity BuildIt and the Sims FreePlay also made strong contributions to the quarter. NBA Live Mobile and FIFA Mobile are delivering strong installs and engagement, which we believe can translate into greater monetization over time.","Net sales of full game PC and console downloads were $355 million, another record, and 82% higher than last year. As anticipated, digital downloads for Battlefield 1 were much stronger than for Star Wars Battlefront in the year ago quarter. 32% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical, measured on current generation consoles over the last 12 months. This is ahead of our fiscal year target of 29% and is likely to be driven slightly higher again by the fourth quarter, which is dominated by catalog sales.","Subscription, advertising and other digital purchases contributed $104 million to net sales, up 16% year-on-year. EA Access and Origin Access continue to grow.","Turning to guidance, we are raising our full year guidance to $4.8 billion in net revenue and $125 million increase in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $1.338 billion, including $43 million of historical acquisition-related costs and $2 million of stock-based compensation.","Operating expenses are expected to be $2.306 billion, including $192 million in stock-based comp and $6 million in acquisition-related costs. Our investment in future revenue continues through development of a new IP, including building out our Motive Studios in Montr\u00e9al, building our player network infrastructure, and expanding our eSports footprint.","This results in earnings per share of $2.91 for the year, a $0.22 increase from prior guidance. GAAP adjustments to derived measures comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $125 million change in deferred net revenue, $194 million of stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and cost of revenue, $49 million in acquisition-related costs, $2 million in debt-related expenses, and the reduction of 1 million shares for the convertible bond hedge.","Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we're raising our operating cash flow guidance to be approximately $1.35 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $110 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.25 billion. We expect fiscal 2017 to be our biggest cash flow year ever.","We continue to anticipate net sales for the year to be approximately $4.925 billion. However, the underlying profitability is up significantly due particularly to the success of Battlefield 1 and FIFA Ultimate Team.","Guidance for the fourth quarter is for net revenue of $1.48 billion, including the recognition of $407 million in deferred net revenue. We anticipate cost of revenue to be $242 million. Operating expenses are expected to be $591 million, including $50 million in stock-based compensation and $1 million in acquisition-related costs.","Expenses are up year-on-year chiefly driven by increased investment in new franchises and our player network. This results in an earnings per share of $1.64 for the quarter. GAAP adjustments to derived measures comparable to our historical non-GAAP EPS include the $470 million change in deferred net revenue, $50 million in stock-based compensation attributed to operating expenses and $1 million in acquisition-related expenses.","We anticipate net sales for the quarter to be $1.07 billion. This is up 16% year-on-year by Battlefield 1 and Mass Effect: Andromeda.","FX continues to be a drag on year-on-year comparisons. Although our hedging program mitigates the effects of short-term movements in exchange rate, no hedging program can wholly protect a company for long-term structural changes in exchange rates. So, that builds a headwind for fiscal 2017 versus 2016 in comparison, and it looks like we'll face an even greater headwind in fiscal 2018.","In conclusion, we had our best ever holiday quarter driven by record performances from our two largest franchises, Battlefield and FIFA. This was supported by a record quarter in mobile, led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes. All three of these titles have strong live service components, and these position us well going into fiscal 2018.","Andrew introduced our fiscal 2018 slate today, and we'll be providing you with detailed financial guidance in May. Our results demonstrate the cash and earnings power of our business model, and we look forward to an exciting 2018 and beyond.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Blake. FY 2017 has been an extraordinary year to date. EA delivered some of the top games in the industry with growing engagement and continue to exceed our guidance. Now, we have more exciting plans ahead.","Creating amazing games and pioneering new ways to play will always be at our call. As games continue to touch the lives of more and more people around the world through more devices and more platforms, the deep engagement that games uniquely deliver becomes increasingly valuable. Maintaining that engagement in a crowded world where players are continually challenged for time requires solving fundamental challenges to remove friction in a digital networked world.","Our EA player network is designed for those challenges, to help players stay connected to their friends and their favorite games whenever and wherever they are ready to play. It redefines the player value proposition from one that depends on each player building a network inside every new game to one that moves seamlessly from experience to experience across devices with their friends and with their achievements.","The EA player network is coming to life today. Our Battlefield games now have a central user interface that dynamically solves for the needs of our players. It will recommend experiences relevant to them based on the modes they're playing, new community challenges, new events or content to help them improve their skills. More powerfully, the interface helps players find their friends faster and jump into games together, an essential service for multi-player games. This is the true power of the player network, keeping players connected with their friends and the games they love, and applying deep learning to bring personalization that will make every experience meaningful, enables us to help our players move fluently across different games, genres and platforms, all inside our network.","With great games like Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, and our EA Sports experiences on console and mobile, we are connecting with more players around the world. Through our live services like Ultimate Team and global competitive gaming tournaments and events, we are giving them deep and dynamic ways to engage. Through subscription services like EA Access and Origin Access, we are giving players more choice and great value.","The player network becomes the consistent thread through all of these experiences and more, helping our players navigate a crowded world, and helping us to deliver a truly connected future of play. We're looking forward to finishing FY 2017 with a strong fourth quarter and delivering more great entertainment to our global network of players.","Now, Blake and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Nowak - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. So, the first one on FIFA Ultimate Team being up 30% ex FX, it's really strong, understanding it's from campaign mode and Frostbite. Could you help us understand a little bit more the breakdown of paying user growth versus spend per user? And then, at this point, what do you see as being the main point of friction that holds back paying Ultimate Team adoption? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks, Brian. I think the metrics have not changed dramatically between paying users and nonpaying users. What we've done is we've brought many more players into Ultimate Team, which is really the goal of what we're trying to do. We want people to have a great experience, more people that play the experience gets better. And we also want to give people new ways to play the game, which we've shown drives more excitement and more interest into the game, as well as the connection into our competitive gaming activities. Over time, we've seen the spend levels climb, but our focus is really on bringing more and more people into the atmosphere of the game to play it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you. So, Andrew, I think you called out a new Need for Speed for fiscal 2018. There also seems to be a Need for Speed Edge, which seems to be an online version that's being published by Nexon, so we're wondering if you can add further perspective there? And will this game follow the path of FIFA online so that it can get exported to other markets like China?","And, Blake, the 32% of sales for Battlefield coming from download. I think we're used to thinking about a pick-up of about 5% in terms of the mix shift from physical to downloads. I'm wondering if there's anything you can highlight in terms of the consumer behavior there. Is the shift accelerating or is this something specific to Battlefield? Thank you.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. So, on the Need for Speed question, one of the things that is wonderful about having such a deep portfolio of global brand is to have tremendous appeal around the world, and Need for Speed, like FIFA, is one of those brands that has tremendous appeal in North America, Europe, South America and throughout Asia. However, as we think about different markets, it's really important for us to establish games according to a modality of play that makes sense for that market.","So, again, with Need for Speed Edge, it is effectively the same track that we took with FIFA Online 3, which is the core component of gameplay which is fast cars, amazing chases, and over-the-top driving action. It will form the center place of Need for Speed Edge, but it will be done in a free-to-play environment the same way FIFA is. It's early days for Need for Speed Edge, but you might imagine that as we continue to grow that property in Asia that it would follow a similar path to that which we've taken with FIFA Online 3.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And, Stephen, your question on full game downloads. Just to clarify, the 32% number is a trailing 12-month number for all of our titles on Gen 4 consoles, and as comparison, in fiscal 2015, that number was 20%; fiscal 2016, it was 24%; and this year, it's running at 32%. We thought it would be probably 29% for the full year \u2013 our full fiscal year, so running ahead of that.","The Battlefield numbers, we don't disclose those, but since it is a very popular PC title, which north of 75% of those games are sold digitally, you should assume that the Battlefield full game download numbers skewed higher than what we've seen, in contrast to last year when we saw Battlefront which skewed lower because it was less of a PC-based title, so.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Chris Merwin with Barclays.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey. Great. Thank you. Just had a couple. So, just a follow-up on the download question. Gross margins were obviously very strong in the 3Q, and Blake, as you mentioned, that was, I guess, due mostly to Battlefield and perhaps lower royalties from Titanfall. But it looks like you've guided to more than 200 basis points of margin expansion in fiscal 2017, which is well ahead of the 100 basis point annual target. So, just as we start to think about fiscal 2018, could you say how much of the benefit that we're seeing this year is one-time in nature and what that might mean for next year, obviously, that given guidance there?","And then a second question. You mentioned in the prepared remarks the strength of engagement you've seen with Battlefield 1, so I was wondering if you could talk about how that's manifested itself in DLC and MTX? And maybe more specifically, what the attach rate of all extra content sales looks like for Battlefield 1 relative to Battlefield 4? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. So, clearly we saw a very large gross margin improvement in the quarter. That's a combination of higher digital, as we just discussed, both in terms of full game download and higher extra content in the form of Ultimate Team. It also is \u2013 as you called out, we sold less Titanfall 2 than we expected and we sold more Battlefield 1 than we expected. And Battlefield 1 is a higher-margin product for us, and so that acted as a way of improving the margin.","We will see some pressure next year because we'll flip back to a large royalty-bearing title in the form of Battlefront, and as we saw last year that put somewhat of a damper on the OpEx, excuse me, on the gross margin. I don't yet have the numbers to give you for guidance. We'll do that in May, and we'll try to call out the impact. But you should assume that we'll have the benefits from continued mix change, more digital, more digital live services as well as more digital full game downloads, and some of that could be offset by royalty-bearing titles, but probably not fully offset by it. We should continue to see some gross margin improvement.","In terms of the Battlefield 1 extra content, we're just getting going on our extra content plan. Our first DLC ships in March, the end of March. There's virtually no revenue this year for that. That will all come next year. So, I'll give you a better sense of the attach and the revenue associated with that when we do guidance. But we're very excited about the potential because we have such an engaged and large consumer base playing the game. We will look to DLC, MTX and many different methods for people to continue to enjoy the game and deepen their experience, and we'll tell you more about that in the months to come.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Jefferies.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Maybe a couple quick ones. The new BioWare game, I think you mentioned it was action and adventure in the description. Is that an RPG game we should assume, coming from BioWare's history? And then, we may have missed this, but is that owned IP or will that be royalty-bearing licensed IP?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So, it's action-adventure, not RPG. So, what we're starting to see more and more in game genres is kind of genre melding, which is great components of a number of different genres really kind of coming together into single games. And so, when you think about this game, you should be thinking about the great RPG character development and storyline progression that BioWare is known for, but in a world of greater action and greater adventure, which is growing to be one of the larger categories in games. It will be a wholly-owned IP. We're very excited about it, and we'll share more in the year to come.","Brian P. Fitzgerald - Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Thank you, Andrew.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Great. Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes the line of Justin Post with Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you. Blake, you did a really good job kind of guiding the units for Battlefield and Titanfall. I wonder, just to help us think about how big those were and digital potential, if you can give us any sense of how many units have sold through or just the number of players in Battlefield.","Andrew, you have Battlefront coming next year. You've mentioned a lot of new features in a single-player campaign. Can we think about that growing versus the first one? I'm just wondering what your thoughts there. And then last one, Blake, on Ultimate Team, I think the last update was $500 million or so. I was just wondering if you can give us any thoughts on the size of revenue this fiscal year? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. So, let me hit the first two, and then I'll let Andrew jump in \u2013 or the first and last one. The units, we're going to actually spend less time talking about units going forward in the future, for one simple thing which is the business is becoming far less important around units sold. We're very excited. We sold more units than we expected to sell in Battlefield. And we sold less units than we expected in Titanfall. The Battlefield units are on track to be one of the biggest titles in the shooter market in the world, and we're very excited about that.","And that means there's a lot of people playing, and the engagement levels they're playing at are at a point we've not even seen in our past, with highly-engaged audience and incredible depth of gameplay that's going on. And so, you should assume that we'll give units probably upfront when we give guidance to give people sizing, but we're going to try to spend less time talking about the units and more time talking about the revenue associated with the game because we think that's more important. In terms of, let's see, your last question was?","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Ultimate Team.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Ultimate Team.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Ultimate Team, yeah. So, we're now tracking close to $800 million a year on Ultimate Team between the three sports. Obviously, FIFA is the largest, followed by Madden, and then followed by Hockey. But it's very encouraging at the continued excitement around that business and our ability to continue to grow, despite its extremely large size already.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So, as far as Battlefront, again, we're not in a place where we're going to give unit guidance or revenue guidance at this juncture. But here is what I would leave you with. This is going to be a big game. The first game was very well received. It was widely regarded as a game that fulfilled people's Star Wars fantasies in ways they could never imagine. But it was also a game where people asked for a lot more, and a lot more depth and a lot more of the greatness of the game kind of embodied.","This game, again, is going to be in more locations, more game modes, more eras, more shifts, including a full single-play campaign which is very, very exciting. So, we have every reason to believe we're delivering fans exactly what they're asking for with respect to a Star Wars game.","They've also had another movie since we launched the last one, and another one coming later this year, and we would expect that the global fan base for Star Wars will continue to grow. So, we feel great about the game, we feel great about the overall community, and we feel great about the energy that the movie will generate in and around the launch of the game.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a couple. First off, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the relationship with the respond in terms of the future of Titanfall. It sounds like, from your comments, Andrew, that there will be a future sequel. And then, secondly, I was hoping you could address the level of support for the Nintendo Switch, if there's been a change since the last call in terms of our R&D commitments and titles in development. Thank you.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So, we have a great relationship with Respawn. I was actually down there with them recently, spending time. We're very excited about Titanfall 2. We think that game's going to sell for a really long time. As we said in our prepared remarks, it's one of the highest-rated shooters of the generation. It's also got some of the highest NPS scores across our portfolio. So, people playing the game, they're having a great time. We remain committed to that relationship. We remain committed to Titanfall. And we look forward to doing a lot more Titanfall 2 over the year to come.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And Nintendo Switch?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And in Nintendo Switch, no change. As we've announced, we're going to launch FIFA for Nintendo Switch later this year.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Blake, just to slip another one in, just to clarify. It looks like NBA LIVE was in the release slate for March in the last presentation. It does not appear in this presentation. Could you just clarify if that was a change?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","That's a good catch, Colin. I'll let Andrew give you the sort of the development view of NBA LIVE.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. As everyone knows, we have been on a journey with NBA LIVE. It's something that we remain again very committed to, with our partnership with the NBA, and want to deliver something that's truly innovative and disruptive in the marketplace. We had planned a launch in the not too distant future with what we believe was going to be the first step towards that level of innovation, creativity to create a disruption in the marketplace. In all honesty, we got the game and it's really, really good and a lot of fun, and we feel like we are better positioned to launch that with the fullness of the NBA season ahead of us, and have decided to double down on that, add to it and launch it as a full beat later in the year.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So you'll hear more about that and see more coming over the next six months. As Andrew said, we're extremely excited about it, and I've been able to beat Andrew a couple of times, as long as I'm playing as Steph Curry.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. All right. Thanks, guys.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. The questions, maybe one on mobile. Just wanted to understand what you're seeing in terms of both player engagement and monetization on the key sports titles in the mobile format, whether you're seeing any difference between phone and tablet in the way people are sort of engaging with those titles. And then second, maybe more for Blake, but just a updated view of the way you're thinking about the balance sheet, deploying cash, looking at the M&A landscape, sort of an update on your balance sheet view. Thanks so much, guys.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","There are two buckets of monetization you're talking about there, which was across different sports titles and then I think you layered in mobile and tablet in the end. Again, what we're seeing more broadly in mobile is that great titles with great brands are holding their position in the top of the charts, and Madden is a great example of that. We're also seeing that the expectations of gamers now is growing and the games need to be bigger and deeper and offer new and interesting ways to play. And what we're seeing now with Madden is that in its third season, it's reaching that level of depth and breadth and really engaging players in a big way.","We are early days in the FIFA and NBA mobile games. And what we're looking at now is while the core infrastructure was very similar to Madden and we're very happy with their performance to- date \u2013 again, they're in line with our expectations \u2013 we are looking at sports-specific and geo-specific tuning of the feature set and the experience that we think over the coming years will continue to grow those businesses, as we have done with Madden. In terms of phone versus tablet, I don't have any exact stats with me now, but we see a lot more play still happening on mobile phones versus tablets, but we do get players playing across both and monetizing on both.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","On the balance sheet, obviously, the great news is our cash flow continues to grow, which means our cash balance continues to grow. We will be talking next quarter about what our next view of a share buyback program will be because our current program will be up in May. We think we'll finish the current buyback, $1 billion buyback, right around that time.","We're also, as we've talked about before, looking at everything that is out in the marketplace. Being one of the largest players in the market, we get a chance to look at virtually everything. We're very disciplined on price, as we've talked about, and we want to make sure it fits the model and culture of EA to consider anything.","Don't have anything to tell you today other than we'll continue to look and we're very open to continuing to try to grow the franchise, but the good news is, as Andrew has discussed today, with the new BioWare title, we feel like we have substantial opportunities internally to continue to grow this business around great IP, great creative talent, and great ways to play games that we don't even think have fully even scratched the surface, as we've proven with Ultimate Team, but we think can be done with other franchises inside the organization.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey guys. I just want to ask about the fourth quarter. Some of the titles and content you have scheduled to release, and as it relates to that digital revenue, you mentioned that Battlefield expansion pack late in the quarter. Mass Effect is March 21, I believe, in North America and March 23 in Europe. Given those dates and the revenue recognition \u2013 I think you recognize digital revenue 10 to 14 days in arrears \u2013 is it possible that that gets pushed to fiscal 2018?","And my second question relates to Titanfall. I just want to understand if you have any thoughts as to why you think it underperformed and going forward, what the digital monetization strategy will be with that franchise. Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So, I'll address the first one, Drew, and then Andrew can address the Titanfall question. Our digital cutoff is typically about 5 to 7 days depending on the calendar more than the actual days, so we will get some digital from the first few days of sales for Mass Effect. We will get very little revenue just because the way we book the revenue for the DLCs on Battlefield 1. So, you can assume that's close to zero, and assume Mass Effect is going to be anywhere between 30% to 50% of the lifetime of that title. And the last Mass Effect did close to 6 million units, so you'll probably see something like around 3 million units in the quarter depending on exact timing, so.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And on Titanfall, well, as Blake highlighted earlier, it sold less than we expected in the timeframe. We're not seeing it as underperformance at this juncture. What we have demonstrated as an organization is that with great games, we can sell them for many months and often many years. And if you look at the sales curve of Battlefield 4, we were still selling lots of units three years post and still had nearly 10 million people playing that game right in the lead up to Battlefield 1.","So, the way we think about Titanfall is that we have what is one of the best games of this year, and certainly one of the best games in this generation of consoles, in what is this year's largest category. And we've got a development team who have unbelievable pedigree and a commitment to continue to support the community, and we expect to continue to grow that community through the coming fiscal year.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Neil Doshi with Mizuho.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys. Just a quick question on mobile, Blake. I think mobile grew around 7%, kind of well below the double-digit growth we've seen over the past few quarters. Any color on what drove that slowdown and whether we should kind of see that rebound back to double-digit growth again?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah. I think the growth in mobile, remember, is driven oftentimes by when new titles come out, so you have to be careful not to get too hung up on that and instead think about the broad portfolio. And so, if you get a big title coming in and you got a lot of activity earlier on, you're going to bump up the level.","I think the one thing to note is that's the largest mobile quarter we've had in our history, which is what we're really focused on, which is how do we have a continued growth of the franchises inside mobile, seeing titles like Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes grow, but also titles like SimCity BuildIt or Sims FreePlay or the sports titles. Our goal is, how do we continue to build the footprint that we have on console in the sports world also on mobile? We're pretty confident we can do that, but we know it takes time.","So, I can't predict today what the growth rate's going to look like for full year next year, but I would say that, focus more on the annual growth and on the size of the franchises and, really important, the stability of those franchises. As we've talked about before, our focus is to have a very profitable mobile business, which means we're not going to overmonetize or overspend just to try to monetize, and we're trying to build long-term franchises. And we're pretty excited about where that's going.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Two questions for you. First, the guidance for the fourth quarter. If you sort of parse out what was implied off last quarter's guidance and where we are now, is much of the change \u2013 the $0.05 impact to the downside \u2013 is a lot of that just because of Mass Effect having a later-in-the-quarter release date? Is it FX? Or is there something else?","And then, secondly, just from a big picture macro perspective, overall retail had a very difficult December quarter. And game stop included, but all of retail in general, foot traffic was way down. And I'm curious, seeing that, does that maybe get you to focus more on accelerating the digital migration and trying to get people to do more full game digital downloads? How do you read those tea leaves over the next one to two years?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes. So, first, on guidance. I remind everybody we started the year with using, if you refer back to our translated, back to the non-GAAP guidance that \u2013 in the way we've given it. Historically, we started the year at $3.50, we raised it to $3.65, and we've just now raised it to $3.80. So, I wouldn't get overly hung up on how that's phased by quarter. We had an extremely strong third quarter, much stronger than we thought. That gives us caution around the fourth quarter, we don't want to get ahead of ourselves. And thus we've held the top line essentially flat using those old measures or our net sales measure. But we've passed through a large portion of that on the bottom line because we're very confident about the profitability and the ongoing profitability of the business.","We're also investing in the future, and so you see that in the OpEx number. That's not just for the quarter, that's for titles that are coming in the coming years to come, both in terms of marketing and development expenses.","On the digital side, I think we're focused on doing everything we can to deliver the best games and the best experience for our consumers. And if the consumer chooses to do that digitally or through physical, we don't spend a lot of time worrying about that, we're just trying to deliver great experiences. But critical to those experiences are the ongoing live services, we're running events every week, we're bringing people back every week, and those experiences are all developed digitally and delivered digitally. And that's where we think the future of the business continues to go.","And so, that means less and less about individual games sold and more and more about engagement in the games. I don't know how that ultimately plays out to the retailers out there, but our focus is on really deepening the engagement for the consumer and delivering that in a way that's the easiest way for the consumer, which is digitally.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Right. Thanks, Blake.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with The Benchmark.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hey, Andrew and Blake. Congrats on your quarter. Two questions from me. Curious on the fiscal 2018 slate. The transparency that you gave us, Andrew, is that sort of a full slate now? Or are there some games unannounced? There's been some recent chatter on maybe Skate 4, and I think you also sort of were thinking about remasters as possibilities for fiscal 2018.","And the second question, curious if you've seen or maybe worry about physical retail over buying product as it may be underappreciate share loss of full game download, and if you think that's creating or could create sort of an elevated promotional burden as retail attempts to create channel. Thanks, guys.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I'll take the first part. So, the slate we talked about today, you should see, is our core foundational slate. There are always other things that we might do depending on what the market looks like, whether it's remasters or otherwise. But you should see that as our core foundational slate. Much to the dismay of the many people that email me on a fairly regular basis, we are not presently making Skate 4, and so that will not be in fiscal year 2018.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Despite my disappointment, it's one of my favorite titles. So, in terms of \u2013 and I think to add to that, we always can add a few things during the year, maybe something gets pulled in faster than we thought, or we move something out of test in mobile more than we thought. But I think for purposes of guidance, we really wanted to give people a full understanding of the master slate that we're planning. So, don't assume that there's another big title looming out there that's going to drop into the year.","In terms of the retail channel, I'll remind you guys that we reserve upfront, it's the difference between our gross sales and our net sales. What you see is net sales, above that we reserve sales reserve to make sure that we have plenty of money available to keep the channel clean. And that results in planned promotions during the year, around specific holidays, or events, or launches, or whatever it might be. And our process is to make sure we work with the retailers to keep that channel clean. So, we're not worried about it. And we watch it very carefully because it's critical to make sure that they're successful as well as we're successful. And so, I don't think that there's any issues that are different than we've seen in the last 5 or 10 years on that.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Thanks, guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I think that's the last question. I appreciate it. We'll talk to everyone else \u2013 or everyone in the coming months. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This does conclude today's conference call, and you may now disconnect."],"8045":["Electronic Arts, Inc.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Electronic Arts Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call.","Mr. Chris Evenden, VP of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference.","Christopher Evenden","Thanks, Natalie. Welcome to EA's fourth quarter fiscal 2019 earnings call. With me on the call today are: Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our COO and CFO.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, our financial model, and a transcript.

We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today.

All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. Note that our results reflect our adoption of ASC 606 as of the beginning of fiscal 2019. And for more information on this change, please see the accounting FAQ we have posted on our IR website.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Chris. The last year was a period of growth in our industry, and one of significant change as transformation accelerated and player behaviors evolved. Throughout our FY2019, we saw strength in our business and our portfolio, and achieved some powerful milestones in our top games and services. We were also challenged by some things that did not go as we planned. Our learnings are helping us sharpen our execution, and we now have key opportunities to drive growth in the year ahead.","Overall, our player base grew to more than 500 million active player accounts in FY2019. This was driven by engagement in our top franchises and live services on major platforms, as well as the introduction of new IP including the free-to-play game Apex Legends that helped us reach new audiences around the world. I\u2019ll share a few highlights here.","The strength of our EA SPORTS business in FY2019 was powered by some of the deepest and most innovative games that we\u2019ve ever delivered to our fans. In a year where we had great experiences in both FIFA 18, including World Cup content, and FIFA 19 with the UEFA Champions League, we had more than 45 million unique players in total playing FIFA games on console and PC during FY2019.","More than a hundred million more players engaged with our FIFA franchise on mobile and PC free-to-play during the year, as well. FIFA Ultimate Team continued to show strength, and our competitive modes like Weekend League saw engagement double year-over-year.","We\u2019ve had greater than 60% growth year-over-year in total unique views, and more than half a billion minutes watched, of our FIFA Global Series content \u2013 and some of our biggest tournaments of the season are still to come. We\u2019ve seen similar trends in our Madden NFL franchise. Players are staying engaged in Madden NFL 19 for longer, our Madden Ultimate Team business grew year-over-year, and Madden competitive gaming is driving excitement and viewership of the franchise.","Our season-ending Madden Bowl tournament was broadcast directly from our new in-house studio here in Redwood Shores to ESPN2 and digital channels, and garnered 7x as many peak concurrent viewers as last year\u2019s event. We\u2019re proud of how we\u2019re delivering for EA SPORTS fans on all platforms, bringing the authenticity, immersion and competition that players are looking for all year round.","On February 4, we surprised the world with Apex Legends, an all-new free-to-play Battle Royale game from Respawn. The creativity, innovation and fun of this game set it apart immediately, and the fluid gameplay mechanics delivered a core experience with the excitement and competition that players around the world had been craving.","Apex Legends is the fastest-growing new game we\u2019ve ever had, quickly reaching the milestone of 50 million players, and millions more have continued to join. It has also helped us tap into new player audiences, as nearly 30% of Apex Legends players are new to EA. We\u2019re incredibly excited and humbled by the passion that fans around the world have for Apex Legends.","We\u2019re now very focused on delivering for this massive global community with a long-term live service, including new seasons with more robust Battle Pass content, new legends, and exciting evolutions to the in-game environment.","We\u2019re also working aggressively to bring the game to more players in more markets and platforms around the world, including Korea where we saw an opportunity in the market and self-published Apex Legends via Origin.","We are still at the very beginning of this exciting journey with Apex Legends, and we look forward to sharing more as we go, including the first details of Season 2 at EA PLAY in June.","We also expanded the Battlefield V experience in Q4 with the arrival of Firestorm, our first Battle Royale mode in a Battlefield game. The DICE and Criterion teams built the biggest map in franchise history and brought signature elements of Battlefield gameplay into this 64-player survival mode.","In the first week after launch, Firestorm became the biggest Battlefield live service event ever, with nearly 60% growth in active players\u2019 week-over-week.","We\u2019re currently in the middle of our third chapter of live service updates to Battlefield V, with more chapters set to begin in the summer and fall, each bringing more of what fans are looking for with new maps and missions. We\u2019ll showcase some of the great new experiences coming to Battlefield V at EA PLAY.","We are similarly committed to the live service for Anthem, and delivering for our community in this new IP over the long-term. The launch of Anthem in Q4 did not meet our expectations. However, we believe in the team at BioWare, and we also believe in what they set out to achieve with this game \u2013 building a new IP and melding genres to reach a new audience.","Players have spent more than 150 million hours in Anthem since launch, and we\u2019ve heard from them that the beauty and expanse of the world is stunning, and that traversing the environment in the Javelin suits makes for amazing gameplay.","However, we\u2019ve also heard feedback from our community about issues that began to manifest as the game reached scale, and that they want more depth and variety in the mission modes of the game. The team is now very focused on continued improvements to the game, and will then bring more content updates and in-game events that will enhance and expand the Anthem experience.","As we wrap up FY 2019, I also want to highlight the continued success of The Sims 4, which has grown every year since we launched. We launched three new content packs and multiple game updates for our Sims 4 community throughout the year, all of which contributed to a 35% year-over-year increase in active players and our strongest year of engagement yet for this ongoing live service. The passion of our Sims community is incredible, and we look forward to bringing them many more great experiences in the year ahead.","Looking to FY 2020, we see an exciting year ahead. Across HD platforms, mobile and PC, the global gaming audience is growing. Great games and services will continue to be at the center, and we are focused on bringing new experiences to more players on more platforms in more geographies throughout the year.","The variety of new games and experiences that we\u2019re planning for players this year demonstrates the breadth and depth of our portfolio. We will have new titles and experiences in our biggest sports franchises, FIFA, Madden NFL, NHL and NBA LIVE, bringing innovation and excitement to hundreds of millions of EA SPORTS fans around the world.","We\u2019re set to deliver on some of the biggest requests that we\u2019ve had from our communities, including new experiences and gameplay advancements that will more deeply immerse players into the world of their favorite sports.","For Star Wars fans, Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order will deliver an amazing single-player adventure, launching in the same window as the movie this holiday. Need for Speed returns to consoles and PC this year, revitalizing the street racer versus cop fantasy at the core of the franchise.","We\u2019ll have a new Plants vs. Zombies HD shooter title, fun and irreverent as always. On mobile, we\u2019ll have new titles going into early user testing this year, ensuring that we\u2019re giving players more time to test and give feedback before we go live globally. And our support of the indie developer community will continue with Sea of Solitude.","We are also deeply committed to our live service communities, delivering more content and more ways to play, watch and create. With the growth of Apex Legends, the team at Respawn is fully focused on live service with a cadence of big new seasonal content launches and continual updates and adjustments to the experience throughout the year.","We\u2019re set to deliver 20 new content drops and expansion packs this year for our thriving Sims community on console, mobile and PC. We have robust live service plans for Anthem and Battlefield V, and we\u2019ll also continue delivering new content for Star Wars Battlefront II, where our commitment to the game has enabled us to build a very strong community over time.","Our competitive gaming programs will continue to be a major focus as well, with our competitive modes in FIFA and Madden, global tournament ecosystems, and high-quality esports programming set to grow our audience of players, viewers and sponsors.","We are working to bring more great games and content to our players where they are. Subscriptions are a key element of this approach to provide players with more choice, and we will expand our subscription offerings to include more games and more platforms in FY2020.","In our Origin subscriptions on PC, there are over 200 games from EA and outside developers, and that will continue to grow. As we announced this morning, we are bringing our EA Access console subscription to players on the Sony PlayStation 4 this summer.","We\u2019re now positioned to offer a subscription on more platforms than any other publisher, and we\u2019ll look to add to that in the coming year. We have a lot ahead of us in FY2020. We are committed to our players, and we\u2019re excited to be pushing forward with our plans.","Now I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks, Andrew. To echo Andrew\u2019s comments, the last 12 months have been a time of change for the videogame industry. Nevertheless, we ended our fiscal year with strong growth, driven by our live services businesses which continued to provide a very large, stable and profitable source of net bookings.","We significantly outperformed our expectations in Q4. This was, of course, largely driven by Apex Legends, but sports were also stronger than we had anticipated. Anthem underperformed our expectations.","I\u2019ll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measure of net bookings to discuss the business dynamics. To compare this quarter\u2019s results to historically-reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.","GAAP net revenue for the fiscal year was $4.95 billion, cost of revenue $1.32 billion, operating income was $996 million, delivering EPS of $3.33. These results enabled us to deliver operating cash flow of $1.55 billion and return over a $1 billion to shareholders, about 83% of free cash flow, through our ongoing share repurchase program.","Total net bookings for the fiscal year were $4.94 billion. Digital net bookings accounted for $3.72 billion of this. Live services net bookings were a record $2.41 billion, up 10 percentage points year-on-year. Within that, Ultimate Team showed its worth as a stable source of net bookings, growing 5% year-on-year.","Moving on to the details of our fourth quarter: GAAP net revenue for the quarter was $1.24 billion, above our guidance by $75 million. Operating expenses were $766 million, $51 million above our guidance, driven by tactical marketing investments in the launch of two major new franchises, and by variable compensation. Operating income was $196 million and resulted in earnings per share of $0.69, $0.13 better than our guidance.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was $599 million, down $16 million from last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $35 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $564 million. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.","During the quarter, we repurchased 3.2 million shares at a cost of $301 million. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $5.45 billion.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings were $1.36 billion, well above our guidance of $1.17 billion, and up from $1.26 billion last year. As mentioned, the beat was driven by Apex Legends and our sports titles, offset somewhat by Anthem.","Digital net bookings were $1.19 billion, up 14% on the year-ago period, driven by strong digital sales of Apex Legends and Anthem. Digital net bookings represented 75% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis, a new record. This compares to 68% in the prior year.","Live services net bookings were up 24% to $845 million, primarily driven by Apex Legends. This delivered the biggest year ever for live services at EA. FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams both closed the year very strongly.","With regards to our subscription services, we continue to add subscribers, exceeding 3.5 million across PC and console at the end of the quarter, and we look forward to growing this meaningfully with the addition of EA Access to PlayStation 4.","Mobile delivered net bookings of $135 million, down 23% year-on-year, with declines from aging titles across our portfolio not offset by growth from our new title, Command & Conquer: Rivals. Our mobile business remains highly profitable, delivering a contribution margin of over 40%.","Full game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $213 million, 10% higher than last year. Growth was driven by the launch of Anthem and by the ongoing shift to digital. Overall, 49% of our units sold through were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. The Q4 mix benefited from the launch of Anthem, which, judging from sales so far, is the most digital game we have ever launched.","Turning to our expectations for fiscal 2020. In dollar terms, we expect the gaming software market to grow 7% over calendar 2018, with mobile up 12%, console up 4% and PC flat. Guidance for 2020 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.4 billion, cost of revenue $1.3 billion and GAAP EPS of $8.56.","The forecast for GAAP EPS includes a one-time tax benefit from the internal transfer of some of our intellectual property rights to our Swiss subsidiary, where our international business is headquartered. The final tax benefit will be at least $5 per share, but could add as much as $13 per share to GAAP EPS during Q1 fiscal 2020.","We continue to forecast our management tax rate for fiscal 2020 to be 18% and we do not expect this transfer to impact our cash taxes nor our operating cash flow. With regards to cash flow, for fiscal 2020, we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.575 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.45 billion.","Turning to business drivers, we anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.1 billion, up 3% year-on-year. Our projections assume a headwind from FX to net bookings of roughly $50 million. This year we expect the headwind from FX to net income to also be roughly $50 million. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website.","Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full-year net bookings guidance, we will launch four sports titles, and expect units to be slightly down, off of a very strong year for FIFA unit sales thanks to the World Cup. Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order we are modeling in the range of 6 million to 8 million, the new Need for Speed title we expect to sell around 4 million units, in line with past performance of the franchise, and the upcoming Plants vs. Zombies shooter to sell in the low single-digit millions.","Overall, net bookings for packaged goods and other are forecast to be approximately $1.2 billion, down 4% year-on-year, driven by the continued shift to digital. Digital net bookings are expected to contribute $3.9 billion, up 6% year-on-year. Further breaking down digital net bookings, we expect live services to grow 10% to 15%, led by Apex Legends, FIFA Ultimate Team and The Sims 4.","Turning to our subscription business, we expect subscribers to grow meaningfully from the addition of PlayStation 4, on top of some organic growth on existing platforms. Apex Legends is easily the fastest-growing franchise we\u2019ve ever had, and we hope to build a live service that entertains players for years to come. Given the exceptional nature of the game, it is appropriate to take a cautious approach to financial modeling. Thus we are forecasting net bookings in the range of $300 million to $400 million.","Note that this assumes no contributions this year from any future mobile version, or a game in the Chinese market. As you build your model, remember that, although the game is free to play, we incur costs for all players. As a result, you should model gross margin in the low 80% range. As a live service, contribution margins are expected to be in the low 60%, above our corporate average.","We are hugely excited about the future of Apex Legends. Players love it, with a Metacritic of 89 and an extremely high net promoter score. Engagement is strong, and we have big plans for the Legends and the world they compete in.","We are in advanced negotiations to bring Apex Legends to China and to mobile, and we will update you on timeframes when those negotiations are concluded. We are self-publishing Apex Legends in Korea. The game offers an opportunity for us to build a direct connection with our players there, and we hope to be able to leverage this for other games. We are also forecasting further growth of our Sims 4 business, off of fiscal 2019, which was its strongest year ever, including the launch year.","Finally with regards to live services, we expect FIFA Online to show year-on-year growth from Q2 onwards. With regards to our mobile business, our portfolio continues to contribute healthy profits. We will start early user testing for two new mobile games this year, in line with our intent to give our games more time in soft launch, and we are not modeling any net bookings from either of those games in fiscal 2020.","As a result, we expect mobile to be down around 10% to 15% in fiscal 2020, with aging titles in the west partially offset by strength in Asia. Net bookings from full-game downloads are expected to be down 5% to 10%, driven by product mix, offset by the underlying shift of around 5 percentage points a year to digital. On a management reporting basis, operating expenses will grow in the very low single-digits per cent in fiscal 2020, as a result of continued tight expense control.","Focusing on Q1, we\u2019re expecting GAAP net revenue of $1.1 billion, GAAP cost of revenue $188 million and GAAP EPS of $5.84. The one-time tax benefit mentioned earlier falls entirely within the first quarter. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $690 million.","Looking ahead, we will continue to build on the changes we have made to our studio organization this year, in leadership, structure and processes. We recently launched Firestorm, Battlefield V's Battle Royale mode, and that brought over a million people back into the game.","We continue to invest heavily in Anthem, with developers working on game quality, content, systems and game mechanics. It's great original IP and we've doubled down on the product. We are continuing to build out Apex Legends, and are finding creative ways to rapidly bring it to new markets.","We will reach an extraordinary variety of players in our FY 2020 slate. We will launch sports games, a racing game, an action title and a first-person shooter. We will add over 20 different content drops for The Sims 4. We are delivering on our commitment to players with deep live services content for Ultimate Team, Apex Legends, Anthem and Battlefield.","Reflecting the industry as a whole, our games encompass premium, free-to-play, subscription and hybrid business models. The breadth of our content served us well in fiscal 2019 and positions us well for the future.","Now I\u2019ll hand the call back to Andrew to offer some final thoughts.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks Blake. The future of this industry has never been more exciting and full of opportunity. We\u2019re deeply focused on strong execution against our FY 2020 plans, and delivering great entertainment for the ever-expanding audience of players around the world.","We\u2019re building amazing new games from powerful franchise brands, including Star Wars, FIFA, Madden, NBA, NHL, Need for Speed and Plants vs. Zombies. For tens of millions of players around the world, we have extensive plans to evolve and add to the Apex Legends experience. Fans of Battlefield V, The Sims 4, and Anthem will have more great content and new ways to play in the year ahead.","We\u2019re working on new projects in mobile to join our portfolio of large-scale live services, and taking the time in player testing to hone breakthrough experiences. Throughout EA Studios, our creative leaders and talented development teams are deeply focused on delivering quality and innovation to our players in each of these experiences in FY 2020, and much more in the years to come.","We\u2019re also continuing to invest in services and engine technology powering the games and experiences to meet the changing needs of players. At the core is our best-in-class technology platform, which provides the foundational services to deliver ever-evolving, connected experiences at scale.","In the year ahead, we are focused on optimizing our technology to our studio needs, leveraging cloud, A.I. and other tools to increase iteration speed for our developers, and enable faster time-to-player for our games and our communities.","With great games and powerful services, we will provide new ways to play, watch and compete. Competitive modes are driving some of the deepest engagement from players in FIFA and Madden. As our major esports tournaments drive viewership records, we have expanded our own broadcast production capabilities, and we\u2019re continuing to partner with networks like ESPN and Twitch to reach broader audiences.","Combined with new sponsorships and great brand partners that are connecting us to more fans around the world, our opportunity in the global esports movement continues to grow. These priorities will help us meet the needs of an expanding global player base.","In the year ahead, we will seek to be where more of our players are, offering our games through more platforms, through more business models, and in more markets. We will deliver great games to players on console, PC and mobile in FY 2020, and with more choice in premium, subscription, and free-to-play models.","We are already leading in subscription services on more platforms than any other publisher, and we have plans to expand that in FY 2020. And with excitement for global brands like FIFA and Apex Legends, we\u2019re also working aggressively to bring our games to new players in Asia through self-publishing and valuable partnerships. We\u2019re ready for another dynamic year of growth in the games industry.","Now Blake and I are here for your questions.","Blake Jorgensen","Hi, Nat. We are ready for questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Evan Wingren of Keybanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Evan Wingren","Thank you. Just wondering on Apex Legends, if you could provide some early learnings from the game, how you're thinking about free-to-play models in future businesses? And then Blake, on the Apex Legends guidance for the year, if you look at the growth rates that you provided for the full-year for live services, it does seem like that you would expect the rest of your live service business within your guidance to be roughly flat to down slightly. Just wondering and trying to understand the moving pieces there. Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","I\u2019ll take the first part and then I\u2019ll give Blake the second part. As you heard from our prepared remarks, we\u2019re overjoyed with Apex. Again, the team at Respawn has built with universal price from a global gaming community. But at the same time when you bring 50 million players or more in short order, you learn a lot of stuff and you learn about the dynamics that come up with scale, with access, with matchmaking, with cheating, with monetization, with content creation.","And I'm proud to say that the Respawn team is a learning team and they are taking all of that and rolling that back in the game experience. And as we talked about, their focus is to ensure that at the very core of the game, the foundation of the game experience continues to be unbelievable fun, exciting and fair for all players, and they have big and robust playing to fulfill, again something we learned, what amounts to insatiable appetite for new content and new programming in the context of the game over time.","With respect to how we think about that across our portfolio, again free-to-play is a powerful business model where you can bring tremendous amounts of people at the top of the funnel and ultimately social interaction and competition form the very center of the game play experience.","And we will almost certainly have other free-to-play experiences in our portfolio over time where the game that we're looking to build fulfills that criteria. Huge plying population and social interaction and competition at the very core of the experience.","There are many other types of experiences, particularly experiences like Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order that don't fit well into a free-to-play model. And as we think about broad offerings across premium free-to-play end subscription, we know that we are fulfilling broad and varied motivations of the global playing audience. And so there will be many other games that don't fit that business model that we still believe are really, really strong opportunities for us to entertain and engage the global reach of players.","Blake Jorgensen","So on the second question, actually I'm not sure how you're doing your math because we do see growth across the Ultimate Team business for the year. We see growth \u2013 a small growth number for FIFA online in Asia, but most of that comes starting in Q2 as I mentioned. Slight decline in our Star Wars: The Old Republic business, and probably one or two other businesses where there's some offsets.","But overall we're seeing growth. We should see more backend Ultimate Team growth versus front-ended because despite not meeting our expectations last year at World Cup, we still had a strong a World Cup Ultimate Team, particularly a strong second quarter Ultimate Team year-over-year.","We will see probably some challenge in Ultimate Team in the second quarter as a comp, but should have a strong third quarter and fourth quarter. Overall, we're looking for growth across \u2013 live services across virtually all the quarters. The biggest challenge is going to be the fourth quarter where we\u2019ll be comping the first quarter of Apex from this past year.","Evan Wingren","Great. Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Brian Nowak","Thanks for taking the question. Just on Madden's Ultimate Team. You mentioned Blake, how FIFA and Madden closed the year very strong. I was curious if you sort of talk to what drove that strength? And then step back and how you think about ex-China FIFA Ultimate Team growth, just talk about sort of the keys to really reaccelerating that growth in the back half sort of beyond the comps? What's the strategy to get more and more payers and players? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. So I think characterized Ultimate Team in any of our live services is driven by addition of new activities and content. Over the last 11 years we've gotten better every year at designing events in Ultimate Team that engage players who can effectively have more fun each year. And when they have more fun, they're liable to spend some more money along the way.","This year for example, we added an activity in the fourth quarter around the young up and coming players and a global soccer and it was one of our most popular events of the year, really caught fire with people and we will clearly be continuing to tune that.","In Madden, we've continued to tune events associated with esports as well as post Superbowl around things like the combine and draft and they've been very popular and one of Madden\u2019s best years we had ever. And so it's really the beauty of live services is it's a daily business.","The teams respond to daily data about what consumers want and what they're doing and continue with the same path and that will be the same path we follow with Apex Legends, where we\u2019ll continue to have seasons where there will be new ways to play, new maps, new activities, new characters, new weapons.","It is the beauty of the live service business that every day you wake up and think about what we can continue to add to this to make and allow people to have even more fun on deeper engagement. And that\u2019s very different than the traditional business and one which we believe is a much more predictable business and steady business over time.","Brian Nowak","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Andrew Uerkwitz","Hey, thanks for taking my question. Andrew, question for you. I mean, obviously we're in the new age of gaming, so things like Twitch kind of matter and it helps drive marketing, but how relevant do things like that matter to you once games are launched in and out and you\u2019re driving live services? Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","Again, Twitch have been a valuable partner for us and represents a significant engagement node for members of the playing community. And so I expect the Twitch will continue to be important part of gamers lives. In terms of Twitch viewer data or Twitch viewer numbers at any given time, it is one data point that we use. There are ebbs and flows and what streamers want to project in those ebbs and flows and what viewers want to see.","A lot of that is around new content and new engagement models. And so we would expect that as we kind of go through the year, whether that\u2019s for Apex or FIFA, we will see ebbs and flows in Twitch viewer data, and we will match that with a broader engagement days that we see and a player sentiment that we get from interacting directly with our players and use that overall drive what is a more enhanced and engaging and extended and expanded player experience for each member of our playing community across each one of our games.","Blake Jorgensen","Andrew, I'd add to that. Our experience in creating broadcasting content is getting better and better each year. We add a substantial investment this past year in buildings. As Andrew mentioned, building our own broadcast facility and the team built a world-class facility where we go directly to ESPN or other broadcasting partners that we have with the content that we've created.","And it allows us to repurpose the studio for virtually any game we have, it set up as a Madden studio, but we could easily do it as a FIFA studio and Apex studio or whatever it might be. And it can be used not just for creating esports tournaments, but for creating broadcast content to essentially continue the development and excitement around our games and get people engaged. And so you're going to continue to see more and more of that as part of what we do.","Andrew Uerkwitz","Got it. Thank you, gentleman. ","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Eric Handler of MKM Partners. Your line is open.","Eric Handler","Thank you very much. Blake wondered if you could talk a little bit about the origins subscription service that you're having. What is your view on that business for the year? And I'm not sure how much you have to invest on a fixed cost basis at this point, but is this a profitable business in your view for fiscal 2020?","Blake Jorgensen","Without a doubt profitable, we wouldn't be doing it if we saw it as a profitable business. For us, we've continued to invest in the origin platform around network and player related tools, ways for players to engage with games easier \u2013 more easier discovery of better social tools around things like matchmaking, better tools around communicating, and you'll continue to see that evolution over the next couple of years. We have a long technology roadmap that our teams are focused on there.","Making the look, the feel and the interaction much better, we're also trying to make sure we built some of those tools that could be used on other's platforms if those other platforms don't have those tools because our goal is to replicate subscription across any available platform, where we think it would benefit from a subscription. We know consumers want to consume games that way.","We've continued our experiment where we'll continue our experiment this year with frontline titles. We had forefront line titles this year, FIFA, Madden, Battlefield and Anthem and we're continuing to collect data on exactly how that differs from the catalog titles and we're continuing to add third-party content.","As Andrew mentioned, we have over 200 games in our origin, access program and some of those from great developers like Warner Brothers or other large third parties. And we'll continue to add those, because we think that's important for consumers.","We think our scale is a far greater than anyone else in the industry, particularly scale AAA games. And that's going to be important to building that subscription base. And the addition of Sony is going to be a huge benefit to both Sony and ourselves around how to have more people playing more games through a subscription offering.","So more to come we mentioned we're over $3.5 million subscribers across the current origin and EA access on Microsoft platform. We think that steps up this year on both organic growth as well as on a growth with Sony. But you'll probably see us approach other platforms in the future to try and have them involved. In particularly as streaming becomes more and more prevalent in the future, we think screaming and combination with subscription could be very powerful.","Eric Handler","That's great. And just as a follow-up to that, I remember speaking this time last year, or well what you launched around E3, the hope was you felt the shooters would have a big impact on the subscription services, and obviously Battlefield and Anthem had their issues. What do you feel is driving the subscriptions now and as you look into fiscal 2020, what's going to be the key drivers of content for those service \u2013 for the subscription service? ","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. We hadn't built Madden for PC and 10 plus years, so it was probably the lowest driver because they're just not that many people playing Madden on PC. But we've, believe we'll continue to add to that platform because there's more people playing FIFA obviously.","And many of those are starting to get a chance to play Madden because they've never played it before. And we'll see more people that are traditional shooter players play action games like Anthem and sports games that they may not have played before.","And so we find that it takes time for people to get through what's in the subscription. In some ways it's daunting. There's so many games in there, but they start to settle into a pattern in which they play games that they really enjoy. And many times they're ones they've never actually played before.","So we think continually adding, we'll update obviously this year with Madden and, and FIFA, and other titles to drive the subscription as well as third-party titles. And we'll continue to feed that content and make it easier to find that content in play with new tools for interaction between other players. And we think that will help drive the subscriptions.","Andrew Wilson","The other addition to this is not unlike all the media and entertainment subscriptions, is that we will use the engagement that we see inside subscription to help us think about what new games should we partner with to bring to the sub. And what new games that we should greenlight internally, and you will likely see us over time, start to greenlight some smaller games that go into the subscription with a view to growing them into much larger games in the future.","And so not only do we think this offers tremendous value to players from a monetary standpoint, we also think it offers tremendous value to payers because that allows them to really play the games they want to play, and in the future play games that they may otherwise never get to play, but for subscription.","Blake Jorgensen","And to be clear, we're conscious that the investment in the subscription tool and network doesn't come cheap. And investment in third-party content where we usually share revenue could ultimately start to cap margins in the service. We're conscious that unless we can develop a more stable business and more predictable business, it probably doesn't make sense to hurt our margins. We're not going to do as some others have in the media industry overspend or spend a dramatic amount more on content that we're delivering or building ourselves.","We're going to continue to deliver and build a content that we have been in the past and look for other partners to help us deliver content and see how it plays out with the consumers. And it's now small portion of our overall business. We think it can be a meaningful portion and ultimately impact and change the way that the financials come each year in a much more stable fashion. But we're still on that journey and we'll see how it unlocks in a world of streaming because that may dramatically change the number of people that have the opportunity to play games in this method.","Eric Handler","Very helpful. Thank you both.","Andrew Wilson","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan with UBS. Your line is open.","Eric Sheridan","Thanks so much for taking the question. Maybe a broader one. Away from your own subscription and streaming offering over the medium term, how are you thinking about either partnering or not with other potential streaming subscription models that might make themselves available to the video game industry broadly as you look out against distribution and getting a wider distribution for your product as possible?","And the second part of the question, in a world where there was some product that\u2019s free-to-play, and others that are distributed via streamed models, could that mean that we end up with less marketing intensity broadly and higher ROI for the industry? We'd love if you could weigh in on that as well. Thanks so much.","Andrew Wilson","Well, let me grab the first bit and then maybe Blake and I can share the second. We come at this with true guiding principles. The first guiding principle is one that has stood the test of time for Electronic Arts, which is we seek to be platform agnostic. We have done a tremendous job since our inception of partnering with any and old platform holders that we could deliver games in any way that we could. And part of that is as a result of our second guiding principle, which is to be where our players are and offer our players choice in how they engage.","And so as we look out in the market, we're very excited about a number of new players coming into the industry, particularly players at scale have the ability to dramatically increase the total addressable marketed players and provide frictionless access to this tremendous entertainment that we create.","We will continue to find our business on these two guiding principles, to be platform agnostic wherever possible and to provide player choice and be where players are at every possible moment. And we feel like that either in the context of what is likely going to be changing consumption models over time, will both be good for us as an organization and more importantly, the best for our players over time.","Blake Jorgensen","On the marketing side, I think in the near-term there probably isn't a large impact because you're obviously trying to bring people into the subscription which requires marketing as well as people to understand the games as we normally do.","I think over the longer term, our hope is it certainly does. If you are able to help people discover new games once they're inside the subscription, we believe that's probably less expensive to do, and most importantly eliminates one of the big barriers for players and that is the risk of that they're not going to like the title.","We do know that there are people that buy games and only play them once or twice and the risk at first as do they want to try something new? When it does subscription, they think that that next game is for free. And so what we're trying to do is get people to actually or breakdown that barrier of trial, which we believe is subscription can do and it's certainly can do it in a far less cost than it is in a traditional model.","Eric Sheridan","Thank you. ","Andrew Wilson","Next question. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Your line is open.","Benjamin Schachter","Guys congrats on a good performance for the year. When talking about the viewership thing, so when you announced [indiscernible] you talked about the strategic value of YouTube for its gaming business and within that context, can you talk about how you're thinking about viewership, how you monetize it?","Is it still primarily about promotion for the core or do you see more direct revenues from that? And related to that, how your relationship with YouTube, Twitch, Facebook and the others evolve? And then just separately, can you talk a little bit about how political trade talks with China might impact the video game business? Is there anything that that may change there? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","I\u2019ll let Andrew take the first one and then I\u2019ll try to attempt to take the second one.","Andrew Wilson","Again, so in the context of viewership, the first thing we\u2019re seeing is that gaming is a more meaningful part of our player's lives than it\u2019s ever been. And in addition to playing the viewing of games is as important to them. And that's not a natural human beings with him watching people play sport for hundreds if not thousands of years. And for many people the playing of games is very core to their competitive juices being fueled.","And so we're going to see more and more that viewership transcends participation and it becomes a growing part of what is players gaming life. In the broader conduct for us, it all amounts to wonderfully great content. And part of the reason why we build our own production facility here is because we do want to ensure that the content that our view - that our players are viewing is as higher quality as a possibly could be.","And ultimately the combination of playing our games and watching our games and engaging in a vast amounts of content that we're able to create that is of deep interest to our players as game becomes more important to them. That will almost certainly add to the value of our overall network and our overall ecosystem in the same way that any content or media business which see value.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes, I would answer that. We look as Andrew mentioned with great partnership with Twitch. We also have a great partnership with YouTube. We've been using those platforms for obviously working with influencers and showing our content. The one thing I think where we have a difference in many of the other game companies do is we also have great partnerships with many of the sports leagues.","And when you think about FIFA, that's a collection of some of the biggest sports organizations in the world and people like UEFA and the champion's league, the premier league and others, which are really global businesses now versus the regional businesses, they weren't historically.","And so we're working with them to find ways to help them build their brands around the globe, which may be not just traditional video games, but combinations of video games and broadcasting opportunities where we're doing things like esports tournaments and others. So it's a huge potential for us down the road and we're very excited about it.","In terms of China, it's a daily question in our mind when we see what tweaks come out each morning. So it's hard for us to gage. We've know what you think is I seen a very strong partnership with Tencent around FIFA and other games and of the marketplace and those games are both on the PC \u2013 traditional PC platform as well as mobile platforms in China.","We built a good partnership with other players in other parts of Asia. We'll continue to do that. We haven't heard anything or seen anything that would imply pressure based on any of the current trade talks. And our hope is that whatever is discussed is it settled in a way which it helps us even deepen our partnerships with those players in those markets.","Benjamin Schachter","Blake, can I ask one quick follow-up on that? Just the negotiations around Apex entering China? How were those negotiations different than from previous titles?","Blake Jorgensen","I would say not really that different. I think as we get deeper and understand the market more, we may ask for things that we didn't ask for it before, but they're not all that know. It just remember Apex is what we're at 92 days into this and the first 30 days to 40 days we were trying to figure out how many people we could add each day on the tech side of the equation and what content they needed. And so it's taken us time to work with potential partners and everyone wants to work with us. So you're trying to go through the partnership discussions, but overall it's been very positive.","Andrew Wilson","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Drew Crum of Stifel. Your line is open.","Andrew Crum","Thanks. Hey, guys. Blake, so the $300 million to $400 million for Apex bookings, you suggest remodel fiscal 2020. Any guidance you can offer in terms of quarterly phase in there. And then separately, I think there's expectations. There will be new console from Sony and Microsoft out over the next 12 to 18 months. How is that in any way influencing your planned R&D spend and margin guidance for the fiscal 2020? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes. That's a good question. I would probably put more in Q3 through Q4 then in Q1. We've already given you a Q1 guide in total. So you could probably work through what it is because \u2013 we just released our first season at the start of the quarter. We haven't announced what our next season will occur, but you would assume that it's probably at the tail end or the front of the second quarter.","We assume that each \u2013 all the new content that we add will continue to help build that revenue base. So \u2013 but we're guessing a little bit, because we don't have a lot of history here. So I would probably, it's not straight line is probably a little more weighted to the back half of the year.","In terms of the new consoles, we're still in the discovery phase around what exactly that means. But we've tried to build our basic engine structures, so it is can be modified for new consoles or new technology fairly easily versus having it be built from scratch. As part of the reason, we went down the path of trying to build frostbite as one of our major engines inside the company.","And as a reminder, if you go back, many years back \u2013 going from Gen 2 to Gen 3 was very expensive. But some of that was driven by was the first time we went to HD versus non-HD into the games themselves as well as going from still on very customized boxes.","When we went from Gen 3 to Gen 4, our costs actually didn't go up at all. And that's because the boxes were designed on more standardized chipsets.","You didn't have the HD probably you are already there. And I think we just got better and we had better technology.","And so our focus is on how do we try to minimize the cost going to the next generation, will know more in the next time, I'm guessing two or three quarters as we get closer to exactly what's going to be out there. But our hope is that there's not a big impact.","Andrew Crum","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Justin Post","A couple of questions maybe first with Blake, just a lot of questions on Apex will then obviously a very strong starting. Congrats on that, but how has it been the last 45 days as far as you users and usage and spend? And then maybe one for Andrew, two years now in a row where we'd had the big first person shooter, holiday title, under perform expectations. How much is that due to fortnight and other competition versus execution and how are you thinking about Battlefield maybe a year and a half from now just making sure that's going to be a great title? Thank you.","Blake Jorgensen","So I would say we're still \u2013 we're not in a place where we're going to give out a lot of metrics. You can assume that, the first 30 days was off the chart, I mean, again because so many people were playing. Our average daily user base has come down slightly, but there's still a lot of people playing.","And obviously the biggest challenge on spend is having enough things that people could spend money on. You got to create content for people to spend money on. So you probably should assume that our spend levels have come down, but we also have the new edition of the battle paths, which essentially you had a lot of spending around battle pass and then people use that as their currency for some period of time. So we're learning what those spend patterns look like.","So not a lot of guidance to give you. I would say that we're still very happy with where it is a got a very consistent user base. And we're trying to keep people with new content and new ways to play and that's where the biggest focus is going to be as well as continue to make sure that the players experience gets better and better in terms of how they play? If there's any bugs in it. We've never had anything of scale at this level.","I think our biggest concurrent user day in FIFA would be 1.5 million users. And here we saw concurrence that we're 5x to 10x that is some cases. And so it tests and so we're learning along the way, but everything has worked much better than we thought. And it's just a question of more content.","And before Andrew answers your question, I'll just make sure to remind everybody we're not going to start giving guidance for fiscal 2021. We just gave guidance for fiscal 2020. So\u2026","Andrew Wilson","And so again you referred to a Battlefront II and Battlefield V. I think that at the end of the day, we've got to create right games and no matter what's going on in the marketplace, we have to create great games. I think Battlefront II on balance in it kind of hard to see through the midst of this, but on balance, Battlefront II was a great game.","We made some missteps in the context of progression and monetization, which actually clouded, what was otherwise a really great game and with the ongoing commitment that the studio has had with the player community, it's now a really strong game with really strong player sentiment and we expect that will continue to do well.","We should have had that done at launch, but we are a learning organization and we've continued to support that community. I think with Battlefield V, we were missing the Battle Royale mode at launch. I think the players really wanted that. That was certainly in the front of mind of a global FPS player community.","Again, we've now launched Firestorm. We\u2019ll talking about 60% week-over-week engagement and the team continues to be very committed to Battlefield as well. Through all of that, other people are also going to make great games and whether that's Fortnite or it's Red Dead Redemption 2. That's no different for us than it's been certainly for the 20 years I've been in this company, there's always competition. The good news, of course is there's more and more players across more and more platforms, across more and more business models each and every day and more now than there have ever been.","And so we see the opportunity as being bigger and more exciting than it's ever been. But at the very cold we must execute. And everything you've heard from us in our prepared remarks is that we are going throughout entire studio and marketing organizations and working on ensuring that we execute against the delivery of spectacular games and very clear communication with our players to ensure that we're delivering what they want and they know what's coming.","Blake Jorgensen","We\u2019ll take one last question.","Operator","And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Gee with Barclays. Your line is open.","Ryan Gee","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, going back to Andrew's comments on game development. Recurring item that we've seen this year with Anthem and in previous games from BioWare, were some publicly publicized technical hurdles at launch. And I think the solution has been to respond quickly and issue big day one or week one patches. So has that been something isolated to just EA?","I think it's something your peers are doing as well. But from an outsider looking in, it seems like doing this, it should be in the QA roadmap and the trust earlier before impacts, your public perception and your financial performance. And maybe provide some context on the challenges of running these big online worlds, what's being done now on the back-end at EA to ensure your games play as expected at launch. And then especially with Stadia and xCloud from Microsoft, adding to the complexity of games going forward, what you guys are doing now on the back-end to really prepare for that future?","Andrew Wilson","So first I would say it's very perceptive and insightful question. And the reality is it's not just an EA challenges and an industry-wide challenge. And as games get more complex both depth and breadth of game experience and you're moving from what was initially a BioWare game, which will be somewhere between 40 and 80 hours of offline play to 40 to 80 hours of offline play plus a 100 or 200 or 300 hours of older game that happens with new developed players at scale online.","Traditionally, what has happened with these massively online games as you would go through a seed of the launch process, you would have soft launches and you have beta tests and we've been launching these types of games in Asia and there'll be four or five different kind of community tests that happened throughout the development process. And that brings kind of the QA component of what happens to these games at scale more forward.","In the west that kind of comes [in the confidence] with typically how games has been marketed. And so what we're doing now inside the organization is saying, okay, typically the way we would have marketed games like this is on this drip feed approach of releasing new content over time, build up kind of the appetite and the excitement for the game and then launch the game and it would run. As games has gotten bigger that system isn't working as well as it has done in years gone by.","And so what you should expect from us is that we \u2013 it's not just about changing the development process in the game, is not just about changing the QA process in the game, although both of those things are being changed dramatically inside of the organization right now.","But it also comes down to changing how we launch games and how we rolled out and you should expect we'll start to test things like soft launches, the same things that you see in the mobile space right now and it also comes down to changing how we communicate with players. And our entire marketing organization now is moving out of presentation mode and into conversation mode and changing how we interact with players over time.","So the day that we bring truly a global audience into play, we have strong confidence that one, the game is ready, two, that the infrastructure can handle the game at scale and three, that our players understand exactly what reasons they're going to be playing and how they\u2019re going to be playing both on the day of launch and over time.","We think that we are in a really good position. I think that gets really hard, if you don't have scale to do this in this new world, until we feel very good about it. And over time we hope that we can lead from the front and help other developers and publishers change the way they do things as well.","Blake Jorgensen","Great. Well thank you everyone for taking the time today. We'll look forward to seeing everyone at EA PLAY in July, if not before that or before June.

Now I'll turn the meeting over to Mr. Rob Sison, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Rob Sison","Thank you. Welcome to EA's Fiscal 2013 Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today are John Riccitiello, our CEO; Blake Jorgensen, CFO; and Peter Moore, our COO. Frank Gibeau, our President of Labels, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earning release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call and a transcript.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of January 30, 2013, and disclaims any duty to update them.","Throughout this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The comparable Q3 GAAP measures for certain non-GAAP measures to be discussed are: net revenue of $922 million; digital net revenue of $321 million; gross margin of 53.5%; operating expenses of $532 million and resulting loss per share of $0.15.","During this call, unless otherwise stated, the financial metrics will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now I'll turn the call over to John Riccitiello. John?","John S. Riccitiello","Good afternoon. In the third quarter of fiscal year '13, EA's non-GAAP revenue was $1.18 billion, below expectations and guidance. The revenue shortfall was a result primarily of a miss with our Medal of Honor title, with stronger-than-expected sector headwinds for console packaged goods. Our Q3 non-GAAP diluted earnings per share was $0.57, above the midpoint of our guidance. We managed to deliver our Q3 EPS by driving our 3 brands aggressively, particularly FIFA, Battlefield and Need for Speed, via good digital growth and aggressive cost controls.","The 2 leaders that did much to deliver the EPS in Q3 are here with me today. Peter and his team drove hard on revenues, while Blake marshaled the troops on the cost side. Blake will explain more about the cost savings shortly while Peter will outline the hits and misses on the revenue side.","At the sector level, we continue to see strong industry growth in most digital areas: mobile, PC and console DLC. The console packaged goods market is a different story. We saw an approximate 20% decline in calendar year '12, and consumers are behaving in a way which reflects a console transition. Overall volumes are down. We're seeing some great unit volumes on a few winning titles. The losers are getting hit hard.","Console transitions are difficult, but historically, they initiate periods of strong growth and for the companies ready to step up, these transitions represent significant opportunity. Near term, EA will complete the fiscal year with a strong lineup of Q4 titles. These include some of my favorite franchises: Dead Space 3, Crysis 3 from Crytek Studios; the return of an industry classic, SimCity; and finally, an incredible game for smartphones and tablets, Real Racing 3.","Beyond Q4, we see a bright light at the end of the tunnel. For EA, digital remains a winner, and our investments are generating strong growth. We're also investing in Gen4 console technologies and content. We've signaled that we're working on the next editions of our 2 biggest franchises in Battlefield and FIFA. And we look forward to discussing these programs and many others with you when we provide our fiscal '14 guidance in May.","With that, I'll hand off to our CFO, Blake Jorgensen.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Thanks, John. First, I'd like to start with some details of the gaming sector during the quarter. We estimate that the worldwide video game market grew in the mid-single-digit percentages for 2012. The digital market grew more than 25% over the prior year, with the mobile business being a significant contributor. The packaged goods market proved to be more challenging than initially anticipated, contracting about 20% relative to 2011.","We encountered 2 major challenges this quarter: First, Medal of Honor performed well below our expectations; second, the packaged goods market underperformed in Q3 versus going in estimates. To counter these issues, we took proactive steps to drive revenue on thriving titles like FIFA, Battlefield 3 and Need for Speed. We also reduced spending on headcount, variable compensation, contractors, marketing, advertising and other general and administrative expenses. These actions, combined with the higher-than-anticipated gross margin resulting from strong digital sales, enabled us to hit the upper end of our non-GAAP EPS guidance range, despite generating revenue below our forecasted non-GAAP revenue range.","Total Q3 non-GAAP net revenue was $1.18 billion, which was approximately 9% below the midpoint of our guidance. Compared to the same period last year, net revenue was down 28% due to the tough comp of Battlefield 3 and the launch of Star Wars: The Old Republic. Peter will provide more detail on our Q3 revenue and title performance but here are a few highlights.","During the quarter, we saw strong performances from FIFA and Need for Speed. Madden was up over last year, and both NCAA Football and NHL were down. Hockey, we believe, driven -- or hockey's lockout drove the NHL reduction.","The packaged goods side of the catalogue was up over 16%, driven by the continued success of FIFA and Battlefield 3, and we had strong growth on the digital side. EA's Q3 non-GAAP digital net revenue increased 8% year-over-year to $407 million. The underlying growth is understated because we are deferring the Battlefield Premium revenue, and if we included it in this quarter's result, digital revenue growth would have been 15%. The trailing 12-month for digital net revenue was nearly $1.5 billion, representing a year-over-year growth of 37%.","Breaking the digital revenue down by type for Q3 shows the following: First, full game downloads contributed $44 million, down 57% compared to the same period last year. Full game downloads have typically been driven by PC products such as Battlefield and Star Wars, and this quarter, we did not have any PC-centric titles. The majority of our Q3 digital revenue full game downloads came from FIFA, Medal of Honor and Need for Speed. We believe that full game downloads will grow in the future.","Extra content and free-to-play contributed $185 million, up 50%, led by FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams and Star Wars: The Old Republic. These revenues relate to businesses on PCs or consoles, where consumers pay for additional digital content, including virtual characters, map packs and microtransactions associated with browser-based games or MMOs like Star Wars. As a reminder, on November 15, we launched our free-to-play option for Star Wars: The Old Republic. Very early indications have been positive, and we are pleased with the initial results but it's still too early to know how successful this will be in the long term.","Our mobile business, including handhelds, generated close to $100 million for the quarter, and was up 18% over the prior year. The major portion of this revenue was driven by smartphones and tablets, which accounted for $79 million, up $100 million, growing 36% year-over-year. Some of this growth was due to the success of The Simpsons: Tapped Out on the iOS platform. We are actively developing Android applications for our key brands to address that growing market as well. Based on industry estimates, there's over 1 billion smartphones and over 200 million tablets being used currently. We continue to focus on this segment due to the evolution and the sharp growth of the smartphone and tablet markets.","And last, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $79 million, growing 18% over the same period last year. The current year includes a full quarter of Star Wars subscription, but it was offset by a decline in other licensing digital revenues.","As a reminder, the non-GAAP revenue continues to exclude our Battlefield 3 Premium subscription service. For the third quarter, Battlefield 3 Premium generated $28 million in sales, bringing the total premium revenue for the first 3 quarters to approximately $108 million. We will recognize these sales as revenue in the fourth quarter when we release the fifth expansion pack entitled End Game. And as another reminder, all of the development and delivery costs have been recognized in the previous quarters.","I'd like to point out that all these digital revenue types have no physical goods, costs and there are no associated price protections. Eliminating these expenses provide greater savings, resulting in higher margins. Also, consumers tend to purchase digital content over the course of their gameplay, extending the life of our brands. Lastly, these transactions are direct to consumers, helping us develop and foster our relationship with our gamers. The digital momentum continues to build and we see this as the future.","Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin was up almost 2% over our guidance, driven by the growth of our digital revenue. In our continued drive to improve gross margins over time, we are implementing our own digital distribution business, replacing third-party vendors. Taking full control of this process, combined with shipping fewer physical discs, has contributed to improved gross margin. We believe this trend will continue into 2014 and beyond.","Operating expenses for the quarter came in approximately $70 million lower than expectations due to concentrated efforts to reduce spending as discussed earlier. We are being more critical with regard to expenses, concentrating our efforts on the highest value opportunities. In addition, we are focused on greater efficiencies in marketing and leveraging the power of our brands to reduce the need for incremental spend. We continue to reevaluate expenses and cut back where it makes sense.","The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.57 for the quarter, in line with our guidance and market consensus. Our cash, short-term investments and marketable securities at the end of the quarter were $1.5 billion or approximately $5 per share. Roughly 60% of this cash is held outside of the U.S.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $363 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $378 million. Obviously, cash flow was impacted by the lower revenues in the quarter.","During Q3, we repurchased 12.2 million shares at a cost of $157 million, bringing the total share repurchase under our current program to 20.6 million shares at a total cost of $265 million. As a reminder, the $500 million share repurchase program was initiated in August, and we continue to repurchase shares under this program.","In summary, for Q3, we delivered non-GAAP EPS in line with our guidance, despite the revenue challenges. We were able to achieve this through favorable gross margin and focused efforts on reducing operating expenses.","Now turning to guidance for Q4. Q4 has some encouraging elements that we can see: First, we will finally get to recognize a full year of the Battlefield Premium; second, we have strong momentum on the digital side of the business, with FIFA Ultimate Team and mobile leading the way; and finally, our biggest 3 titles shipping in the quarter, Dead Space 3, Crysis 3 and SimCity, are all finishing strong.","However, there's a high level of uncertainty and challenges surrounding the upcoming quarter, because of the softness we just experienced in the holiday quarter. Additionally, we are also anticipating significant volatility that accompanies a perceived console transition. Also our first key launch for the quarter won't be until next week with Dead Space 3, and there have been no other major releases since December that could reveal any specific trends or developments in the market. And last, we've decided to move the launch of FUSE to Q1 of fiscal 2014.","These factors are causing us to be more conservative, and therefore, we are widening and adjusting down our guidance for the quarter, and consequently for the year. GAAP revenue for the fourth quarter is expected to be between $1.115 billion and $1.215 billion as compared to $1.368 billion in the prior year. GAAP diluted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be between $0.92 and $1.12 per share, as compared to $1.20 per share in the prior year.","Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be between $1.025 billion and $1.125 billion, an increase over last year's $977 million. Gross margin for the quarter will benefit from the very high-margin Battlefield Premium revenue that had been deferred.","Regarding operating expenses, we expect our total non-GAAP operating expenses to be less than $525 million for the quarter. For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be between $0.57 and $0.72 per share, as compared to $0.17 last year.","So for the full year, GAAP revenue for the fiscal is expected to be between $3.703 billion and $3.803 billion, and GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be between $0.18 per share and $0.38 per share. Non-GAAP revenue for the fiscal year is expected to be between $3.778 billion and $3.878 billion, and non-GAAP EPS is expected to be between $0.86 per share and $1 a share.","On cash flow for the fiscal year, we reconfirm our fiscal '13 capital expense projections of approximately $100 million, but we are adjusting our operating cash flow estimates to $350 million, reflective of our lower guidance. This implies an expected free cash flow generation of $250 million, more than double what we generated in fiscal '12.","Regarding next fiscal year, our plan is to provide fiscal guidance for 2014 during our Q4 earnings call, where we'll be in a better position to share our insights. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Robert Moore","Thanks, Blake. Today, I'm going to offer an overview on the sector, some color on EA's Q3 performance and an update on the games and services we're offering in the current quarter. I'll start with the sector overview. The most obvious trend is the distinction between the performance of high-definition consoles, the PS3 and the Xbox 360, versus standard definition consoles, that is, earlier generations and the Nintendo Wii.  Both are trending down, but standard definition is down 46% year-over-year in 2012 versus a 13% decline in our HD titles. That's an important distinction as EA's console titles are singularly focused on that HD audience.","The next trend is the concentration of consumer dollars behind chart-topping hits in the packaged goods sector. In the holiday quarter of 2011, the top 10 titles accounted for approximately 40% of Western World industry revenue. In 2012, the top 10 captured nearly 50%. EA had 2 of the top 5 in 2012, FIFA 13 and Madden NFL 13. We also had more top 20 hits, 6 in 2012 versus 4 for the prior year.","But as John mentioned a moment ago, this market dynamic results in a clear distinction between winners and losers, and in Q3, EA had both. The digital trends are extremely positive. We estimate that the global revenue from digital games and services grew by more than 25% year-over-year. Mobile game revenues on iOS and Android doubled in size in 2012. Digital revenue related to PC games, including full game downloads, PDLC, social gaming and subscriptions, grew at approximately 20%, as did the digital revenue related to console games.","Now turning to EA in the holiday quarter, we struggled with 2 challenges: the slowdown that impacted the entire sector; and poor critical and commercial reception for Medal of Honor Warfighter. Medal of Honor was an obvious miss. The game was solid, but the focus on combat authenticity did not resonate with consumers. Critics were polarized and gave the game scores which were, frankly, lower than it deserved. This one is behind us now. We are taking Medal of Honor out of the rotation and have a plan to bring year-over-year continuity to our shooter offerings.","To address the revenue gap, our global publishing organization moved quickly to align behind blockbuster brands with solid revenue streams, namely FIFA, Battlefield, Need for Speed and Madden.","I'll start with FIFA, an EA franchise that has emerged as one of the world's top 2 or 3 games. The EA SPORTS team in Vancouver is absolutely crushing it on every format and in every market. Since FIFA 13 launched in September, we've sold through more than 12 million units. And in Europe, FIFA 13 was the #1 title in 2012, outselling all other games, including Call of Duty.","The digital performance for this franchise is particularly impressive. The number of gamers that actually play FIFA Ultimate Team grew 61% over last year's offering. Additionally, the average revenue per paying user increased by approximately 30%. Both of these increases contributed to FIFA Ultimate Team revenue being up 136% year-over-year, and the holiday delivered the largest revenue day in the history of the service.","Moving to Asia, FIFA World Class Soccer in Japan has delivered lifetime revenue of $80 million. And we're extremely optimistic about the early read on FIFA Online 3, which we have debuted in Korea in partnership with Nexon. After 2 successful closed trials, we went to open beta on December 17 and registered more than 2.4 million players in the first 4 weeks, a record for Nexon. Average daily users reached 440,000, which is 10% above our target. This one is tracking really well.","Another Q3 success story was Need for Speed Most Wanted. Sell-through was up over 30% year-over-year, and outperformed the industry's other AAA racing titles. In this market, consumers are concentrating their choices. They don't buy 2 driving titles but they will buy the best one. Need for Speed is back in position as an annualized blockbuster.","Next up, Battlefield 3. The core game launched 15 months ago and has captured more than 20 million players. Following the release of Aftermath in December, our fourth expansion pack, the Battlefield Premium service added over 0.5 million subscribers to exit Q3 with total subs of 2.7 million. This is a shooter franchise with unmatched ability to engage consumers, millions of fans who want more missions, more maps and more fun. Battlefield, along with FIFA, is now in position to become one of the top 2 or 3 game franchises in the industry.","And no review of our blockbusters would be complete without mentioning Madden NFL. This year's game performed well this quarter, with year-over-year increases in both unit sales and revenue. This year's key innovation is real physics that drive incredibly fluid animations and fundamentally improved the game experience in Madden NFL 13.","Beyond the AAA blockbusters, our mobile titles continue to perform well. The Simpsons: Tapped Out hit #1 top grossing app in the U.S. during the holiday period, climbing to 3.2 million daily active users. Both The Simpsons and Bejeweled Blitz have been charting well in the Apple App Store for several months; both will debut on Android later this quarter.  In December, EA was once again the #1 iOS publisher worldwide, and December was the highest revenue generating month of 2012 for the App Store.","Now turning to Q4. We have 3 top titles and 1 highly anticipated mobile game to finish out our fiscal year: First, Dead Space 3, a proven sci-fi horror franchise with a strong consumer base, will launch in the first week of February. This is our biggest and best Dead Space in the series, with a terrifying single player campaign and an entirely new to the series Co-op Gameplay mode. 30 media outlets listed Dead Space 3 on their best of 2013 list.","The Dead Space 3 demo released earlier this month on Xbox 360 has generated 44% more downloads than the demo for Dead Space 2, and the PlayStation 3 demo launched last week. We're feeling really good about this one.","Second, Crysis 3, from our partners at Crytek Studios, will ship on PC and consoles February 19 in North America and February 22 in Europe. Preorders are tracking roughly 40% ahead of Crysis 2. We opened the multiplayer beta last weekend, and we're getting a great response from gamers.","Third, SimCity, a completely new version of the treasured classic, includes deep online features. More than 100,000 people played the SimCity beta last weekend, giving us a nice bump in preorders, and the critical reception is shaping up well. Watch for SimCity on March 5 in North America and March 8 in Europe.","And finally, Real Racing 3 is a stunning driving game for iPhone, iPad and Android devices. Our Firemonkeys Studio did an awesome job with this one, bringing console quality graphics and fluidity to a mobile title. Real Racing 3 will ramp up to a full launch in North America on February 28.","Three more shoutouts for games scheduled for release this spring. First, Tiger Woods PGA TOUR 14 will be released on consoles on March 26 in the U.S. and on the 28th worldwide; secondly, Army of Two: The Devil's Cartel, will be available on consoles on March 26 in the U.S. and in Europe on March 29; and finally, Ted Price and the Insomniac Studio are putting a lot of polish into their new game, FUSE. The extra work delivers a big payout for players and FUSE will be released in Q1, our spring quarter.","I'll finish with a note on Origin. Our online portal for digital games and services continues to scale. Origin now boasts more than 39 million registered users, with over 2 million new registrations in January alone. And the team is preparing to launch Origin for the Mac next month, extending Origin to tens of millions of new gamers. Now back to John.","John S. Riccitiello","Thanks, Peter. Here's a quick summary of what we've told you today. First, Q3 was a disappointment on the revenue side. Medal of Honor didn't deliver, and we underestimated the overall softness in the console packaged goods sector. Helping to offset these challenges was the stellar performance on our 2 biggest brands: FIFA delivered on packaged goods and digital in Western markets and in Asia; and Battlefield 3 contributed strong packaged good sales in Q1 through Q3, and Battlefield 3 Premium is providing a big digital revenue positive in Q4.","Second, our Q3 EPS performance was solid and at the upper end of our guidance. Looking forward, we feel we're in a position to capture and lead the next period of industry growth. We think we're perfectly positioned to take advantage of the trends we see coming, in digital and mobile, as well as on the console side of the business.","In each of these growth opportunities, we're investing in the next generation of technology and content. We have the biggest brands. FIFA and Battlefield are proven blockbusters, they just keep growing and getting better. I believe that in the next 4 years, both will be among the top franchises that define the industry across all platforms and geographies.","And we have several more blockbuster franchises right behind Battlefield and FIFA. We are building a digital platform for servicing our global network of more than 275 million users, a platform that enables profitable growth in digital with efficient cost structure. And we've got the best talent in the industry. EA is a rare company that can build global brands. We can nail it on console, nail it on mobile, and we've built a team that can turn the complexity of a digital platform into a competitive advantage for Electronic Arts.","We believe fiscal '14 to be a point of departure, the starting point for a new era of gaming and a growth period for the best game companies. We're confident that EA's brand, platform and talent will separate us from our competition and allow us to lead in this new era.","With that, Blake, Peter, Frank and I will take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator",".","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Williams from BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a quick question, first of all, on Medal of Honor. Can you talk a little bit about what you think drove the performance of Medal of Honor? And what steps so you can kind of take from that to prevent that from going forward? Then maybe you can provide a little bit of clarity on, Peter, on your comments on year-over-year continuity with first-person shooters?","John S. Riccitiello","I think Frank will take this one.","Frank D. Gibeau","Sure, let me start with Medal of Honor. Look, we're a hit-driven business, where it's about what you can build in a certain period of time and really deliver for the marketplace. And frankly, we missed on Medal of Honor, and we take responsibility for that. I would be remiss if I didn't point out that the rest of our studios have performed pretty well. We released 11 games this quarter, over 80 in the year, more than any other third-party developer. And we also deliver about 94% of our titles on time. And Medal of Honor, I admit, definitely overshadows these achievements, but we're proud of our team overall. Now if you look at Medal of Honor as a specific case, it was really about a hit missing, but the rest of the studios have really performed and delivered on their goals. As it relates to the comments that Peter talked about in shooters, we've already talked a little bit about that we have a Battlefield title coming next year, but we're not in a position right now to talk about our development plans and our SKU plan long term. That will come in about 90 days when we get to show you some Battlefield stuff.","Operator","Brian Karimzad from Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","A couple of questions, I guess, relating to costs. So the first one, I guess, it was somewhat refreshing to see that the absolute marketing expense came down about 20% year-on-year in the quarter; it had been tracking kind of flattish prior to that. So Blake, is it your sense this is something that's sustainable as we kind of think about things going forward? And maybe, do we kind of go back to the situation where 3, 4 years ago, you're able to get away with kind of a $600 million marketing expense base on a similar revenue base? And I have a follow-up.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes. So I'll hesitate to say it's a trend, because it's really driven more by the titles and the activity in the quarter. But we are spending a substantial amount of time, both with our core marketing teams as well as our digital teams here, trying to determine how best to spend each marketing dollar. A lot of work's being done on how to get more out of each dollar, and we're being conscious in a difficult market as to when we spend, and if we think volumes are coming down, we will correspondingly wind back some of our marketing spend associated with some of those volumes. I'd say hold off on putting too much of a trend in your models going forward, but know that we're going to try to keep pushing that down. But it's really going to be driven by the slate of titles going forward.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I guess leading off of that, so you generally talk about having 8, 10 recurring franchises. I guess we efficiently got rid of one with Medal of Honor going away. But, and I know you guys don't like to talk about individual game profitability, but I think we can all back into the fact that FIFA and Battlefield probably represents substantially all, if not more, of the profit of the company, at least over the last year or 2. So as you move into next generation here with the console cycle, what's changed in your thinking about your approach to rationalization?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, I think we're going to continue to try to maintain a smaller slate of titles than we had historically. Does that go up or down 1 titles or 2 a year, it depends. I'll let Frank or John comment to that. But at the end of the day, we're trying to build around franchises, so Battlefield and FIFA are great examples, but Madden and others are also examples on that. And the franchise build is -- try to build the profitability by not just having a big title, but by having a long digital life associated with that title. Battlefield's a great example. If you look at the Battlefield Premium service that's come along with that. We're now over 1.5 years outside of when that title was released. And as we've said, we'll book at least $108 million in the fourth quarter on revenue associated with that Battlefield Premium service. FIFA Ultimate Team's another great example. We're trying to create a world in which people are playing FIFA on many different devices in many places during the day. So a team may play at night on a console with their friends, and may then the next morning, update the scores in their Ultimate Team on their smartphone or their tablet, while they're going to work, the may play at work on their tablet or smartphone, they may arrange for a game late in the evening, or for that coming evening, and then get back together with their friends on the console. And all of that can be monetized through different methods of digital, which help drive that profitability versus having single -- one single packaged goods title that's really driving it.","John S. Riccitiello","So this is John. Let me add a little bit of that. So 2 thoughts. 10 franchises, Madden, FIFA, Sims, SimCity, Battlefield, FIFA, [indiscernible] I'm sorry about that, NHL, Dragon Age, Mass Effect, Need for Speed, so 10 titles, all profitable. So let me start by dispelling the notion that it's only Battlefield and FIFA that contribute to our profitability. We have a deep bench of highly profitable, great franchises. The second point that I would make is, you are correct that titles at the scale of FIFA and Battlefield are what drives your profitability inside of EA, and they're doing so increasingly for precisely the reasons Blake just outlined. And my view is that the top 5 franchises globally in the industry probably define half the industry's profitability or something close to that. I could be exaggerating a little bit, but I haven't calculated it that way. But I will assure you that -- we believe that FIFA and Battlefield have a shot at certainly remaining in the top 5, quite possibly being 1 and 2, if we're successful as we move through the next technology transitions we see coming. We do recognize as we move into what we determine or call Gen3, i.e., PlayStation 3, Wii, Xbox 360, we started weak, and we climbed forward, improved, but we lost market share coming into this transition, we climbed back. We think Battlefield and FIFA are going to help us lead as we move into the next set of technology opportunities and platform opportunities, and continue to get bigger. So you're right to believe that FIFA and Battlefield are vitally important to us. I think it's too simple to believe that's all that is important to us. I'm proud of the rest of the titles we have, and that's say, 10 or so titles, because it's through that, that we can be sure to have, from this point, 10 great years, 15 great years, not 1 generation of great years, defined by 1 or 2 franchises that may falter towards the end of an individual cycle.","Operator","Colin Sebastian from R.W. Baird.","Gregor Schauer - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Gregor Schauer, I'm filling in for Colin, he's on another call at the moment. And I guess, maybe a bit of a tough question, but as you guys have mentioned, the biggest, say -- one of the biggest issues you guys are facing are just the secular headwinds as a result of the late stage of the console cycle. So to a certain extent, it seems that a lot is not in your control at the moment. And I guess, if one's anticipating, hopefully a positive and a good -- a well-selling new console, but in the event that the new consoles are not that competitive, what is plan B in that scenario? I mean, and I guess, that scenario could potentially involve the other platforms that are gaining penetration in the -- in this year or maybe evolving as console platforms. How do you -- is that something you can do a lot in terms of preparation for? Or what do you...","John S. Riccitiello","So this is John. Let me take that for you, just a little bit. So as a starting point, the data on game usage and game revenue is exceptionally clear. So we have added gamers to the universe of paying game customers in a dramatic way each year over the last several years, and there's absolutely nothing that I see that suggests that's going to slow down. The second thing is, that's been driving very substantial growth in what we referred to as digital. Over the last 12 months, we've generated 37% growth to get us to a $1.5 billion digital business over the last 12 months. I mean, I would -- I could make a reasonable argument that absent all of our packaged goods business, that $1.5 billion digital business growing at 37% might well be more valuable than the entirety of our current market cap, if I were to venture a guess. I -- you guys value it, I don't. But so I think that's a vital fact, growing massive opportunity business for us. But sitting on some pretty sound fundamentals, great brands, strong consumer franchises, great technology and compelling entertainment content. So I think we've got that. What drives that is a talent base that I think no one else in our industry has. Some folks -- and some of the social gaming companies are good at data, some companies that make simple console games are great at entertainment, not so great at monetization. I think we've got both here in that team. Now I think we've got a great story absent consoles. But as you might well expect, we know more about the roadmap and more about what's coming in consumer electronics in terms of the specifics of devices that would play games than you might otherwise be disposed to. The information we have, we remain bullish. It's why we have outlined our plan to invest, this past fiscal year, the current fiscal year, $80 million in that opportunity. So I think plan A is, explode along with the opportunities we see on digital and console, and plan B is console rip [ph] a little smaller, but we have high confidence in what we see coming.","Operator","Justin Post from Bank of America.","Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Ryan Gee calling in for Justin. I guess first, going back to the digital, it's solid substantially, quarter-over-quarter, and even if you go back and factor in the Battlefield 3, 15% growth. What else is driving that deceleration? And if we see that FIFA digital has pretty much doubled year-over-year, what else is driving down that growth? And then is there any sign that comps get better moving into the next quarter outside of FIFA -- I'm sorry, outside of the Battlefield 3 digital?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, so this is Blake. The reminder is, that full game downloads are really PC-centric, and so, when you have a title like Battlefield, which was a substantially bigger title than anything we had in this quarter, and you have a title like Star Wars that starts up, so we had the startup of Star Wars in Q3 last year, those 2 combined, are primarily PC-based businesses, and that drove a huge amount of extra content -- or excuse me, or full game downloads during the quarter. So if you look at the slides that we distributed with our earnings package on Page 9, you can see it pretty clearly, $103 million in Q3, full game downloads, versus $44 million in this quarter. Almost all of that's driven by Battlefield and Star Wars startups in that quarter. Yes, the other is just pure math, right? We're now at north of $400 million a quarter in digital business. The law of averages, you can't keep growing that at the high percentage rates that we've been growing them at. Year-over-year growth, 37%, we're fairly confident we're going to continue to see growth because all components of that business, absent the product-driven growth in full game downloads, you're going to see a lot more growth coming out of that going forward.","Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great, and then another question. I know you guys didn't ever really quantify it, but it sounds like you're more optimistic on Battlefield 3 digital, it had some good sales in the quarter. And then SimCity, looks like that's tracking well for next quarter. Should we assume that maybe that 4Q benefit next quarter is maybe a little bit bigger? Again, you've never really quantified it, but should we expect to maybe a bigger benefit for next quarter than maybe we were modeling going into this quarter?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Well, you take Battlefield Premium, we know we disclosed today that $108 million will drop into the fourth quarter at a minimum, right, because that's, that game has been up through the third quarter. In the third quarter, we had $28 million generated from Battlefield 3 Premium. Obviously, we're down to the last expansion pack in that series in the quarter, so you might see that trend down a little bit. But you probably, if you did your math and you're somewhere in the $120 million to $130 million in the fourth quarter, you probably see that. I think the one thing to keep in mind is that as we mentioned, most of the costs for developing or delivering that product were incurred as the quarters went along, and so that revenue, when it comes into the fourth quarter, will be a very high gross margin. And so you're looking at the guidance, you might be asking the question, your gross margins must be relatively high compared to say, third quarter and that's indeed true, driven by both that Battlefield Premium as well as the owned IP from titles like SimCity or Dead Space 3, which run at higher margins than some of our other titles. So that's going to give you -- help give you your boosted gross margin, which will pencil out on the guidance that we just gave you guys.","Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, just one last big picture question, maybe for John. I know Nintendo came out today and was a little bit more cautious on its outlook for Wii U sales. Doesn't sound like this is a platform you guys are really pursuing aggressively early on. What does this really say about consumer's willingness to adopt the next gen consoles? We should have something new from Sony or Microsoft. So what does that say, just with Nintendo going through the struggles early on, on the Wii U?","John S. Riccitiello","Well, a couple of things. I'd first say, you never count Nintendo out. They've got some of the best IP probably in the game industry. When their marquee titles show up, that's when you usually see the bounce. I'm deeply respectful of the achievements they've had over the last several years and as I said, you just never really count them out. Having said that, I wouldn't say that we see much correlation between the results that Nintendo just shown with their console debut of the Wii U, and what we see coming. We see a pretty sharp distinction, and unfortunately, unable to go any further than that. Ours is an industry where a lot of devices come in and represent themselves as the next generation or the next generation after that. In many ways, we would argue that the gen -- what we're describing as Gen4 is yet to come. And it's with that, we're excited about, and that's what we're investing in. And frankly, we've been quite consistent with that for some time, recognizing the frustration or inability to articulate precisely why causes for you.","Operator","Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies.","Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A couple of questions, guys. The first one, with the recent events that happened, any softness around first-person shooters or more mature rated games impact that you're seeing or potentially expect to see around Gun Club? And then just to follow on, what's your view of the media and political focus and how it pans out, maybe historically looking back at other hits than inside of happened [ph]?","John S. Riccitiello","All right, so I was hopeful we weren't going to do this question, but thanks for asking. So first off, no, we're not seeing softness on -- in the FPS sector. Secondly, I would say, I've got a somewhat unique advantage or vantage point here, working at EA and also chairing the ESRB and the ESA. Some reasonable exposure to the goings-on in Washington. I want to underline the first point. The game industry is a very mature, responsible industry, more so than you might otherwise imagine. First off, we're very confident in the quality of our content and the lack of actual factual linkage to any of the actual violence that takes place in America and markets around the world. So there's no doubt we, like you, were stunned and horrified by the violence in Connecticut or Colorado or other -- in many other places over the years. But there's been an enormous amount of research done in the entertainment field about looking for linkages between entertainment content and actual violence. And they haven't found any. And there -- I could give you long stories about how people in Denmark or U.K. or Ireland or Canada consume as much or more violent games and violent media as they do in the United States, and yet they have an infinitely smaller incidence of gun violence, but that's not really the point. The point is that direct studies that have been done, hundreds of millions of dollars of the research have been done, has been unable to find a linkage because there isn't one. And that went all the way up to the Supreme Court this past summer. A number of folks had summarized the available data, provided it to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court came out in favor of, basically stating that we deserve all the First Amendment right freedoms that are accorded to any media. And the key part of that, is I think, they were swayed by the evidence that was presented to them of all these studies. Now having said all of that, and with all, if you will, humility about the world we live in, we understand that while there may not be an actual problem, given all the finger-pointing going on in the press, there appears to be the perception of a problem, and we do have to wrestle with that. Ours is an industry with an association that has risen to that call many times before, and will, as we move forward. We're responsible, we're mature, we intend to be part of the solution. Our media reaches literally every American, and that can be used as a voice for good. And I think you'll hear more from Mike Gallagher, the head of the ESA and other industry participants, including ourselves, over how we can be part of a solution to this perception problem as opposed to, if you will, the butt of the joke. So quick summary, we're horrified, like you. It's not about games. There's a perception issue. We can be part of that solution, and we're ready to step up to do that.","Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I really appreciate your candid and thorough and sincere comments there.","Operator","Doug Creutz from Cowen.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","We've seen in the past years some, most or all companies have some real success in mobile and somewhat social in the midcore genre. And I was just wondering where you guys are, with respect to that genre, what your plans are, do you view as an opportunity?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, this is Frank. Absolutely, we are looking at the midcore segment for mobile. Real Racing is a good example of a game that appeals to a core gamer that's going to be coming out shortly on Android and iOS, and we have a number of titles planned going forward, that will start to reach that audience. We're big believers in it.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Any updates on Plants vs. Zombies 2?","Frank D. Gibeau","We have nothing to announce at this time. The PopCap business is doing really well on mobile, Plants vs. Zombies being a key title in that mix. And we are looking at a great plan going forward from PopCap to grow the Plants vs. Zombies franchise.","Operator","Mike Hickey from National Alliance Security.","Michael Hickey - National Alliance Capital Markets, Research Division","Valve at CES has this year created, I think, some noise with their official introduction of Steam Box. As Nintendo kind of fades a bit, maybe from this cycle, and there's uncertainty around Sony and Microsoft in terms of excitement, you think Valve could be a competitor within the home console market, moving forward?","John S. Riccitiello","This is John. First off, let me admit that I am squarely in the Gabe Newell fan club, really enjoy my conversations with him, certainly have enjoyed a whole lot of content they've produced, and at one time, and certainly even today, I'd say Portal represents one of my all-time favorite bits of game software that's ever been produced. Having said that, Valve really hasn't put enough information out there to suggest whether or not they've got the wherewithal to compete in console. There are lots and lots of issues. But large-scale success in game console usually goes with multiple billions of dollars of investment, both in content development, investments made across a blend of developers and publishers, retail relationships, online relationships, consumer marketing, chip fabrication, manufacturing, supply pipeline and the rest. So based on what they've said so far, it could be anything from a cool niche product that appeals to Gabe and his friends, and people like me, to a product that actually has the shoulders to give help -- lift our industry forward into what we're describing as Gen4. They need to give us -- put a few more breadcrumbs on the ground to tell us what path we're on. Good people, smart people, technologically innovative people. And right now, there's just not enough information out there to really answer.","Operator","Sean McGowan from Needham & Company.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","A couple of questions, if I can. First, more probably quicker, what do you think you could take away as learnings from your success with Simpsons for the mobile market? What's either in that title or monetization techniques that you think you can apply to other titles?","Frank D. Gibeau","Well, The Simpsons brand was a great opportunity for us to bring a bunch of new thinking and new ideas related to episodic content to the market. So one of the things that really stood out for The Simpsons and was the key growth driver was the release of Treehouse of Horrors Packet at Halloween, and we have a commitment to ongoing, episodic theme-based content releases for The Simpsons. And so at its core, it's a hilarious game, working directly with the writers at Gracie really gave the game an edge and an attitude and authenticity that resonated with fans. And then the fact that we're committed to releasing and continuing to release high-quality, episodic content has really proven to be the growth driver there.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, and then, maybe for John or anyone, could you give us a little bit more specifics on what's driving the guidance for the fourth quarter? Is it just, you don't like what you kind of generally see out there? Or is there something more specific that says, \"Here's something that we were expecting, and we knew were going to see a lot less of it?\"","John S. Riccitiello","I think it's less specific than that, and Frank may -- Frank has actually provided a detailed explanation, and as Peter did on the -- their prepared comments, but I'll give you some color. I think most industry analysts were looking at the holiday quarter, the December quarter, expecting a rack of really good titles, headlined by things like a very rich and positive game coming out of Ubisoft, Assassin's Creed, Microsoft's entry, with Halo. Obviously, CoD, which is a stalwart of the industry and some of the biggest games in history. Together with strong entries like Need for Speed from EA, and the continued strength on FIFA and Madden, and expected that, that title slate would have resulted in much stronger performance that we had seen in the first half of the year, which was not supported by the same richness on the content side. Despite great games well marketed, the December quarter was weaker than we had anticipated going in. And that often happens when the consumer carries the expectation of a console transition. And another hallmark of a -- consumers behaving as if there's a transition afoot or coming, is when you start to see certain titles overperform and other titles underperform in relatively dramatic ways, and that's something else we saw in the December quarter. So when we look at that, it's both down and erratic. And now we're down and erratic and it's the end of January, and with the exception of a small title that was released from Capcom, there are no industry examples thus far this year in January that we can point to, to say, is the market up, down, or sideways, is it performing consistently with the December quarter, or is it going to trend down or up? We just don't have that information. And we're about to launch the first of 3 major packaged goods titles that will define our quarter. So we know we've got a fast boat, we just don't know how deep the water is right now. So we don't know precisely what to do with that. We're -- that's why we've widened the range a bit, to give us room to be sure we have the right answer. We think the content's great, we're anxious a little bit about the sector, and if the sector ends up a little bit smaller and more volatile, that gets us closer to the bottom end of the range, and if the sector performs better, our titles will go with it, we'll be at the upper end of the range.","Operator","Todd Mitchell from Brean Capital.","Todd T. Mitchell - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Just 2 quick questions and then a follow up. Just look, to clarify on Battlefield. Can I assume from the comments that you're dropping Medal of Honor, that you're going to annualize Battlefield? And the second question is related to the guidance for 4Q. It seems to me -- is there some kind of back end tax loading in the non-GAAP number versus what you were thinking before?","Frank D. Gibeau","I'll take the first question, this is Frank. We are not announcing an annualization of Battlefield today. What we've said is that we will be launching a Battlefield game next year, and we're very excited to show you guys more detail on that coming soon. But we're not announcing an annualization of Battlefield at this time.","Blake J. Jorgensen","And on the guidance, I think what you were asking is there some tax benefit that's in our non-GAAP numbers, and no, you're pursuing the same...","Todd T. Mitchell - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","No, just the opposite. Versus what you were thinking with your prior non-GAAP guidance for the full year, is the tax bill gone up?","Blake J. Jorgensen","No, we're assuming the same tax rate through the full year.","John S. Riccitiello","28%, right?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, 28%, so...","Todd T. Mitchell - Brean Capital LLC, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then one last question, if you don't mind. In terms of your digital initiatives, there's a lot of acquisition, a lot of internal organic building. Could you just briefly discuss in terms of what's working and what's not working? Is there areas where you intend to sort of rethinking in, retrenching some of your investments, in sort of new digital revenue streams?","John S. Riccitiello","So, this is John, I'll take that question to close out today's call. First off, what's working for us is mobile. Digital downloads of full games, although that's obviously very confident with the success of individual titles, and our PDLC business and things like FIFA Ultimate Team, Madden Ultimate Team, and that's both selectable, PC and console. So we feel very, very good about, if you will, it's really console, PC and mobile. It's both the Premium business on a download, and it's a whole bunch of free-to-play models that are working really, really well for us. So that would capture individual examples, like FIFA Ultimate Team, doing really well. That's a microtransaction-based business, mostly related to console. A big part of Battlefield Premium is related to PC. And when I say free-to-play, titles like FIFA in Korea and Japan are both free-to-play but generating very substantial revenues or The Simpsons: Tapped Out is a free-to-play micro-transaction game. If you were to try to drop a grid, it would be Premium and free-to-play titles against both mobile, PC and console, and most of the console being add-on to core titles. So that's was working well for us. Absent from that list is social. Social hasn't done as well for us, and the overall sector is significantly softer, and we'd anticipate it going forward. I think another question you were getting at and one that I think is worth answering, is yes, we have made some M&A. We've acquired a number of companies. I would argue at this point in time, we have the IT we need and the channel access we need. We feel very good about the portfolio of digital assets we have. We think we're in a position to lead digital in the West, and perhaps, with great execution over time, take that lead into Asia because we're now seeing our titles resonate there. We didn't have the strength on smartphones. We did some acquisition to get there. We had good IT. We wanted the added strength of the PvZ brand and the Bejeweled brand and we feel great about the PopCap acquisition. But net-net, we've got a, if you will, a full house with the things that are working, PC, console, mobile, free-to-play, Premium. That's a great deck of cards or a great hand, and at this point, we're not going to trade anything. We like what we've got, and we're not looking to drop.","Rob Sison","And with that, Angie, we'll wrap it up now.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's conference.

Q3 FY'16 was a great quarter for Electronic Arts. Across all key platforms, we delivered amazing new experiences for our players and live services that enabled them to play more of the games they love. Non-GAAP revenue and earnings were above our guidance for the quarter, and we are raising our full-year non-GAAP guidance as we continue our strong momentum into the final quarter of the year.","Our highlights from the holiday quarter capture how players are engaging across the increasing breadth and depth of games and services from Electronic Arts. Q3 was a breakthrough quarter for our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm on the Star Wars franchise. With Star Wars Battlefront, our team at DICE delivered a game with amazing visual fidelity, unmatched authenticity and true Star Wars action fantasies that are fun for fans of all ages. It became the largest launch ever for a Star Wars game, and exceeded our guidance for the full year. The journey is just beginning for Battlefront fans. Earlier this week, we announced our first free content update as well as the four expansion packs to come for Star Wars Battlefront, and there are many new experiences in development for every player in the growing community.","Star Wars fans are deeply engaged in our experiences on mobile and PC as well. On mobile, Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes quickly built a strong player base after it launched in November, reaching the top 5 most-downloaded iOS games in more than 130 countries. On PC, our Star Wars, The Old Republic community has grown to the highest subscriber level in nearly three years, driven by the latest digital expansion, Knights of the Fallen Empire. More great content is on the way for players in each of these experiences, as well as new Star Wars titles for multiple platforms in development across the company.","Continuing the mobile momentum, Madden NFL Mobile is a cultural hit that topped the U.S. App Store charts over the holiday period. Player engagement is thriving, with monthly active players up nearly 50% year-over-year and our live events driving two and a half times more games played over the previous year. Madden NFL Mobile continues to illustrate the opportunity for sports games on mobile devices. Just as we\u2019ve demonstrated on other platforms, great sports experiences will ignite fans\u2019 unbridled commitment to the teams and sports they love, driving deep engagement over time. Building on the success of Madden NFL Mobile, we are excited to bring more compelling EA SPORTS experiences to our players on mobile devices.","As the top game publisher on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One consoles in the western world for calendar year 2015, EA continues to captivate players with some of the world\u2019s biggest and most popular franchises. Madden NFL 16 was the number one sports title in the U.S. and FIFA 16 was the number one title across all genres in Europe for calendar year 2015. Player engagement continues to grow across our entire EA SPORTS portfolio, with monthly active players growing more than 10% year-over-year in the third quarter. And the return of Need for Speed delivered for racing car and car culture enthusiasts, with more than twice as many monthly active players in Q3 compared to our previous game.","Live services are at the core of how we help our players connect with each other and stay engaged in their favorite games longer. Our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team services continued to engage more fans year-over-year in Q3, driven in part by new experiences like FUT Draft in FIFA 16 and Draft Champions in Madden NFL 16. We also continue to see long-term engagement across Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline. In Q3, our players logged more than 150 million hours of Battlefield gameplay.","Our subscription programs represent a key opportunity to connect players to even more great games. EA Access continues to grow in subscribers, and more than 60 % of those players have used EA Access to try a game they haven\u2019t previously played. Based on the success of EA Access, we\u2019ve just launched Origin Access, expanding our subscription programs to the PC platform. Early reaction for Origin Access has been equally positive, and it\u2019s clear that our global player base sees value in this innovative approach to playing more games.","EA Access and Origin Access are great examples of how EA is working to help players with one of the more compelling challenges in entertainment today. In a world that sees more competition than ever for our players\u2019 time, we are focused on delivering services that reduce friction and barriers to discovery, allowing them to maximize the time they have to play their favorite games or try something new. Through deeper relationships, we can help more players connect to vibrant communities, access more games and content, and engage in experiences that are meaningful, personal and fun. In Q3, we captivated players with stunning new experiences and more great content for the games and services they love.","Now, I\u2019ll hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks, Andrew. EA\u2019s non-GAAP net revenue was $1.803 billion, which was $28 million above our guidance. The quarter\u2019s revenue was 26% higher than the prior year\u2019s, primarily driven by Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed, but also by growth across the breadth of our portfolio, including Ultimate Team, mobile and catalog. Star Wars Battlefront surpassed our full fiscal year guidance of 13 million units, which includes over 1 million units bundled with consoles. On a constant currency basis, revenue would have been up 35% year on year.","Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 16% year-over-year to a record $807 million, 45% of this quarter\u2019s revenue. It was also a record for the trailing twelve month period which was up 11% to $2.42 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter.","Extra content and free-to-play contributed $360 million, up 15% over the prior year. The principal driver of the growth was Ultimate Team. In particular, FIFA Ultimate Team showed strong growth, up 8% year-on-year, or 18% year-on-year at constant currency. Madden Ultimate Team and Hockey Ultimate Team also grew. Finally, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title in China and Korea, continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations.","Mobile generated 162 million in the quarter, up 17% year-on-year. Our big launch during the quarter was Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, and it has performed extremely well, a great start for our newest live service. In addition, Madden NFL Mobile was in the top three grossing apps in the U.S. on the iOS app store through the important Christmas period and peaked at number one on Christmas Day. The two join our broad portfolio of strong revenue-generating titles, which also includes SimCity BuildIt, The Sims FreePlay, The Simpsons Tapped Out, Need for Speed No Limits, and Real Racing 3","Full game PC and console downloads generated $195 million, up 39% over the prior year, driven by Star Wars Battlefront, offset by FX. Star Wars Battlefront was our largest digital launch ever, although it did lean more towards physical copies over the full quarter as holiday gift-giving became the dominant driver of purchases. Note that revenue from the large number of copies sold bundled with consoles is counted as physical revenue even though they are distributed as digital codes, and this revenue will be recognized in the fourth quarter.","Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue contributed $90 million, down 10% from last year, due to the natural decline in the recognition of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. However, EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth, and we launched a similar PC subscription service, Origin Access, in January. Our most recent update to Star Wars, The Old Republic has fueled subscriber growth with its rich content and deep story-telling.","Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 70.4%, down from last year\u2019s 72.8% and 110 basis points below our guidance. The decrease from last year was driven largely by mix, with Dragon Age: Inquisition last year compared to the royalty-bearing Star Wars Battlefront this year. We had factored into guidance our expectation that Star Wars Battlefront would be a strong gift-giving title, but it skewed even more physical than we had anticipated. The other significant driver of the margin shortfall versus guidance this quarter was also a positive, the strong performance of our royalty-bearing console and mobile games, which triggered greater royalty expenses than expected.","Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $511 million, down 10 million year-on-year, driven by FX. At constant currency, OpEx would have been up $22 million, driven chiefly by increased investment in marketing to support the bigger launches this quarter compared to a year ago.","The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.83 per share, which is $0.08 better than guidance due to our strong top line performance and continued cost management. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.23 billion, or approximately $10.42 per share. 51% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. This is down from 57% held onshore last quarter, the difference being partly driven by stock repurchases and settlements of early redemptions of our convertible notes.","During Q3, we settled 95 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through December 31, we redeemed 293 million of the 633 million total and as of yesterday we\u2019ve received notices for an additional $177 million to settle in Q4. We have updated the dilution table on our website accordingly. We also repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $126 million, leaving $672 million in our two-year $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $889 million. This is, by a significant margin, the largest quarterly operating cash flow ever generated in the history of the company and $207 million more than last year. On a trailing twelve month basis, operating cash flow was a $1.025 billion.","Turning to guidance, we expect our fourth quarter non-GAAP net revenue to be $875 million, 21 million lower than last year\u2019s. The decline is driven by the absence of last year\u2019s Battlefield Hardline, offset by Plants versus Zombies Garden Warfare 2, UFC 2 and Unravel this year. Sales of our new titles have been strong and we believe continued weakness in game sales for last generation consoles will continue to be a headwind.","Finally, we expect FX to impact sales by around $40 million in the quarter compared to last year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecast to be 76%, 60 basis points above last year\u2019s. We expect our Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $500 million, down slightly year-on-year, driven by FX and partially offset by increased investment in R&D. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share, as compared to $0.39 last year.","Our Q4 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.275 billion, as compared to $1.185 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per diluted share is expected to be $1.46, as compared to $1.19 in the prior year. I would like to highlight one item related to income taxes that is not included in this GAAP guidance. As a result of our GAAP earnings in the U.S. over the last two years, in the fourth quarter we may record a material income tax credit due to a reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance we have against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This would significantly increase our GAAP earnings per share, but would have no effect on non-GAAP earnings or cash flow.","Our Q4 outlook would result in a full-year non-GAAP revenue of $4.517 billion and non-GAAP EPS of $3.04 per share. This is an increase from our previous guidance of $4.5 billion and $3 per share respectively. Our anticipated operating margin remains at 28%. Our Q4 GAAP guidance implies full-year GAAP revenue of $4.363 billion, and fully diluted GAAP EPS of $2.23.","Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are maintaining our operating cash flow guidance at approximately $1.2 billion and free cash flow guidance of at least $1.1 billion, as capital expenditure is tracking below our 100 million estimate for the year. Despite the considerable uncertainty around the state of the world\u2019s economy, we remain confident in our ability to continue to grow earnings and cash flow.","Q3 was another strong quarter for Electronic Arts and a new high-water mark for cash generation. Our strategy is to assemble a broad portfolio of games, leveraging both wholly-owned and licensed IP. This builds a deep catalog that sells for years and provides the right balance of innovation and predictability for long-term earnings and cash flow growth.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Blake. FY'16 has been a groundbreaking year so far for Electronic Arts on so many fronts. Stunning new games, dynamic services, and new opportunities to connect and celebrate the passion for play we share with our players. Amazing game experiences begin with creativity and innovation, and we are focused on delivering that to players wherever they want to play. Leveraging the powerful Star Wars IP, we\u2019re now connected with players in live services across three games, on three platforms, and three business models.","In Star Wars Battlefront, an HD console experience, we are building a major franchise with passionate fans. In Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, a free-to-download game on mobile, we have a successful new live service. And in Star Wars: The Old Republic, we\u2019ve demonstrated the longevity of an experience that has great IP and content that continues to deliver enjoyment for our players.","In Q4, we will go live with three new titles that further reflect the creativity, innovation and variety in our experiences today. Unravel launches on February 9, bringing Yarny\u2019s journey to life in the charming and beautiful world crafted by our partners at Coldwood Interactive. On February 23, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2 goes live, with all of its over-the-top action and hilarious characters ready for new and existing fans of this beloved franchise. Then on March 15, we return to the Octagon, with EA SPORTS UFC 2 set to debut featuring new fighters, new physics and new modes for fight fans around the world.","Looking ahead to FY17, we will introduce breakthrough games from some of our biggest and most popular franchises. In Q1, we\u2019ll begin with the creative and innovative Mirror\u2019s Edge Catalyst from DICE launching in May. A great line-up of EA SPORTS titles are in development for next year, and we look forward to sharing more about these new experiences in the months ahead. An all-new Battlefield game from DICE will arrive in time for the holidays, we\u2019re excited to have a new Titanfall experience coming from our friends at Respawn and of course, Mass Effect Andromeda from the team at BioWare will launch later in the fiscal year. Players in our live services will continue to experience engaging new content, expansions and updates, and we\u2019ll have more new mobile titles as well.","Competition runs deep in the DNA of Electronic Arts, and we\u2019re thrilled to share that passion with our players through our new Competitive Gaming Division, led by Peter Moore. For years we have experienced the energy of competitive gaming through events and tournaments for our EA SPORTS and Battlefield communities. As the global gaming audience grows, we are working to deliver a best-in-class program of competitions that are accessible, engaging and entertaining at all levels, celebrating the talent and skill of our players. We are already underway, with players competing in the Madden NFL Live Challenge that culminates with the finals here in San Francisco during Super Bowl week. We\u2019re excited to have Peter and the team unveil more of our plans as we get into FY17.","From our new titles to our live services, new programs like Origin Access to new frontiers like competitive gaming, Electronic Arts continues to focus on putting our players first in everything we do. Games deliver on a fundamental human need for entertainment, and for each of us that means something unique and personal. A need to connect, to compete, to explore, to improve, to challenge, to share. We are focused on understanding these needs for every player, building stronger relationships so we can fulfill them at the right place and time, and unlocking the full potential of play through amazing new experiences. The commitment we have to our players continues to transform Electronic Arts, and galvanizes our efforts to deliver disruptive and innovative new ways to play.","Now Blake, Peter and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instruction]. Our first question is from the line of Chris Merwin.","Chris Merwin","I just had one on digital downloads, this past holiday season, with season industry data points to share the AAA launches really inflected higher in terms of digital. But digital downloads were just a bit lighter than we have expected for you. Blake I know you obviously comment of that Star Wars was a much more heavily gifted title during the holiday season, which I think makes a lot of sense, giving the younger audience. So next year when you release Battlefield 5 are you expecting to see more of an inflection in digital downloads, and is one point of gross margin expansion per year still the right target going forward?","And just a second quick question, just wondering if you would mind telling us how engagement has been trending for Star Wars relative to maybe Battlefield 4 and when we think about the DLCs you\u2019ll be selling for that title is its fair to assume that the attached rate would be comparable to that Battlefield 4? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","Sure let me start with full-game download and Andrew might want to talk a little about this Battlefield, the Battlefront engagement.","First, I\u2019ll remind you that full-game downloads generated 195 million, up 39% year-over-year. So while we might not have done as many on Star Wars as we thought we could do, that\u2019s still a big number and many of our other titles are obviously skewing heavily towards full-game downloads. Since you couldn't have got a number of that side in a quarter without that. We were surprised that more gift giving was done with Star Wars which obviously impacted the digital downloads and my guess is that that will be less so next year because Battlefront tends to skew less towards gift giving and more towards PC, there is a very hardcore PC audience as the Battlefield audience and they tends to obviously to more physical -- digital downloads than physical. So we should tend to see a return to that gross margin, guidance that we have talked about in the past. We will obviously give you detailed gross margin guidance in May for the full year. But based on what we know about the Star Wars title and gift giving we would be very surprised that we didn\u2019t shift back to the improvement in gross margin that we saw.","Andrew Wilson","And on engagement, engagement has been strong, it's been a great game to play across most of generation, so the audience is much wider than a traditional Battlefield audience which is great for us. We\u2019re introducing new people to Electronic Arts and to games and to the first person shooter genre, we have just announced our first batch of free content and our four maps that will form part of the premium service and we expect strong engagement with that going forward.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Stephen Ju.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Chris [ph] on for Steven, congrats on the quarter. Two quick questions from our end, you said you sold in 13 million units of Battlefront and the 1 million of them were bundled, wondering if you guys are seeing any excess inventory in the channel. And then can you touch a bit on what you've seen so far with Origin Access's, subscribers have the same propensity to try new games, maybe new genres that they've not played before just like EA Access?","Blake Jorgensen","So, on Origin Access feeds that we just rolled it out, so it's very early days and it's hard to get any data yet. So, more to come on that. But we -- obviously we're very excited about what we've been seeing in EA Access and that was part of the reason we decided to rollout Origin Access. It's a different group of titles because not all of our titles are PC titles. So, we'll probably see some different dynamics between players but we hope to see similar dynamics that we've seen in EA Access because it's exciting to see obviously people broaden their interest in more games than simply one franchise.","On your first question, the -- can you'll be back and just repeat again your -- what's you're looking for there?","Unidentified Analyst","Yes, so you guys, you've sold in 13 million unit Battlefront and 1 million of that was consistent in the bundles. Do you guys have any excess inventories in that channel?","Blake Jorgensen","No, we're very comfortable with where the channel is. We actually had a very strong sell-through during the quarter as well as sell-in and there are some accounts obviously that are replenishing in there -- as they get through their January timeframe and we're very comfortable with where the channel inventory is now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Colin Sebastian.","Colin Sebastian","Was wondering if you can comment on the progress of the next Titanfall and with that the overall relationship was reached on for instance, the opportunities to expand that relationship to cover other titles. And then I was hoping Peter if you could expand on the e-sports opportunity, how large you guys think this could be, how impactful could it be to the overall business over the near term and then the longer term as well, that will be helpful. Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","So, I'll take the Titanfall question. Again it's really early start talking about the details of Titanfall at this juncture and that wasn't purpose of raising it, what I would say having seen the game is it's looking fantastic, our relationship with Respawn is extremely strong, we had great fight in that entire team to build a spectacular game and are really looking forward to sharing more details in the month ahead.","Peter Moore","With regards to competitive gaming, I mean obviously we see a great opportunity going forward here, I'll remind you and I know you know this that we've been doing this for a number of years whether it\u2019s been our involvement with FIFA with the FIFA Interactive World Cup. As was mentioned in the prepared remarks we're looking forward to the finals of the Madden Challenge series at the Madden ball on Thursday night here in the Bay area, but we also see this maybe a little bit differently than maybe some of our publishing brethren, they're in the marketplace right now and we see this as a tool and a platform to increase engagement.","More and more session days with games is good for Electronic Arts, it's good for our players, we've taken a very player-first view on this and which we're building community. It's clearly an entertainment medium, I think there's a lot of excitement around it and I can't think of anybody that's better served with the diversity of our portfolio when you think about sports titles in particular, FIFA and Madden as well as our Battlefield franchise have been able to build a meaningful business over the next couple of years.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Fitz.","Unidentified Analyst","Jay [ph] in for Brian. Just another question on Star Wars, so just wondering how much of the mix shift towards physical discs, do you attribute to heavy promotional activity like GameStop\u2019s $40 sale. So, I'm just curious about how those kinds of retail promotions, how effective are they in terms of attracting new users, and just on the same subject I know you take a 20% reserve on gross revenue for each in the shipped. I'm just curious if you could quantify the impact to your P&L and GameStop who offers discounts like we saw, how's the impact -- how does this impact gross margin? Thanks.","Peter Moore","So, I'll comment firstly to this discounting in general, this is a business that in the holiday timeframe between Black Friday and Christmas is traditionally done a lot of discounting. It's a way of driving volume particularly when people are now buying -- who're buying for the first time the new console offerings often they want to build up their software inventory pretty quickly and we found the discounting helps drive people into the engagement. We obviously shared that view with the retailers and we help support the retailers in that, each year with specific programs and I think we've done that year-over-year and it really doesn't impact that.","We're also doing discounting on the digital side as we try to keep the two aligned. We don't want to have a disconnect between pricing in one area and pricing in another. And so you'll tend to see us drive volumes through discounting and it's pretty consistent year-in, year-out. I would say this year our programs were very similar to what you saw last year or similar to what we've seen with all of our other industry partners and titles that they may have had, there wasn't a lot of different between years. On the sales reserve we take the sales reserves upfront at the start of each quarter and anticipation of what our selling is going to be and we use those sales reserve during the quarter on a very formalize planned method . So all this sales get planned well in advance. We need to make sure that we have the appropriate reserves in place to help pay for those overtime. And so we will be setting up sales reserves each quarter as we go in those cannot impact margins or margins that we forecast because they\u2019re already build into the numbers.","Unidentified Analyst","Thanks and then if I could I believe that Andrew mentioned that you are attracting a new type of demographic to Star Wars, I am just wondering for any sort of color on that. What the -- who are the new players, what is the demographic breakdown look like of that game? And what types of new -- what's the new demographic your attracting to the EA trend? Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","Yes, I can take that. So what we have seen is really there is two groups that have either come for the first on or have come back to gaming. The first group is people quite frankly of my generation or my vintage, who have been gamers in the past, have for whatever reason moved away from it and particularly moved away from cool FPS shooters because they\u2019ve became very hard and complicated and quite rightly brutal to play online. They\u2019ve come back in a lot of the Star Wars IP and the commitment and the passion they have around that from their youth.","At the same time they now have kids, we are of game playing age who may not have got into the first person shooter universe yet because of the nature of the content sort of some of those games. And so we\u2019re seeing fathers and sons play, we are seeing mothers and daughters play because of the broad appeal and so the big groups that we\u2019ve added is kind of a huge demographic, it\u2019s typically younger than we have seen before as well as an older demographic that we may have had interaction with some years ago, but had lapsed out in recent years particularly from the first person shooter universe.","And we\u2019re looking now at how we continue to provide content and experience that engage those two new groups so that we maintain relationship with them overtime.","Operator","Our next question is from line of Justin Post.","Ryan Gee","This is Ryan on for Justin. First of on Star Wars congratulations on this shipments, wondering if you could talk about how demand is looking in early 4Q? And then maybe how much you expect that title to contribute either digitally or physically or combined during the quarter? And then you highlighted some of the titles that you guys are working on especially for next year, wondering how you are thinking about spacing for all those titles, Battlefield, Mass Effect, Titanfall and maybe Mirror\u2019s Edge is in there as well? ","And then lastly, just going to the digital in the mix shift, is it fair to say that really this digital mix shift away from full-game download is one time in nature and just really the specific Star Wars titled, or is there any reason for us you think that EA won\u2019t continue to see the benefit on the margin side from the industry going digitally and in into 4Q and then in this fiscal '17?","Blake Jorgensen","I don\u2019t think there is any indications of that, this mix shift isn\u2019t anything about a Star Wars, Battlefront opportunity remember the movie was out. All things Star Wars for the month of December and it was the perfect gift giving opportunity. And typically with gift someone wants to have a package under a tree or and a gift pile somewhere versus that digital code and that was the driver of the shift.","We could see when we do the next Battlefront, we could see something like that but we have no idea on exact timing for ourselves for the industry and exactly how the buzz around Star Wars will be when that comes again the next time around. So right now I would say nothing would imply to us that the digital journey is slowing in any way. And in fact if we look all of our non-Star Wars products every one of them we\u2019re up, digitally and full-game download and the digital engagement associated with. If you look at Ultimate Teams specific we gave you, that\u2019s a clear sign that people are planning and engaging longer and longer around the titles.","In terms of guidance, guidance on Star Wars, we not going to breakdown individual guidance, obviously we will end up selling more than the 13 million units since we\u2019ve already got there. We did sell more in the third quarter, so we may ultimately sell in the fourth quarter than we originally part. But we\u2019ll clearly sell more overall and that\u2019s build into our guidance for the fourth quarter.","I\u2019ll remind people about fourth quarter though, don\u2019t forget that there was a continued FX headwinds, headwind that we called out that\u2019s $40 million of headwinds, I\u2019m not sure everyone\u2019s modeling that into their models. And we\u2019re not ignoring the fact that there is an economic headwind out there around the world that hasn't really impacted us, but we\u2019re being conservative when we give our guidance around watching that closely.","In terms of next year's guidance, the title slate that we talked about are the core titles along within traditional sport titles. The one thing to note is Q1 the only title we have in Q1 is Mirror\u2019s Edge, plus all of our catalog business and live services business. But our core console title will be Mirror\u2019s Edge and if you are doing -- we\u2019ll give you real full year guidance in May when we sit down to do the next earnings call, but as you starting to think about guidance for Q1 in next year don't forget about the continued FX headwinds which are impacting us as well as in Q1 one specific item, remember that last year in Q1 we had a $30 million benefit, one-time benefit from FIFA Online 3 as we started that up and we had deferred revenue all into Q1. So, that was high profit revenue that came into Q1. Couple of basic things for your model but things to remember.","But we're excited about the rest of the slate, you should assume that a Battlefield would come typically in the third quarter when we normally have it, we're not yet announcing when Titanfall or Mass Effect Andromeda will come, but you should assume that\u2019s in the back half of the year as well because of second quarter is so dominated by our sports titles.","Ryan Gee","And then if I can add one last follow-up, it's a nice pickup in mobile revenue, do you guys happen to have an updated MAU figure that you could share?","Blake Jorgensen","We don't, but we probably will in the next quarter.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Arvind Bhatia.","Arvind Bhatia","A couple of questions, one I know you guys touched on Madden NFL Mobile, did really well this quarter, wondering what are some of the learning's Andrew, in particular that maybe you could apply to FIFA Mobile and other titles specifically. And then wondering if you guys are willing to share the mix of full game, digital downloads on some of the key titles during the quarter. And for any of you I guess just reluctant thoughts on virtual reality and your efforts there currently? Thank you.","Andrew Wilson","I'll take the Madden Mobile one, as we think about all of our mobile games, you really think about them on four vectors; discovery, how someone will find the title whether that's through an App Store or through social representation, on boarding, how someone will get into the title, the games like mechanic itself, so actually what do you do while you're playing the game and then how that how do we run the servers that actually surrounds that game to make it new and interesting, fun and dynamic, and engaging on a moment-to-moment day-to-day basis. As we look at what we've done with Madden NFL Mobile over the last couple of years you will have seen we\u2019ve fundamentally overhauled all four of those vectors since we first launched Madden on mobile devices.","We now believe we have landed in a place that has a game that is very social in nature, has a game that onboard the new players and a broad demographic of players, we have a game mechanic that feels right for mobile devices and our change of delivering live events that's tied to the passion of players have for the real world of the NFL and a very engaging forum on an ongoing basis. But during the weekend games and the week leading up to those games, all of those opportunities present learning for us as we take these types of things to our other sports games on mobile and we expect to be able to do well in those areas.","Blake Jorgensen","Arvind your second question was about trends in full game downloads, we clearly continue to see them trending upwards, we see titles running anywhere between 20% and 30% plus, we've always seen FIFA skew lower because in Europe many retailers use that as a loft leader to drive traffic into their stores and that tends to be a physical copy, but in the rest of our sports portfolio we tend to see strong digital full game, really Star Wars was the only Gen4 title than indexed lower than average because of the gift-giving issues. So, we're very comfortable with continuation of where that trend is going industry wide.","Arvind Bhatia","And then on VR?","Andrew Wilson","Sorry, virtual reality, sorry, the context of VR?","Arvind Bhatia","Just wondering if your -- what's your investments are currently and how you're viewing sort of the opportunity this year and perhaps for the next couple of years, if you have any titles currently in development and any early thoughts there?","Andrew Wilson","Sure, and I\u2019ll echo what we've talked about on some previous calls which is we believe that VR is going to be an important part of that industry. We do believe it's a number of years out before it's a meaningful part of our industry but right now we're investing at a core engine level, we've talked about Frostbite as we move to a single engine for the company and that team is working to ensure that they can output virtual reality experiences regardless of device. And then we have a few key game teams around the company who are doing targeted experiments as it relates to very engaging virtual reality experiences in the context of particular genres. I would expect that we would start to surface some of those over the coming years. And that we would start to build that into a more fully fledged experience over time.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Mike Olson.","Mike Olson","You had an obviously big launch with Star Wars in the quarter, and no doubt that had some marketing and other expenses. And yet the overall OpEx was basically down year over year, so the cost containment efforts continue to remain strong. How do you think about OpEx going forward with a lot of these incremental titles coming in fiscal 2017? Is there a reason to think that OpEx will start to creep higher? Is that kind of a reasonable multi-year run rate going forward where we are at this year?","Andrew Wilson","I think peer dollar OpEx is got -- we\u2019ve got an benefit this year of FX on our OpEx line because many of our studios are outside the U.S. so we have a large base obviously in Sweden, in Canada, in Romania, in Australia, many in China, many of those have obviously coming at lower dollar cost. We try to report each quarter with the actual dollar costs are and you\u2019ve seen some continued investments. Our goal to try to keep R&D expenses around to 22% to 23% of revenue line, which means even if our revenues is growing, we\u2019re clearly continuing to invest in R&D we think that\u2019s very important for our future.","You will see marketing expenses bounced around depending on the title and the quarter. So this quarter our marketing expenses were up in -- if you\u2019ve -- FX adjust them and that was driven by the factor that we had a fairly large title this year that we didn\u2019t have in year's third quarter. This year's Star Wars is obviously last year our large title was Battlefront Hardline in the fourth quarter. Until you get some of that timing differences but you\u2019ll continue to see general increases in our OpEx with goal to try to target, R&D around the 22% to 23%, we\u2019re trying to push marketing expenses down into the 13% range and hold G&A in that 8% to 7% range if possible.","So that\u2019s you\u2019re going to see as a percentage revenue and hopefully will continue to be reflected in our business going forward.","Mike Olson","Okay. And then just one quick one. Is there any detail you can give on the timing of the first monetized Star Wars expansion pack? Is that in the month of March, and if so, can you say that early or late in the month?","Andrew Wilson","I can\u2019t tell you much more than March, but I would assume that much of that revenue will probably fall in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter but it\u2019s hard to see right now.","Mike Olson","Okay. That answers the question. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Drew Crum.","Drew Crum","So Ultimate Team up 13% in the quarter, it seems like an impressive number, given the comp. And I think you guys had some pull-forward recognized in the second quarter. So what is Ultimate Team up year to date and can you comment on the expectations on Ultimate Team going forward? And then I have a follow-up.","Blake Jorgensen","Yes, I don\u2019t have the year-to-date number with me here. But it's fairly consistent with what it was in the quarter, just off the top of my head and we\u2019re continuing to see that. Remember we had a slowdown in FIFA Ultimate Team in the fourth quarter last year as we put the price banding and to address the inflation in the market place issue that we saw. We are currently forecasting that we will have a stronger fourth quarter that we did last year. Because obviously we corrected some those price and coin farming issues. So we should continue to see strong growth of Ultimate Team through the year and probably for the full year clearly exceed because it's a lean last quarter last year.","But clearly the business continues to grow and we done a good job of bringing new users in. So we\u2019re not taxing the existing users, but it gets harder and harder to grow the business at the size that it\u2019s at. So we\u2019ll see what it looks like for next year. The other thing to really remember as you\u2019re looking at it is realize that a huge portion of the ultimate team audience for FIFA is outside the U.S. large markets like France, Germany, UK and so all of those markets have a headwind from FX in them that we\u2019re clearly seeing in the growth numbers.","So as I mentioned today 18% on a constant currency basis for ultimate team or for FIFA and that\u2019s a pretty impressive growth rate on a business of that size.","Drew Crum","Got it. Okay, thanks. And aspirational number on R&D as a percentage of revenue, how important is culling less profitable or non-profitable titles in the portfolio? Do you have an opportunity to do that going forward? How you think about limiting the number of SKUs going forward? Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","We are down to less than 15 majors SKUs, and that feels like a good size of the business and we are obviously announcing that we\u2019re investing in some action base SKUs by bringing people like Jade Raymond and Amy Hennig into our organization to help build those and those are obviously a few years out in our SKU plan, but clearly we want to try grow genre and grow our revenue based with more titles both digital live services titles as well as traditional console titles.","Part of -- to do that part of it we have to be restless that we don\u2019t spend a lot of money on smaller titles, we size them correctly, but we also want to continue to look for ways to bring new interesting titles to the market. Look at Unravel as a perfect case of that. We are trying to address the market place for broader titles addressing wider audience in terms of the types they are and the types of games people want to play. We are also trying to build enough product to be able to effectively run subscription based businesses and the requires a great portfolio which we have and we'll continue to add to. So, we'll always cull but there's not a certain things that cut back on today because we've brought the total number of titles down to a very perfect level for us now.","Operator","Our next is from the line of Ben Schachter.","Ben Schachter","So there's been a lot of pretty positive commentary, including Star Wars beating and getting reorders in 4Q, but then you don't see that really flow through for the fiscal year guidance. I was wondering if you could just talk more about why, and is it all weakness in prior gen, is it all FX, is there anything else going on there that we should know about.","Secondly, FIFA in China, can you just talk about how meaningfully we should be thinking about that business for FY2017? And then finally, of course, I have to ask another VR question. And understanding that is not going to be meaningful for a number of years, is it possible that we will get any of those what you've defined the VR experiments or small experiences, any chance we will get those in calendar 2016?","Blake Jorgensen","Ben, I guess I would remind people that we did raise full year guidance, that's the third time this year we've raised full year guidance, we've got a track record I think of 10 quarters in a row of beating our guidance. I think we've exhibited some conservative in how we operate the business which we think is the prudent thing to do and we're sitting with FX headwinds and a lot of uncertainty in the economy. You put all that together, I don't think that signals anything negative about the fourth quarter, it signals the way we've been approaching the business and operating the business and that's what we're going to continue to do.","In terms of FIFA Online 3 in China, the key there is we're continuing to see very positive reactions, but we also have a very long-term view there. So, that continued level that we've talked about 10 million to 15 million a quarter is still consistent with where we are and when we do give you guys guidance in the May timeframe, we'll update that number if it looks like it should be updated, but all is very positive in that and our partner TenCent continues to be extremely happy.","With that maybe I'll let Andrew hit the VR question, to say more to say of that we already said but.","Andrew Wilson","Not a lot more to say at this point, no announcement as to launch times or servicing the experiments at this stage, but as we go into calendar '16 as we start to come closer to our EA play events in LA and in London we'll be talking more about our full title slide and some of the new in development products that we have running it across our studios right now.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Neil Doshi.","Neil Doshi","Two questions. Blake, can you talk a little bit about the macro environment and kind of what you guys are seeing as we move into calendar 2016? And then secondly, we've noticed -- I think Amazon announced that they are putting out a promotion for Prime members. So every time a large AAA game it goes up for sale on preorder, a couple weeks after, they're going to give a pretty hefty 20% discount. Can you talk about whether you guys are helping to fund that or if that's something that Amazon is just kind of taking on their own? And how you think that could potentially impact digital sales, since those are primarily for physical discs. Thanks.","Blake Jorgensen","On a macro environment we've mentioned a couple of times our cautioned because of the macro environment, we have not seen anything in our business or heard anything from other players in the business that would imply any economic slowdown in entertainment software. I then say we have a level of conservatism about the, just the global economy which at some point in time there is trouble in the global economy that would impact everybody probably.","I think our business seems to be operating pretty consistent as it has been over the last couple of years. The console purchases are up through the end of calendar year '15, our estimate is 55 million units out there which has exceeded virtually everyone's forecast for the year and now almost 50% higher than previous console cycle so, all of that is very-very positive, all the game play we're seeing and the engagement and things like Ultimate Team we're seeing is positive. We\u2019re just conscious of the fact that there's a lot of storm clouds out there, we want to be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves or the economy in our forecast for the business and that's what you're hearing.","The second part of the question was the Amazon issue, we do not fund the Amazon discount, that comes out of Amazon\u2019s own pocket and I think that's fairly consistent how Amazon operates and we don't have much say or view on pricing of anyone in the marketplace, that's their job not our job. For us if it brings new game players into the business then we're excited, but we don't really have much more to say or control over their pricing strategy.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Doug Creutz.","Doug Creutz","You guys announced your EA Play event a few days ago and obviously you made the interesting decision to not have a booth on the floor of E3 this year. Just curious as to your thinking about why do that? If I recall, one of your major competitors made a similar decision several years ago, ultimately decided it was not the way to go. Is there anything that's changed that's led you to that decision? Thanks.","Andrew Wilson","So, what we're seeing is more and more we need to be close to our player. And what you have seen from last couple of years in almost all of our actions whether it relates to development or marketing or sales is attempts by us and endeavors by us to get as close as possible to our players and get direct feedback from them. We believe that\u2019s the single best way to ensure that we are making games that they want to play. And then we\u2019re making some of the best games in the industry. And we see this as an opportunity to do just that get close to our players, invite them in an environment where they feel comfortable to play games, give us feedback. And interact socially as they do whether through social networks or with their friend or what have you.","We continue to be member of the ESA and we will have meeting rooms at E3 this year. So what we see we\u2019re doing is augmenting the overall E3 experience. And we are excited by what we\u2019re going to be able to do as it relates to EA Play and we are excited for what the industry is going to be able to do as it relates to E3 more broadly.","Blake Jorgensen","And to add to that we are also doing a simultaneous events in London and so in some ways we are trying to do a more geographically spread way to introduce people to our new product.","Operator","Our next last question is from the line of Eric Handler.","Eric Handler ","Thanks for taking my question just under the wire there. Two things for you, first, with Star Wars, obviously you are not making a Star Wars movie game, but you got nice leverage off of The Force Awakens this December. How are you thinking about what you can do with Star Wars Battlefront next December, when the first spinoff movie comes out, Rogue One. Is there much you can do around that to keep monetization levels high?","And then secondly, looking at your mobile business, after the first two quarters of the year, mobile is really stagnant. You got strong growth in the third quarter with Madden and Star Wars. I'm just seeing as we think about the mobile business going forward, is this sort of the inflection point where we start seeing some reacceleration of revenue or [Audio Gap] sustainable is the improvements there? Or maybe talk about some of your plans with mobile.","Blake Jorgensen","So I\u2019ll start with Star Wars, I don\u2019t know Andrew might want to chime in mobile piece. On Star Wars, the one thing that we are adhering to, and I think this is part of our arrangement with Lucas and Disney, is you can't make a game in Star Wars that violates the canon of Star Wars mainly you can't take something from the future and bring it back into the past unless it's a reference. Not knowing yet exactly what the storyline in Rogue One is going to be, I can't comment on how that could come in to the extent that it's in the future around our current Battlefront game is also a paced based on the historical Star Wars canon, which is 30 years before the most recent movie than will limit our ability to bring some new content into that. But more to come there obviously, we\u2019re trying to stay tightly connected to the Star Wars beat for future movies and we we\u2019ll obviously in future Star Wars games be able to tap to new characters and vehicles and so far. But in our current game and for that manner the DLC associated with that current game obviously we\u2019ll have to be careful that we don\u2019t violate the cannon.","On mobile, obviously mobile the one thing remember is like our console business, mobile will always be a little choppy based on when new title come at. But like most live services they should be smoother than the historical beats around console business. So overtime it helps to smooth that out, but there is still maybe some jumps up and then do the quarters.","Andrew Wilson","Yes on the Star Wars play, I\u2019ll just to add a little. I mean what we have seen is that the movie or the content of the movie itself hasn't impeded the engagement in various Star War games. We have seen that across console PC and the mobiles. And we would expect that as more great Star Wars films come out, we would see more great engagement in Star Wars content more broadly again not just in Battlefront but in Star Wars The Old Republic and our mobile game Galaxy of Heroes.","As we think about mobile, just to add to Blake\u2019s point I think he\u2019s absolutely right. The one other thing that we would point to is as we look at our mobile portfolios our titles typically have very long life spans. The Sims FreePlay, The Simpsons Tapped Out, Real Racing 3 have continued to grow over a number of years. And as we think about launching new titles, we\u2019re taking a little more time and being a little bit more calculated about how we launch, but we\u2019re doing so with a view that we are putting experiences into the market place that will live for many years and drive engagement and profitability for a number of years to come. And so as we look at the year to come, as we look at what we\u2019ve done with Star Wars and Madden and some other titles that are coming again to shoot. Our expectation is that we\u2019re able to grow the overall business with them.","Andrew Wilson","Alright thank you everyone.

With me on the call today is John Riccitiello, our CEO; Ken Barker, Interim CFO; Peter Moore, COO; and Frank Gibeau, our President of Labels, who'll be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call and a transcript.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding the future events and the future financial performance of the company.

Riccitiello","Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon. I'd like to start with a short review of our recent history before addressing our FY '12 performance, our FY '13 guidance and turning the call over to Ken Barker. For those on the call, I might suggest you take a look at the slides we've posted on our website. They'll help you track this a little bit better, particularly the last few years review I'm about to do now. ","As all of you know, these past few years have been very dynamic for companies competing in the fast-changing game industry. 4 years ago, we set out to turn around our core console game business while transforming EA from a packaged goods company to a truly global digital pure play. Throughout this time, we never lost our ambition to position EA as a global leader in digital in the same way we led the packaged goods market during the PS2 era. ","4 years ago, our strategies could be described as essentially defensive, mostly about our turnaround and getting a start in digital. At the time, we had 3 strategies: fewer, better and bigger console games; getting started in digital; managing costs. The numbers show we've done these things very well. ","On our last earnings call, we introduced a significant change in our strategies, a shift to offense, one that will complete our transformation into a digital pure play company, one that will move us from being a top 5 global competitor in digital gaming to becoming the global leader. ","Today, our 3 strategies are brands, platform, talent. By brands, we mean that we have the strongest brand portfolio in the game industry. We will project that portfolio across all relevant digital business models and channels while continuing to invest to grow the power of our brands. Leading the way for EA are blockbusters like Battlefield, Need for Speed, FIFA, Plants vs. Zombies, Bejeweled, Star Wars, Madden, The Sims, Dragon Age, SimCity, Mass Effect and Medal of Honor. We strongly believe this brand collection is unmatched by any competitor in our industry. ","By platform, we mean we are building the underlying technology that enables us to project our brands across all digital channels and business models, seamlessly, direct to consumer, and do so in ways that vastly enhances the consumer experience. Technologies like our Nucleus system with nearly 0.25 billion registered users, ensure we can recognize and serve content to our players no matter where they are, on a social network or a console. ","These investments enabled us to launch Origin, our direct-to-consumer service for downloading games and connecting players with other gamers and friends. Origin is now the #2 direct-to-consumer game service with more than 11 million registered users. ","And we built EA Play4Free, a proprietary platform that is modeled on the Asian companies like Tencent and Nexon. EA Play4Free now hosts a number of EA brands including Need for Speed and Battlefield and has become one of our fastest-growing businesses. We will be adding more brands to this platform in the coming years. ","Our third strategic initiative is talent. This is an unusual strategy for a game company. For most, talent is a consideration. For us, it is a core strategy. Streaming into EA today is an incredible torrent of new talent. People who add to our capabilities and make us more like Google, Facebook and yes, Zynga. This talent is creating and maintaining our most sophisticated online services. In some cases, it is veteran EA talent that is learning new skills. In other cases, it is new talent coming from key tech companies and great universities. ","2 great examples of the new talent are 2 leaders now on my executive team. Kristian Segerstrale, the founder of Playfish, is now EA's EVP Digital. He is assembling a team of quantitative analysts, technologists and Internet marketers who will profoundly change the way we acquire, engage and monetize consumer game play. Rajat Taneja, recently from Microsoft, is now EA's CTO. Rajat's team is building a deep infrastructure for creating and playing our games on every device. You will be hearing more about these projects from both Kristian and Rajat at EA's E3 investor breakfast.","We're also doubling down on our creative talent, the creative teams that build our games. People who add a special magic that differentiates great entertainment from just ordinary games, great games so emotionally engaging that consumers identify with the heroes and have fierce debates over the endings. Storylines that create controversy because the audience, our players, care. Talent that creates games and build brands that will win the test of time. We don't see any competitor doing both the tech and art in the way our people do. ","So those are our 3 strategies: brands, platform, talent, all designed to help us accelerate our transformation to being the leading pure play digital gaming company. And over the last few years, we've shown great progress towards this goal. Let me call out a few of these milestones. ","In fiscal '09, we published 67 packaged goods products, each, generally speaking, a stand-alone game. In fiscal '12, we published 25 major branded online game services, each online multiplayer experience with ongoing monetization. We have increased our database of Nucleus registered users from 27 million to 220 million. We built a $1.2 billion digital business, establishing EA as one of the top 5 largest global digital game companies. In doing this, we delivered a revenue CAGR of 47% from fiscal '10 to fiscal '12, and most of this growth was organic. ","We developed the strongest brand portfolio in digital interactive entertainment, and most recently added PopCap brands like Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled to our own incredible brand like Battlefield, Medal of Honor, Need for Speed, FIFA Soccer, The Sims and SimCity. ","Our Origin platform, which generated $150 million in revenue in fiscal '12 and is poised for strong ongoing growth, leverages both EA content and that of our partners. We transformed our financials from an EPS loss in fiscal '09 to $0.85 EPS in fiscal '12. From fiscal '10 to fiscal '12, a 39% EPS CAGR, and we're just getting started. ","With that, I'd like to turn to our fiscal '12 review. Both fiscal '12 and our most recent quarter were very strong for EA. In Q4, we delivered $0.17 EPS, at the upper end of our guidance and ahead of the Street despite key challenges like the failure of a major retailer just prior to the launch of one of our major titles, Mass Effect 3. For the full of fiscal '12, we exceeded our top line guidance and came in at the upper end of our EPS guidance at $0.85, up over 20% on EPS versus a strong fiscal '11. ","There are a few milestones I'd like to point out that help drive our fiscal '12. We exceeded our $1 billion goal for overall digital revenue, delivering a plan-beating total of $1.2 billion in digital revenue. Star Wars: The Old Republic was the most successful subscription MMO launch in history and is now firmly established as the #2 MMO in the West. The service is extremely strong on the operations level. ","We did what we said we'd do with Battlefield. Battlefield 3 took very significant share from the leading competitor, on its way to being one of the biggest selling titles in EA history. There will be exciting new developments for the Battlefield brand as fiscal '13 progresses. ","EA SPORTS FIFA reached new heights as a brand and a game service. Today, FIFA is probably the most successful brand in our industry in terms of serving more users across more channels and business models than any other brand from EA or from any of our competition and it's all tied together in one cohesive service. And we brought PopCap into EA and with them, an incredibly talented group of creators with a great collection of strong brands including Plants vs. Zombies and Bejeweled. ","Next, I'd like to turn to our FY '13 guidance. The key considerations for our FY '13 plan, as it came together these past months, are these: at the foundation is another year of blockbuster brands, Madden NFL, FIFA, SimCity, Medal of Honor, Dead Space and Need for Speed, as well as mobile hits like The Simpsons, Tapped Out and Bejeweled. Versus my original expectations, we are pushing out one major packaged goods title. This is a function of our R&D investment priorities. ","Star Wars: The Old Republic now has 1.3 million subscribers with a much higher mix of ongoing credit card consumers but on a lower absolute number of subs. The service is stable, profitable, and we have strong plans to grow it in fiscal '13. We intend to invest $80 million in Gen 4 console development in fiscal '13. We are strong believers that console will return to strong growth and represent a great opportunity, one that is in lockstep with our digital plan. ","We're expecting another year of 40% growth in our digital business. Growth in these very high-margin contributors allows us to afford our investments and in particular our investments in Gen 4, while delivering very strong earnings growth. ","Our guidance, which Ken will take you through in a moment, calls for over 30% EPS growth in fiscal '13, off our strong fiscal '12. We're projecting to have another great year. ","I will now turn the call over to Ken.","Kenneth A. Barker","Thanks, John. Starting with a review of Q4. EA's overall performance was in line with the guidance we provided on our last earnings call. Total Q4 non-GAAP revenue was $977 million. We came in slightly ahead of the top end of our guidance due to the successful launches of Mass Effect 3, FIFA Street 4 and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning and the continued momentum of FIFA 12 and Battlefield 3. ","As you may recall, in early March, we indicated that the financial troubles of The GAME Group in the U.K. could cost us mid single-digit EPS for Q4. While that came to pass, we were able to offset some of this as revenue exceeded our March expectations in both packaged goods and digital as consumers were determined to get their hands on our products, especially Mass Effect 3. ","EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital revenue increased approximately 60% year-over-year to $425 million, and for fiscal '12 exceeded $1.2 billion. Digital growth came from all areas of the business as we continue to see success in each of our initiatives. For the quarter, extra content and free-to-play were up 37% last year led by FIFA. We passed an important milestone this year in which FIFA 12 became our first packaged goods title to generate more than $100 million in non-GAAP digital revenue. ","And Battlefield 3 is on track to break the same milestone. I'd like to highlight that this is happening while packaged goods revenue for these titles is increasing relative to their prior iterations. The Sims Social and PopCap also contributed to our digital growth. On a stand-alone basis, PopCap saw double-digit growth this quarter as compared to the same period a year ago and was accretive to our Q4 results. ","Full game downloads were up 76% year-over-year. Origin contributed $48 million of non-GAAP revenue fueled by Mass Effect 3, Star Wars: The Old Republic and revenue generated from our third-party publishing relationships. ","Mobile and other handheld non-GAAP digital revenue was up 23% year-over-year. This quarter, we saw continued growth in our smartphone and tablet revenue as well as in our Asia mobile business. This growth offset a decline in standard feature phones. 72% of the quarter's non-GAAP revenue in this category came from smartphones as non-GAAP revenue from smartphones grew more than 80% year-over-year. The 143% growth in subscriptions, advertising and other revenue was driven by the December launch of Star Wars: The Old Republic. ","Let me provide you with an update on Star Wars. Through the end of the quarter, approximately 2.4 million units have sold through. In our last call, we indicated that we have 1.7 million active subscribers. And as of the end of April, we now have 1.3 million, with a substantial portion of the decrease due to casual and trial players cycling out of the subscriber base, driving up the overall percentage of paying subscribers. ","We have already launched a number of initiatives designed to grow subscription. Initial responses have been positive, and we are encouraged by the gaming community's reaction. In summary, we delivered an extraordinary launch of a solidly profitable long-term franchise, which contributed to both our gross and operating margin improvement in fiscal '12. We expect this title will further expand our margins in fiscal '13 as we get the full year benefit of subscription revenue. ","Let me give you 2 additional points of perspective as it relates to our current subscriber base and its impact on our fiscal '13 guidance. First, the current number of active subscribers, 1.3 million, is very consistent with the original assumptions that we made when we acquired BioWare in 2008. Second, while this franchise is very profitable, it only represents a mid-single-digit percent of our total profitability in fiscal '13. ","Moving on to gross margins. As compared to our guidance, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was down a couple of percentage points because of a heavier mix of lower margin titles such as Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning and stronger catalog. OpEx came in slightly lower than our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.17 for the quarter, higher than the midpoint of our guidance. ","Turning to cash. Our cash, short-term investments and marketable securities at the end of the year was $1.8 billion or approximately $5.78 per share. Roughly half of this amount was held offshore. Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $287 million. This was driven by our solid results and continued focus on operating efficiencies, such as reducing our inventory balance and increasing inventory turns to 22x on a trailing 12-month basis, the highest level we've seen in the last 7 years. Operating cash flow for the year was $277 million, slightly higher than our forecasted $250 million. ","During the quarter, EA repurchased 14.1 million shares at a cost of $241 million. We also repurchased another 4.3 million shares in April at a cost of $71 million. Accordingly, the $600 million share repurchase program has been completed. Since inception of the program, we retired a total of 32 million shares. ","Looking back at fiscal '12, we delivered great results that were in line or above the original non-GAAP guidance we provided last May with over performance in many areas that offset retailer challenges in Europe, a delayed Star Wars launch, PopCap integration and a debt financing. In summary, fiscal '12 was an excellent year in which EA has its third consecutive year of at least double-digit non-GAAP operating margin and earnings growth. We look forward to continuing this momentum into fiscal '13. ","Turning to guidance. Rather than walk you through the P&L and give line-by-line guidance, we have laid out all of the pertinent GAAP and non-GAAP data points in the earnings release and in our slide deck. Overall, based on the midpoint of our guidance, we look to deliver non-GAAP EPS growth of more than 30% in fiscal '13, driven by an increase in non-GAAP revenue, further gross profit and operating margin expansion, all of which are a result of our digital initiatives. ","GAAP revenue is expected to be $4.075 billion, relatively flat to prior year. GAAP loss for the fiscal year is expected to be between $0.36 and $0.16 per share. Please note that a significant driver of the GAAP loss in fiscal '13 is a projected $225 million increase in our deferred revenue balance for online-enabled packaged goods due to the phasing of our release schedule this year and a likely increase in the period over which we will be recognizing revenue for GAAP purposes. As we've stated before, this is only an issue on the timing of recognition, not collectability, and has no impact on non-GAAP earnings or cash flows. ","With regard to non-GAAP revenue, our PC and console revenue will be fueled by 14 excellent packaged goods titles, each of which will have significant digital offerings. We expect to see continued growth in virtually all areas, utilizing our brands effectively across mobile, social, Play4Free, console and PC. ","In addition to the multiple digital titles we already support, we expect to launch 41 new titles across social, mobile and Play4Free. Non-GAAP digital revenue will be increasing to close to 40% of EA's total non-GAAP revenue in fiscal '13. We see a point not far in the future when digital revenue will be more than half of EA's total revenue. ","The increased mix towards digital revenue will have a positive effect on our long-term gross margins. In the short term, we expect non-GAAP gross margins to increase by roughly 1% in fiscal '13. ","OpEx. We expect to keep OpEx relatively flat as compared to fiscal '12. As we always do, we took a critical look at our spending. We made some difficult decisions to reduce our spend on the current generation packaged goods front, and this approach allows us to make the necessary incremental investment in our digital platforms and technologies. ","In addition, in fiscal '13, we will be investing approximately $80 million towards Gen 4 technologies to be well positioned to take advantage of this future opportunity. As a result of this focus to accelerate our digital transformation, we will be implementing a small restructuring program that will result in eliminating positions and terminating licenses that do not align with the strategy. ","In summary, for fiscal '13, on a non-GAAP basis, total revenue is expected to grow driven by another year of growth in digital revenue, partially offset by a decline in packaged goods. The increased mix in digital revenue will drive an increase in non-GAAP gross margins. The combination of higher gross margins and solid cost management should positively impact operating margin, allowing us to deliver over 30% growth in non-GAAP EPS based on the midpoint of our guidance. ","A few other housekeeping items. PopCap is expected to deliver double-digit non-GAAP EPS in fiscal '13, consistent with our statement last July. CapEx is forecasted to be about $100 million for the year, down from $172 million in fiscal '12. This reflects investments in our digital platforms and technologies. ","Headcount. As of March, our headcount was roughly 9,200, with about 70% of that in R&D, and we expect to increase total headcount to 9,700 by the end of fiscal '13.","Litigation. In Q4, we booked a $27 million accrual related to a potential settlement of an ongoing litigation matter. This nonrecurring charge has been excluded from our non-GAAP results. And perhaps most importantly, we expect to generate operating cash flows of at least $400 million in fiscal '13, up over 40% versus fiscal '12. ","Lastly, I'd like to provide some context to our Q1 guidance and the revenue phasing for the full year. Our Q1 non-GAAP digital revenue will continue to grow year-over-year, particularly given the benefit of a full quarter of Star Wars: The Old Republic, a continued momentum in microtransactions and digital services. This quarter, we expect to launch 11 digital titles and 1 packaged goods title. ","As we look to revenue and earnings phasing for the rest of the year, I'd like to remind you that the revenue impact from some of our digital launches, particularly in social and mobile, is much greater in quarters subsequent to launch. This has the effect of increasing revenue and earnings towards the back half of fiscal '13 similar to fiscal '12. We also expect to see our second quarter non-GAAP earnings to at least double on a year-over-year basis. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Peter Moore.","Peter R. Moore","Thanks, Ken. Today, I'm going to provide some context and proof points to the strategic priorities John laid out: brands, platform and talent. Each of these reinforces how EA's digital business has grown and evolved. ","I'll start with our brands and one that I'm very familiar with and that's FIFA Soccer. The world's most popular sports video game is in position to scale to an even larger audience online. Our vision for the future is multiplatform gaming, anytime, anywhere, a day when EA SPORTS FIFA will recognize players across any device and store their achievements, rewards and community status in the cloud. Next month's E3, you'll see FIFA 13 take a huge step toward that goal. ","In Asia, FIFA Online 2 is a micro-transaction-based free-to-play game with more than 28 million registered players. In Korea alone, an astonishing 8 million people, a huge percentage of our target audience in that nation, have registered to play. In fact, our internal estimates suggest that as many as 80% of Korean males aged 16 to 19 have played this game. In November, FIFA World Class Soccer launched on the GREE network in Japan and became the top ranking third-party title on that system. It had $1 million day last week and has racked up $30 million in just 5 months. ","FIFA Ultimate Team, a fully digital service which allows players to build teams and trade players, does not show up on the retail charts, but was our second best-selling offering in the U.K. last year. Let me say that one more time: our second highest-grossing product never appears on the retail tracking charts. ","With content downloads and cross-platform identity and rewards, FIFA is pioneering much of our thinking about the connected brand universe. In fact, all of EA's core brands are developing similar ecosystems and affinity with players. SimCity, one of EA's most beloved global brands, is returning this year to PCs and mobile devices. The new game will be always on, always connected. SimCity was unveiled at GDC this spring and received a tremendous response from fans. Additionally, our Maxis label is planning a big social title which is scheduled for release this quarter. ","Our Battlefield brand has been pushing the edge of online combat for 10 years, and along the way assembling a huge community with tremendous expectations. As we predicted, Battlefield 3 took market share last year, and more importantly, millions of players are still online, deeply engaged in this game. Battlefield Play4Free, a game with great graphics and a rapidly growing community, is a substantial business generating solid revenue. ","Need for Speed is another brand with a great reputation and millions of committed fans around the world. 2 years ago, the breakthrough Autolog feature brought the community online to set up matches, establish leaders, swap cars and share video with the most spectacular wins and crashes. And Need for Speed World is another title-generating impressive revenue on our Play4Free platform. ","Our PopCap studio is home to many of the most powerful brands in casual gaming. Since joining EA last year, PopCap has been innovating and growing. In December, they shipped the new iOS adaptation of Bejeweled, which quickly became EA's top grossing game on the Apple App Store. Their free-to-play games are showing good ARPU on mobile, and they doubled their Facebook footprint with 2 new games, Solitaire Blitz and Lucky Gem Casino. And in the months ahead, you can count on new iterations of PopCap franchises like Bejeweled and Plants vs. Zombies. PopCap's financial performance is tracking with our expectations, and we couldn't be happier they're on our team. ","Next, I would like to address our platform strategy. We have already discussed our Nucleus with 220 million registrations enables Origin, which is generated approximately $150 million in digital sales. ","Another platform ramping to a high-margin future is EA Play4Free. This proprietary site features richly detailed browser games, which quickly scales with revenue from microtransactions. Battlefield Play4Free and Need for Speed World are just 2 of the EA franchises generating big audiences and significant revenue already. The Play4Free platform generated $1.8 million per week in Q4 fiscal '12, up 80% over the same period last year. ","Another intriguing aspect of free games is its potential to serve as a funnel, introducing millions of new players to our brand universe. With this kind of scale, revenue and profitability, you can assume that more EA brands will be available on this platform in FY '13. ","Our investment in platform technology provides a number of advantages that expand revenue and margins. With a database of more than 220 million users, we have a powerful media channel built into our own platform, one which generates ad revenue and saves us millions that would've gone to other marketing outlets. Couple this with affinity marketing and we can realize a huge savings in the cost of customer acquisition. ","A few years ago, we spent 12 months and tens of millions of dollars recruiting the new audience while a game was in development. Today, we begin that process with platform technology that keeps us in constant contact with that audience. They're easy to find because we never lost them. ","Now a quick comment on breakthroughs we've made in measuring product performance. We have reached a point when the sale of a disk is no longer the largest revenue event in the financial performance of a game. Unit sales are just the first events in a larger set of economics. ","At EA, we are developing new metrics to capture the true scope of our enterprise. We measure how many customers have been acquired by a game or a service. We measure the degree of their engagement, how many minutes they spend playing. Most importantly, we have modernized our approach to tracking and managing game play monetization from retail to subscription before downloads, microtransactions and other streams of revenue. It's a unique and revealing way to view our business, and we want to share more of that information with you, our investors. At E3, EA will host an investor breakfast where my colleagues Rajat Taneja and Kristian Segerstrale will outline our strategy for providing a better understanding of the market and the performance of our products. ","I'll finish with a personal note on EA's talent initiative. When I arrived 5 years ago, EA was a confederation of silo businesses. There wasn't much communication between brands, between studios and marketing or between technologists and creative teams. And there was little contact with the consumers beyond the initial sale. ","Today, we are a much more cohesive team, from our executive staff to the creative and marketing teams to the corporate groups that support them. Everyone is focused on a clearly defined, unified set of goals. Our digital goals have provided a common denominator that links talent, brands and consumers. ","And we're seeing an incredible infusion of new DNA in the company. Our university outreach program brings in fresh faces and perspectives. Rajat is recruiting a workforce of engineers. Kristian is assembling a formidable marketing and digital analytics team, and Frank Gibeau oversees the group of the best creative leaders in the entertainment industry. I've never seen EA more focused, more cohesive, more joined by a common goal. ","Thanks, and now back to John.","John S. Riccitiello","Thanks, Peter. To summarize, fiscal '12 was a great year, but fiscal '13 will be much better, an historic year for EA. This is a year that we break away from the pack with a very different profile than the traditional game companies we grew up with and with access and capabilities that none of our new digital competitors can match. ","A dozen powerful brands projected over a variety of devices by a powerful direct-to-consumer network. More than 220 million consumers registered and linked by infrastructure that recognizes their game identities, preferences, rewards and friends. Every event captured, measured and reported with meaningful metrics. All of it created and maintained by the industry's most talented people. ","The key is digital revenue, which has a multiplier effect on our business. Digital revenue provides top line growth on a cost structure that creates improvements in gross profit and operating margins. Better margins allow us to invest in the future in big opportunities like Gen 4 consoles. We've been through a lot of change, change we undertook to drive greater shareholder value. ","Let me finish by saying it's a good time to be at EA. We're well on our way to having transformed our business model, changed the company from Tower Records to iTunes, from Blockbuster to Netflix, from Sears to Amazon. But unlike many of our digital competitors, we draw our growth from more than one revenue source. We have a much more diversified revenue base, with each digital segment growing rapidly, including our own direct-to-consumer services. ","Moreover, we are building this digital business more organically than most, and our vast portfolio of great brands enables us to do it more artfully and we believe in a way that is far more likely to win the test of time. We've got the right brand, the right strategies and most importantly, the right talent. Years of investment are starting to pay off. From here, we capture the rewards. ","With that, we'd be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question comes from Edward Williams of BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A couple of quick questions. First of all, can you just comment a little bit about the Star Wars trend lines, what we saw out of paying subs kind of since the game kind of call it since February 1 to now? So as the first billing cycles go past through, how those paying subs for Star Wars settled down? And then also looking at the digital revenue, can you give us some color as to whether or not digital at this point in fiscal '13 should be above, in line with or below kind of the core operating margins of the company?","John S. Riccitiello","So it's a couple of questions there. Maybe Frank and I will split the Star Wars question. I'll start on the broader margin issue and may be Ken can help us out. But Frank, you want to start on the Star Wars trend line?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, sure. Ed, this is Frank. The trend line on Star Wars is as follows. When we launched the product back in December, it was an event launch. We brought in a lot of users, and with a brand like Star Wars, it reaches out much past the hardcore MMO fan base into the broader market. And as the service evolves from here, what we're seeing is that some of the initial casual customers have gone through a billing cycle and decided not to subscribe to the game. But for the most part, we're seeing very good retention amongst core MMO users, which has given us a solid base of around 1.3 million subscribers. So the percentage of paying subscribers from our peak until now has actually gone up, and the folks that we have are as engaged as they were when they first bought the product. And if fact, if you look at how we're going to be releasing content going forward, we have a lot of elder game play, a lot of extension content that will keep them engaged and continue to grow on subs. Make no mistake, BioWare intends to grow subscribers. This quarter alone, we released 2 major content upgrades designed to drive subscription loyalty, and again, we've got many more plans throughout the year. We're also having a lot of success with our free-to-play weekends and buddy key promotions, which is helping us drive acquisition and we'll continue to hit those. And we're actively planning territory and platform expansions and extensions in Europe and Asia for Star Wars: The Old Republic. So we feel like we've got a very strong base that's over the long term we're going to continue to grow.","John S. Riccitiello","This is John. A couple quick thoughts on Star Wars before we turn to digital margins. I understand that a lot of investors are very interested in Star Wars. I just want to put a couple of thoughts in perspective. I think somebody -- this is something Ken mentioned of the call. First off, Star Wars performance right now is very much in line with our original assumptions and the assumptions and where we're guiding folks over the last couple of years. Where that puts it in our portfolio is, in terms of profitability from a franchise, is in our top 10 but it's not in our top 5. So it's a business contributor, while important, is not as important as Medal of Honor or Battlefield or FIFA or Madden or The Sims or SimCity, but it's more important than Tiger Woods PGA Golf. So while I understand there's an enormous amount of interest, I don't know that it warrants as much as what we're seeing right now. But we love the franchise, we're going to grow the franchise and just like we want to see Tiger Woods Golf grow or SSX grow, or Madden for that matter, we're going to drive this one for growth. The second thought that I would throw your way relates to your second question which is digital margins. I would give you 2 bits of context, where we are in terms of putting our digital services in the marketplace and how profitable they are long term. In a number of cases, we have -- we haven't yet launched the product. There's more in front of us than are behind us. The overall business sector, for example, social is less profitable than our console business as that when it carries everything going forward that we've got on our development pipeline. But as we model the business, as it scales, when these new products get into the marketplace and start generating revenue, it's a more profitable business. And in fact, if you track EA's gross profit trends and operating margin trends over the last 3 years, the key contributor to having our gross profit percentage rise and our operating margin percentage rise has been the addition of digital revenue streams that makes us more profitable. Some businesses get to a great profit profile very quickly, like Play4Free. Others are breaking through and getting good profitability like Origin. Mobile's in a good place. Social's moving to a good place, but all in all, it's a net plus in a big, big way. I think Ken thinks I covered it there. So next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Neil Doshi of Citigroup.","Neil A. Doshi - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just another question on Star Wars, John. With the large competing brand coming out later this year potentially, what else can you do to kind of maintain and grow subs through the back half of the year? And then secondly on mobile, we saw kind of nice growth in the 20%-plus range now for 2 quarters in a row. Is that the type of growth we should be thinking about going forward?","Frank D. Gibeau","This is Frank. I'll take the Star Wars question. Yes, I think what's important in an MMO is to continually update the game and add new experiences and new features and elder game play that keeps people retained and keeps the viral component of the service active. And from that perspective, we have a very aggressive release plan of content for the rest of the year and beyond. And it's mainly focused in on adding a lot of new elder game content around PDP, around achievements and a lot of other feature sets that the fan bases are asking for. It's also important that we're going to be giving the guilds a lot of features and components that they're requesting as well. So we are cognizant of competitors coming, but none of them quite fit in the same competitive category as Star Wars. They're just different fantasies. They're not the Star Wars fantasy. It's not the big expansive universe that appeals to so many people worldwide. And as you know with MMOs, every day you're in operation to get better and better and better. You continually perfect the experience. You continually improve the acquisition component. And so building from a base that we're at right now, we feel very confident that this business is going to continue to stay competitive throughout the remainder of the year.","John S. Riccitiello","You've asked the question about ongoing growth of 20%, but I didn't hear the sector you're referring to, Neil?","Neil A. Doshi - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's on the mobile side.","John S. Riccitiello","All right. So think of mobile as 2 businesses, just to get a sense of it. There's the traditional marketplace by Java Brew, the old feature phone business, and then you got the smartphone business. In our most recent year-end quarter, we had better than 80% growth on the smartphone business. If you take a look at the slide, you'll see better than 90% growth. So we are absolutely killing it there, and we're seeing strong expansion. What it blends down into the 20s is because we're still living with the tail end of Java Brew but starting to evaporate. But we're doing, frankly, fantastically well on the smartphone business.","Peter R. Moore","Neil, this is Peter. Just let me refer you to the slides as well for a little bit more color and texture on mobile. If you go to Slide 22, you'll see the representation of our titles across not only mobile but social and free-to-play. 25 of the 41 we feature there and the phasing is on Slide 25 is mobile. And what I can tell you is that the quality of the brands that we're linking mobile to in fiscal year '13 is faster period than we did in FY '12. So the concept in mobile tying into our brand universe element is spot on. So look at that breakdown. You can see that 25 mobile titles being launched in FY '13.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. One, I wanted to be sure I understand the revenue guidance for next year a little bit better. I think, John, you guys had talked about double digits before. You mentioned a shift of a title. Is there anything else that we should be factoring in the delta versus the prior guidance? And then second question on the next gen, is it fair to think that the next gen will not see the same step function increase that we saw in the prior cycle? Or help us understand how we should think about that.","John S. Riccitiello","Step function increase in what, I didn't quite understand.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","In the cost -- I'm sorry, in the development cost per title, you mentioned the $80 million that you're investing this year. I'm wondering, and maybe it's early, but just as you think about the next generation, what sort of cost increase we should be factoring in on a per title basis?","John S. Riccitiello","Okay. So in terms of -- your first question was about our guidance. I enumerated a number of considerations that went into our FY '13 guidance in the prepared remarks. I'd say the biggest one versus my prior expectation in terms of the one downward movement was we removed a major packaged goods title. And in parallel with that, we added significant R&D for Gen 4. In a lot of ways, they're sort of offsetting. We believe we're heading into a world where we won't have strong digital growth, partly offset by console declines. We believe we're entering a world where we're going to have strong digital growth complemented by strong console growth. And that console, as it is today, will be a blend of digital and packaged goods. In terms of next-generation content, I really wouldn't want to get into that more than we are right now. But we're confident that EA is going to be able to continue to grow, accelerate that growth and accelerate our margin expansion.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird & Company.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So obviously, FIFA and Battlefield are 2 success stories you have in transitioning franchise to the hybrid online and traditional business model. Was curious about the timing of this transition for some of the other core EA games, and if that represents a big part of the digital growth you're expecting in the year ahead.","Frank D. Gibeau","This is Frank. We are definitely taking the model for Battlefield and FIFA and applying it to franchises like Need for Speed. Mass Effect obviously just released with multiplayer and MTX, and we're having great results with that. So this is definitely a model that works for us, and you'll see that expanded across the entire lineup of console products going forward.","John S. Riccitiello","So think of it as it's far from the first inning here. The middle of our range this year, I think it's fair to say is fourth or fifth inning. You'll see lots of pieces. E3 will be an eye-opener. But we think EA is doing this uniquely since our competition doesn't have strength in console, PC, mobile, social, microtransaction, subscription, packaged goods, et cetera, we do, and it's a rare exception for franchises not really hitting on the majority of those plus points in fiscal '13.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And maybe just as one follow-up, perhaps update your views on the state of the social game market, at least on browsers. There was a little bit of a sequential slow down in credit revenues reported by Facebook and potentially some regulatory issues coming out of Japan, if you could maybe just address that.","Peter R. Moore","Colin, it's Peter, I'm not sure about the second half of your question but certainly, when you look at the lineup we've got, we certainly expect to grow very strongly our share on Facebook this year. Based on the strength of what we're seeing in our social lineup, again, bringing brands to play and tying into Frank's earlier comments of tying those brands together, increasing the funnel, making sure that we're delivering, I guess, more free-to-play experiences for a broader base of users and you can expect us to see that turn into market share growth in the Facebook platform in particular. I can't comment on your second question about regulation. I'm not sure what that's all about. May be we can get back to your on that.","Frank D. Gibeau","One point to note there is that we do think the browser is broader than just Facebook. If you look at our Play4Free platform, we're offering quite a few game services there that are now operating native through Explore, Safari, Chrome, whatever. Those are actually considered platforms for us, and they're very profitable and very global. So when we think of browsers, they're not strictly limited to Facebook.","John S. Riccitiello","Yes, there's a slide in our presentation, if I could find it, I think it's Slide 17. Think of Play4Free as EA's own, that's the bottom right slide, think of that as EA's own social network. And within EA's own social network, which is PC-centric, we've seen an 80% growth in weekly revenues from Q4 FY '12 to Q4 F'11, but we're also very successful partnering with Neowiz in Korea, GREE in Japan. There's no question that relative to Japan, one of the challenges is the mobile -- is the social business is a little bit trapped on the feature phone. The transformation to mobile and smartphones is going to be an interesting one. I know that we're sort of in a win-win situation. We do well on the feature phone, and we do well on the smartphone. So we're not particularly anxious about that transformation. My sense is over time, now to get to your question, that we're looking at the broader definition of what operates like a social network, a microtransaction-based model that's delivered free-to-play to consumer that's supported for us on a microtransaction business in a largely social format. We're going to see Facebook to be an important partner, our own platform likely to be our largest business. And then we're going to be partnering, as we do today, with Tencent and GREE and Neowiz and others. So it will be a multipartner plus EA direct-to-consumer model.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","John, looks like we're maybe approaching the third cycle. I've been sort of been following the industry here, and usually earnings really get hit hard during the console cycle because the costs go up and you sell fewer units on the new platform. Could you talk about maybe whether you already have the development kits? Is fiscal '14 kind of the transition year, and maybe why EA could be better positioned for this cycle than prior cycles? And then I have one follow-up.","John S. Riccitiello","So usually, relative to what we know about the hardware and what's coming, et cetera, I really wouldn't want to get into that. I think I'd like to refer you to Sony, Microsoft, et cetera. I would say if you were going to try to analogize where we are today, this would be a down year for us, fiscal '13. When we're investing the $80 million, we would be otherwise reflecting a negative EPS trend. We are absolutely a different company in a different spot. In the face of, unfortunately, somewhat of a headwind relative to console, we're getting top line growth, robust digital growth, robust margin expansion, robust EPS growth, while affording the investment in the next-gen console. I don't think, going back to our foundation in '82, that's ever happened before. So what we are guiding for is entirely unprecedented, and it's a function of everything we've been saying on the call so far. We've built that digital business. We're tethered to consumer. We're monetizing in a very different way. Remember, we're not transitioning in the past 50, 60 individual packaged goods game. We've got -- think of it as being 20-ish core intellectual properties that are running across mobile, social, PC, console, microtransaction subscription, packaged goods revenues and a lot of that packaged goods revenue is actually digital straight through the Origin store. So a very, very different business. It's our hope to be able to accelerate top line through a transition and accelerate bottom line growth through a transition because we won't be facing sort of negative console compares.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay, great. And then a couple other questions. A couple of success stories you've had on digital are FIFA and I think Battlefield. Maybe you could talk about what margins look like for the entire franchise for those versus when they were just packaged goods? And then I think you said 5 Facebook games on the last call. Is that still the number for the year and the first one is still in Q1?","John S. Riccitiello","So Justin, we haven't put out -- great question. We haven't put out overall franchise profitability. But if you think about the fact that we've gone from 67 titles where we were making $0.30 a share and now we've got 14 titles that we're guiding to well north of $1 a share, obviously, franchise profitability is sky high in terms of where we were and where we are. So I mean, the numbers have got to be virtually off the chart because we've got 1\/3 as many titles or 1\/3 as many franchises generating 300% of the income. So I'm very confident, without having the data at my fingertips, that these things are moving up into the right in a truly fantastic way. In terms of launches on social, 5 is conservative. We've given you a combined number for mobile social, and I hate to keep referring you to the slides, but it's listed in the slides. And the reason we're not trying to give much more guidance on mobile social title is there's an awful lot of circumstance today where 4, 6, 8 weeks in front of a launch, people will sort of copy your name and take a spot in the App Store of certain of our partners and\/or Facebook with a look alike, sound alike, feel alike. So we don't do sort of the advanced communication of the individual titles so much as a surprise launch. We're not looking to get ambushed by folks that are trying to benefit from dropping in under our marketing window.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Karimzad of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","2 questions, the first one and apologize if this was touched on in the remarks about guidance. But when you look at the $2.5 billion of non-digital revenue for this year from the publishing side, looks like you've cut the title count by about 1\/4 and then backing in at $2.5 billion. Looks like it's down about 15% or so. What are you guys kind of baking in for like-for-like growth in packaged goods, either in your industry outlook or title versus title where you have an even compare? Just to get a sense of what you're baking in given what we've seen in the first quarter so far even in high-def packaged goods being weak. And then the follow-up would be on your decisions for investment in social versus mobile, as you decide of which one of those to put in incremental dollar towards, on one side with smart phones, there really is no clear leader there. Whereas in social, you certainly have one and they have some interesting advantages. How do you guys take that into consideration, and how has that evolved over the last year?","Peter R. Moore","So Brian, this is Peter, let me get that first question at least. We're projecting single-digit declines in packaged goods this year and of course, high double-digit growth in the digital space. And that's something that we've seen over the last couple of years. We expect that trend to continue. We've got a very strong lineup of titles, and again, I'll refer to E3 and see our lineup then which will be presented fully and you'll get a taste of that at the investor breakfast on the Wednesday morning. But as I say, bottom line is we're looking at again single-digit decline in packaged goods, high-definition packaged goods and strong growth in digital. As regard to making decisions, investment decisions on social, mobile, it's really a difficult question to ask. It depends on where we are, what device, what is the brand, where we see the best return, what is the game play mechanic. It's a lot of things that we do. But I'll refer you once again to the slide deck. You can see the amount of games. We're doing 41 across that titles, and you can see the phasing as well on Slide 24 of where we're bringing it all to bear. So Frank, I don't know if you've got any...","John S. Riccitiello","This is John. One addition, just in terms of the sector performance and high-def, low-def for the year. I don't think our industry forecast of down single digit is different than most. It's been a little weaker so far this year. That's more of a function of sort of industry level content availability. We've got strong compare to some titles last year and then first couple of months of the year. And as we expect to move on later this year, we expect to see the compares favor '12 over '11. So I think we're solid there, and we're basically anticipating roughly holding share in packaged goods against a smaller title count, so our revenue per title is rising dramatically. In terms of mobile, social, here's one thought for you. We're tending to bring the same intellectual properties to mobile and social, and we're increasingly getting very similar with the product execution because the mechanics, the amount of time people spend on and the type of mechanics that's working, the business model, the free-to-play market transactions working across mobile and social and we're really programming, again, the Asian opportunity, the western social opportunity, Android, obviously, iOS.","Operator","Our next question comes from Atul Bagga of Lazard Capital.","Atul Bagga - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I have a couple of questions on the platform side. So you mentioned on Origin your install base. Can you talk a little bit about what is the active user base? And also, in terms of revenue, what was the breakup of revenue within first-party titles versus third-party?","Peter R. Moore","Atul, it's Peter. So yes, there are 11 million installs of the Origin client active on desktops today. As regards to your second question, the overwhelming majority right now of the revenue is first-party as you might imagine. We are anticipating very strong third-party growth. You can watch it every week as the number of third-party titles come onto the Origin client. I know you're a customer, Atul, and you can see as we grow our portfolio that third-party in fiscal '13 will be a stronger part of our portfolio when we think about our growth in Origin. But for fiscal '12, it was overwhelmingly first party, and of course, you might imagine Battlefield and Star Wars.","Frank D. Gibeau","The one thing to add, as you look at games as a service, Origin is one part of the platform. When you're looking at the total audience size, again, the Nucleus account data is really representative of the consumer base that we're marketing into which is over $220 million as reported this quarter. So as we look at the cross-platform execution and our key franchises like FIFA, Need for Speed, Battlefield, there's an Origin component to that, but then there's also an in-game commerce component to that. And we're actually building audiences that we're carrying from version to version in a much more efficient and leveraged way. So to your first part of your first question, it's a component of Nucleus and Origin that we look at in terms of how we're deploying our platform.","Atul Bagga - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And how does Play4Free fit into this? Do you expect it to become 2 separate platforms, or do you have any plans to merge these 2? And maybe if you can give some breakup of Play4Free, what's the current user base and how is that broken into eastern market versus the western market?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, the Play4Free platform has about 60 million registered users right now, and it's predominantly western-focused. I'm not including the FIFA Korea data in that. If you include FIFA Korea, it takes that number up substantially. But in general, it is a platform that appeals to emerging markets as well as first country markets, like U.S. and Germany as an example. It's growing aggressively, and it's a key component of our cross-platform strategy to bring Battlefield not only to the Play4Free category but also on the consoles, and we're able to track users that are in either platform -- either game service and be able to upsell and cross sell them into the other one. So it's a highly monetizable platform. How it evolves from here with regards to Origin and the rest of the platform, that's something that we're actively working on right now.","John S. Riccitiello","One thing for those of you who haven't attempted to take a look, if you just type in EA Play4Free, that's play with the number 4 free, you can see the platform, play it and try it. It's all up there. It also gives you an awful lot of data about who's doing what and when. So for those of you that are asking questions have been -- if your haven't had a chance to take a look at it, we essentially modeled this off of some very success -- companies that we admire that were generating strong digital revenue: one with Nexon; one with GamePort [ph], a private company based in Germany, that have built very substantial businesses here. It's more or less EA's version of a social network from microtransaction games, and it tends to attract consumers that are high monetizing and slightly more core than a straight-up social network. It's a great business. We have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Doug Creutz of Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","If I look at the App Store today, roughly 3\/4 of the games that are in the top 20 grossing titles at any given moment are from smaller developers that aren't part of larger well-capitalized entities. There's been 2 fairly major acquisitions in the space announced in the last 6 weeks. I'm just wondering right now how are you looking at potential M&A opportunities in the mobile space, and how you're feeling about that for the next year?","John S. Riccitiello","So top line for me on this. So first off, we're the leader in all mobile iOS and Android on a 2011 basis. We're second in social. Our competitors in San Francisco have a very strong lead in social, and best I can tell, they are #2 in mobile and my guess is we're going to trade leads and we're going to gain share in social. So I guess the first observation is that a very large portion of the business comes from just the 2 of us, and I think we're pretty well capitalized. Here, just not to disagree with the thesis, but I think there's a lot coming from the leading players. As is, I would expect it to consolidate more and more around leading players, leading brands taking more and more share. In terms of acquisition, to be honest with you, I'm pretty anxious about acquiring instant one hit wonders in the space. There's an awful lot of noise that grows up around individual franchises that rises, less so in that individual franchise when it declines. A lot of times, I think when people are acquiring individual new intellectual properties in mobile and social, they try to put an earnings multiple on it, should be a 10x or 20x. But the problem is to put anything on it more than a 3x or 4x, you have to have a belief that this thing is going to last a very, very long time. If something is going to come and go in 3 or 4 years, you can't put a multiple, you've got to add up 3 or 4 years profitability to figure out what to pay for it and then do some sort of a risk-adjusted discount on that. We actually think with Sims, SimCity, what we've got in Bejeweled and the rest of the PopCap IP, we are blessed with an unbelievable portfolio of brand. We don't need to buy a brand just to get a temporary lead on top of the charts for whatever is hot this quarter. That doesn't mean that we would never buy or never invest. We would. But right now, what I'm starting to see is valuation expectations that assume that these things are all hockey stick moving up into the right with no end in sight, and I think those are bad assumptions. Some of them will work, some of them won't, but they can't all be worth the multiple that I'm seeing in the market right now.","Rob Sison","[indiscernible], I think you can cut if off now.","John S.

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision.","All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Chris.","Q1 was a great start to fiscal year 2016 as we continue our journey to put our players first and deliver amazing entertainment experiences for them. We're building deeper connections with players in our games and live services. There is tremendous excitement for our upcoming titles, and we see profound new energy in our industry.","Our Q1 results were excellent, with revenue, margins, and earnings above our guidance. Our top games and live services, including EA SPORTS FIFA 15, Battlefield Hardline, The Sims 4, are engaging players around the world with fresh new experiences. We see continued strength in our mobile titles, with new games coming later this year. EA is executing well against our plans for FY 2016. And with ongoing strength in our digital business and growing anticipation for our upcoming titles, we are raising our full-year guidance today to reflect momentum across the portfolio.","Our industry is hitting a powerful stride as we advance further into the new global era for games. The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 installed base continues to grow and show great strength, driving well beyond adoption rates of previous generation devices. The opportunities in mobile as well as new service and delivery models are opening up more ways to bring players into our games than ever before. At the E3 conference in June, the appetite for great new games was clear. Players on all platforms are ready for new experiences that capture their imagination with creativity, innovation, and breakthrough gameplay. EA is in a strong position to deliver.","We had an outstanding E3 this year, showcasing 15 new games to our players, media, and partners. Throughout the event, our partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm was in full view. Star Wars Battlefront stunned audiences with the magnitude and realism of its gameplay. We revealed a new expansion for Star Wars: The Old Republic, and announced a new Star Wars mobile game.","We unveiled new experiences for original IP with Mass Effect: Andromeda, Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare 2, and surprised with the unexpected charm of Unravel. We celebrated the return of Need for Speed, captivated players with the authenticity of our upcoming SPORTS games, and detailed the gameplay innovation in Mirror's Edge Catalyst. Attendees were able to go hands-on with all of this year's titles at our E3 booth.","Most importantly, through content and social conversation, we brought the E3 experience to players around the world. Millions of viewers joined the stream of our live event, and our titles were mentioned more than 500 times per minute on social media during the week of E3. Trailers, gameplay, and live streams of our games were viewed over 53 million times throughout E3. And Star Wars Battlefront alone generated 22 million views on social platforms, our most popular content ever at E3. It was tremendous to see such positive reaction from players and feel the excitement level for our games continuing to build. We're looking forward to sharing more at gamescom in just a few days.","In addition to our upcoming games, our live services today are ecosystems of ever-changing content for our players. Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline players logged a combined 170 million online gameplay hours in Q1, and we'll be bringing new expansion packs for both experiences in the coming months.","The Sims 4 player community continues to grow and engage deeply with the game as we deliver more updates and new content, and we saw gameplay hours in our mobile hit, The Sims FreePlay, increase 85% year over year. In addition, our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team modes averaged over 2 million players per day in Q1, up nearly 20% year over year.","Amazing and creative new experiences, dynamic live services, and deeply engaged communities built on strong and meaningful relationships with our players, these are the building blocks of our long-term strategy for Electronic Arts. Through our key franchises as well as experiences with new and original IP, we have the ability to reach more players than ever. EA Access, Origin, and our new Xfinity Games beta are bringing more players in to compete, connect, and fuel their passion for games. And with our digital infrastructure, analytics, and live services, we are evolving and personalizing the experience for each player and exploring how cross-game services can create additional value for everyone.","After a strong first quarter, the stage is now set for us to deliver our slate of groundbreaking and stunning new games through the remainder of FY 2016.","I'll now turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Andrew.","EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $693 million, which was $53 million or more than 8% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 11% lower than the prior year's because we had no console launches this quarter, and the year-ago quarter included the launches of Titanfall for Xbox 360, EA SPORTS FIFA World Cup 2014, and EA SPORTS UFC. Our core business was strong. And at constant currency, this quarter's revenue would have been within 4% of last year's.","As I discuss the results for this quarter, bear in mind that FX changes have had a dramatic impact on year-on-year comparisons. The euro, for example, fell nearly 20% against the dollar from the first quarter last year to this year's first quarter.","In the first quarter, EA SPORTS FIFA 15, Battlefield Hardline, and The Sims 4 drove solid revenues and delivered excellent margins. This demonstrates the power of our deep catalog of popular IP, which delivers a base of stable revenue throughout the year. The revenue and margin beat versus guidance were driven by better than expected performance from FIFA Ultimate Team and The Sims 4.","Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 10% year over year to $532 million, 77% of this quarter's revenue. The trailing twelve-month digital net revenue was up 20% to $2.28 billion.","Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $255 million, up 21% over the prior year. The principal driver of this growth was FIFA Online 3 in China. $31 million of the FIFA Online 3 revenue was deferred from previous quarters, as noted in our last earnings call. Total Ultimate Team was down 6% year on year but up 3% on a constant currency basis, even with the World Cup boosting FIFA Ultimate Team engagement levels last year.","Mobile generated $122 million in the quarter. Digital extra content and advertising was up 11% versus the prior year to $115 million, while premium mobile full-game download revenue was just $7 million, down 56% compared to the prior year. We expect premium full-game download revenue to remain at this minimal level for the foreseeable future.","Full-game PC and console downloads generated $84 million of revenue, up 18% over the prior year. We continue to see the digital downloads increase as a percentage of full-game sales, although this quarter was particularly high since our catalog titles typically skew more towards digital downloads than do newly launched games.","Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue contributed $71 million, down 11% from last year, due to the natural decline in Battlefield 4 Premium revenue. EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth, and we continue to build its value to gamers as we add more games to the Vault. Titanfall is now in the Vault and Dragon Age: Inquisition will join it at the end of the summer, bringing the total titles to 13.","Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.8%, an increase from last year's 70.2% and better than our guidance of 74.5%. Growth over the prior year was driven by product mix, the shift to digital, and FIFA Online 3 in China. We exceeded guidance largely through better than expected performance from FIFA Ultimate Team and the continued success of The Sims 4, which delivers very high margins by virtue of being a PC title based on wholly-owned IP.","Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $472 million, up $13 million or 3% year on year. The increase over last year was driven by R&D, payroll tax expenses related to stock-based compensation which have risen with the stock price, and by the extra week in the quarter. This was offset by FX and lower marketing costs as a result of no major launches this quarter.","The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $0.15 a share, which is $0.15 better than guidance due to strong revenue and higher gross margin. As a reminder, this is calculated at our new tax rate of 22%.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.88 billion or approximately $9.23 per share. 64% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore.","Net cash used by operating activities for the quarter was $71 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $992 million, a record for this period.","During Q1 we repurchased 2.2 million shares at a cost of $132 million. Our $1 billion stock buyback program was initiated partway through Q1 in May 2015, and has a two-year timeframe. As of the end of the first quarter, there was $925 million left on the $1 billion plan, as some of the stock repurchased during the quarter was bought under the old plan.","Due to the strength of our business, we are increasing our full-year guidance. For fiscal 2016, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue is up by $50 million to $4.45 billion, and our non-GAAP EPS increases $0.10 to $2.85 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of 27%. It's still early in the year. And with Q1 representing less than 16% of expected full-year revenues, we believe some continued conservatism is appropriate. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.3 billion in revenue and $1.98 of fully diluted EPS.","Regarding cash flow for the year, we are reiterating our operating cash flow guidance of approximately $1.15 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.05 billion.","Guidance for our second quarter is for non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.075 billion, 12% lower than last year's $1.22 billion. In this quarter, we're launching Madden NFL, FIFA, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, NHL and NBA Live. While last year's Q2 saw the launches of our major sports titles, it also included The Sims 4. In addition, FX presents a year-on-year impact of around $100 million to Q2 revenues.","Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 63%. Again, the main difference between this quarter and the year-ago quarter is the launch of The Sims 4. We expect our Q2 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $510 million, up slightly year on year, driven by increased investment in R&D, and offset by FX and savings in marketing. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.40 per share as compared to $0.73 last year.","Our Q2 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $815 million as compared to $990 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be $0.58 as compared to a $0.01 per share profit in the prior year.","We are very pleased with our first quarter results. Our ability to reliably generate earnings, even in the absence of major launches, is a testament to the value of our broad IP portfolio, our catalog, and our robust live services. Digital extra content and mobile continue to provide additional layers of consistent revenue. On top of this, player reactions to our marquee titles at E3 gives us great confidence in our competitive position as we look forward into this year and beyond.","Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Blake.","We have a great deal ahead of us over the next three quarters as we prepare to deliver a range of new titles from our key franchises and original IP as well as more new content for players in our live services.","We will have four more EA SPORTS experiences launching through the summer and fall, Madden NFL 16, NHL 16, FIFA 16, and NBA LIVE 16, all featuring engaging new modes and groundbreaking gameplay for our players. Need for Speed will arrive in November, and fans are loving the authentic car culture and deep customization that we've shown so far. And of course, Star Wars Battlefront will launch on November 17. The excitement for this game continues to build. It took home 45 awards from E3, including Game of the Show from IGN and Best Online Multiplayer from the E3 Game Critics. We look forward to unveiling new dimensions of Star Wars Battlefront and letting players go hands-on next week at gamescom.","We have more new experiences coming throughout the year. Our live services will continue to evolve with new content. We'll have some great new mobile games, and we're excited to have three new and original IP titles launching in Q4.","Looking further ahead, we're preparing more new games for our players. The reaction to a first look at Mass Effect: Andromeda at E3 was incredibly positive. We have a new Battlefield experience coming in Q3 FY 2017 and another new Star Wars project being led by the dynamic creative team of Jade Raymond and Amy Hennig. These are just a few of the new experiences in development across our studios today.","From the creativity of our teams to the technologies we are building to the passion for play that we share with our players, we are pushing the boundaries for games in an effort to deliver the next amazing experience. Through our games and live services, we will immerse players in new worlds, introduce engaging new characters, and transport them into adventures that capture the imagination.","In a new global age for games where more time is spent playing than ever before, we are also building a future with relationships at the core. Through our network, we are connecting players with each other and delivering experiences that are meaningful every time they play. I look forward to sharing more updates on our progress in the quarters ahead.","Now Blake, Peter, and I are here for your questions.","Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations","All right, Kay, we're ready for questions now, thank you. Could we have the first question now, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session.","Our first question is coming from Mr. Chris Merwin from Barclays. Sir, you may start with your question.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thanks a lot. So I just had one on gross margin. I think, Blake, you touched on some of this, but it's a very impressive margin that you posted. And I was just hoping you could provide a little bit more detail on what in particular drove that through a combination of, I guess, digital downloads, FIFA Online, and China, and then whatever else.","And then just secondly in terms of Ultimate Team, I think you commented that it was up slightly on a constant currency basis but down on a reported basis. I know last quarter there was an illegal coin sell issue, and I know you're working to resolve that. I'm just curious where you stand as it relates to that, and then how we should be thinking about growth for Ultimate Team for the rest of the year in the context of your extra content revenue. Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. So first on gross margin, the gross margin, a couple things to remember in just year-over-year comparisons. One, last year both Titanfall and UFC are royalty bearing titles, so they have dampened last year's gross margin a little bit. But the real driver for us was the strength, as you noted, FIFA Online 3. Obviously, some of that is deferred revenue, so coming in at very nice gross margins.","But second and probably more importantly, the strength of The Sims 4, and I'd just give people a reminder. Last year The Sims started a little slow relative to our thinking. We talked about that in our Q2 earnings. But the strength of The Sims franchise is the layering in of expansion packs that really fuel not just the expansion pack revenue, but bring people into the core game. And we were in a situation where many consumers were comparing the original Sims 4 game to The Sims 3 game with a long series of expansion packs. And as we now start to bring out expansion packs, they're starting to see the power of The Sims 4 gameplay and the excitement around it. And we sold more Sims 4 this quarter than we thought, and we think that trend will continue and we're very excited about it, not just because of the franchise, but because of the power that it drives to the gross margin.","And then last but not least, as you saw, the digital business as a whole was 77% of our total revenue. And that included a large amount of full-game downloads, which obviously enhances margin, as well as all the other components of the digital business which enhanced our gross margin, and that really helped the over-delivery relative to plan.","In terms of FIFA Ultimate Team, and I encourage Peter or Andrew to jump in on this if they'd like, first we saw, as you said, Ultimate Team down slightly but up on a constant currency basis. And a key reminder there is the comparison year over year was that FIFA Ultimate Team did extremely well in the first quarter last year because of the World Cup and all the people playing associated with the World Cup and the World Cup modes that we had in the game.","We did see better performance of FIFA Ultimate Team than we expected. As you remember, in Q1 we \u2013 or last call, Q4 excuse me, we gave some warning that because of the illegitimate coin selling we thought that we would see some slowdown in FIFA Ultimate Team mainly because the actions we take and the new price banding. Much of that will be corrected in the new version of FIFA Ultimate Team that comes out with FIFA 16, and we're excited about that. And we don't see any change to our outlook for the overall extra content and Ultimate Team business in the future. And as you can see, we were surprised that we did better than expected on Ultimate Team in the quarter, which also helped drive margin.","There's a lot of excitement about soccer in the world. The Women's World Cup in Canada really drove a huge amount of excitement in North America. We're seeing a great amount of excitement across Asia. And we think that will continue to help drive both the FIFA product and the Ultimate Team product over time.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","The next question is coming from Mr. Ryan Gee with Bank of America.","Ryan Gee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys, this is Ryan calling for Justin [Post]. First question is on OpEx. You've done a good job of managing those expenses the past several years, and the 2Q guidance shows some sequential growth there. Any color you can give on just where you are in terms of investing for the cycle and OpEx growth going forward?","Second, Blake, can you just confirm whether or not Unravel was included in your prior outlook and just whether any of the guidance increase this quarter is due to unannounced or new titles or products? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure, so let me hit OpEx first. The OpEx that we gave guidance on at the start of the year obviously hasn't changed in terms of the guidance. We have built into that OpEx R&D investment in both console and mobile products, and that's why you're seeing a slight uptick.","The OpEx this quarter was driven primarily by the options \u2013 or RSU [Restricted Stock Unit] exercises and the tax expenses associated with those. We didn't forecast the stock price to be as high as it turned out to be, and thus it was a little bit higher than we had expected. It's still obviously within our guidance, and we're comfortable with our full-year guidance on OpEx. We're continuing to try to be extremely efficient in R&D and continue to try to build benefits in to drive marketing expenses around the great digital connection we have with our users, our gamers, and consumers out there, and you'll hopefully see continued benefit to that over time.","In terms of the guidance and products, Unraveled was in the original guidance. I don't think the expectations around the love for Yarny himself was quite built into our guidance, and we were pleasantly surprised at E3 about how popular he was. But it's still a fairly small product and it's built into our guidance. We haven't added any products to our guidance. That was not the reason that we raised the number. The number was raised primarily due to the positive reception we saw across all of our products and the strength of the industry, as Andrew mentioned, the excitement we've seen around console gaming and the continued popularity of both Xbox and PlayStation and the strength of that going forward. So that was really the driver to our raised guidance.","Ryan Gee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, and then one quick follow-up, if I could, on digital and mobile. There was a pretty sharp fall-off, but it looks like the smartphone portion of that mobile is doing well. Can you help us with the phasing of mobile throughout the year or any products that we should be aware of that are coming out on mobile in the near term? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We've talked about a couple of key products that are coming out in the back half of the year. I can't give you exact dates. We test our mobile products extensively, and so it's often hard to be able to guess exactly when the launch date is going to be. Clearly, we have the Minions as a key product. We have a Star Wars product coming out. We have updates to some of our sports titles which you'll see; and a lot of exciting expansions or additions to products like The Simpsons or SimCity BuildIt, which have continued to build off of the strength of our platform there.","In terms of the actual phasing, hard to say, and I don't think it changes our overall phasing that we've put in our new guidance, but we'll update you as that comes along.","Ryan Gee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mr. Colin Sebastian from Robert Baird. Sir, your line is open.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks and nice quarter, guys. I have a couple of questions. First off, a lot of anticipation around Star Wars obviously and it looked really great at E3. Just considering the release date is fairly fixed, I wonder how comfortable or confident you are, Andrew, around the studio's ability to launch a fully finished product by the time November rolls around. And then are you sticking with the original 9 million to 10 million unit guidance for the game?","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Colin, and thanks for the congrats. We're feeling very good about the game right now. Again, as a reminder, this is a tried and true development team building on the Frostbite engine that's now launched a number of products on this platform generation, and we're coming on the third phase of development on this generation of products. So we feel like we have put all of the things in place that we need to, to deliver a great product. We had thousands of people play it at E3 in one of the more robust setups we've had for a shooter in our E3 booth in recent years, and we're looking at having literally tens or hundreds of thousands of people play it on over 200 units at gamescom next week. So the code is all very playable. The quality is high, and the feedback so far from the player base has been very positive. On the 9 million to 10 million, I'll let Blake take that one.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. Just to clarify, there's no change obviously in ship date on that whatsoever. We're very confident that we should be able to hit that date based on what Andrew just told you.","On the guidance, look, we normally do not raise guidance coming out of the first quarter. I think all of you know we have a fairly conservative mindset around guidance. This is the first time we've raised guidance in probably 10 or 15 years coming out of the first quarter because only 16% of our business is really booked in the first quarter. We're really excited about Battlefront but we're also really excited about all of our products, and that excitement drove us to increase our guidance in the quarter.","We haven't yet started to think about or talk about publicly what that means in terms of units, partially because it's still early. We want to see how the reaction is at gamescom to all of our products, including Battlefront, as well as how the fall plays out. So I would assume we'll have that discussion in October before we ship those products, and more to come on that. But right now, think about the raise in guidance on revenue as strength across all of our products, including strength in the response around Battlefront.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, Blake, thanks, and just one quick one on the second quarter outlook versus a year ago. You mentioned the FX headwinds and sense for the comp there, but you also have the higher console installed base and digital growth, and I think NBA is incremental. So it would appear that top line growth is still a possibility on the strength of the franchises. But are there any other moving parts I'm missing that might have impacted your initial outlook?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, and in fact, it looks like a lot of people on the Street got ahead in terms of revenue. And I think that's because maybe people forgot that The Sims was in last year's quarter along with the sports titles; obviously, no Sims this year. We're expecting strong revenue out of FIFA, Madden, NHL, and NBA, but those are obviously \u2013 they were there last year as well. I think the biggest and really only headwind comes out of FX. And based on where we are today and FX rates today, we think that's relatively roughly $100 million relative to last year.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mr. Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.","Stephen D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right, thanks. So, Peter or Andrew, are you able to share some of the underlying user data for FIFA Online 3 in China, monthly active users, paying users, et cetera, if not at least a directional indicator on how this is ramping, and separately if you are able to look at your user base for FIFA in the U.S. and compare that versus Western Europe or even versus Korea where you think you are?","And, Blake, I think at E3 you talked about the possibility for an annual release of a Star Wars game as you take advantage of your license here. So where are you in terms of deploying development talent to make that possible? Thanks.","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","So the first question, Steve, on FIFA Online 3 as regards trends, this is of course published with our partners in Tencent there, so it's a little early. As you recall, we waited for soft launch. We're now in full commercial launch. We can probably share a lot more of that data in the next earnings call.","As regards to your question in comparison to the West, obviously they're very different experiences. This is a free-to-play game. It's built on the Ultimate Team format, but is not a twitch-type game which a regular FIFA game obviously is. So from that perspective, I think the overriding similarities of soccer fans around the world, and Blake touched on this, we're riding high on soccer currently right now coming off the Women's World Cup and with the new domestic leagues all about to start within the last two weeks. So obviously, having that FIFA license for us and being able to deploy it across multiple geographies with multiple partners and in particular in the biggest geography in the world with a very strong partner in Tencent gives us a great opportunity. We brought forward the $31 million from the previous quarter into this quarter here. And as Blake had mentioned on the previous call, we're looking at somewhere in the region of about $10 million to $15 million per quarter as net revenue from our Tencent relationship.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And in terms of Star Wars, I don't think we've actually said that there's an annual Star Wars plan in place, but we do have a long-term contract with Disney. And we know Disney has plans for many Star Wars movies, and we're going to try to take advantage of the IP that are coming out of those movies.","I do think what we have said is that our intention is to try over the next couple of years to have a first-person shooter as one of the core titles, this year obviously Star Wars Battlefront, next year another Battlefield title. And as Andrew said, we're working on some other Star Wars titles. Jade Raymond and Amy Hennig are working on a core title right now. We don't have the timetable yet to announce those, but trust that you will see multiple Star Wars titles both on console and PC as well as on mobile. We have at least one mobile title that's going to come out this year and we have more in the process as well. So lots to come on Star Wars, and you'll hear about that as we discuss our future guidance. We're very excited about the franchise and about our partnership.","Stephen D. Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Mr. Brian Pitz from Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the question. Just to follow up on Star Wars, I'm curious what you're seeing out of pre-orders. I know you've had 20 million views on the trailer and a lot of marketing around it, but any comment on this translating into pre-orders on the title and maybe how those pre-orders could compare to the last Battlefield at this point?","Then separately, an update on your console growth expectations; I know Sony just raised its expectations today for the year. I believe you were around 48 million to 49 million next-gen boxes by year end, any changes or updates? Thanks.","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","So on the pre-orders, we're seeing extremely strong pre-orders coming out of E3, as you might imagine. I will remind everybody on the call that more and more as we see digital start to take a hold with our consumers that pre-orders become less of a key indicator, key linear indicator as how we predict our business here. But as we came out of E3, and more importantly, as Andrew mentioned, as we come out from what I think will be a pivotal moment for Star Wars next week in Cologne, Germany when 265,000 consumers will descend on the Cologne Convention Center on Thursday, all of whom will be trying desperately to get their hands on this title, we expect to see tremendous response from that. I've seen the build, and the game looks very, very solid, and we're excited to be able to share that.","As regards the question regarding installed base, yes, 49 million at the end of the calendar year, just some data on that. We're now 20 months in. And if we go like-for-like on the previous generation, we're up 44% installed base hardware versus where we were Xbox 360, PS3, et al. And our attach rate for software is slightly ahead as well. When correcting for full-game downloads, digital full-game downloads and hardware bundles, we're at 6.1% right now versus 5.9% in the same period in the previous generation.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And, Brian, we haven't fully digested the Sony announcement other than to say that it's hugely positive. Every time either Sony or Microsoft brings out information, it's been on the positive surprise upside. I think the NPD data showing the success of the Microsoft one-terabyte console as well as the continued strength in both Sony and Microsoft's product mix have been really strong. And a piece of that puzzle is if you were at E3, you saw the quality of software, not just ours, but the whole industry. And that bodes extremely well for generating interest in \u2013 if you're sitting on the fence today getting out and buying a new console, and we think that's going to do well over the next couple years.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Great, thanks, guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, next question.","Operator","The next one is coming from Drew Crum from Stifel.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So you guys had a pretty sizable beat on gross margin in the first quarter, but that does not seem to be flowing to your fiscal year guidance, and I wonder what the rationale behind that was.","And then separately, as relates to your sports titles, obviously a lot of moving parts there. Any updated view in terms of directionally how those businesses or how those franchises will perform in aggregate in your fiscal 2016? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Why don't \u2013 let me take the gross margin question and let Andrew hit the sports question. I think the reality is it's a little bit of the law of math, right? We're able to raise our full-year guidance on the bottom line and the top line, but with a slight improvement in gross margin. But remember, third quarter gross margin gets somewhat impacted by the royalty bearing nature of Star Wars Battlefront. So net-net, we're seeing a positive trend in gross margin. But with only 16% of the year gone, math just doesn't drive the gross margin numbers that much even though we've got a $0.10 increase in EPS.","I think the good news there is a slight improvement in gross margin, nowhere near what we saw in the first quarter, but just a slight improvement going forward bodes well for the earnings and the cash flow power in the business model. And that's why we're so focused on driving the digital side of our business because it's a huge value creator for us.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","As we think about our sports portfolio coming into Q2, again, as we have got more and more data on our player base, one of the greatest things that demonstrates the propensity to upgrade to the next version is continued engagement in the current version. We're seeing very, very strong engagement across the portfolio right now. And that, combined with a great feature set across our sports portfolio and the evolution and growing player base as a result of the growing console cycle, and increased follow-ship of sports like soccer around the world, we are very encouraged and excited by what our sports portfolio can do through this quarter; but not just that, as a result of the live services that we now build around our sports games, what it can do through this fiscal year and beyond.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it, okay, and just one last one. Blake, can you remind us what you're assuming in terms of FX detriment to the top line in fiscal 2016?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","That's a good question. Thanks, Drew, for asking. As a reminder, we said at the start of last quarter and it pretty much holds that our revenue forecast on a like-for-like basis, last year's FX rates was $4.65 billion. We thought FX would impact that by $250 million, and thus that led to the $4.4 billion revenue guide. So obviously, under the new guidance we're assuming $4.7 billion in revenue, the same FX impact, $250 million, thus $4.45 billion in adjusted post-FX revenue. And we present in our investor pack the FX rate. The reality is the euro is right about the same level as it was when we did our original guidance. We saw a little weakening in the dollar during the quarter, up to about $1.13 from $1.09, but that didn't last very long. It's back down around the $1.09 level. And the Great Britain pound, which is obviously a big driver for things like FIFA, we saw \u2013 the original guidance was $1.62. It's currently at $1.56, so a little bit of difference, but last year's full-year average was $1.49. So we're still seeing some movement, but it pencils out to be roughly around that same $250 million headwind.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","The next one is coming from Mr. Ben Schachter from Macquarie.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey, guys. First, congratulations on just continued positive momentum, a few questions. One, how should we be thinking about Titanfall free-to-play in China and throughout Asia?","Two, aside from FIFA in China, what are the other key drivers in China?","And then you know I have to ask a question about virtual reality. So I know it's very, very early for VR, and it won't impact the financial model anytime soon. But should we expect you to work with some of the VR platform holders in terms of them helping fund and develop some showcase titles? And when should we expect the first VR game from EA? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I thought you were going to ask when should we expect the first VR earnings release. That wouldn't be pretty.","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Ben, it's Peter. Just on your Titanfall question, as you saw announced a couple of days ago, yes, we've entered into a relationship with our partners at Nexon as well as of course the developer Respawn. Think of this as a classic free-to-play game there, but do not think of this as being particularly material to revenue. It's an interesting experiment in looking at that type of game and whether it plays in a free-to-play environment. We'll be interested to see the results.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","As it relates to VR, as we've talked about, we're thinking about this on a couple of different levels. We certainly believe that VR represents an opportunity for our industry as you think about our players' motivation to immerse themselves in cool new worlds and explore new characters. It's less for us about any one particular device or piece of technology and more about how we abstract beyond that and ensure our core technology layer, our digital platform, and our core engine in Frostbite can facilitate virtual reality experiences irrespective of which device a consumer wants to use. Right now we have a number of different incubation projects across the company where we're looking at best-in-class new and innovative and creative ways for players to experience our games in a virtual reality environment. It's still very early days, but we feel we're investing appropriately to prepare for a time where that could provide a new and different and innovative way for our players to experience our games.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Great, and just anything other than FIFA, what are the other key drivers in China that we should be watching?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I think FIFA is our biggest single driver, and I think there the biggest driver is continued growth in popularity of soccer, and that's a positive trend going on obviously around the world and particularly in places like China. You'll see additional new products come out that have similar approaches, being partner and using known IP that resonates well in the Chinese market, more to come there. But I think our real approach is to try to stay very focused and try to build great relationships with partners there to help drive the business. That's worked for us really well in Korea with our Nexon partnership, and we want to try to do the same thing with Tencent in China to really drive that business. Versus throw a lot of products into the market and hope something works, we're trying to be very, very focused.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, I'm looking forward to the VR game.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, next question.","Operator","The next one is coming from Mr. Mike Hickey from The Benchmark Company. Sir, you may begin.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hey, guys, great quarter. It's nice to see the guidance going higher too, that's awesome. Thanks for taking my question.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Mike.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","I think you touched on this. I'm going to hit it anyway. I'm just curious on your hiring of Jade and the building of her new Motive studio in Montreal. As you said in your prepared remarks, it sounds like her first project is working with Amy at Visceral, and it also sounds like she's overseeing that studio. I'm wondering if this was an original development direction you were planning. Or do you feel you needed additional expertise for this game's completion, Star Wars, that is rumored to be an open-world experience?","And I also wanted to confirm. You touched on it, but confirm that this new R&D expense related to Motive was originally part of the $100 million or so that you announced previous quarter. And I have a quick follow-up.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I'll let Blake cover the expense. As it relates to the hiring of Jade, as an organization, as a creative organization, as an organization always looking for really strong, creative leaders, we are always hoping to be able to bring in the best and greatest creative leaders. Jade and Amy have had a relationship for a really long time. We've been working with Jade for some time about coming into our organization and doing this project and some other projects, quite frankly. And we're very, very excited by what we're going to be able to do on that front, both as it relates to the Star Wars project that you referenced, and I won't make any comments on the rumors in any way whatsoever. But we're excited to have Jade as part of our organization and really looking forward to what she and the team that she's going to be working with both here and at Motive in Montreal are going to be able to do.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","And to your comment, Mike, on operating expenses, yes, it is contemplated in our current guidance. Our assumptions \u2013 we already have a team of people operating out of the Bioware Studios based in Montreal. It's been a great location for us, and Canada in general obviously has been a great development location for us across Edmonton, Montreal, and Vancouver. We would like to continue to build more talent in that marketplace. And there are some great people to be hired there, and that's always been in our expectations.","The reality is it will take Jade some time to develop the IP ideas and develop the core team. That's not a lot of people up front, so it won't impact this year's guidance at all. And next year we'll start to build that out, but you'll hear more about that in next year's guidance. I don't see it as a major driver of IP expense or R&D expense over the near term because we'll simply redial where our balance is around the world and where we're investing.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks, guys. Last question, also in your prepared remarks, and you added a little bit to it, but the 16 million matches of FIFA 15 played on average per day in Q1 obviously astonishing, and it shows the ongoing engagement for a game that's been on the market now almost a year. So when you think about evolving business models, it would seem that a subscription service for a game like FIFA could be a successful future model for you and I guess for the players too, given the consistency of their engagement. And so I was just hopeful you could \u2013 it's a little fringe of a question, I apologize, but I'm curious if you could provide any insight on the potential for subscription game models on console in the future. And obviously I'm not talking about EA Access.","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Great question. I'll see if I can shed some light on how we think about this. There are really two core vectors as we think about this. The first is how do we build a live service that engages players day in day out, week in week out, and month in month out throughout the year? And how do we build that into a consistent and predictable engagement loop for our players and for our business? And I think what you're seeing with FIFA and our other properties, including Battlefield and Madden and NHL and others, is that we are successfully navigating that shift and really leading from the front in an industry to drive great engagement opportunities for our players.","The second vector as we think about that is then what's the appropriate business model for any given player to enjoy that experience? And I think it's insightful that you point out that it does open up subscription opportunity. As it relates to subscription right now, we are very happy with the testing and experimentation and analysis we've got going on with EA Access. And over time we will evaluate based on this ongoing engagement and relationship and conversation we have with our players as to whether the extension of EA Access as a subscription or some alternative subscription would make sense for that player base. But right now our focus is on the continuance and driving of that live service experience.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Thanks, guys, best of luck.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","Your next question, sir, is coming from Mr. Eric Handler from MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks for taking my question, two things for you guys. First with the news of consoles expanding in China beyond the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, what would it take for consoles, do you think, to actually gain traction in China changing from a massive PC environment to one that's more accepted with consoles?","Secondly, big change of thought here, the convert that you have comes due in a year. I know you've got a hedge on that convert. But can you talk a little bit about can you use cash rather than delivering shares? How does the hedge impact the P&L when that convert eventually comes due?","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll take the China piece and let Blake deal with the convert. China, as you know, is a very interesting, diverse, and dynamic marketplace, particularly for Western companies. In order for consoles to be supremely successful there, I think that we would have to account for the cultural sensibilities of the Chinese game-playing population. We'd have to think about business model, we have to think about appropriate culturalized content, and the ability to fulfill the motivations that they have for social connection and competition, which differs from how we play in the West or even in other Asian markets.","I believe that both Sony and Microsoft are committed to driving the business there. I feel that we have content that, should we be able to navigate through those key elements, has appeal in China. But my sense is that it takes some time, as has the overall market in China, to really gain the traction and momentum that it has today.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","On the convert, Eric, so a couple things to note, so original value of the convert roughly $633 million; that has to be settled in cash, and then the upside component of that obviously settled in stock. Right now, at the average stock price for the quarter, which was $61.61, that would equal 6.6 million shares of stock that would be used to obviously settle the convert. We published a chart on our website, our IR website, that shows that at various stock levels, so I would consult that and note there's a difference between the GAAP share count and the non-GAAP share count because GAAP accounting excludes the benefit of the bond hedge, so it shows full dilution versus what comes in through the bond hedge, where the non-GAAP share count is obviously unaffected by it.","A couple of notes, as many people see with converts, particularly ones that are well in the money like ours, there often is early conversion requests that come in. And shortly after the last coupon payment, we saw a jump in early conversion requests. I believe people are simply making a calculation as do they take their money now or borrow money to carry it for the rest of the year. And typically the borrowing cost is offset \u2013 not fully offset by the coupon, and so you're seeing some early conversions. And we've had over $165 million of early conversions that will get paid out over the next three months; there's a time lapse. And so our assumption is we'll continue to see some of that over the next year as people get closer to the conversion date next July. Our intention is to look through ways to obviously potentially refinance that in the capital structure. We've talked about a potential permanent layer of debt or another convert and\/or just paying it all off, and we're looking through all those options and more to come. But we appreciate the fact that there will be a lot of dilution and we're looking at ways to minimize that dilution going forward.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thank you very much, very helpful.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","The next question is coming from Mr. Ryan Gee from Bank of America.","Ryan Gee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi again, thanks for taking my question. Blake, real quick, one of the comments you made is that the increase in OpEx year over year was due to, among other things, an extra week in the quarter. Can you just explain that? It seems like it's like for like this year and if that had any impact on revenue, not just on OpEx.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Obviously, it had a little bit of impact on revenue, particularly catalog revenue. It didn't have a big impact just because it wasn't like we were releasing a title in the quarter, but OpEx is obviously very steady where revenue is going to be up and down day to day or week to week. So I don't have the actual revenue impact, but we simply mention it because our internal accounting calendar had an extra week in the quarter versus last week, and that's why we mentioned it because it does drive a week's worth of extra OpEx. That would probably be the smaller portion. The RSU expense was obviously higher than that in terms of magnitude across the OpEx impact.","Ryan Gee - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","The next one is coming from Mr. Doug Creutz from Cowen & Co.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","To follow up on an earlier question, you mentioned that the attach rates for the cycle are slightly up and that obviously the hardware installed base is growing much faster. Can you comment on how the performance of last gen compares to last cycle and on net between the two where you see things?","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Doug, it's Peter, so just let me say again. When we look at this cycle, let's call this current gen Xbox One, PS4, et al, versus last gen, we believe the installed base of hardware at the end of 2015 will be 49 million. On a like-to-like basis of 20 months, 20 months from the launch of the Xbox 360 and PS3 to where we are today, we are up 44% in the West on installed base.","As regards the attach rate of software to the current installed base, 6.1% right now versus 5.9% of the previous generation. And that has been like-for-like indexed against the full-game downloads that we now enjoy both in the previous generation at the back end as well as the full generation we have now of full-game downloads as well as hardware bundles where the software has been inserted into the hardware. So 6.1% right now versus 5.9% taking into account digital downloads and bundles.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I guess let me add to that. We saw at the tail end of the Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3 cycle full-game downloads around the 5% level. And that was 5% across new and catalog products. We're seeing today, if you look at our last front-line title that came out, Battlefield Hardline, both in last quarter and this quarter, we're seeing rates north of 20% full-game downloads. And if you look at our catalogs, we're seeing some catalog titles up into the 40% that are older titles in the year versus brand-new titles. All of those trends continue to see positive movements, and we've heard similar things from our other members in our industry. And so we're very, very excited about the potential for continuing to drive that part of the business.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","I guess maybe I didn't ask the question very well. What I was actually trying to get at is what you're seeing in terms of performance of Xbox 360 and PS3 compared to the original Xbox and PS2 at the end of the last cycle and the net. Obviously, we've had faster growth in the new gen, but my sense is the old gen is falling off faster as well. What does it look like on net compared to last cycle?","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","So it's how the tail is holding up, Doug, yes?","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes.","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I think it's fair to say it's hanging in there. I think when you look at EA in particular, we keep our sports titles for as long as we possibly can. I'll remind you that's it's only three years ago we were shipping a PS2 title for FIFA. But I think it's fair to say as well when you look at our most recent big AAA launch, which was Battlefield Hardline, we saw four out of every five units on current gen. and as a result you're seeing most of our new launches now being on the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4. Whilst we'll still give some support in particular sports to Xbox 360 and PS3 and hope that they continue a trend of hanging in there, our dev teams in particular are moving forward with the next gen.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Doug.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","With that, I think we'll call the call to a close.

Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","Our first quarter of FY 2018 was an outstanding start to an exciting year for Electronic Arts. Engagement in our live services across console, PC, and mobile was exceptional, demonstrating the strength of our digital business that evolves daily to meet the needs of our players. Revenue and EPS for the quarter were above our guidance, and we had our highest Q1 operating cash flow in EA history.","Our live services today continue to grow with more passionate players connecting with their friends through our network and having more fun with the games they love. Our EA SPORTS live services were thriving through Q1, engaging more players on multiple platforms. Unique players in Ultimate Team grew 11% year-over-year through Q1. In our mobile businesses, FIFA Mobile expanded to more than 95 million unique players, and NBA Live Mobile grew to more than 70 million unique players.","Our Sims community continues to be strong. Monthly active players in The Sims 4 increased more than 20% year-over-year in Q1, and we're excited to have a new Sims Mobile game in soft launch. And in Battlefield 1, our community has grown to 21 million unique players experiencing an extensive live service with monthly updates, in-game events and missions and the largest expansion pack in franchise history.","As we continue to strengthen player relationship through our live services, we are also innovating with how we reach players outside of our games. Through EA PLAY in June, we engaged a global audience from our event in Hollywood. First, we gave fans the most comprehensive look to-date at our FY 2018 titles, including Star Wars Battlefront II, FIFA 18, Need for Speed Payback, Madden NFL 18, NBA LIVE 18 and a new EA Originals title in A Way Out and our stunning new IP, Anthem.","The trailers and videos we launched for our games at EA PLAY have together generated more than 115 million views on social channels, twice as many as last year's content. We welcomed nearly 20,000 players to our venue for a celebration of play and opportunities to go hands-on with our biggest games.","Among those attendees were 300 community leaders and content creators who captured and streamed 1,000 hours of gameplay for our upcoming titles. That content is now being shared among a combined 250 million subscribers worldwide, bringing them closer to the new experiences and excitement we will deliver this year.","Q1 set the foundation for FY 2018 and there is much more ahead of us, new games, more content, and pioneering for the future of play.","At Electronic Arts, we're committed to innovation for our players and the industry. We are pushing the limits forward. Our focus manifests in three key areas that uniquely position EA to lead and drive growth: a core technology base that is unparalleled in our industry; amazing new titles being developed by extraordinary teams; and new models to expand our reach and help more people discover, engage, and enjoy the fun of games.","EA's investments in engine technology, analytics, infrastructure, and research continue to fuel advancements in our games, our services, and our Player Network. Our industry-leading Frostbite engine is now powering development of a dozen new titles across our portfolio. It is continually engineered alongside our world-class technology platform for games and services, enabling our creative teams to leverage sophisticated data and insights to conceptualize and build the most incredible new experiences for our players.","Our digital platform provides the scalable infrastructure that powers our multi-player experiences, connects players to their friends, and updates our games based on player inputs. And across the company, research teams like SEED are working in areas like neural networks derived from our data sets, cloud infrastructure to deliver streaming experiences, virtual humans, and AI. These concepts will dramatically shape how players interact and experience games over the next five years and beyond.","Competitive gaming will also continue to fuel growth and evolution in EA's portfolio. Players in titles like FIFA and Madden NFL are up to three times more engaged when they are playing competitively, and fan feedback from our tournaments has been highly positive. This year, new competitive structures and new modes are set to expand engagement and drive growth in the digital ecosystem, broadcast, and sponsorship.","Launching first is Madden NFL, where the size and scope of our competitions in FY 2018 will increase substantially from a strong foundation as we deepen our partnership with the NFL and bring e-sports even closer to the real-world sport.","At Gamescom, we'll debut a new way to play Battlefield 1 built for competition and designed with direct input from our Battlefield community. Through a growing portfolio of digital and traditional broadcast deals, our spectator reach will continue to expand, with major brands set to engage this high-value audience through global sponsorships.","Looking to our FY 2018 slate of new titles and live services, we are delivering unprecedented levels of innovation. Starting in Q2, FIFA 18 delivers a generational leap forward for the franchise. Frostbite is now enhancing every aspect of the game from visual fidelity to gameplay. The Journey 2 brings a deeper and more personalized story experience, and FIFA Ultimate Team is expanding with the addition of FUT Icons. FIFA's global appeal also continues to grow. FIFA Online in China is one of our fastest growing sports businesses over the past year.","Madden NFL will break new ground for the franchise when it launches in August, powered by Frostbite, delivering a unique take on story mode with Longshot and introducing MUT Champions to power our global e-sports competitions. NHL 18 will have the most ways to team up and compete with friends in franchise history, 60 combinations of co-op and online multiplayer, including a brand-new NHL THREES mode. And Battlefield 1 will continue to evolve as a content rich live service, with monthly game updates and our next expansion pack, In The Name of the Tsar, launching in full in September.","In addition at Gamescom, we will detail our plan for a new offering that will bring the richest Battlefield 1 experience yet, including the all-out warfare, epic multiplayer battles, and War Stories campaign that have defined the game plus new maps, deeper progression, and additional fan-favorite game modes, all in a single package.","In Q3, we'll deliver new games in some of our most popular global IP. Need for Speed Payback will excite fans with its adrenaline-fueled action driving experience, signature car customization, new story, and new characters. Yesterday, we announced that The Sims 4 is coming to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 players this November, bringing the same unique gameplay and self-expression from the PC game to console players. Much of the content added post-launch on PC will be included, with more game modes and updates to come.","Finally, Star Wars Battlefront II will bring the unforgettable Star Wars experience that fans want, a game three times the size of the previous title with a new single-player story, iconic space battles, deeper multiplayer, and a new event-driven live service model that will keep the community together long after launch. Anticipation and excitement for this game continues to grow. Our trailers and user-generated content for Battlefield II have received more than 117 million views to date, up more than a third from our previous game.","We're also focused on growing our reach and encouraging more players around the world. Our live services are continually evolving to connect more players with new experiences, like our unique model for Star Wars Battlefront II post-launch content and event-based modes like FUT Champions.","As we continue to expand our competitive gaming program across more IP, we're delivering highly engaging broadcast content for e-sports spectators, one of the fastest-growing audiences in entertainment. And as a publisher, we have pioneered the multi-title subscription service at the platform level with EA Access and Origin Access, enabling players to discover and enjoy more games at tremendous value.","Only EA spans this breadth of engagement models today, helping us to reach more players and continually grow our network. There is a lot to be excited about in the quarters to come. We are innovating for our players, for our business, and for the industry.","Now, I'll hand the call over to Blake.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","We had a great start to the fiscal year, powered by our event-driven live services, particularly FIFA Ultimate Team and our mobile titles. Our operating cash flow was the highest ever for a first quarter and underlines how our growing live services have fundamentally changed our business model, resulting in a more stable and predictable cash flow all year round.","I'll report our results on a GAAP basis then use our operational measure of net sales to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model. EA's net revenue was $1.45 billion, compared to $1.27 billion a year ago and above our guidance by $24 million.","Operating expenses were $552 million, $6 million above our guidance due to phasing. The increase over last year was primarily driven by new product development as we invest in new genres.","Operating income was $743 million and diluted earnings per share was $2.06, $0.13 above our guidance.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was a record $176 million, up $294 million from last year. Remember that the FASB rules regarding the treatment of stock-based compensation have changed, and this affects how we classify our cash flow. Under the old rules, operating cash flow for the first fiscal quarter in 2018 would have been $42 million, up $290 million year-on-year. Under both accounting treatments, operating cash flow was an all-time record for the first quarter.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $33 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $143 million. Operating cash flow for the last 12 months was $1.87 billion, our strongest ever 12 months. See our earnings slide for further cash flow information.","During the quarter, we also repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of $150 million, leaving $1.08 billion in our two-year $1.2 billion buyback program we began in May. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.47 billion, with 37% of this balance held onshore.","Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $775 million, up $93 million on the prior year and $25 million above our guidance. There was an FX headwind of approximately $16 million compared to the prior year.","The outperformance relative to guidance was driven by Ultimate Team, The Sims 4 and FIFA Online 3. Year-on-year growth was driven by the Mass Effect: Andromeda sales captured in the quarter and by FIFA. Digital net sales were $681 million, a new record for the first quarter and up $113 million on the-year ago period.","The increase reflects strength in live services together with our mobile business. In addition, Mass Effect: Andromeda was a significant contributor. Digital sales now represent 63% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis compared to 56% in the prior year.","Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital sales in turn. Live services net sales were up 22% year-on-year to $420 million. The growth was broad-based, driven by FIFA Ultimate Team, Battlefield 1 and The Sims 4. The e-sports mode and FIFA Ultimate Team continues to attract new players and drive engagement.","Notably, Sims 4 expansion packs continue to perform extremely well, and the last 12 months have been the best in the title's history. Both EA Access and Origin Access are up year-on-year. Remember, we've merged extra content and subscriptions, ads, and others into this new live services category.","Mobile delivered net sales of $150 million, up 6% year-on-year with the growth primarily from FIFA Mobile, Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and NBA Mobile. FIFA Mobile is continuing along its growth trajectory and beat our expectations by delivering its strongest quarter since launch. June was the strongest month so far for FIFA Mobile, a testament to the ability of the team to create compelling live services for players. In Q1 alone, they released two major client upgrades and delivered 10 major content programs.","Full game PC and console downloads generated net sales of $111 million, 32% higher than last year. This was driven by Mass Effect: Andromeda sales captured in the quarter. 34% of our unit sales are now digital rather than physical measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to just 27% a year ago.","Turning to guidance. We are reiterating our guidance for the full year. For the second quarter, we expect net revenue of $955 million, cost of revenue to be $389 million and operating expenses of $638 million. OpEx is up year-on-year, primarily due to two factors, continued investment in new genres and live services and the phasing of marketing expenses.","Phasing will be different as we start campaigns earlier for new games and live services. This results in a loss per share of $0.18 for the second quarter. Note that this is calculated using the basic share count of 310 million shares. Should EA report a profit, the diluted share count of 314 million will be used. We anticipate net sales for the quarter to be $1.16 billion. This is up 5.6% year-on-year, primarily driven by growth in our sports franchises, offset by a FX headwind of around $18 million.","With regard to sports, Madden NFL 18 is a significant step-up from last year's game. It's the first Madden on Frostbite, it's the first with the story mode, and we significantly refined the competitive gaming features in Madden Ultimate Team. FIFA 18 continues the pattern of innovation with the addition of Real Player Motion Technology and player personality and the second season of the journey. Also contributing to our excitement around FIFA is the addition of the Nintendo Switch. We will launch FIFA 18 for all three console platforms at September 29.","In conclusion, we are delighted with the performance of our business in the first quarter, driven by the growing revenue streams generated by our live services. We've applied our teams to developing competitive or compelling live service event, and this has fundamentally transformed our business model. Our live services continue to grow our profitability and enable us to generate cash all year round.","Now I'll turn the call back over to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Blake.","The future of games is changing. Over 2.5 billion people are estimated to play video games today, and we expect that number will continue to grow. At that scale, the way we connect to, access and play games will continue to evolve. EA is at the leading edge of that transformation.","Our creative teams are applying advanced technologies and better intelligence to craft new experiences like our Longshot Mode in Madden NFL 18 and the massive dynamic environments in Star Wars Battlefront II. But this is just the beginning as we combine the power of our Frostbite engine with our digital platform.","With increased processing power on devices and in the cloud, the new frontiers for innovation become deeper forms of personalization, immersive and self-generating worlds, artificial intelligence, and deep learning. As we continue to pioneer for our players, our portfolio will expand in FY 2019 and beyond. We deliver stories that you're able to play like the Star Wars action-adventure game being developed by the Visceral Games team. Anthem, our new IP from BioWare, will introduce a contiguous open world that is ever-changing and influenced by players as they band together and support each other in their journeys.","Next year will also be a World Cup year in soccer, an added opportunity for us to innovate and engage our massive FIFA audience around the world. We'll continue delivering for our Battlefield fans, including the next great game in the franchise. Across our top franchises and new IP, our ongoing focus will be on advancing the state-of-the-art in games for players on every platform. Delivering new and compelling ways to discover, engage and enjoy games will enable us to reach more players and grow our network.","Our live services will continue to expand, hosting thousands of daily, weekly and seasonal in-game events that brings players in deeper. Our competitive gaming programs from online tournaments to global championship spectacles will engage more players and spectators in our franchises as the massive e-sports audience continues to grow, and through our subscriptions and Origin platform, players will be able to seamlessly connect to new experiences from EA's portfolio and beyond.","We are entering a new era for innovation in the games industry. We believe interactive entertainment will change more in the next five years than it has in the last 45 years. And we're excited to lead that evolution at Electronic Arts.","Now, Blake and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Tim O'Shea with Jefferies.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Good afternoon and thank you for taking my question. So one of the big announcements at E3 was this new Ultimate Team style mode for Star Wars Battlefront II, where gamers can purchase Star Cards to unlock the special in-game abilities. And you guys are doing over $800 million in Ultimate Team revenue. So my question is how much incremental Ultimate Team style revenue could be generated by Star Wars and then how much is implicitly included in your outlook \u2013 your full-year outlook? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes. So thanks, Tim. Good question. I remind everybody it took us 8 years to 9 years to get Ultimate Team where it is today. Our first year of Ultimate Team was $8 million for FIFA. I think there's a huge possibility for the extra content live service event-driven model in non-sports games, but we're also very conscious that it will take time to develop. We have a relatively small amount of that built into this year's forecast.","I think if it's successful, we'll start to see the benefits at the tail-end of this year and really see the benefits next year. But it's hard for us to really predict at this time exactly how that might play out. Our biggest focus, though, to remember is we want to just engage all of our users, all of our players deeply in the game and provide them more ongoing activities, content, events for them to keep coming back and playing. And if that's successful, we think the economics will follow, but more to come as we release that game into the market in November.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thank you. Looking forward to it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks. So, Andrew and Blake, I think we talked about this topic before, but I thought I would bring it up again. Given all of the different development efforts at Motive, BioWare, DICE and Visceral, you're now in a position where it looks like you might have too much products. So does this open up the opportunity for you guys to space out some of the non-sports franchises maybe every two years or maybe even three years as opposed to every other year? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Never too much product. I think we like our regular cadence. I think we've found a good cadence obviously with Battlefield and with Star Wars Battlefront. We're trying to make sure that we're leveraging our relationship with Disney on the Star Wars property, so aligning those where possible with their theatrical release schedules. So right now, our plan is not to change our cadence schedule. Clearly, we don't yet know how the cadence of new properties like Anthem or anything coming out of Motive will be \u2013 that's still to be determined. But I think we're pretty comfortable. We believe it rates a nice top line growth that's all organic from our teams, and we're very focused on making sure that it's very profitable along the way. So we want to continue to drive both the top line and the bottom line through new IP, existing IP, new live services, and margin expansion across all of those.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, two questions. First, obviously, you're excited by the improvements in Madden's. How have you factored that into your guidance for both the upcoming quarter and maybe in the holiday season? And then second, Battlefield 1, it looks like you're pretty excited about some changes there. Can you keep monetizing the digital after the year anniversary, meaning can you still see some pretty good digital revenues in fiscal 2019 for that game? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah, so we are planning for Madden to be up year over year, but I would say that it's not up dramatically; i.e., creating a risk in any way. You know, Justin, our approach to guidance. We try to be pretty rational and conservative. We think there's some upside to our guidance number there, but I wouldn't expect that it's up dramatically creating any risk. Based on what we've seen of the game and the excitement around the e-sports mode is very, very positive, and so we're looking forward to a great Madden year ahead.","In terms of Battlefield 1, we've had such great engagement there that we're continuing to feed new content into that community to try to continue to drive the game. We're constantly reminded that people are still playing Battlefield 4, for example. And that's a game that was \u2013 it's almost four years old. And so to try to be able to continue to add things for people to stay engaged and to build off that economically is a big positive for us, and we see that as one of the efforts as to why we're pushing Battlefield 1.","And then, as a reminder, Andrew mentioned that at Gamescom in a few weeks, we're going to introduce a new e-sports mode to Battlefield. People have used Battlefield as an e-sports product for many years outside of EA. It's a fun fast-paced game. But with 64-player, multiplayer, it's a bit hectic and chaotic for e-sports. And so you'll see some new modes coming out that will benefit a more rational e-sports approach, and pretty exciting for us for this year and really powering next year and the year after off of that title.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Nowak with Morgan Stanley.","Jonathan P. Lanterman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. This is Jon Lanterman on for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. In the past, you guys have stated a goal of getting the percentage of GameSpot via digital download to 40% \u2013 45%. And more recently, you updated this to 50% to 60-plus percent. Last year, we saw the traditional 5% annual mix shift accelerate closer to 10%. So looking ahead, what are some of the barriers that you guys see, the main barriers in getting to that 60-plus percent of games being downloaded? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I think for us, the first and most important thing to remember is we're very global. And so while there are high bandwidth speeds in the United States and in key major countries like the UK or France or Germany, that's not consistent all through Europe or Eastern Europe or Asia. And so that's probably still the biggest impediment to full-game downloads.","And the second piece is while we in the U.S., and I think it's the same in Northern Europe and some parts of Europe, the cashless credit \u2013 or cashless transaction methods are fairly well-developed. I would say they're not as well developed in other places in the world. So the use of credit cards, PayPal, any type of e-pay approach has still got a long ways to go. And I would say those two things are the biggest impediments to full-game downloads. We know that the consumer, once they do a full game download, realizes how easy it is and how effective it is for managing their games. And so we don't see consumer resistance. It's really the resistance around bandwidth speed and ability to pay with a cashless method.","Jonathan P. Lanterman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then would you say a consumer who downloads a game is also more likely to do MTX and DLC and things like that?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I think I would say it's probably the opposite, which is many consumers are doing, for example, Ultimate Team, but were still buying the game physically, and they're realizing how effective and easy it is to pay through a credit card method, and thus they'll transition into a full-game download.","Jonathan P. Lanterman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, thanks. That's helpful.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","We'll continue to do things to help the consumer to see the opportunity there and find a way to buy our products digitally. And at the same time, we'll continue to make sure that we have a strong presence in all of our retail partners because we know it will be a mixed model for a long period of time.","Jonathan P. Lanterman - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks, congrats on another good quarter First on competitive gaming, I wonder if you could comment on expectations for monetization of competitions, in particular for Madden and FIFA, or whether you still view these experiences as more about driving loyalty and community.","And then maybe a bigger picture question on Frostbite, which I think, Andrew, you said is powering 12 titles in development and is often highlighted as a key factor in game quality. My question is whether this version of the engine remains cutting-edge is being refreshed on an ongoing basis, or given some more frequent console platform refreshes now, should we expect a new version of Frostbite on the horizon? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Two really good questions. On e-sports, as we think about e-sports and we think about the monetization of e-sports, we think about it along some core vectors. The first vector to e-sports is you need a global community of players who are engaged in the game. If we look at FIFA and we look at Battlefield and we look at Madden, we have many tens of millions of players in each of those franchises who are continually and consistently engaged.","Next, you need a competitive game structure. And what you've seen using from us over the last 12 months is a real focus on ensuring that we have a strong competitive game structure all the way from the very, very amateur leagues through to a league championship The next thing you need is a way to monetize the increased engagement that you get out of that structure that you put into place. And what you heard from me earlier was that we saw a significant uplift in FIFA Ultimate Team revenue over the past year. And we believe a strong contributor to that is the competitive gaming modes that we built into FIFA, which again was a precursor to many of the new competitive gaming modes we built into Madden this year. And so we are hopeful to see ongoing growth and monetization in and around Madden Ultimate Team as well.","And then of course, once you've got these global communities engaged at a higher rate in a digital ecosystem and a competitive game structure, then that's a very compelling community when it comes to broadcast deals and sponsorship deals. And we are seeing that also accelerate at a faster rate than we had expected and are very pleasantly surprised by that. In all honesty, our focus isn't about generating huge numbers out of broadcast deals yet, it's really about increasing viewership and building a truly entertaining experience for our global audience. But we see opportunities for strong returns on those two vectors as well, broadcast and sponsorship over the coming years.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Before Andrew answers the question on Frostbite, what I'd say is, we talk about our business in general around engagement, because that's where we're focused on. But let me be really direct. You don't get 22% year-on-year growth in live services without the e-sports power that we've seen in our Ultimate Team business. And I challenge any other console player to demonstrate where they've seen revenue growth of that level driving \u2013 coming from e-sports. It is very powerful for us and it will continue to be very powerful.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","On Frostbite, again, we have a very large team across a number of different locations who are constantly and continually investing and innovating in that engine in terms of visual fidelity, in terms of physics, in terms of animation, in terms of AI. Every aspect that a game team needs to develop the most innovative and creative experiences.","And when you look at what we've been able to do with Real Player technology in FIFA this year, when you look at what we've been able to do with Madden visual fidelity and Madden cinematics and Longshot or story mode, when you look at the expanding dynamic worlds that we're showing in Star Wars Battlefront 2, that is really demonstrative of the level of innovation and advancement we continue to make in that engine.","And at some level, because we have a dozen teams building on top of the platform and a core team feeding all of that development back into the mainline of code, that engine is actually making leaps and bounds faster than many engines would, which is one or two games working on them.","And so we are very, very happy with our core strategy of moving to a single engine. We're starting to see real leverage in the engine, not just in terms of our ability to build wonderfully large and creative and entertaining new games efficiently, but because we're able to do things that are far more innovative than things we're seeing anywhere else in the industry.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thank you.","Chris Evenden - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Question?","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Drew Crum with Stifel.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thanks. Good afternoon, guys. So you have a very large installed base, it seems for FIFA Mobile. Can you comment on the monetization trends that you're seeing? I think you mentioned, Blake, that June was your best month thus far. What changes have been made to drive the improved performance? And maybe comment on how it's performing relative to Madden NFL Mobile? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So a great question. Again, when we launched FIFA, we were using the blueprint that we had used and developed over a three-year period for Madden NFL and Mobile that had really started to gain traction and continues to be a very engaging property for us. And when we did launch that, we said that even though we're using the blueprint for Madden, we expect that given the nature of the global community and the different geographic and cultural differences around both engagement and monetization in the soccer audience versus the North American-focused Madden audience that we believe there would be some tuning time required.","What the team has been doing on a day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month basis since launch is really better understanding through the great deal of data that we are able to get every day from play. What cultural needs are, what engagement needs are, and ultimately, what the overall monetization needs are of each player base in each community. What we're seeing now again is the ongoing commitment to live services, events that are relevant to each of those communities around the globe, started to generate the kind of engagement and monetization growth that we would expect and continue to expect.","I think that we are ahead of where we were with Madden. I don't have the exact data. We're ahead of where we were with Madden. And again, when you think about Madden as in a $50 million to $100 million range being primarily North American-focused, we continue to believe that FIFA on mobile can be substantially greater than that on a global basis.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes. And, Drew, a couple of examples that just occurred during that quarter is I mentioned they had 10 major new content updates. One, for example, is called VS Attack Mode, where players compete for leader board status and can unlock or upgrade items based on the division that they're in. It's proven to be very popular with the community and highly engaging. And think about this as \u2013 when we started FIFA Ultimate Team years ago, it was really one mode. And over time, it's developed into many different modes and many ways to play with different types of players.","And the journey of Madden Mobiles follows that. FIFA Mobile will follow the similar journey over time. The quarter did really well, but it's a strong \u2013 it wasn't a strong quarter for American Football, but it's a strong quarter for international soccer. And so you tend to see strength in both FIFA and NBA in that quarter, but also you're seeing just the potential as we continue to add and work with the game. It's a game unlike most mobile games, it's more like our Madden \u2013 our FIFA or Madden Ultimate Team where we've tinkered, we've played with it, and we've added to it over many years and that's how we'll continue to grow both FIFA and NBA and Madden over time, and we're pretty excited about that.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Uerkwitz with Oppenheimer.","Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks, gentlemen, for taking my call. I just have two higher-level questions. The first one is Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2 and a couple other games were added recently to EA Access. It feels a little bit like they're added a little bit earlier. Could you talk a little bit about this strategy around EA Access and potentially eventually an over-the-top gaming service?","And then, secondly, and shifting gears on Frostbite. As that becomes more and more powerful, do you see opportunities beyond to use that game engine beyond traditional gaming? Thanks, guys.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Two great questions. As we think about subscription and less about the timing of adding of those particular titles to our EA Access subscription. But as we think about meaty consumption over the last five years, the greatest disruptor has been the combination of streaming and subscription. It's changed the way we watch television. It's changed the way we listen to music. It's changed how we think about ownership versus access.","And we believe that ultimately, the combination of streaming plus subscription will also be a great disruptor to our business. And you've seen us investing there for a number of years. It's some years ago that we started our first streaming test. We continue those tests. We continue to work with other key large-scale partners on how we think streaming might work for our business in the future. You saw us launch EA Access and Origin Access. You should expect us to continue to push in growing the opportunities in and around subscription and delivering more value for our players on both of those vectors.","As it relates to Frostbite, again, we had this wonderfully powerful engine that can do things that no other engine can do. And as you might imagine, in our strategic planning meetings, often we are sitting down and saying, okay, we have a great many strength as a company, whether that's nearly half people in our network, whether that's our social reach, whether that's the depth and breadth of our portfolio, whether that's our engine, or our core digital platform with IT, infrastructure, security, data, scalability. And we're always looking at how we might apply those to adjacent businesses or other areas that might deliver value both to our payers and to our shareholders. And Frostbite absolutely is front and center in those conversations.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And just one clarification. We've announced that we will release Titanfall and Battlefield 1 in September. And that's about the normal cadence. We're typically somewhere between seven months and nine months after initial putting the title out. And so those really aren't any earlier than what we would normally see. But what we do see is the more titles we have, the greater interest there is in the subscription, I think that makes commonsense. But more exciting titles like a Titanfall or Battlefield 1, it also drives a huge amount of interest in the subscription service, and we tend to see nice pops around those announcements.","Andrew Uerkwitz - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Eric Handler with MKM partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks for taking my question. I'm just curious with \u2013 will keep on the FIFA theme, you're now about 11 months away from the 2018 World Cup. How are you thinking about live services as you sort of get the lead up to that event with \u2013 you've got qualifying events, you've got the actual event itself. How you can sort of parlay that to sort of a side-by-side type of situation? And then secondly for Blake, so it looks like on your operating expense number guidance for 2Q, it looks like the non-GAAP, if we're allowed to say non-GAAP, number looks to be about $575 million. Should that be the peak of the year for operating expenses?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Why don't I get that one first, and I'll let Andrew get the FIFA one. It's a very nice way of trying to have me give you third quarter and fourth quarter guidance early. But I can't say that other than to say that if you've been using historical patterns for marketing spend, you should start to think about those differently over time. Because, as we said, as we live in a live service world and as we have a bigger and bigger mobile business, we're driving and managing our business daily, not by title specifically or title launch specifically. And so what you're going to see is our marketing spend smooth out more across the year, but still be dominated by Q2 and Q3 because that's when our biggest properties come out. But we started spending on FIFA months ago or on Madden months ago. We're starting spending on Star Wars, for example, that doesn't come out until November versus the old model where the bulk of your spending came three weeks before you or four weeks before you shift the product, more like a movie.","And we're moving to a much more ROI driven marketing structure where when we see something that works, we continue to fuel it and we're driving more and more of our marketing in non-traditional ways away from traditional media and into the more influencers of the world to try to drive the message home. And because of that, you're going to see different patterns in marketing spend, but I reiterate to everybody, our total marketing budget for the full year has not changed and the targets that we've talked about relative to marketing have not changed. It's simply the spend patterns are slightly higher in this quarter than they have been historically, and that's probably why most people's models were off.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","On World Cup, again, as you can imagine, there's always a great deal of excitement around the World Cup. It's the world's largest sporting event and typically represents a great opportunity for us and our FIFA player community. We've got a long history of bringing that event to life for our fan base, dating all the way back to World Cup 1998, so no new announcement on that yet. But as the event gets closer in 2018, we'll be able to detail a lot more of how we're thinking about bringing the event to life for the global FIFA community.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of San Phan with Mizuho.","San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for touching on \u2013 giving some more color on sales and marketing for next quarter, but I was wondering. Can you tease out what you mentioned earlier on the step-up in OpEx, maybe on the R&D side with the new genres? And perhaps how much of the increase is more a timing issue versus the higher run rate for R&D?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So we will have a slightly higher run rate for R&D. We're building out a new studio in Montreal, as we've told everyone. And we've hired over 100 people into that studio that are brand new to EA. This is to build the new IP around Jade Raymond's team that she has been building. I was in that studio last month and it's a wonderful new addition to our team. And we brought our BioWare Montreal team into that same facility, so they now all sit in one new studio together.","We're obviously investing in Anthem, which everyone got a chance to see at E3. That's out of the BioWare Edmonton team, and they're very excited. We'll see some increases around that in terms of spending. And then we're continuing to invest across all of our network and platform activities. I don't see any of those going beyond the targets that we've talked about, trying to keep R&D expense in the 21% to 22% of revenue range. But the goal is to drive new revenue. And if for some reason we weren't able to drive new revenue, clearly that would be overspending, but we're very confident that we can drive new revenue around the action genre and continuing live service build-out across all of our products.","San Q. Phan - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter. Just a quick one I guess on Battlefront II. Obviously, you guys have done a lot of work with the first version. I think, Andrew, you said that maybe YouTube videos was up over the original. But do you have any specific data at this point that would suggest that this game could outsell Battlefront 1? And then just to confirm, I think you've said before you're looking for 14 million units within your guidance. I don't know if that's correct or not, but any thoughts there would be helpful.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Hey, Mike, just I'll let Andrew answer, but you broke in and out a little bit on the last. I think were you saying, are you changing your 14 million unit number for guidance? Is that what you asked?","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","No. I wasn't getting there yet. I may have gotten there, but I just wanted to clarify that was the number, Blake.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes, that was and still is the number, but I'll let Andrew talk a little bit about the demand generation and how the products are shaping up.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah, thanks, Mike. If anyone got to see the title in around EA PLAY, or at E3 in Sony's booth, the title is coming together really, really strong. The sentiment is really strong. The single-player campaign is resonating really, really well with the community as well as the depth and breadth expansion in multi-player. The video of user up significantly, as I talked about in the prepared notes. We have not changed our unit expectation on that at this point, but we're very, very happy with the progress in the game and very energized by the positive feedback we're receiving from the community.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And Disney has been a great partner for us. They had our lead protagonist on the stage with characters from the Star Wars movie at their D23 celebration last month, and we're very excited about continuing to leverage the upcoming movie as well as the buzz that is generated around Star Wars, and so more to come. I think we're trying to be careful that we don't get ahead of ourselves on unit forecasts. And as I said earlier, it's still really early in the year.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Fair enough, thank you. Just one quick one, another one for me. I was hopeful you could sort of walk us through maybe the competitive setup this holiday. Obviously, not a holiday release but Destiny is coming out fairly soon in September, and then you have Call of Duty. That's a boots on the ground similar to play experience you had with Battlefield 1. And you also have Battlegrounds on Xbox, which obviously is catching a lot of buzz and also is boots on the ground, so I'm curious how you think all these four titles will play out and maybe the opportunity or threat that could create for you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","You have Assassins as well, not to just throw more fuel on your fire. I guess we've got boots in space versus boots on the ground. So what we found historically, we've had many times where we've gone into quarters that looked daunting because of the competition. Think back to GTA when it came out, and what was actually found is it grows the overall market. It drives console sales. Oftentimes, many of those titles get bundled to help drive or reduce the price of a console for the consumer, and it drives excitement in the marketplace, and we like that. It benefits the consumer and it benefits us because it generates a lot of buzz around games.","We've always competed against most of those titles you mentioned or all those titles you've mentioned. And so I don't think it bothers us, but it excites us, I'd say instead. And you might remember, no Red Dead that was originally in the plans for our third quarter, fourth quarter of the calendar year, so that does open up a little bit of opportunity, I think, for everybody.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi there. Can you guys hear me okay?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes. Welcome to the team, Laura.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. I'm really excited to be here. So I guess I have three like little ones. So I'm wondering if you've seen player engagement fall on Madden as a reflection of the weakness in NFL TV ratings, or if you've seen those things to be disconnected. That's my first one.","My second one is just philosophically, marketing, I would have guessed that marketing expense in your mind was more of a substitute for your license fees because, to your point, you do have soccer starting or football starting or you're going to have Star Wars released. To me, those feel like marketing \u2013 again, marketing parallels that should cut your marketing fees \u2013 expenses, so I'm wondering how do you think about license fees as a substitute for marketing or do you not think of it that way? And then I'd love on your update on VR\/AR, and where you are likely stand in future games?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Why don't I have Andrew hit the first and the last question on VR and then the first question on the NFL?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So I'll start with VR and AR. Not a lot of new news on VR for us and as you see there's not a lot of new news for VR in the industry. People seem to have come to terms of the fact that VR while an unbelievably wonderful innovation for how you consume interactive entertainment and all forms of entertainment for that matter is going to take a couple of years at least to going to get to a point where it is truly a mass market consumer opportunity. We still are in the same position we were in which we have enabled core VR capability in our Frostbite engine.","We have delivered a console experience in the course of delivering a mobile experience and we'll continue to push on the boundaries of what's a sports game look like inside of VR? What's first person shooter look like in VR? What's an action adventure game look like in VR? And that's really at a design level and something that will start to manifest in the marketplace in the years to come.","AR I think is more interesting. I think the notion of a data overlay into your mobile console PC games are something that takes things that are important, interesting about you whether that's geo-data or whether that's game play data or friends data, that you are able to allow the game to utilize to enhance and extend your experience. I think, we're likely to see more of that sooner and certainly, our creative teams are really thinking about what kind of data would a player want to use from their real world to augment their virtual world and you should expect to see more of that from us also in the coming months and years.","As it relates to Madden, again what you might also recall is while there was a lot of articles in the early part of the season around slower TV ratings around football, post-November the ratings were actually very strong and ultimately end up with one of the most exciting Super Bowls in recent history. And, again, Tom Brady who was the chief architect of that excitement is on the cover of our Madden game this year, so we're very happy to have him.","In terms of engagement for us, what we actually saw was more engagement in our Madden game and more engagement in Madden Ultimate Team and so we feel very good about that. We believe we are introducing, engaging and on boarding a new and young audience to football fandom and are excited by what we're going to do this year with Madden on Frostbite with Longshot and then many developments and innovations that come with it.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And on the marketing question. We do try to offset our marketing expenses where we have royalties, so in our sports titles where we're paying a royalty, we try to leverage our partners like FIFA or the NBA or the NFL to help us market as much as possible and in some cases we do a good job of that offset, in some cases it's not fully offset. I'd say the thing to remember is in Q2, we've got FIFA, Madden, NBA, NHL and The Sims 4 all coming out on console, plus we've got \u2013 we continue to fuel all of our mobile titles during that same timeframe and PC free-to-play titles. And so just simple along, we didn't have NBA last year, we didn't have The Sims last year, so both of those are going to be additive to the marketing expense in the quarter. But also, as I mentioned earlier, we're doing a lot of long lead-time marketing for the third quarter titles like Need for Speed or Battlefront.","And despite the partnerships that we have, those still take money to market or to make sure that we're spreading the word around the quality and the excitement of the games. And so, the combination of where the titles fall and how the marketing has changed over time is how you're seeing some of the differences there in OpEx.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Super helpful. Thanks guys, very much.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Evan Wingren with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thanks. You gave the Ultimate Team population was up 11% year-on-year. I wonder if you could give us an update on the trends in terms of the number of payers and the magnitude of the payers and what the growth rates are as well there.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah, I mean, without getting into too much numbers, what I can tell you is, the number of people that buy the game and then join Ultimate Team continues to go up. FIFA is the leader across all of our Ultimate Teams in that respect and we believe the story mode last year helped drive much of that growth, so more people coming into Ultimate Team from the core game and more people starting to spend money realizing that it is very fun and if they spend some money it will be even be more fun.","And also the amount of dollars they spend are continuing to go up over time. As we add new ways to play and new content to play with, that gives them more things to spend money on over time. So it's a win-win across-the-board. It's more engagement, more enjoyment and more things to actually spend on which is driving the success of all of the Ultimate Teams.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Got it. And it looks like, if I did my math right, the gross margin expansion in 1Q was around 700 basis points and then in the Q2, the, I guess, sequential improvement in gross margins on a year-over-year basis was down a little bit. Is that just tied to higher royalty costs or is there something else going on that would prohibit more margin expansion?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah, it's mainly tied to the fact that we have four sports titles that all have royalties to them in the quarter and as those titles continue to be successful, that's obviously impacts the gross margin particularly in the second quarter. We'll get some offset with The Sims, but not enough to offset all of it.","We also tend to have fairly conservative forecasts on digital, because it's hard for us to guess exactly how fast the consumer will move to digital. So clearly, if more digital live services occur or more full-game downloads occur, there could be some upside to that gross margin number.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Thank you very much.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","One last question.","Operator","And our final question comes from the line of Raymond Stochel with Consumer Edge Research.","Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Hi guys. Thanks for squeezing me in on the call. You guys have a big bucket of initiatives in cloud streaming, AI, virtual human. So which initiative in that bucket would most likely to be financially impactful over the next three to five years? And then overall, how much are you spending on these initiatives as you are thinking long-term about your business?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Again, there's a lot of things that we're investing in and again we've \u2013 what we talked about in our prepared notes is we do believe there's going to be more change in the next five years in our industry than there has been in the last 45 years. And we want to ensure that we're on the frontline of that transformation and disruption in our business.","As we think about those things, we are very focused in our investment. We don't have hundreds and hundreds of people working on these types of projects. We are very calculated and targeted in how we invest and in terms of where we think the greatest return will come. For many of those things, we actually think the time horizon is about five years plus, but things like cloud and streaming, we believe, is probably in the two to five-year timeframe.","When we think about subscription, we're already seeing return from that and the combination of that with streaming on that two to five-year time horizon could be very meaningful in terms of revenue addition for us. And so as we think about the future, we're always going to have small squads thinking about new technology and we think about it on what are we building for this fiscal year? What are we building for the next 24 months. What are we building for the next 24 months to 5 years and how are we thinking about 5 years plus. And you should expect the five years plus a very, very small targeted teams, to two to five years a slightly bigger and much of our investment is around delivering in the next 24 months.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I think just two things to note is we started investing on the foundation to be able to have a streaming business or a subscription business three or four years ago, and much of our investment around cloud has gone on over the last couple of years and we feel like we're in a very good position there. So don't assume it's all going to start some time now. Much of it's already baked in. The second thing is part of the change that we've tried to drive at EA is we ask the simple question, if we're going to invest in this what are we going to stop investing in. We can't do everything. And the organization is very focused around that and very much positive when we ask that question in a way of trying to constantly reprioritize what's the most important thing to do today and we think that will also help us manage that investment, so we don't show up in the future with a big surprise.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","With that, we'll end the call. We'll talk to everyone next quarter. Thank you.","Andrew P.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I'd like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Rob Sison, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Rob Sison","Thank you. Welcome to EA's fiscal 2014 first quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are Larry Probst, our Executive Chairman; Blake Jorgensen, our CFO; and Peter Moore, our COO. Frank Gibeau, our President of Labels, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call and a transcript.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-K for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of July 23, 2013, and disclaims any duty to update them.","During this call, unless otherwise stated, the financial metrics will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Larry.","Lawrence F. Probst","Thank you, Rob. Our performance in the first quarter reflects an important trend we have identified in the past year. Digital revenue from strong brands projected across multiple platforms has become a major component of our business.","In Q1, 76% of our non-GAAP revenue was digital, driven by the online services of blockbuster franchises like Battlefield and FIFA, as well as our strong mobile portfolio.","Blake will provide more detail on our financials, but EA has delivered revenue and EPS above our guidance. We did this through a combination of stronger-than-expected digital revenue and cost controls. Our results also reflect the phasing of expenses out of Q1 into future quarters. We realize this is just one quarter and there is a lot of work in front of us, but we think this is a solid step toward our ambitious goal of holding expenses flat in a console transition year.","As you know, I am serving an interim role as Executive Chairman, while the Board of Directors searches for a new CEO. In this capacity, I have identified 3 priorities on which I can update you today:","First, we are managing the business with continued focus on our upcoming product launches and disciplined cost controls to generate growth on both the top and bottom line.","Second, I am assisting the Board of Directors in searching for a new CEO. While we have nothing specific to share today, the Board is fully engaged in this process and evaluating both internal and external candidates.","Third, and most important, we are working to ensure that EA delivers the very best games and services on the new consoles, current-generation systems, PC and mobile. Again, the early returns demonstrate we are making significant progress and consumers are excited about our products. Last month at E3, our teams took home 116 awards from more than 220 nominations, more than any other publisher.","Later in the call, Peter Moore will tell you about our publishing strategy, and Frank Gibeau is here to answer your questions about product development. We are incredibly excited about the momentum our teams have generated, but we aren't taking anything for granted. We have a lot of work ahead of us. EA is committed to creating and marketing the industry's best games and services and equally committed to doing it without increasing our cost.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Blake Jorgensen.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Thanks, Larry. Starting with our Q1 results, EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $495 million, which was above our guidance and Q1 last year. This quarter was marked by continued strong sales of Battlefield 3 and FIFA 2013, as well as solid performance from the rest of our catalog titles.","EA's Q1 non-GAAP digital net revenue also contributed significantly to the higher-than-expected results. Digital net revenue increased by 17% year-over-year to $378 million, and accounted for 76% of this quarter's revenue. Our digital business continues to be a diversified mix of high growth, profitable segments. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 28% to a record $1.72 billion.","Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performances of each business: First, extra content and free-to-play contributed $177 million, up 35% over the prior year, led by sustained growth in FIFA Ultimate Team, as well as Star Wars: The Old Republic and FIFA Online 3. This revenue relates to businesses -- or business on PC or consoles where consumers can enhance or extend their gaming experience by buying additional digital content.","Second, our mobile business generated $103 million for the quarter, up 30% over the prior year. Smartphones and tablets continue to represent a majority portion of the revenue, accounting for $90 million of the $103 million total, growing 73% year-over-year. The Simpsons: Tapped Out and Real Racing 3 continue to be key contributors. Given the significant global growth in the smartphone and tablet markets, we are very focused on this business.","Third, full game downloads represent $37 million, up 12% over the prior year. This revenue is driven by PC-centric products. Solid performance by Battlefield 3 and The Sims 3, both popular PC titles, contributed to the increase in full game downloads.","And fourth, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $61 million, down 25% over the same period last year. In the previous year, the Star Wars: Old Republic was a subscription-only based MMO. This year, some of the revenue was recognized in the free-to-play category as we expanded this title to be both a subscription and free-to-play game. If you were to combine all of our extra content, free-to-play with subscriptions, ads and others, we saw more than 10% growth over the same period last year.","Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 63.8%, better than our guidance and an increase from 61.5% in Q1 last year. The increase was due to our focused efforts to reduce online support costs and solid results from our digital revenue offerings.","Operating expenses for the quarter were $477 million, $53 million lower than our guidance. Some of the lower operating expenses are due to our cost control program taking hold, but a majority of the positive variance is due to phasing of key expenses in both marketing and headcount.","As a reminder, on the last call, we prioritized a fiscal operating plan with a disciplined approach to cost control. Consequently, we anticipated incurring severance payments with the majority of the costs to be recognized in the first quarter. We executed on most of our planned actions and this quarter, we believe we are well positioned to hold our operating costs essentially flat to last year.","The resulting non-GAAP loss was $0.40 per share, exceeding our guidance due to strong revenues, higher gross margin and lower operating expenses, primarily attributed to delayed spending.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $1.41 billion or $4.60 per share. Roughly 50% of this cash in short-term investment balance is held out by the U.S.","Net cash used in operating activities for the quarter was $248 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $320 million, which is relatively flat compared to Q4 of fiscal 2013.","During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares. However, we are still committed to our program, which, as a reminder, is a $500 million share repurchase program initiated a year ago. At this point, the total shares repurchased under this program remains at 22 million at a total cost of $278 million.","Before providing guidance, we want to remind you of one specific GAAP-related item we discussed last quarter. We have developed a deeper relationship with our gamers, resulting from our growing games-as-a-service model. Our consumers are playing our games online over longer period of time, and this longer period affects the length of time over which we are required to recognize GAAP revenue. This fiscal year, we are lengthening the recognition period, resulting in an estimated $500 million of net revenue being deferred into fiscal '15. This longer-service period has no impact on our non-GAAP revenue or cash flows.","Turning to guidance and focusing on Q2. GAAP revenue is expected to be $625 million as compared to $711 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be $1.22, as compared to $1.21 per share in the prior year.","Our non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $975 million, a 10% decrease over last year's $1.08 billion. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, we tempered our expectations on current generation titles as we are in the late stages of the console cycle, and all this quarter's packaged goods revenue will be driven by current generation offerings. This quarter, we expect to launch 5 major titles, including one free-to-play game. We also expect to release 5 mobile titles. Peter will provide more insights regarding these launches.","Our non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 61%, slightly better than prior year, due to the positive impact we have seen from our digital product mix.","Operating expenses will be impacted by the phasing of some of our operating expenses from Q1. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses to be $550 million. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.12 per share as compared to $0.15 per share last year.","For fiscal year 2014, we are reiterating our non-GAAP guidance announced at the beginning of the year. Net revenue of $4 billion and $1.20 of fully diluted EPS. The GAAP guidance is estimated to be $3.5 billion in revenue, and a loss per share of $0.98.","We recognize that our Q1 results were ahead of our guidance, but let me point out: Q1's revenue represents only 12% of our forecasted non-GAAP annual revenue, and was primarily driven by catalog titles. As I've said earlier, some of our favorable operating expense results were due to phasing, and we expect that spending to occur in future quarters. Our most significant quarters, which still presents sizable risks and opportunities, are ahead of us.","Using a sports analogy, we just got through the preseason. And while we may have won all of our games, the regular season is just getting started with Q2.","Now with that, I'll turn the call over to Peter.","Peter Robert Moore","Thanks, Blake. Today, I'm going to provide some perspective on 3 topics: First, an update on our performance on consoles to mobile in the first half of the year; second, a report on our progress in Asia; and third, an outline of our strategy for marketing games for both Gen4 and current generation systems, when the new hardware launches this holiday.","I'll start with our performance to date. As both Larry and Blake mentioned, our first quarter was defined by the powerful ongoing performance of 2 flagship franchises, Battlefield and FIFA.","FIFA 13 has been in the market for 10 months now, and Battlefield 3 for 20 months. Yet during this calendar year, both continue to chart among the Western World top 20 performing games, with FIFA still in the top 5. These blockbusters keep delivering with a service model that provides more content for the consumer and a revenue stream that extends months, even years after launch.","On mobile, EA continues to chart breakout hits based on big brands. I'll start with The Simpsons: Tapped Out, which debuted on iOS in 2012. In June, we released the Waterfront update, which drove Daily Active Users to 5.9 million in the quarter and established the game as the #5 top-grossing app on both iPhone and iPad in the U.S. The Krustyland update is scheduled to release at the end of this month, and we're developing more updates to keep Simpsons fans engaged.","Next is The Sims FreePlay for iOS and Android. This is a great example of how a big brand can be extended across multiple platforms. In Q1, The Sims was among the top 10 grossing games on iPad in both the U.S. and the U.K.","Real Racing 3 has earned a huge fan base for bringing console-quality graphics to iOS and Android. This month, Real Racing 3 released an update, which adds new courses and features such as time trials and cars from Mercedes-Benz and Bentley.","This is a big year for EA's PopCap studio, and we're seeing a lot of consumer excitement over Plants vs. Zombies 2, which will debut on iOS at the end of this quarter. The game is now in soft launch on iOS in New Zealand and Australia and has reached the #1 ranking for free-to-play games in both markets. All over the world, there is anticipation building for this one. I think PopCap is about to deliver another big winner.","One final note on mobile. As both Larry and Blake mentioned, our quarter was notable for the high percentage of revenue attributable to digital games and services. To that end, Apple was EA's biggest retail partner measured by sales, and that, is a first.","Next, I want to highlight some of the progress we're making in Asia. In December, we partnered with Nexon to launch the beta version of FIFA Online 3 in Korea. Since then, the game has become the #1 online sports game based on traffic and revenue in Korea and the #2 game in Korean PC caf\u00e9s.","Later today in Shanghai, EA, and Chinese publisher, TenCent, will announce a similar agreement to bring FIFA Online 3 to that country as well. It's hard to frame this one without superlatives: The world's biggest online publisher is bringing the world's biggest sports game to the world's biggest market.","Together, these 2 partnerships represent a growth opportunity for EA in Asia. Teaming up with publishers of the caliber of Nexon and TenCent provides local expertise and deep insight into the largest market for games-as-a-service.","In the months ahead, we expect to forge additional agreements to bring EA's biggest brands to new consumers in Asia and other new markets.","Next, I want to share some insight into our strategy for supporting the launch of the next-generation consoles while servicing the millions of consumers paying on current generation systems. This is particularly important this year when the new hardware launches shortly after the release of our biggest sports games.","Consumers are acutely aware that new hardware is coming. Neither company has shared their specific volume targets, but there are outward signs of strong customer demand. Microsoft reports that Xbox One presales are trending ahead of the 360 during the same time period, and major U.S. retailers have sold out of their pre-sell allotments.","And PlayStation believes this will be their biggest hardware launch ever. So we believe that the key indicators are pointing to a strong launch for both consoles in the holiday window.","The new systems are spectacular and we expect millions of players will quickly make the transition to better graphics, online features and motion control. Our job as a publisher is to provide an easy migration for the millions of players who choose to transition onto the new hardware.","EA SPORTS offers a snapshot of how we plan to do this. Madden NFL will launch on the current generation consoles on August 27th, and FIFA will follow worldwide by September 27th. Next generation versions will debut on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in the holiday quarter.","Today, we announced that FIFA 14 will allow players to transfer their full roster of Ultimate Team players and in-game items from Xbox 360 to Xbox One and from PS3 to PS4.","Our Madden franchise will provide a similar service, and EA SPORTS will have more news on easing the transition when we present at gamescom in August. Our goal is to make moving date painless to welcome players onto the new consoles with the minimum distraction and inconvenience.","Finally, an update on product quality. We couldn't be happier with the quality of the games our teams are producing or the early reception those games are getting from critics and consumers. As many of you who attended can attest, EA had a spectacular showing at E3. We received 220 nominations and brought home a record 116 awards, including Best of Show and a slew of top honors for Titanfall from Respawn. Need for Speed Rivals won Best Racing Game. On NHL franchise, a perennial favorite with critics, won Best Sports Game. Two other games drew spectacular praise: Battlefield 4 coming this year from our DICE Studio and from PopCap, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare.","Now as everyone knows, this is a hit-driven industry, and this year, EA has a engineered an incredible lineup of proven blockbusters and new IP. The quality, quantity and sheer magnitude of titles coming from our studios in the next 12 months will define our leadership on the next generation of hardware. We're making incredible games, and we're planning to give them all the marketing and sales support they deserve.","With that, I'll hand it back to Larry.","Lawrence F. Probst","Thank you, Peter. I want to reiterate what Peter said about the line-up of proven franchises and new intellectual property that we showed at E3. We couldn't be more proud of those games, and of the people who are building them.","In summary, EA is in very good shape. We are executing on a clear set of goals for leadership on mobile, PC, current-generation systems and next-generation consoles. The big bets we've made with blockbusters like FIFA, Madden, NBA Live, NHL, Battlefield 4, Sims 4, Need for Speed Rivals and Plants vs. Zombies are resonating with critics and consumers.","We believe both Sony and Microsoft are offering a compelling value proposition for consumers, a big step-up in technology and an attractive price.","Our mobile titles are extremely popular around the world and show great staying power with frequent content updates.","All of this is happening in parallel with a renewed commitment of cost discipline and margin improvement. Our plan is to hold year-over-year operating expenses flat, a formidable goal in a hardware transition year and a first in the history of this company.","I'll finish by thanking our employees and our investors for their ongoing commitment to Electronic Arts.","And with that, Blake, Frank, Peter and I will take your questions.","Rob Sison","Andy?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Williams.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","BMO Capital Markets. Just looking at the September quarter and your expectations for current-gen software sales. What are you -- what are you looking for as far as year-over-year comparisons for some of those key sports titles?","Blake J. Jorgensen","This is Blake. As we talked about in the last quarter's guidance, component of the call when we were giving full year guidance, we helped people understand that Gen3 sports titles would be down year-over-year, slightly, with the exception of FIFA, which we believe will continue to see growth because of the strength of that franchise around the globe and that sport around the globe. We are conscious of the fact that some of those titles will also sell on Gen4, Madden for example, FIFA, NHL, and we want to make sure that we're marketing those titles into Gen4 and making that transition as smooth as possible, as Peter mentioned. But for the year, we're assuming, because some of those titles ship before the Gen4 boxes are out, that the total franchise, both Gen3 and Gen4, will be down slightly and that's built into our guidance.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then as a follow-up to that, as you look to the fiscal year to your $4 billion top line, how much of Gen4 are you looking for out of that?","Blake J. Jorgensen","It's a relatively small portion. We haven't carved it out publicly. But since the installed base of Gen4 will still be relatively small even through the Christmas cycle or holiday cycle and the bulk of our titles fall in the first 3 quarters of the year, our assumptions are that a relatively small portion of our total revenue will actually be Gen4 this year.","Operator","Colin Sebastian.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Robert Baird. I guess first off, Frank or Peter, at E3, you talked about lean back games and the opportunity for new business models on top of premium pricing. If maybe you can update us on how quickly we should expect some of those alternative models on franchises like Battlefield and Need for Speed and others? And in terms of the revenue upside, it looks like most of that came from the digital side of the business. Blake, maybe if you could break that out for us versus packaged goods. And as follow-up to Ed's question, given some of the positive data points on pre-orders for next gen, which is good obviously, are you seeing consumers pulling back on current gen purchases more or less than you anticipated at the start of the year?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, this is Frank. I'll start with the first question. The good news is we're seeing that those alternative business models are already in action with games like FIFA and Battlefield. So now if you look at Ultimate Team and how we performed in fiscal '13 for FIFA, that was a $200 million digital opportunity for us. And going forward, those alternative business models, as it relates to Battlefield Premium and FIFA Ultimate Team, will continue expanding, continue to grow as the online capabilities of the Gen4 machines really manifest themselves and become real. We'll seek to expand those opportunities across additional franchises. And we are experimenting with some additional business models that you'll see come out as we release new IPs and new titles over the first 24 months of the Gen4 platforms.","Blake J. Jorgensen","So on the digital piece, Sebastian, so $495 million total net revenue for the quarter. Of that, $378 million was digital, and that's a year-over-year growth of about 17%. I think important as well is the trailing 12 months now has total digital at $1.7 billion, or 28% year-over-year trailing 12-month growth. Inside the digital business, we tried to break out for people here in the formal part of the script, the key components. The mobile side of the business, up 30%. That's pretty consistent with the guidance we provided during our call last quarter for the full year. And that really is being driven by continued growth of The Simpsons franchise, Real Racing and FIFA Online 3 in Asia. And the part of the business that is also up big is an extra content business. We'd actually guided for the full year for that to be flat, because many of the social titles that we took out of the year, last year as part of our restructuring process. But the FIFA Online or FIFA Ultimate Team business continues to perform extremely well and drove that business up 35%. In addition, as you know, we started a free-to-play Star Wars business, and part of that is showing up in the extra content. So you're seeing the subscription business down 25%. That's a reduction -- some of the people moving away from Star Wars subscriptions and playing the free-to-play, which is helping drive the extra content side of the equation. And then last but not least, full game downloads was up about 12%. A lot of that is based on both franchises that Peter mentioned earlier, Battlefield and FIFA, where people are continuing to buy full game download versions of that even well into the second year of that franchise.","Peter Robert Moore","Okay, Colin, this is Peter. And your question -- your final question on pre-orders, yes. This is something that, of course, you and I have seen over the years. It transitions as the consumers are anticipating the next gen hardware. We're seeing softness, in particular, on our key sports titles on current gen pre-orders. I think consumers anticipate getting the new hardware. We certainly came out of E3 with renewed enthusiasm for new hardware, and I think that's being reflected in current gen pre-orders. The only difference being that we are actually seeing strong pre-orders for Battlefield 4 versus where we were on Battlefield 3 at this time prior to launch. So softness as anticipated and as planned in pre-orders for sports titles right now. Probably the exception on that is FIFA, which we continue to see great anticipation around the world. I think pre-orders will start to come in late as consumers start to realize that there may be not enough hardware to go around for every consumer in the world to buy a next gen piece of hardware. But this is as planned, as anticipated. I do see and expect to see some pickup as we get closer to launch.","Operator","Justin Post.","A. Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Justin Post, Merrill Lynch. Could we move into a little, couple extra questions on digital. What really is driving the upside to your plan so far? And do you think that does carry forward and give you optimism on future quarters? And then secondly, can you give us any update on the plan for the Battlefield digital? Will it be a subscription or will it be map pack downloads? Any help on how you're going to kind of monetize the digital on that title?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Sure. So I'll start and then I'll let Frank follow up on the Battlefield part of the question. We're not going to, Justin, give any new guidance relative to our digital growth. I think if there was a surprise in the quarter, it was the continued strength of FIFA Ultimate Team, as well as continued growth in full game downloads for some of the franchises that, frankly, are at the tail end of their life. Battlefield 3, for example, this is still going strong even though we're getting close to shipping Battlefield 4. So that helped drive some of the full game download. Star Wars continues to do well, and obviously, the mobile business is growing with the growth of the mobile platforms around the globe and we're benefiting from that. I think we're pretty consistent in where we think our guidance originally was on the growth there. And if that changes a lot, we'll let you know about it in future quarters. But right now, I think the general focus should be that the guidance is about the same on digital and on packaged goods going forward.","Frank D. Gibeau","This is Frank. On Battlefield 4 digital, we have nothing to announce on that particular approach today. We'll have some announcements coming in the next several weeks. So we'll give you more clarity and understanding of what we're going to do there.","Operator","Arvind Bhatia.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Sterne Agee. Good quarter, guys. I wanted to ask you about the earnings beat that you mentioned, some of that coming from the phasing of operating expenses. Blake, wondering if you might be able to provide some more granularity there. Just how much of that beat was expense related? Obviously, you've beaten the top line as well. And my second question is on Facebook games, where we see a general slowdown. You've pulled back a little bit. Just help us think about expectations going forward on that business.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Sure. Let me hit the over delivery in Q1, and then I'll have Frank talk a little bit about Facebook games. So we are being cautious because obviously, 12% of our revenue plan has been achieved in Q1. We've got 24% phasing in Q2 and 45% in Q3. That's a lot of revenue ahead of us. And many of our costs are variable: Marketing, outside contractors that help a lot of the last-minute game testing that goes on, as well as purely the margin associated with the games volumes. And so since we've got so much ahead, we feel like some of the cost will get phased into those quarters, and we could use that or need that, and thus we're not changing our guidance. I think the other way to look at it is we've got 130-plus percent of our EPS to now go -- to go bring in, still a lot of work ahead. And I think all of us are focused on trying, as Larry said, maintain the flat cost year-over-year. We're confident that we can do that. But as part of our plan, we will not -- don't get ahead of ourselves by moving up guidance too quickly.","Frank D. Gibeau","This is Frank. As we look at our content plans out over the next several years, some of the things that we looked at was frankly the opportunity cost of these different platforms versus each other. And for Electronic Arts, we saw a much bigger opportunity and much bigger audience on mobile and on the consoles for the types of products and brands that we have. So we've de-prioritized the social segment for our portfolio and moved those resources and teams to focus in on the opportunity in mobile, as well as to help us continue to grow and maintain the console side of the business. There's still a very active gaming business on Facebook and in the social channels, and we do participate there with several franchises and services. But our emphasis and focus over the next several years is going to be on mobile and HD consoles.","Operator","Doug Creutz.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes, Cowen and Company. Talking about sports a little bit. Obviously, you guys shipped NCAA Football a couple of weeks ago, and I wonder if you could share how that's trending versus last year and sell-through so far?","Peter Robert Moore","Doug, it's Peter. Yes, as we said a couple of times now on the call, we anticipated a little bit of a slowdown in current gen. It's a current gen-only title. It's tracking below where we were with last year's title and nothing that we didn't anticipate, a long way to go yet, obviously, in selling this title through, but we're down versus where we were last year.","Operator","Stephen Ju.","Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Credit Suisse. So Peter, curious as to the terms of the licensing agreement with TenCent for FIFA Online 3. Shall we assume that the rev share here is a fairly standard split for most games being released in China? And any sense in terms of you when you start localization and closed beta testing and what's the government approval process? And Blake, will the new FIFA online distribution deals be booked on a gross or net basis on the P&L?","Peter Robert Moore","So Stephen, on the FIFA Online TenCent deal, we're actually going to be in Shanghai tonight. The team is on the ground there making the announcement. I'm going to leave some of the details for them. I don't want to steal the thunder of what's going on there, and we obviously are not going to disclose the actual terms. But to reiterate what I said on the call, world's biggest publisher -- digital online publisher, world's biggest market, world's biggest sport. It's all good.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes. All I'll add -- assume that we've baked into our forecast this year the business there. These types of arrangements take some time, as you know, to get up and running. We're very excited about the longer-term potential but we know it'll take some time. You should assume that we booked this as a net accounting, and also that the terms would be pretty standard with other type of terms you would see in a deal like this in China.","Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And any other regions -- you mentioned other regions. What other countries make sense for you after China?","Peter Robert Moore","Yes. We'll be announcing -- as I said, we'll be announcing further deals as we get further down the line but nothing to announce right now.","Operator","Brian Fitzgerald.","Brian Patrick Fitzgerald - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Jefferies. Maybe a quick follow-up to Doug's question. As you guys were assuming that the college football game is in next year's guidance, as you guys shift from NCAA to the Collegiate Licensing Company, what impact should we think about there? And then on the TenCent deal, should we expect FIFA to ramp as quickly in China as it did with Nexon in Korea?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, this is Frank. I'll take the NCAA license question. Basically, we are committed to the college football business. EA SPORTS is going to be publishing a college football game next year across multiple platforms with our partners at the Collegiate Licensing Company. And our fan base is going to see all the teams, conferences and innovative features that we're known for and what makes that franchise so great. So we don't think we're going to miss a beat here. The NCAA name and marks will leave the game, but the great game play content and capturing that college football spirit will be there for next year.","Peter Robert Moore","And Brian, on your question on the TenCent deal, actually, no. The thing that's different here is that we were rolling off a game with a different publisher, taking a user base and then migrating it very well as Nexon did on to the next version of the game in Korea. This is a little bit of a startup, if you will, with what TenCent is doing. So we see a slower ramp. We're not going to see much impact in this fiscal year. These are the types of things that build year 1, year 2, year 3 out. So in answer to your question, no. But the optimism for, again, world's biggest publisher, world's biggest game, world's biggest market is huge for us.","Operator","Michael Olson.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","It's Piper. The OpEx discipline continues to be impressive. Just curious if you could update us on where you think there might still be room to make changes there? And would it potentially come from additional removal of titles from the library? Is it ongoing digital mix growth or changes in marketing strategies? And also if you could give us any indication on how you're thinking about multiyear target op margin potential, that will be great to hear.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes. This is Blake. Our focus is continuing to try to drive OpEx, flat OpEx, which means really savings across the whole organization. We've talked about reorganizing marketing under Peter and really driving the marketing organization towards more active use of the online components of marketing, where we're connected with our customer base as much as possible and really leveraging that. Clearly, Frank's very focused on managing through the Gen4 transition and making sure that we're very focused on keeping our costs down while moving through that transition and trading out lower -- cost of the Gen3 titles that we'll start to transition over to Gen4. And then obviously, across all of the platform that our Chief Technology Officer, Rajat, has been driving really been to try to maintain and build a back office that allows us to deliver, digitally, all of the titles that we are planning on doing in our digital business all ourselves and bring our overall gross margins up with that. We've talked publicly about a multiyear plan. We're not giving multiyear guidance but we do see a path to operating margins that are clearly into the 20s. And we're all very focused on doing that and doing that without impacting -- more importantly or most importantly without impacting the quality of our games and the ability for us to deliver a great consumer experience.","Operator","James Hardiman.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Longbow Research. A couple of questions on Battlefield. Blake, you talked at E3 about Battlefield basically being the X factor in terms of getting to your guidance for the year. So I guess a couple of questions. Is Battlefield being roughly flat with 2011 still what you'd need to get to your $1.20 number or is it maybe a little bit easier than that given the first quarter beat? And then is there anything that you saw at E3 or within the quarter that makes you feel any better or any worse about the likelihood of Battlefield 4 meeting or exceeding Battlefield 3? And I guess just finally, if you care to give us any update in terms of the total sales to date of Battlefield 3, just as an idea of installed base, so to speak, as we get closer to Battlefield 4.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes. I'll -- let me start and then Frank can get you -- probably a give you a little bit more color on what's going on with Battlefield or Peter as well. We're very optimistic based on what we saw coming out of E3. The excitement that was on the floor, the excitement around our press conference, the fact that we had 64 players playing virtually nonstop every hour the booth was open, was a very big positive, not to mention all of the nominations we got for awards. All of that continues to help us signal that we should be able to do what we did for Battlefield 3 in the year which its shipped, our fiscal '12. I don't want to speculate today if we're going to ship more or less than that. I think we're still sticking with the guidance that we provided. And a big Battlefield is obviously important to us but we're very focused on that as the marketing floor is very much in gear. And I don't know if Peter or Frank want to add to that.","Frank D. Gibeau","I'll just add that we were -- that the DICE team was very encouraged and excited by the reception at E3. We will be publishing the game across 5 platforms this Christmas, and we're excited about how we're matching up against the competition and what the generation 4 technology on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is going to enable us to do. We have a lot of innovation happening in the multiplayer game and new online features. But in addition to that, the single player experience has got even more epic than in Battlefield 3. So we feel like it's a generation ahead of Battlefield 3. We believe that we will exceed expectations, and it's very exciting around here right now in terms of the teamwork that we're putting against Battlefield 4.","Peter Robert Moore","And James, one more point from me. As I mentioned earlier, our pre-orders are stacking up well versus Battlefield 3. We came off a very strong E3. As I travel the world and speak to retailers, there is incredible optimism and anticipation for this title. And Frank and his team and, in particular, the DICE team has done brilliantly coming out of E3. I think we're well positioned versus our competition in this segment. And our 50 million target, which is what we ended up and what we currently have at Battlefield 3 feels very achievable. So we're feeling good there.","Blake J. Jorgensen","To a part of your question as well, there's been an amazing length of the Battlefield franchise -- or lengthening of the Battlefield franchise, particularly with the premium offering, that we put in place. Everyone knows the deferred revenue that we have last year from Premium, it really speaks to the amount of players that are still actively involved with our franchise and continuing to buy both the original Battlefield 3, the Battlefield Premium offering and teeing up, as Peter said, with pre-orders for Battlefield 4.","Operator","Ben Schachter.","Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research","Macquarie. A couple of mobile questions and then just a quick follow-up on the guidance. There's so much focus on the next gen consoles that as you mentioned, Apple was your leading retail partner in mobile just becoming more important. Can you talk about the platform battle between iOS and Android? Are you seeing Google and Apple getting more competitive in the same way that you see the platform guys with Co-Op payments or development help, those kind of things and any potential change to the general 70-30 rev split? And then specifically just on Plants vs. Zombies 2 and the expectations, what does the revenue graph look like there? Is it a quick spike or is it slow growth? Is it -- does it last a long time? Any discussion around Plants vs. Zombies 2? And then finally, Frank mentioned some softness in the non-FIFA sports pre-orders. Is that the reason that the revenue beat in 1Q didn't flow through or was that already expected in guidance?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Let me just hit the bin [ph] on the last one real quickly. That was expected in guidance, and we're pretty -- it was exactly as we thought. We would see some softness in Gen3, and that's built into what we saw at the tail end of the quarter as well as our guidance for Q2.","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, this is Frank, I'll start and maybe Peter can dial in with some of answers here. Let me start with just the general shape of the mobile business. Right now, it's growing like gangbusters. And a lot of that is due to its global nature. It's a platform that appeals across multiple regions and multiple territories. But they're very unified platforms to publish into so it's very efficient for us. Google, the Android system versus iOS, it is a bit of a rivalry right now and there's a lot of competition and there's a lot of attention and capital being deployed there to try and grow their respective businesses. We publish on both. Over the last year, we've been really expanding our Android offerings across of our titles, and that has proven to be a key growth driver for us. And we see a lot of growth in front of us, especially driven by the blockbuster titles that we have in front of us. Plants vs. Zombies 2, which comes out at the end of this quarter, is a freemium design and we'll be releasing across iOS. It will have a curve that is typical of a free-to-play game, but what you notice in mobile is what takes several years to unfold in a console business happens in a few months in mobile. But you could anticipate that these titles are starting to feel bigger and bigger and bigger. And the curves which used to be a lot slower or lower and slow are, I think, actually starting to spike a little bit earlier. But the great thing is they're really sustaining. The Simpsons is now in its second year and is doing great revenue numbers. The Sims Freeplay, as Peter mentioned earlier on the call, is in its 18th month and is seeing record revenue days and weekends. So these live services that are constantly updated with features and content, we can keep alive for multiple years. So the ecosystem on Android, the ecosystem on iOS is very positive for Electronic Arts, and we're just moving from success to success in mobile.","Peter Robert Moore","Yes. And on the question on the publishers, we are absolutely as a platform-agnostic publisher, enjoying the same situation we have in consoles right now, which is Sony and Microsoft, we now have with Apple and Google. The growth, in particular, of the Android operating system, as Frank pointed out, now puts us in a very enviable position because of 2 things. We have world-class brands that consumers find very easily on both the App Store within Google Play, and you have brands now The Simpsons, Sims, Real Racing that are really starting to pull away from the competition there. So having both Google and Apple vie for our attentions and having our brands on their platforms is a very enviable position for EA and we continue to be able to leverage that going forward.","Operator","Eric Sheridan.","Eric James Sheridan - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sure, Eric Sheridan from UBS. A couple of quick ones. One, on the buyback, I just -- I know we've got a portion of the buyback remaining, but I also noticed that the guidance for the share count continues to tick up both next quarter and to the first fiscal year. So just wanted to sort of marry the view on the comments on the buyback with the guidance around share count. On the Origin, I don't think we've got an update on sort of subs or how you're thinking about Origin as a platform, we'd love to get that. And then on the last issue, maybe Blake, take another swing at the margin question. Is there any way you guys can quantify the development costs that are going in for next gen this year as a headwind in operating expenses, so we could sort of think about, organically, what you're taking out of the cost base as we move through the year?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes. Let me start and then I'll let Frank talk about Origin a little bit. So on the buyback, we don't assume in our guidance any buyback just because it's difficult to do. And you can see this year, our buybacks has not been -- we have -- did not operate it in the first quarter because of just simply where we are in our buyback grid. We are assuming in the share count just a basic attrition assumptions inside of our company as well as issuance assumptions as part of that. So that's all you're seeing there. And we'll keep people informed as we turn the buyback back on. Our intention is to continue to buy back stock, and we're simply in between stages of that program right now. Just quickly on the development cost, and then Frank can probably add to this, is that we've told The Street both last year and this year, that roughly $80 million to $100 million a year was built in last year, and then an incremental $80 million to $100 million on top of that this year. So you got a couple of hundred million dollars of Gen4 costs. Now there's offsets to that, both in terms of Gen3 costs as well as some of the other costs that we went in to try to bring down to make sure we can hold our operating costs flat. And, obviously, that will bleed off over time as we get better at developing Gen4 titles.","Frank D. Gibeau","This is Frank. If you think about high-definition console development from fiscal '13 to fiscal '14, it's flat year-over-year. What we've adjusted is the mix underneath. We're doing less current gen development, more next gen. So anything that starts to go up on next gen, Gen4-specific development is being offset by a reduction in either the SKU count or the investment in Gen3. So the mix is really what we're managing but keeping the total flat. So HD console spending flat year-over-year. As it relates to Origin, a quick update there is we're still seeing very strong growth. Digital titles like SimCity, Battlefield continue to push the full game download components of Origin. And we're committed to making that a world-class service for consumers that makes the games better. Total installs are now north of 50 million. Mobile installs are north of 22 million. We have over 500 third-party games available across the service. And we expect a very favorable year for Origin coming up, with Battlefield being a big launch for us at holiday and seeing continued sustained sales in The Sims business, as well as SimCity heading into the holiday. So we're committed to Origin, we like where we're at. We know we can do better and are committed to doing so and that's the update on Origin.","Operator","Drew Crum.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Stifel. I just want to get an update on the company's plans for pricing on next gen software. Also could you update us on your first-person shooter strategy once you move beyond Battlefield 4? And then finally, could you share with us your experience around monetization for Real Racing 3? I think you mentioned you have 45 million installs, which seems like a pretty successful game.","Peter Robert Moore","Yes. This is Peter. On the next gen pricing strategy, we have not announced obviously any pricing that is set by the retailer. We're working on our pricing strategy right now for the holiday. We need more information obviously from our first-party partners. But no announcements to make. Those will come from retailers when they set their prices.","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, this is Frank. On the shooter category at E3, we announced Battlefield 4, Titanfall, as well as Star Wars: Battlefront, which has a third person component to it, so we think of it in the same category. But generally, when you look at those 3 franchise opportunities, that's how we're going to build our shooter business going forward. We're very excited at the reception for all 3. Titanfall was the Game of the Show, Battlefield 4 did extremely well in terms of demand and reviews and an anticipated buzz, and then Star Wars: Battlefront, we showed, I think, 22 seconds of kind of where we're going with it and the fan response is very positive. The DICE team is well in the development on that product already. So we feel very bullish about our shooter rotation over the next several years. Real Racing 3 is a terrific experience for us, very high quality game, released and reached a very wide audience. We've been committed and will continue to be committed to releasing content, as Peter mentioned earlier. And we've added Mercedes-Benz and Bentleys to the experience. Because it's a live service, we will constantly be adjusting it and responding to user feedback and looking at the KPIs inside the economy and constantly tweaking and making that a better game and service over the long term. So we fully expect that we'll be in the Real Racing 3 business for years, much like we see with The Simpsons as well as Sims Freeplay.","Operator","Sean McGowan.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","From Needham. First question for Blake, on the expense phasing, can you talk a little bit about the headcount portion of that. Is that because people have not been hired who are going to be hired or because the recognition of expenses gets put off? And then second question, margin impact, as Origin grows, if that continues to grow as a percentage of the total business, what -- is there a gross margin impact of that growth or an operating margin impact of that growth?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes. So on the headcount piece, it's not a recognition issue, it's the slowing of hiring. Part of that's coming through the work that we're doing on just trying to maintain a leaner organization, and part of it is coming through the timing for when those people are required in the company. And so you might see continued hiring during the year. Right now, it's been down because of some of the actions we took in Q4 and early Q1. In terms of your second question, I've forgotten it.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Company, LLC, Research Division","Margin impact of Origin growth?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, margin impact of Origin. We've talked publicly about our goals to be driving gross margin as well as operating margin. And in the gross margin component, we've got a couple of things, which is, one, how do we operate a very strong platform, including Origin, to be able to do all of the servicing of online business from billing, collections, marketing and so forth. We clearly are bringing -- we've been bringing that in-house and that comes in-house at a lower cost to us, and we think that will help us continue to drive gross margin. As you see, we've gone from 55% in the mid-2000 timeframe to now 66%, and we think there's an opportunity to be able to drive that closer into the high 60s over the next couple of years and maybe into the 70s longer term. And so that's clearly our goal and Origin is great key component of that.","Frank D. Gibeau","All right. I think that's it.","Blake J. Jorgensen","All right.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I'll turn the meeting over to Mr. Rob Sison, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Rob Sison","Thank you. Welcome to EA's Fiscal 2014 Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO; and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO. Peter Moore, our COO; and Patrick S\u00f6derlund, our EVP of EA Studios, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call and a transcript.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding the future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of January 28, 2014, and disclaims any duty to update them.","During this call, unless otherwise stated, the financial metrics will be presented on a non-GAAP basis. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be and considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","One last note. In today's remarks, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360-related products will be referred to as current-gen or current-generation while PlayStation 4 and Xbox One-related products will be referred to as next-gen or next-generation.","Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Rob. In the third quarter of fiscal year '14, we had the unprecedented excitement of 2 new game consoles launching within weeks of each other. With that came the challenge of launching a full slate of EA's top titles for both next-gen and the current-gen consoles.","In terms of our quarterly performance, on the top line, we generated $1.57 billion in non-GAAP revenue, which was below our guidance of $1.65 billion. As others have noted, industry sales of major games for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles declined in Q3 at a faster-than-anticipated rate, and that softness was the primary driver of our revenue shortfall in Q3. This shortfall will impact our full year revenue guidance, and we are now forecasting our annual revenues to be $3.91 billion.","What's exciting for us looking forward is the uptake of next-gen consoles has been faster than we expected. The launches of the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Xbox One proved to be strong new catalysts for the console gaming market. The 6 titles we released with the launch of the next-generation consoles; FIFA 14, Battlefield 4, Madden NFL 25, Need for Speed Rivals, NBA LIVE 14 and Peggle 2, collectively sold above expectations and exceeded our Q3 forecasts.","As a result, we have taken an early leadership position on the next-gen consoles. Based on NPD December results in the U.S., EA achieved 40% segment share on the PlayStation 4 and 30% segment share on the Xbox One, and our estimates indicate we garnered similar shares in Europe. On average, every gamer in Europe that bought a next-gen console is playing one of EA's next-gen games. We're exceptionally proud to have been the #1 publisher on next-gen consoles in December, with millions of gamers playing EA titles on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One across the globe.","The popularity of our next-gen games has allowed us to benefit from this early growth, as illustrated by our segment share numbers. Looking forward, our goal is to keep our next-gen games fresh through live services, driving sales through Q4 and beyond as more gamers shift to the new consoles. We also have a robust pipeline in front of us as the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 player bases continue to grow.","EA's digital transition also continues at full speed. Our non-GAAP digital net revenue, including mobile, full-game downloads and live services was up 27% year-over-year, and we are on track to exceed our guidance of $1.7 billion in digital revenue for FY '14.","Inside our digital portfolio, December was EA's biggest month ever for mobile downloads, with over 71 million game downloads across the App Store and Google Play, the most of any game publisher worldwide. The Simpsons: Tapped Out reached a record level of daily active users during the holiday quarter, and The Sims FreePlay, a game that launched over 2 years ago, delivered its largest-ever month of revenue in December. These milestones demonstrate how mobile continues to be a fantastic opportunity for EA's expansion and revenue growth.","We are further strengthened by our financial discipline during this fiscal year. We continue to manage our costs and remain on track to lower our expenses year-over-year, an impressive achievement in a console transition cycle. However, this is not just an effort for FY '14. Long-term operating profit growth will continue to be an ongoing focus.","Benefiting from our position on next-gen consoles, digital growth and continued cost management, our Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.26 exceeded our expectations by $0.04 per share, and we are raising full-year EPS guidance today by $0.05 to $1.30 per share on a non-GAAP basis.","Before I turn the call over to Blake to give additional details of our financial performance, a quick word on one of the most talked about titles of Q3, Battlefield 4. Launching Battlefield was a complex effort, with our teams at DICE delivering a massive game packed with innovative new features for players on next-gen consoles, current-gen consoles and PC. Shortly after Battlefield 4 went live, we began hearing from some players in the community who were experiencing issues with the game. The Battlefield team acted swiftly to address the issues through game updates, and they continue to make refinements as part of our live service to ensure a great game experience for all Battlefield 4 players. Battlefield 4 is an amazing game in size, scope and gameplay, and we're confident that gamers will be playing for a long time to come.","Q3 was an exciting start to a new generation of games, a great quarter for digital growth and another positive step towards increasing operating profits. The stage is now properly set for the conclusion of our fiscal year, as well as the long-term opportunity in front of EA.","Over to you, Blake.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Thanks, Andrew. Turning to our Q3 results. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.57 billion, which was below our guidance but 33% higher than last year. Our revenue growth over Q3 last year was driven by Battlefield 4, FIFA 14, Madden NFL 25 and NHL 14.","And as a note, we deferred $36 million into Q4 from programs that allowed consumers to upgrade from current-generation titles to next-generation titles. Our Q3 revenue shortfall was driven by a much sharper decline than anticipated for demand -- in demand for next-generation or current-generation software, excuse me.","The industry showed signs of current-gen software market weakness in the third quarter, and in December, the U.S. NPD results reflected that trend with PS3 and Xbox 360 software sales declining 35% versus the prior year. Our quarterly results were negatively impacted by this trend, and some of our key titles, such as Battlefield 4, FIFA 14 and Need for Speed Rivals came in below our expectation for current-gen revenues.","This downward trend on current-gen software was partially offset by our positive next-gen results, and fortunately, this plays well for our future. Our Xbox One and PlayStation 4 software sales were well ahead of our expectations, led by FIFA 14, Need for Speed Rivals and Battlefield 4. Sales of each of these titles on next-gen platforms exceeded our forecast. Based on estimates, EA titles represented 35% of the Western World next-gen software market in the third quarter, and EA was the #1 publisher on PS4 and Xbox One in December.","Q3 non-GAAP digital net revenue continues to grow over the prior year. Digital net revenue increased by 27% year-over-year to $517 million. Trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 27% over the prior year to a record $1.86 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each business.","First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $213 million, up 15% over the prior year, led by the continued growth in FIFA Ultimate Team, FIFA Online 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Our year-to-date results for all of our Ultimate Team services; FIFA, Madden NFL and NHL Hockey, continued to demonstrate revenue growth year-over-year. Extra content growth was partially offset by our decision to sunset several of our social titles.","Second, our mobile business generated $125 million for the quarter, up 26% over the prior year and 19% over the prior quarter. Smartphones and tablets continue to represent the majority of the revenue, accounting for $110 million of the $125 million total, and growing 39% year-over-year.","Third, full game downloads added $113 million, up 157% over the prior year. This was largely driven by the launch of Battlefield 4 on PC in the quarter.","And finally, subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue totaled $66 million, down 16% over the same period last year. This was driven by a decline in POGO subscription and advertising revenue and a decline in Star Wars: The Old Republic subscription revenue as the fleet free-to-play offering continues to grow.","Moving on to gross margins. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 68.1%, up over last year's 65.7% and in-line with our guidance. The improvement was due to our product mix shift, as well as the growth in digital, lower transaction fees as we move away from the social business, and the benefits of our new digital platform.","Operating expenses for the quarter were $540 million, up 11% from last year and $60 million lower than our guidance. Operating expenses as a percentage of revenue was 34%, compared to 45% in the prior year. Our improving operating expense leverage illustrates the success of our cost control programs, as we continue to drive our operating margins above 20%, while remaining focused on investing in future growth.","The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $1.26 per share, which exceeded our guidance of $1.22 per share. Our EPS came in above our guidance due to our continued efforts to focus R&D investments on high-return opportunities and managing our marketing expenses through greater performance-based advertising strategies.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.07 billion or approximately $6.70 per share. Roughly 60% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held outside of the U.S.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $685 million compared to $363 million in the prior year. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was 666 -- or $664 million. This is the highest trailing 12-month operating cash flow for EA since 2005.","During the quarter, we did not repurchase any shares.","Now turning to guidance. With respect to our Q4 guidance, GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.07 billion, and GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $0.72. Our non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $800 million. This estimate factors in the steeper-than-anticipated declines we saw in current-gen software revenues. Also as a reminder, in Q4 last year, we launched 5 core titles and recognized the full year's Battlefield 3 Premium subscription revenue. This year, we will be launching 2 titles in the quarter and recording Battlefield 4 Premium subscription revenue on a ratable basis.","Our non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 71%, down against the prior Q4 gross margin of 74%. Our forecast in Q4 includes $36 million of revenue deferred from Q3 for promotional upgrade programs. As a reminder, last year's higher gross margin was attributable to the recognition of all of the Battlefield 3 Premium subscription revenue in the fourth quarter.","We expect our total non-GAAP operating expenses to be $525 million. Our operating expenses will be impacted by our planned marketing and advertising for our key titles on next-gen.","This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.09 per share.","For the full year, non-GAAP revenue is now estimated to be $3.91 billion and gross margin is expected to be 66%. Due to the favorable results of our continued cost control efforts, we are now estimating operating expenses to be reduced to approximately $2.04 billion, and we are raising our EPS guidance by $0.05 to $1.30 per share.","The GAAP guidance is estimated to be $3.52 billion in revenue and a loss per share of $0.42. As we have pointed out in past quarters, our consumers are playing our games online over longer periods of time, and this longer period affects the length of time over which we are required to recognize GAAP revenue, which will drive the deferral of an incremental $385 million of net revenue into fiscal '15. This longer service period has no impact on our non-GAAP revenue or cash flows.","Regarding cash flow, we are raising our estimates for fiscal '14 operating cash flow to approximately $600 million. This implies expected free cash flow generation of approximately $500 million, which is up $200 million from our previous guidance and more than twice what we generated in fiscal '13.","Regarding fiscal year '15, we will provide guidance during our Q4 earnings call, when we will be in a much better position to share our insights. At that time, we will give you our title slate for the year and our expected financial guidance, which will be a continuation of our multi-year plan of improving operating profits and cash flow.","In summary, we were able to weather the decline in current-gen software sales by actively managing our operating expenses while still investing in the development of our next-gen products, services, future IP, earnings and cash flow. We are encouraged by our initial software sales from PS4 and Xbox One. And going forward, we remain committed to extending our leadership position in next-gen console software development, growing our digital games and services and continuing to improve our operating profits.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Blake. Just a few thoughts to close. We are proud to have been the #1 publisher on next-gen consoles in December, with more new games on the way. Our digital businesses are reaching new heights across multiple platforms and geographies, and cost discipline measures are protecting our returns so we can invest in key IP for the future.","We're all incredibly excited for the arrival of Titanfall on March 11. Our partners at Respawn Entertainment are now putting the finishing touches on this highly anticipated title for Xbox One, Xbox 360 and PC. There is -- this is a spectacularly innovative game, a true achievement by the teams at Respawn.","Across EA Studios, development continues on plan for our future titles, and we'll share more of our FY '15 slate on our next quarterly call. We expect digital growth to continue as a defining characteristic of this fiscal year for Electronic Arts. Players are engaging deeper each year in digital live services for some of our established franchises like FIFA Ultimate Team, Madden Ultimate Team, and now, Battlefield 4 Premium, which currently has more than 1.6 million members. Digital is also accelerating our growth in new markets. FIFA Online 3 is doing extremely well in Korea in both traffic and revenue, and we expect more fans to connect with our online free-to-play FIFA games in China and Latin America during the World Cup this year.","EA's mobile titles continue to rise up the chart and demonstrate our ability to build a portfolio of great games and grow them over time. Games like The Simpsons: Tapped Out, FIFA 14, Real Racing 3 and The Sims FreePlay have highly engaged fan bases on iOS and Android that are still growing long after launch.","Our recently launched Heros of Dragon Age is another excellent example of an entirely new mobile experience designed around one of our proven IPs. Our strength in mobile is in our ability to repeat on success and we see more strong opportunities ahead.","Throughout FY '14, we've been demonstrating our ability to grow operating profits, and we expect strong returns from this increased focus on discipline across our business. This is a multi-year journeys striving for both top line revenue growth and profitability improvement, and one that we are fully committed to for the long term.","By executing against our strategic priorities, we look forward to closing our FY '14 in a position of strength. We're delivering exciting new experiences to our gamers every day, and we are ready to capitalize on the long-term opportunity in front of us.","With that, Blake, Peter, Patrick and I are here to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird Co.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","A couple of questions. First, after the follow-up on Battlefield 4, if you could comment on current sales trends of the game and whether server issues had any noticeable impact on sell-through or reorders? And then secondly, Andrew, maybe since you have a few months now under the belt as CEO. Curious, where you've identified some of the key early learnings about EA from the top? And strategically, where you think there's still more work to be done?","Peter Robert Moore","Colin, it's Peter. Let me take the first part of that question, then I'll hand it over to Andrew. As both Blake and Andrew indicated, we obviously saw some decline in current-gen software that wasn't picked up by the increased anticipation that gamers have in the sales thereof of next-gen. Battlefield 4 was no different than FIFA or Need for Speed in this issue but this was focused on current gen rather than, we believe, any issues with the game itself. This game has got a long tail, as you well know, and we will continue to be able to sell this effectively throughout the next fiscal year. So yes, we did see some impact of the current-gen softness that was indicated by Andrew and Blake in their prepared statements, but this is not, we believe, linked to any quality issues.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Colin. In terms of learnings in the job, I'd reiterate what I've been saying to this point, which is, I think as a company, we have an amazing portfolio of IP, and we're starting to see that really resonate both with new console gamers on these next-gen platforms, on mobile with titles that have been very strong for us in the past, things like Heroes of Dragon Age and now certainly PC free-to-play in emerging markets, with things like FIFA Online 3 in Korea. And so for me, our strategy continues to be sound. We have to go strongly after the next-gen market. I think we're in a strong position there. We certainly have the opportunity to benefit from the World Cup this year, with respect to FIFA Online free-to-play games across the globe. And mobile continues to be a very, very strong strategic opportunity for us and we are doubling down and investing heavily in that space to ensure that we've got our AAA teams look -- and our AAA IP to bring great games and services to users on those platforms across the globe.","Operator","The next question comes from Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a couple of questions. First of all, can you give us some color as to what you think we should be looking for as far as the rate of decline in PS3 and 360 sales are concerned? As a follow-up to that, how clear do you think the inventory levels are for that legacy software in the retail channel? And then looking at the next-generation, can you give us some color so your kind of attach rates, and what we should expect for digital sales for the next-gen software?","Peter Robert Moore","Ed, it's Peter. Let me try and plow through that. Certainly, as we, again to reiterate, we've seen, obviously, a decline in what we anticipate and I think what the industry anticipated in current-gen once next-gen launched. We will continue to monitor this. You and I have been through these transitions many times, and you continued to re-forecast as you see trends. I will say this, both Sony and Microsoft recognized, in particular, Sony, have managed their PS2 to PS3 transition very well. Having ran that Xbox business, as you know, I think Microsoft is committed to the Xbox 360 for a number of years. So I would anticipate seeing both Sony and Microsoft get behind their current-gen platforms at least for the next 2 years and bring us to a 10-year cycle as we saw in the previous cycle. As regard to inventories, difficult for me to speak other than our own. As I think Blake alluded to, we have put some reserves aside to make sure that we are able to do the correct promotional activities in Q4 and beyond to move any inventory issues that we have to keep retail shelves fresh and make sure we've got room for our new titles in FY '15. And then as regards to next-gen, the tie ratios, I'm actually pretty bullish on what I'm seeing so far. Certainly, Sony has done well with the PS4 at -- when you compare it to the first 2 months of their launch on the PS3. They're up to 2.1 versus 1.9. Microsoft is a little down, the 2.6 attach on Xbox One versus Xbox 360, and this is U.S. only, during that similar period for launch, but I think a lot of that has to do with the some of the bundling activity we saw on a global basis, but certainly here in the U.S. I think it's been a solid start for both and we're incredibly bullish that, that will continue in FY '15.","Blake J. Jorgensen","And Ed, just to be crystal clear here on inventory, we regularly assess our reserves and our channel inventory, and we're truing up any reserve that we believe are required to maintain a clear channel. Part of our lower revenue in Q3 is driven by the fact that we put reserves on to make sure that we had a very clean inventory channel, and we're very comfortable with that even with the decline in the Gen3 sales that have been existing.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then have you seen any lift, anything noticeable yet with the regards to the digital sales of full games for next-gen consoles?","Peter Robert Moore","Ed, it's Peter again. I think it's a little early. I mean, certainly, digital extra content, full game downloads is something we watch and something that we're keeping a very close eye on. I think what you see, typically, in the first couple of months is that consumers have gone to retail to pick up their boxes, and as a result, they probably bought the packaged goods version of that software. I think it's a good question for 12 months from now when we have a full year of data behind us. And it's also probably a more appropriate question for Sony and Microsoft to be able to speak to with PSN and Xbox LIVE, respectively.","Operator","Next question comes from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","I wonder if you can speak to what's going on with your contract with the NFL. I believe it's now expired, and obviously, people are expecting another Madden game in 2014. So could you just talk about where that is?","Andrew Wilson","Yes. Contrary to some reports, we still have a number of years left on our agreements there and are currently in planning on the next Madden property right now. And we expect to make a number of Madden games in the future, and the relationship that we have with both the NFL and the NFL Players Association continues to be extremely strong.","Operator","The next question comes from Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just a couple of questions. You guys talked about the Ultimate Team revenue is up 60%. In the past, you guys have been kind enough to share some details on the FIFA and Battlefield side of things. Wonder if you could update on the dollar figures for that? And then as far as the market is concerned, I think, Peter, you had alluded to your bullishness on the next-gen. At this point, do you feel like the 10 million unit console for next-gen by March, is that looking like it might be higher than that or you think it's 10 million by March?","Peter Robert Moore","I don't know if it is 10 million, Arvind, right on the nose. But I stand by my comments, I think it's going to actually be in excess of that and I'm feeling pretty good about what I'm seeing and hearing and visiting retail and listening to retailers talk about their flow of inventory. I think you can see, you do the store checks. Both Sony and Microsoft seems to be doing a pretty darn good job of flowing inventory in between now and from what I've seen, certainly, by the end of our fiscal quarter on March 31. I think it's 10 million-plus, Arvind.","Blake J. Jorgensen","On the extra content, we're not going to break out the FIFA Ultimate Team versus other Ultimate Teams. But what you can see on the documents that have been published is that the extra content revenue for the quarter was up to $213 million, which is up 15%. Our original guidance for the year there was that would be relatively flat so we're clearly exceeding our expectations. And part of that exceeding the expectations is that we've improved the Ultimate Team offering for all of the sport. So while FIFA continues to grow, we're seeing great growth out of Madden NFL as well as NHL Hockey, and it's really improving the overall Ultimate Team experience. On top of that, also in that category, is the growth of FIFA Online 3, which is primarily a free-to-play business in Korea and soon to be in China, that's growing extremely well and is very popular in Korea. And Andrew might have some more detail on that, that he can provide. But we're very excited about, clearly, that whole component. And I think as people know, on a trailing 12-month basis, we're already over $700 million there, and we foresee that business continuing to grow year-over-year in the levels that it has over the last couple of years.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And then I guess on Battlefield 4 Premium, I wonder if you could give us some color on the early response there.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes. So early days in Battlefield 4 Premium, as you know, most people buy the original game and then they sign up for Premium. Just as a reminder, from a financial standpoint and I can let Patrick talk about the product, we are recognizing Battlefield 4 Premium differently than we did Battlefield 3 Premium. As you know, we've recognized Battlefield 3 Premium at the end of program in one quarter. Now we're recognizing it ratably. There are 5 expansion packs that are scheduled to be released over the next year, and we plan to ratably recognize that revenue. So if you were to purchase something when the Premium first went out, say in October, when we first rolled out Battlefield, that purchase would be amortized over 15 months. If you were to purchase it in November, it would have been amortized over 14 months and so forth as we get to the end of the revenue. It will all be dropped into digital subscription revenue, so you'll see it in that part of the breakout of our financial statements. But I think it will be a lot smoother in terms of the revenue recognition versus what you saw before.","Patrick S\u00f6derlund","This is Patrick. On the product side, I think it's important to point out that Battlefield 4 Premium has just started. We have 1 map pack in the channel. There's another 1 coming shortly. And I think there's a lot of exciting content being built right now, that I think will excite people.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","A couple of Titanfall questions. Given Titanfall is going to be the first major new franchise for next-gen when it launches in March, just in general, how are you thinking about forecasting that title in your March quarter outlook? Could you kind of describe your approach to Titanfall as aggressive, conservative or somewhere in between as far as how you're thinking about it?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, I guess I would call it conservative. We, as a reminder, Titanfall is just on Xbox One and Xbox 360 and the PC. And so by that nature, it's smaller as an overall product. We're very excited about the product. Respawn has done an amazing job with it. But as a reminder, also, we'll be shipping it the tail end of the quarter, middle of March. And so essentially, the March revenue or the quarter revenue is primarily the first sell-in of that title. We expect the title to be very additive to us also in FY '15. You'll hear more about that when we give our '15 guidance. But it's really a starting point in Q4 this year and then we'll play well into next year as more and more people build the base of Xbox Ones or build or play the title either on 360 or PC.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That exclusive that you mentioned was the other question is obviously, leaving out the PlayStation impacts the addressable market to some degree, and I realize you can't talk about specifics of the economics around your deal with Microsoft on there. But can you just talk, conceptually, about whether or not the economics are kind of enough to offset potential sales that the game could've had on PlayStation and -- or just, high level, how kind of these deals work?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Well, I think you should assume that we made that decision when it was back a few years ago when we decided to go exclusive. We had some forecast at that time from where we thought both Xbox and PlayStation would be and that's what we based our decision on. I think we're still feeling very comfortable with that. I think -- think about the deal as economically as we made. We told people last quarter that it's a trade-off between The Sims 4, which is the product we moved out when we moved Titanfall in. And the reason that's economically neutral on that deal in this year is that most of the expenses for the development of Respawn's products were expensed along the way, as we do with all of our R&D. And thus, when we ship that product, it's fairly high margin for us until we start to share royalties with them. You should assume in FY '15, we'll start to share royalties as the revenue builds, and that will start to reduce the profitability of the product over time. But the initial ship-in at the volumes that we're anticipating and built into our guidance are fairly profitable, and we determine it was a exact trade-off with The Sims profitability if that would've also been in the quarter.","Operator","James Hardiman with Longbow Research.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","Quick follow-up on Battlefield. Just wanted to check and make sure that at this point, are all the issues that you were having early on, sort of in the rearview mirror at this point? And as I think about some of the issues that you had, are there lessons learned there that give you confidence that you won't have similar issues with Titanfall, given it's another multiplayer cross-generational game? And then I had a follow-up for Blake.","Andrew Wilson","Let me -- I would just -- I'd take that one, I think it's a great question. Look, on the Titanfall piece -- I'll hand off to Patrick to give you a little more color on Battlefield 4. What I would tell you about Titanfall is we are incredibly excited for the release of the product. And to partner with experienced world-class teams of both Respawn and Microsoft to launch a title. We're currently moving through kind of public tests of the product, and we're seeing great results and we're really looking forward to seeing the gamer reaction in March.","Patrick S\u00f6derlund","I'll cover Battlefield 4, and I'll quickly touch on kind of what happened, what we've done and how we're learning from it? So on the first segment, the what happened part is when Battlefield 4 launched, it was a very complex game, launching on 2 entirely new console platforms, as well as current-gen and PC. We were pushing innovation heavily and we're delivering 60 frames per second gameplay for 64 players plus the ability to connect via mobile tablet as a commander into the product, coupled those with some very innovative features in the gameplay side. Based on our prelaunch testing, our beta performance, we were confident the game was ready when it was launched. Shortly after launch, however, we began hearing about problems from our player community, and the development team quickly began to address the situation. So what have we done since we encountered the problems is we were fortunate to have an architecture in place that allows us to adjust and update the game rapidly, and that's actually what we've done. We released multiple software updates across all platforms to resolve the primary issues and game stability has significantly increased. To the final point, which is how are we learning from this? The challenge that we've faced with Battlefield 4 were different from anything that we've seen before with other games. There were different issues that only manifest its scale in the post-launch live environment. We're taking multiple steps to evaluate what occurred and incorporate those learnings into our development process for future products, so we don't experience the same problems again. I would close on the fact that Battlefield 4 remains an amazing game with massive innovation, and we're confident that gamers will be logging on to play for a long time to come.","James Hardiman - Longbow Research LLC","That's really helpful. And then I had a question for Blake. Blake, I sort of feel like a good portion of your script every quarter, you could probably cut and paste because it seems like every quarter, you're beating on the OpEx line by a pretty sizable margin. So I guess my question is, how much of that is a function of realizing those savings earlier than you had initially anticipated? And how much of that, if any, is that there's actually a bigger opportunity with respect to your ultimate margin potential that you've sort of laid out over the past year, 1.5 years?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, so I guess I'll restate your first part, which is not only are we beating on OpEx, I think we've been happy that we're actually beating on EPS and cash flow, which was really where we're trying to drive the beast every quarter. We've done that through trying to deliver on the top line, which we've been doing except with the minor miss in Q3, and at the same time, management -- more aggressive management of our OpEx across all parts of the organization. And I used the word management versus cost cutting because that's how we view this, and we view that there's a long opportunity ahead of us and more certainly to be able to drive our operating margins and profitability upwards. We're trying to prioritize and focus and we're trying to make sure that the entire organization is aligned with that, but we're also trying to do that so none of what we do cuts back on our future IP development and our ability to drive the top line longer term. And part of the reason that we're taking a step-by-step process over the next couple of years to continue to build our operating margins is because we are trying to protect the long-term franchise value of many of our key IPs. And we think that's a good balance and we think there is a lot of opportunity still left. I think we're a little bit ahead of where we thought we would be, which is good news, but we also know we've got a lot of challenges ahead. And as I mentioned, you'll see next quarter our guidance for fiscal '15, but I do think what you'll see is a continuation of the same strategy that we've all been talking about publicly to continue to build our operating margins over time.","Operator","Next question is from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","[indiscernible]","[Technical Difficulties]","Operator","Your next question is from Drew Crum with Stifel.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","So I wonder if you guys could comment on the experience you've had with next-gen pricing on the full game download and what type of economics you're seeing from that? And then separately, could you comment on the your plans for digital monetization on Titanfall?","Andrew Wilson","So the first question regarding next-gen, so the pricing that Sony and Microsoft determined to charge on their PSN, Xbox LIVE stores? Is that the question?","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Correct.","Andrew Wilson","Yes. Obviously, that's determined by a number of factors. We are active participants in those stores and look forward, as I mentioned, in my earlier comments, to that business ultimately growing. But we do not determine prices here. There's no different than a retail store in which they will determine the prices going forward here, both Sony and Microsoft on that, as well as local authorities as well. There is also other issues in there. But is there something that you have more specific? Is your question why is it not different?","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Well, if you could address that. And then also, Peter, I'd be interested in your comments around what the economics look like, what type of margins are you getting on these full game downloads relative to the packaged goods sold at bricks-and-mortar retailer?","Peter Robert Moore","Yes, I'm not going to talk about specific margins, but I think we've been pretty consistent over the years that as this industry moves to more digital downloads, that it's margin accretive for us as we start to leave behind some of the challenges sometimes that retail has. At the same time, we are selling a tremendous amount of packaged goods software, which leads to digital margins, in particular, when you think about Ultimate Team products on our sports titles and our Battlefield Premium subscriptions. One of those springboard off the disc that is typically sold at retail. So it's not a black-and-white issue of you either sell digital or you either sell packaged goods there. It's a combined economy for us in that respect and we enjoy digital margins of both our packaged good sales and our digital sales.","Blake J. Jorgensen","But clearly, the growth in gross margin over the last 3 or 4 years has been driven by the movement into digital, not just full game but, obviously, all of the ancillary products. Any digital business comes in at a better margin for us because of lack of some of the physical and inventory-related expenses associated with it, as well as some of the margins you may lose or leak along the way. So we're very focused on continuing that process. But as Peter said, we're also trying to balance that with making sure our products get into all the people's hands that want them and we can do that through a lot of our great retail partners out there.","Andrew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Then on Titanfall, guys, any comment you can make around digital monetization for that title?","Andrew Wilson","Yes. So Titanfall again is a highly innovative game, multiplayer-driven, and so expect a lot of online engagement around that. We're planning extra content already for the product, but in the nature of the live service, I think that, that will evolve over time as we see how the player base evolves through the year.","Operator","Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Andrew, so as you think about taking some of your franchise and thinking console plus online experiences, if you start the development process of the outset to coexist on both, do you have some sense as to how much your development costs may be higher or lower or flat or whatever, as a result of on -- as a result on a franchise-by-franchise basis versus just developing for the console? And am I reading too much into your comment a little earlier about China and Latin America free-to-play FIFA ahead of the World Cup as perhaps an imminent signing of the distribution deal for maybe Brazil or other territories?","Peter Robert Moore","Okay. So I'll hit that both. First is the cost of development around cross-platform and the second with respect to FIFA Online in China and Brazil around the World Cup. As it relates to cross-platform development, I think something that is really starting to play under the strength of EA is this move to cross-platform play and the need for cross-platform development. So as a company, we've started to invest on a number of levels, over the past 3 or 4 years, that really help facilitate this transition for us. One is the investment in our digital platform at a core ID logging entitlement security data platform level, which again is universal across the company and lowers the cost barrier as you start out development. The second is the move to more common engines and you've heard a lot from us around Frostbite 3 and Ignite technology. And we continue to try and converge our Engine technology to the extent that our game teams aren't having to spend a lot of time, effort, energy and investment around the core game technology like physics, animation, rendering, audio, et cetera. And what that really does is frees up the game teams on a couple of fronts. One, it gives them the ability to outsource commodity like investment by virtue of common technology; and two, focus really their core-driven innovation around feature development as it relates to each platform. And the net of all of that is what we're seeing is fairly significant economies of scale as the player base across platform evolves and we start to deliver these experiences across platform. Second, as it relates to FIFA Online 3 and the World Cup, so we have announced a deal in China, and we've also announced that we are rolling out FIFA Online world, which is a slightly different manifestation but built on exactly the same engine for Brazil and Russia. We will be driving that inside the company with a full self-publishing opportunity. So we will maintain all of the value chain in those territories. So very excited about that, a great step for us as a company as we think about PC free-to-play in those emerging markets.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies.","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Justin Post, your line is open with Bank of America.","Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","This is Ryan calling in for Justin. First question's on Battlefield and Titanfall and the digital strategy behind those 2. I know you haven't talked too much about the Titanfall digital. But I'm -- we're wondering if those 2 titles can coexist next year. Also there's other first-person shooter games out there, how the dynamic will work? And then also as you look out for fiscal '15, what does the weakness in prior-gen software mean for revenues next year, particularly as it relates to catalogue usually and you do see a big -- or you still see healthy sales in sports titles and some of the holiday games next year, what that current-gen software weakness means?","Peter Robert Moore","Ryan, it's Peter. Let me try and address that first question on Titanfall. Actually, the question -- the answer is yes. I think they can both coexist. We haven't talked at detail about our Titanfall digital strategy, but you're very familiar already, obviously, with Battlefield 4 Premium. We expect that to be incredibly strong for us as is Battlefield 4 typically as a catalogue title itself. Once we announce Titanfall, obviously, you'll have a better understanding what our digital strategy is. But I think they can both coexist very easily and then we think they will be both incremental and accretive to what we're going to be doing in FY '15. As regards to revenue, we're not prepared yet to talk about that. That will be on the next earnings call, and I think we'll be, obviously, 90 days better educated by the time we get there once Blake is able to disclose what our revenue's going to be for FY '15 in the next earnings call.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, I do say that -- I will say that we'll most likely be cautious around Gen3 for some period of time because until pricing for the all Gen3 or current-generation boxes gets settled down, it's hard to guess exactly if that will bring new consumers in or not. I do think we're still in a bit of an air pocket right now between the new consoles coming out and the old consoles, where many of the consumers are still waiting on the sidelines. And that's why you haven't seen 1:1 replacement in software. Our assumption is that it will start to go away over time, and it will settle into a normal Gen3 business. We still ship some Gen2 software, so we think Gen3 will be around for some period of time. And we think it'll be a viable part of our catalog going forward, and it could grow if for some reason the prices came down on the current-gen forefront -- or Gen3 consoles and brought new consumers into the market in places around the world that have not yet had access to the boxes.","Ryan Gee - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then, Blake, kind of going back to the cost savings this quarter, I was wondering if you could summarize maybe 1 or 2 of the specific measures you took during the quarter that really drove those savings. And whether or not it's reasonable to carry forward the magnitude of 3Q savings into next year? Or if there's something maybe competition or product roadmap that limits that ability.","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, I mean, we'll give you a lot of detail around that next quarter when we do guidance. But I think you should assume is that we're trying to change the way we're operating. And so that means organizational changes, that means the way we go to market, that means how we actually do advertising, and that means prioritization of our product portfolio. We're trying to make sure that we fully invest in the key properties and stop investing in some properties that don't look like they have the opportunity to become the size that we would like or the scale that we would like. And I think we're also getting better at how we invest in those properties. And so even as we look forward, we should be able to, based on consistent engines across properties, for example, be able to continue to bring our overall development cost down. And you'll continue to see that built into our cost structure and, thus, expanding of our margins, over time, with limited upside on the revenue. And if we get bigger revenue upside, that will even be that much larger margin expansion.","Peter Robert Moore","Yes, Ryan, this is Peter. If I can maybe address marketing. I mean, to be the leader the we currently are as publisher in the next-generation, you've got to be next-generation marketer to be able to match that up. And the marketing teams around the world are moving very rapidly into more performance-based marketing. We're not a traditional marketer anymore. We're utilizing 1:1 marketing techniques with the digital and, ultimately, more cost-effective for us and more relevant to the consumer. You're going to see continued efficiencies in that area for us, at the same time, not losing any impact of share of voice with the consumer.","Operator","Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Andrew, just kind of curious, looks like the last couple of months, there's been some executive turnover on the development side. I'm wondering kind of what you're doing to set the culture and retain talent.","Andrew Wilson","Listen, I think that's a great question, and certainly that one that we think about here. As a company, we're a creative organization. I came up through the creative side of the organization. So I have a deep passion for both bringing in new creative talent and keeping with creative talent. But that also, as part of the creative industry, people come and go for all kinds of different reasons. You've seen some recently have left, and these changes happen to be announced in the short window, which was more coincidental than anything. I know it's absolutely no connection between their departures. EA, as an organization, we've got over 8,000 amazingly talented and creative people, and we love to see these people have the opportunity to step up and lead our studios. Guys like John Vechey at PopCap, Matt Webster of Criterion, and Ed Rumley at Chillingo have all been with their respective studios for a long time and bring a lot of energy and enthusiasm and new creative thinking to their roles. I don't know whether anyone saw the piece that Matt Webster did. He did a great interview with IGN early this week were he talked about the passion and energy and the creative DNA inside of Criterion and what they're doing for the future. In fact, we're going to get to talk about some new things out of Criterion a little later in the year. But this is really important for us. These studios all have exciting work underway and we look forward to sharing all of it with players in the future.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Company, LLC, Research Division","Last question, it looks like '14 will be interesting in the living room. It looks Steam should officially launch their product and it's still early days, but some of it looks compelling. We have Apple, Amazon and Google, all kind of rumored to be potentially launching a micro-console and kind of connecting that mobile eco-system to the TV. So just curious how you think how disruptive that could be and how that market can take shape for you or not?","Andrew Wilson","Listen, I think it's great. I mean, every time there are new ways and opportunities for people to play games, that's great for us and it's great for our ability to bring new and innovative experiences to our gamers. EA is and has always been kind of a platform-agnostic company. We do our best to bring great experiences to gamers on whatever platforms they're playing on. So right now we think about our world kind of in 3 modalities of play, the lean-back experience in the living room, the lean-in experience with PC and free-to-play, particularly, in emerging markets and the lean-over experience on mobile as that is such a growing part of the gaming community, the gaming ecosystem. As it relates to specific technology, we're watching eagerly but we see that more as our ability to manifest those 3 modalities of play. And we'll work with each of those partners to deliver great games and services to gamers in the modality of play that makes most sense for them.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Schachter, Macquarie.","Benjamin A. Schachter - Macquarie Research","Blake, on FY '15, I know you're not giving explicit guidance, but if you could just give us any color on general trends. Is it fair to expect continued margin growth and EPS growth there or do we have to wait until '15 to hear that? And then just on the competitive landscape on mobile, what are you learning there? I mean, why are The Simpsons still doing so well but Plants vs. Zombies didn't do as well as you thought? What can we understand around some of the sustainable competitive advantages there?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Yes, let me tackle the '15 question and then I'll let Andrew talk about the mobile question and Peter, if you want to jump in as well. What I did say in my remarks was that we'd give our, obviously, our details next quarter but that it would be a continuation of our multiyear plan for improving operating profit and cash flow. I've talked publicly about a multiyear strategy to get us into the 20% operating margin levels. We've been delivering on that every quarter. We're ahead of our plan on that, as I think you can tell, just by looking at our guidance numbers, that's up from what we originally guided for the full year. And I think you'll continue to see more of that next year. I'll give you details but assume that it is #1 focus for everything we're doing, along with building great products for gamers to make sure that we really deliver excitement around mobile and console gaming.","Andrew Wilson","Yes. And listen, as it relates to mobile, I think it's a great question. Certainly, as you've heard from us, it's something that we're very, very focused on and working diligently again right now as a company. And it continues to be a fantastic opportunity for expansion and revenue growth within our digital portfolio as we really drive the focus in this area. And I think early into what we're learning right now is that brands matter in this market. And we have tapped the power of the EA network, the brands within it, partner placement, the relationships we have with our partners, to really drive some incredibly strong IP. And we've demonstrated that with things like The Simpsons: Tapped Out, which continues to grow for us and has topped over $130 million life-to-date in digital net revenue. We continue to drive updates to that game. I think that, that's what we've learned is that ongoing progressive content that keeps experience fresh and exciting for gamers is important. Real Racing 3 has over 100 million downloads since launch, and again, it comes down to great IP, great game mechanic but also providing that extended and enhanced service. That team works diligently around continuing to upgrade and extend the product. Sims FreePlay, again, just a phenomenal brand for us, has over 87 million life-to-date installs. And 2 years post its launch saw its biggest revenue month inside of December. And so again, it's that mobile isn't a sprint, it's a marathon. These live service businesses, it's really important that you continue to work with your gamer base and grow the gamer base and provide them a really exciting experience over the long term that connects them with their friends and connect them with the experience. And again, now we're seeing that with Heroes of Dragon Age. And so we feel like now that we've learned how to acquire mobile gamers though our IP, the next step is really to follow the market monetization trends and really drive and reach those top grossing games. We've got some work to do, but we are making strides as we lower the barrier to entry to our games, increase the quality and manage what is a very exciting experiences for our gamers.","Operator","That last question comes from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.","Neil A. Doshi - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Blake, on the marketing and sales side, we saw some very nice leverage there. Do you think you can continue to demonstrate that type of leverage on a go forward basis? And then secondly on the FIFA Online for China, can you just update us where you guys are in that process? And what are some of the additional steps needed to get that game ultimately approved and launched in China?","Blake J. Jorgensen","Sure. The first question I'll answer, and then let Andrew give you the FIFA answer. We do feel confident that there's more leverage there. We're really trying to drive more of the business to both digital, as well as use as much performance-based marketing activities. And the combination of those, I think, continues to show leverage off of the existing cost base, and then clearly leveraging the R&D expense line around prioritization but also using more standardized tools that allow us to really have the artist focus on building great games and not worrying about how the back office or platform operates. So more to come on that as we give our '15 guidance, but we do feel pretty confident that there's more opportunity.","Andrew Wilson","With respect to FIFA Online 3 in China, as we've announced, we have a relationship with Tencent where we are working kind of hand-in-hand on the development, publishing and launch of this title. The core engine comes out of our EAC Studios, so you can expect that the gameplay is going to be top class. We are actually driving a lot of the meta-service layer out of our EA Korea studio, which again has been responsible for FIFA Online 3 work, with Nexon there and continues it exceptionally well and then partnering with Tencent in China on the publishing of that title. And for anyone who kind of understands the life cycle of a free-to-play property, there are a series of technical tests, closed betas and open betas, as you move into commercialization and you gradually scale the business over time with respect to feature set and user numbers, and we are in the middle of that process with Tencent right now and on plan for our target launch of this year.","Blake J. Jorgensen","With that, I think we'll wrap up the call. Appreciate everyone's time and attention and look forward to talking to everyone next quarter.","Andrew Wilson","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude the conference.

Earlier this afternoon, we released our Q1 earnings report detailing a strong start to fiscal year 2015 for Electronic Arts. At EA, we have a commitment to put our players first, holding at our core that every game, every live service, every EA experience will deliver the entertainment, innovation, creativity and value that our players want. ","With a strong slate of exciting new titles and fresh content served to players in our live services, we are well-positioned to deliver on that commitment in FY15. Around the world, more than 300 million registered players are engaging with the long-lasting entertainment provided by EA\u2019s games and services today. ","In the last quarter, gamers played more than 13.6 billion online sessions of EA games, for a total of nearly 2.4 billion hours played across console, mobile and PC experiences. To put that in context, that\u2019s more than 3,000 years of gameplay every single day. On screens from six inches to 60 inches, for sessions of two minutes to two hours or more, EA continues to deliver outstanding entertainment to players.","Our global FIFA soccer franchise had a standout quarter as the World Cup drama began to unfold on the pitches in Brazil. More than 53 million matches were played in FIFA Ultimate Team World Cup mode alone, during the quarter. That\u2019s the equivalent of more than 830,000 World Cup tournaments. The World Cup update to FIFA 14 on mobile drove engagement to a franchise record high, and in Korea, FIFA Online 3 had the highest peak concurrent player levels ever for FIFA Online since it was launched in 2006.","Fight fans drove sales of EA SPORTS UFC to exceed our expectations for the quarter, and the in-game action has been intense: more than 65 million fights have been played since the game launched. With EA SPORTS UFC joining our other great games for the new consoles, EA continues to hold the #1 segment share on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One calendar year to date. ","Our live services and digital content are reshaping the gaming experience today, helping players enjoy the games they love for longer. During the quarter, \u201cNaval Strike,\u201d the third expansion pack for Battlefield 4 launched to players in April, while Titanfall\u2019s first content pack \u201cExpedition\u201d was released to players in May. Our EA SPORTS Ultimate Team modes continue to feed players\u2019 insatiable appetites for their favorite sports, with live updates, new content and competitions daily.","Players also continue to get new and fresh experiences in live services for our top EA Mobile games, where we drew more than 140 million monthly active players in Q1. Titles like The Simpsons: Tapped Out, Real Racing 3, The Sims FreePlay and FIFA 14 demonstrate the success in the approach of our mobile development teams \u2013 build top-quality experiences around fun and entertaining IP that can grow over years of play. With innovative new content like the Real Racing 3 Le Mans update, which drew 2 million entrants, players keep coming back to their favorite games.","All of these factors contributed to a strong fiscal first quarter for EA as we delivered revenue and EPS above our non-GAAP guidance. Our focus is now on the work ahead of us for FY15 as we prepare to launch a slate of new games and live services to our players. As I said at the top, our commitment to players and the quality of our games is paramount with every game we make. We have some amazing new experiences coming this year \u2013 games that will connect, inspire, challenge and entertain players. Games that are packed with creativity, innovation and emotion. Games with vibrant communities giving us feedback to make them even better.","Dragon Age: Inquisition is the biggest RPG that BioWare has ever created in its rich history. It will deliver an epic open-world experience, powered by Frostbite 3 and combining combat, compelling characters and rich storytelling. ","The game was a huge hit with fans and critics at E3, taking home 25 awards, including Best RPG from the E3 Game Critics. The team has crafted an absolutely amazing game for players. They want this to be the best Dragon Age experience ever delivered, so they are taking a little more time to put the final touches on the game. Dragon Age: Inquisition now launches on November 18. ","The live multiplayer beta for Battlefield Hardline that launched at E3 was a powerful opportunity to bring our players into the game earlier than ever before. With 1.7 million players joining the beta on PS4 and PC and logging more than 4.2 million session hours over two weeks, the beta delivered a very stable experience that also helped the Visceral Games team gather valuable player feedback.","Additional player testing has shown great excitement for this new world of cops and criminals inside the Battlefield franchise. It also showed us how, with more time, we could go deeper and innovate more. Visceral is testing and implementing several new features that will help to make Battlefield Hardline a game that players can enjoy for many years to come. We are moving the release of Battlefield Hardline out to Q4 FY15, and the team will be keeping players regularly updated on progress. We\u2019ll also have an all-new beta opportunity in the months ahead for players to experience more of Battlefield Hardline.","Of course, Battlefield fans don\u2019t need to wait until then, as Battlefield 4 continues to provide a dynamic live service today. Many more hours of new Battlefield 4 content and gameplay are yet to come, including the expansion packs \u201cDragon\u2019s Teeth,\u201d launching worldwide on July 29, and \u201cFinal Stand\u201d coming in Q3. The DICE team continues to deliver new updates and features for Battlefield 4 players, and recently introduced a Community Test Environment for players to provide feedback on new additions to the game before they launch.","With breakthrough gameplay innovation, stunning visuals, and immersive depth and detail, this year\u2019s EA SPORTS lineup will capture an unprecedented level of excitement and emotion. Madden NFL 15, FIFA 15 and NBA LIVE 15 are all making big strides in the second year of the new console generation, while the NHL and PGA TOUR franchises will make their next gen debuts this year. NHL 15 took home Best Sports Game from the E3 Game Critics, and EA SPORTS PGA TOUR takes golf to places it has never been as the first sports game to be powered by Frostbite 3.","Maxis will launch The Sims 4 in early September to an eager fan base ready to get their hands on this rich new Sims experience. Everything about The Sims 4 is exciting, from the massive technical innovation that gives these new Sims emotions and unique personalities, to the beautiful and vibrant new neighborhoods in which they live, to the weird and fun stories that players will tell. For both veteran fans and newcomers alike, The Sims 4 will open up a whole new world of gameplay possibilities. Players can pre-load The Sims 4 on Origin and be the first to play.","We will deliver entertaining new experiences from some of EA\u2019s biggest brands to players on mobile devices. New FIFA and Madden NFL experiences are set to launch during Q2, as well as a big and really fun new update for The Simpsons: Tapped Out. A much-anticipated new Peggle game from PopCap is moving through a test period in preparation for launch, and our EA Mobile studios have four more exciting new experiences from other major franchises in development. We\u2019re excited to share more about all of these new titles for iOS and Android players in the coming months.","EA enters our second quarter in a strong position. We are committed to delivering top-quality games and services to our players throughout the year. I\u2019ll now hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our Q1 financial performance and FY15 outlook.","","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks, Andrew. Starting with our Q1 results, EA\u2019s non-GAAP net revenue was $775 million, which was 57% higher than prior year\u2019s results and 11% above our guidance. Digital continues to be a major contributor, but this quarter also saw three new launches \u2013 EA Sports UFC, FIFA World Cup 2014, and the Xbox 360 version of Titanfall. In addition, FIFA 2014, Battlefield 4, Madden NFL25, and the rest of our catalog titles had solid performances.","Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased by 28% year-over-year to $482 million and accounted for more than 60% of this quarter\u2019s revenue. The trailing twelve-month digital net revenue was up 10% to a record $1.9 billion. Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performances of each of these businesses. ","Extra content and free-to-play contributed $211 million, up 19% over the prior year, led by sustained momentum and approaching 90% growth in our Ultimate Team business. We saw NHL Ultimate Team grow 50%, FIFA Ultimate Team grow nearly 80% and Madden Ultimate Team grow over 350% year-over-year. Star Wars: The Old Republic and FIFA Online 3 also continue to be significant contributors. As a reminder, this revenue relates to businesses on PC or consoles, where consumers can enhance or extend their gaming experience by buying additional digital content.","Mobile generated $120 million for the quarter, up 18% over the prior year. Smartphones and tablets continue to represent a majority of the revenue, accounting for $109 million, or 90% of our total mobile revenue. Going into a little more detail, we break out our mobile revenues into two streams: first, digital extra content and advertising revenues, which is also known as freemium; and second, full game or one-time download revenues, also known as premium.","In the quarter, $105 million or 87% of our mobile revenues were comprised of digital extra content and advertising revenue, reflecting the shift to the freemium business model. This freemium business was up 39% versus the prior year, more than offsetting the decline in the premium business. Premium full game download revenue was $15 million, down 43% compared to the prior year.","We attribute our freemium growth to the strength of our portfolio of live service games. We continue to view mobile as a business with tremendous opportunity as the market is experiencing significant global growth in smartphones and tablets. And as this market base expands, we continue to release new content in our live service games and execute against our launch roadmap.","Full game PC and console downloads represented $71 million, up nearly 90% over the prior year. Historically, full game downloads were primarily driven by PC-centric products. However, we continue to see full game download growth on the new consoles. Titanfall, Battlefield 4 and FIFA 14 were key PC and console titles that contributed to the increase in full game downloads in addition to other catalog titles.","Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue contributed $80 million, up 31% over the same period last year. The ratable recognition of Battlefield 4 Premium is a key contributor to the increase in our subscription revenue this quarter. ","Moving on to gross margin,  our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 70%, an increase from last year\u2019s 64% and better than our guidance of 67%. The increase was primarily due to solid results from our digital revenue offerings and a continued focus on reducing online processing fees and support costs.","Operating expenses for the quarter were $459 million, $18 million below prior year and $26 million lower than our guidance. Our lower operating expenses are due to continued cost discipline, but some portion of the reduction is due to quarterly phasing of key expenses in marketing and contracted services and we expect these costs to be incurred in future quarters. The resulting non-GAAP EPS was $0.19 per share, exceeding our guidance and prior year due to strong revenues, higher gross margin, and lower operating expenses.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.32 billion, or approximately $7.40 per share. Roughly 68% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $4 million, versus last year\u2019s use of $248 million for operating activities. Year-over-year this is a $252 million improvement in cash flows. On a trailing twelve month basis, operating cash flow hit a company record high of $964 million demonstrating our ability to generate higher cash flows.","During Q1, we repurchased 1.4 million shares at a cost of $50 million. As a reminder, our $750 million stock buyback program was initiated in May and has a 2 year time frame. Before we discuss guidance, we want to address a couple of items. ","First, we recently completed a review of our portfolio of licenses and agreements and we decided not to use on a going-forward basis certain licensed intellectual property. This decision resulted in a GAAP-only charge of $122 million to cost of goods sold due to the loss on the corresponding royalty commitment. Going forward, our non-GAAP P&L will benefit from this decision not to use the IP. It should also be noted that this decision will not impact any of our core licensed products. ","Second, with regard to our share count, for the first time since the issuance of our convertible notes in 2011, our average stock price for the quarter was above the $31.74 exercise price of the notes. However, at the time of the issuance of the notes, EA also entered into bond hedge and warrant transactions to effectively raise the exercise price to $41.14. ","Under GAAP, we are required to include only the dilutive effect of the convertible notes and warrants in determining our diluted share count. However, on a non-GAAP basis, we also include the effect of the offsetting bond hedge transactions in order to provide a complete view of the economic dilution to earnings. On our website, we have posted a table that illustrates the potential share count dilution on both a GAAP and a non-GAAP basis.","Turning to Q2 guidance: GAAP net revenue is expected to be $965 million, as compared to","$695 million in the prior year. GAAP loss per share is expected to be ($0.12), as compared to ($0.89) loss per share in the prior year.","Non-GAAP net revenue for the quarter is expected to be $1.14 billion, a 10% increase over last year\u2019s $1.04 billion. This quarter, we will launch The Sims 4, which we expect to more than offset last year\u2019s college football game. In addition, we will launch FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15 and NHL 15.","Non\u2013GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 65.5%, better than prior year\u2019s 62%, driven by the positive impact of The Sims 4, a PC-centric, wholly owned IP. Operating expenses will be impacted by the phasing of some operating expenses from Q1. We expect our total non-GAAP operating expenses to be $530 million.","This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.50 per share, as compared to $0.33 last year. For fiscal year 2015, we are reiterating our non-GAAP guidance announced at the beginning of the year \u2013 net revenue of $4.10 billion and $1.85 of fully diluted EPS. We expect our positive Q1 results to offset any impact of delaying Battlefield Hardline to the fourth quarter. ","The GAAP guidance is $4.30 billion in revenue, and $1.78 of fully diluted EPS. The updated GAAP estimate reflects the impact of the $122 million GAAP charge I mentioned, as well as the delayed launch of Battlefield Hardline.","Regarding cash flow for the fiscal year, we continue to forecast operating cash flows of approximately $800 million, and capital expenses of approximately $100 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $700 million.","We remain very positive about the trends in our industry and business \u2013 growth of the new","generation consoles, trends toward a greater digital business and growth in mobile and PC free-to-play.","Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks Blake. We have an exciting year ahead of us. We raised the curtain at E3 on rich new experiences in development at EA today, providing a view into our future and the breadth of games and services from favorite brands and new IP. ","Now we head to Gamescom in Cologne, an event that is all about giving millions of gamers worldwide the next view into our games coming this year. For more than 300,000 gamers attending in Cologne, it will also be an opportunity to get up close with our biggest titles including, FIFA 15, The Sims 4, Dragon Age: Inquisition and Battlefield Hardline. We look forward to hearing more of their passionate feedback.","We greatly value that open interaction and dialogue with our players. It is what drives us to lead with innovation, to explore new ideas, and pursue creative new experiences with every one of our games. The opportunity in front of us is to build entertainment on a truly epic scale \u2013 to captivate with amazing experiences that hundreds of millions of players want to play.","There\u2019s a lot more to come from Electronic Arts in FY15, and I look forward to sharing more updates in the months ahead. For now, Blake, Patrick, Peter, Frank and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert Baird.","Colin Sebastian - Robert Baird ","Firstly, on the Battlefield and Dragon Age news, certainly sounds like the extra time is justified. I wonder if that should also change our assumptions at all about release of next year\u2019s sequels, such as Battlefield.","And then secondly, what are you guys seeing in terms of the mix between physical and digital sales on next-gen, particularly full game downloads. And as a related point, how are you managing the transition to digital with your retail partners in mind?","Blake Jorgensen","","First, we\u2019re going to refrain from giving \u201916 guidance already, or even talking about timing on Battlefield for next year. We\u2019re committed to continuing to build a great Battlefield franchise. I think that\u2019s the reason why we\u2019re really focused on a fabulous hardline product. And you\u2019ll hear more as the year goes on, about what might occur in the future year.","I would say, though, that since we\u2019ll be shipping in fourth quarter, you\u2019ll tend to see more hardline business next year than we would have originally had if we\u2019d shipped it in the third quarter, and that bodes well for our \u201916 as well as our \u201915.","With that, let me turn it to Peter.","Peter Moore","As Frank mentioned in his remarks, we saw about $71 million in full game downloads, which excludes mobile. And that was split about 50-50 PC versus console. And I had mentioned on the last call that we were seeing somewhere in excess of 10% now for full game downloads on the Xbox Live and Playstation network.","We\u2019re seeing that continue to grow. Now it\u2019s between 10% and 15% of the initial sales that is going digitally full game downloads on those platforms. And if we take UFC as an example, which only shipped with two weeks of the quarter left, we saw at the high range of that 10% to 15% band.","So we\u2019re continuing to see a progressive move toward gamers being able to download, because they can now on the next-gen consoles, full games on day one and week one of the ship. I will also add that the transition, though, is working well with our retail partners. Progressive retailers such as GameStop are preselling well our sports titles that are the ultimate edition SKUs, which give $40 of digital content for only an incremental $10.","So our retail partners are able to play in that digital space as well, so I think we\u2019re balancing out this transformation between physical packaged goods and digital well, and our retailers are able to play in that space.","Operator","Next question is from Edward Williams with BMO Capital.","Edward Williams - BMO Capital","First of all, can you talk a little bit about what your thought is on the next-gen adoption trends, what we\u2019re seeing with regards to hardware pickup, and what its impact is on the legacy console systems, and what we might see in terms of a mix between the two as we progress through the year.","Peter Moore","So when we look at the eight months since launch of the Playstation 4 and the Xbox One, and then look back at the same period of time with Xbox 360 and Playstation 3, in the previous generation, we are seeing 90% increase here in the U.S. of [unintelligible] hardware sales. And we\u2019re seeing no dropoff in attach whatsoever.  ","","We\u2019re keeping a very close eye on the current gen of Xbox 360 and PS3, but as we continue to ship games, and as our competitors and colleagues in the industry continue to ship games, we\u2019re seeing still a pretty vibrant ecosystem there, and we have reassurances from both Sony and Microsoft they\u2019re going to support the long tail of both of these platforms. So very, very strong start for Xbox One and Playstation 4, respectively.","Edward Williams - BMO Capital ","And then can you just comment a little bit now that you\u2019re eight months into post-release of these consoles, what you\u2019re seeing with regards to developing the software for those systems? Any challenges that you\u2019ve run into? Or has the learning curve already been mostly scaled at this point?","Andrew Wilson","Great question. I think what we\u2019re seeing right now is, you know, any time you go into a new platform transition, you know, the benefit, to use that term loosely, of going through three or four major transitions in my career so far, they are never easy. What you do find as you come into the second phase is that the software, the operating software of the platform itself, starts to stabilize. And the first parties, Microsoft and Sony, start to find additional processing and GPU bandwidth on those platforms that we\u2019re able to benefit from.","Also, our teams get a better understanding of how our engine\u2019s pipelines work with respect to those new platforms, and we start to see an optimization of our development process, and we start to see greater output in terms of CPU, GPU, and ultimate quality of games as a result.","Operator","The next question is from Doug Creutz with Cowen & Company. ","Doug Creutz - Cowen & Company","I want to touch on the mobile gaming business. It feels like we\u2019re kind of rapidly morphing to a situation where the hits in that business are getting bigger much more rapidly, but potentially beginning to suck some of the air out of the room for lesser titles, much like we saw happen in the console space over the last five to ten years.","Just curious if you agree with that, and also, if and how are you changing your approach to the mobile business to try and ensure that you get some of those top 10 and top 20 hits that could really be material eventually.","Frank Gibeau","Let me point out that you are correct in that there is a greater concentration of revenue in the top of the charts in mobile. So the dynamic that we\u2019ve seen in the PC or the consoles over the years is happening in mobile, it\u2019s happening at a fairly normal rate, if not any faster or any slower than what we anticipated. But you\u2019re definitely seeing more revenue, more audience in the top five, top 10, top 20.","It is a very large market, and the charges do differ by region, so Asia is very different than the west. So there\u2019s still a lot of room to maneuver in terms of the types of titles and the types of genres that can be successful and that are growing.","The mobile business also has a lot of growth in front of it, and so we anticipate that the overall pie will continue to grow while the concentration occurs at the same time. So it\u2019s a lot of positives in terms of how you look at the overall market.","When we look at our opportunity in mobile, EA, we\u2019ve really looked at what are we really good at and what do we need to get better at? And what we think we really have as a core competitive advantage is an unbelievable portfolio of IPs and brands. ","If you look at some of the more recent releases in mobile, like Farmville or even the Kim Kardashian game, it\u2019s really pointing to the fact that brands are becoming more and more important in mobile, and if you look at the charts, the concentration of the revenue is happening in brands.","That\u2019s definitely moving into our direction, where we have a strong portfolio of proven brands like the Sims, FIFA, Madden, Need for Speed, and so on, as well as The Simpsons Real Racing. So we feel really good about how the market\u2019s moving in our direction on the IP front.","We also have great production values. We\u2019ve got great technology. So we know we can nail the art side of the business. What we need to do a better job of is mastering the live services piece, and that\u2019s where we\u2019ve been spending a lot of time reconfiguring the mobile teams at Electronic Arts from premium to freemium teams.","As you heard in the remarks from Blake, the mobile premium side is growing at about 39% to 40% year over year, which is a healthy number. We think we can do even better than that, but what\u2019s important to us is that we\u2019ve been going through this transition from premium to freemium, and it\u2019s pretty much over at this point. ","It\u2019s freemium from this way forward, and we\u2019re adding a lot of new technology and talent to allow us to operate freemium services at scale. So the combination of proven brands that install organically at an amazing rate, combined with great freemium services that engage customers over a very long time and provide them great value. So we feel really good about that combination of audience, brands, and freemium services. ","Operator","The next question is from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","First, maybe just give us a little more color on the Battlefield beta. Obviously you\u2019re pushing it out. What areas maybe are you trying to address and make better? And then secondly, great job with the expense controls. Are you kind of through that? And kind of more level expense growth from here, with revenues? Or how are you thinking about that and making sure you\u2019re investing in the future?","Patrick Soderlund","We launched the beta at E3, and we saw a tremendous pickup of players. We had over 1.7 million players in the beta. And what made me happy was the fact that we had a stable environment, people got to play the game, and it functioned really well, which is kind of the first thing we\u2019re looking at when we look at a beta.","Then, we allowed people to play for a little bit longer, maybe, than we planned, because we found a lot of feedback from players in there, providing us valid information and feedback around features of the game and how the game felt, etc. ","And things like the cops and robbers fiction maybe wasn\u2019t shining through properly, you know? Is it playing like a military game, but it should be a cops and robbers game? We saw ideas around asymmetric gameplay, a bunch of really strong, good, well-thought ideas that we decided to listen to.","And having a long discussion with the team, and looking at where we were, we felt like the best thing for us was to give the development team a little bit of extra time and get the game to where we think it needs to be in order to be successful. ","Blake Jorgensen","And let me address the opex question. You know, I think we\u2019re never done reviewing our opex and looking for opportunities to bring opex down. The question is, do we use that savings to invest back in the business, or do we drop it to the bottom line. I think we\u2019re pleased with the level that we\u2019re currently running at, but we also know that we\u2019ve got future products that we need to invest in, as well as marketing that we want to invest in.","If you look at the trend from \u201913 to \u201914, just for Q2 as an example, Q2 opex in \u201913 was $580 million, and it dropped to $499 million in last year\u2019s trend. We\u2019ve guided obviously above that, but most of that guidance is driven by marketing spend increases to support The Sims, which was not obviously in last year, and a very profitable product for us, as well as some of our continuing fueling the mobile growth and our Ultimate team and sports property growth.","But the reality is, we\u2019ll probably continue to keep focused on that. The key message, I think, for shareholders is the organization is very aligned on making sure we manage opex effectively and balance that against investment for the future. And we\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019re seeing, and the level that we\u2019ve been able to maintain.","Operator","The next question is from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse "," ","I think I just heard Blake talk about $105 million in net mobile revenue that we\u2019re not advertising, I guess from freemium content. So I guess this suggests about $150 million in gross bookings for the quarter, and about $600 million for the year. So this makes you already one of the larger mobile game companies on the planet, yet it seems like you\u2019re monetizing on a paying user basis at about half the rate of some of your developer peers.","So is there yet a concerted effort inside the company to bring up the monetization rate at all? Or will your preference be to try to grow your active user base for now?","Additionally, you\u2019re disclosing that you have 140 monthly active users as of the latest quarter. What was that number a year ago?","Blake Jorgensen","Just a clarification. We had $109 million of mobile revenue associated with smartphones and tablets, and of the freemium revenue, which is most of that, that was primarily the $105 million number I mentioned. So freemium is $105 million of the $120 million overall mobile.","I\u2019d be careful about drawing a line between that number and our ability or inability to monetize. It\u2019s hard to assess that based on just a pure revenue number. Now, having said that, I\u2019ll let Frank address, we are obviously focusing on how we can monetize more, and build great games around that.","Frank Gibeau","Yeah, the key to monetization is value and engagement, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused on, is building live services for our products that deliver the maximum value to customers over the long term in a highly engaged way. That\u2019s where you\u2019ll start to see our conversion percentages improve, our [darbs], all the KPIs that go into what monetization looks like. That\u2019s where our focus is right now. We\u2019re building great games with great brands. ","We organically install very well. Last year, we had about 635 million installs across the business. So we generate very large audiences. We don\u2019t have a problem with audience size. Our issue really is engaging them and giving the maximum value over the longest period possible.","And what we\u2019re doing right now is investing in technology and teams and talent to get us into position to be among the best in the world at freemium long services. That\u2019s our long term goal.","Operator","The next question comes from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee "," ","I wanted to see if I could focus a little bit on the FIFA franchise. I know you guys talked a little bit about the momentum you had. The World Cup product was only on the old gen, and I\u2019m just wondering how that resulted in the performance of this title versus the one four years ago. And also, if you could shed some light on FIFA 15 preorder activity at this point?","Peter Moore","I think it\u2019s a radically different world today, with the World Cup in Brazil, than it was in 2010 in South Africa. When we look at our FIFA franchise, and the offerings we have on a global basis across the platforms that we bring in on the different business models, and our ability to be able to engage our consumer globally versus where we were in 2010, which was simply put out an event-based game, our FIFA Ultimate Team Mode, as Andrew mentioned in our World Cup modal alone drove over 53 million games. We had 800,000 World Cups played almost every single day. ","The engagement levels we\u2019re now seeing at a digital level are far greater than we\u2019re seeing from a standalone event-based game. Not to say that that game didn\u2019t do well, and it did, but what we\u2019re seeing now is our FIFA consumer, regardless of the event, is engaged 365 days a year.","And really, it was the World Cup mode on FIFA Ultimate Team, combined with great catalog sales of FIFA 14, as well as the event game itself, that will give us tremendous emphasis and motivation to go into FIFA 15 now.","And to your question, the preorders are very, very strong on that title. I think it showed extremely well at E3 and we continue to release assets. It\u2019s a gorgeous looking title, and you saw earlier this week the release of the emotion-based engine that the team is working on now.","I think it\u2019s a very different world, and it\u2019s a very, very strong part of our franchise offerings. And obviously now I think we\u2019ve moved away from having individual [unintelligible], like big events, and having a 365 day a year offering called football. And it\u2019s as simple as that. ","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee ","On digital, up 28% in the quarter. Guidance for the year is, I think 17%. And just maybe help us reconcile, is there any timing issue here? Or are you just being conservative in [unintelligible] number?","Blake Jorgensen","","Well, you know, we always tend to drift toward the conservative side. I think you also, though, have some areas that are fairly consistent quarter over quarter, like extra content. But full game downloads will bounce around depending on the product. PC-centric product like a Battlefield or a Sims tend to do really well on full game downloads, and we\u2019ll tend to see higher quarters then.","And while mobile is growing very well, we still want to continue to see that grow, and so I\u2019d say we\u2019re still in line with our guidance, and unless we start to see complete outside trends around something like full game downloads, we\u2019re probably not going to start changing that yet. But more to come.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Olson with Piper Jaffray. ","Mike Olson - Piper Jaffray","How do you feel the new hardline timing sets a game up competitively compared to the prior October launch timing that, I guess, was arguably a more crowded competitive launch period? And then secondly, this is way out there, but regarding Star Wars Battlefront, I\u2019ll try to avoid asking about specific timing of the game, but maybe more relative to the movie. If the timing of the movie changes, is that something that could impact the timing of the game? Or is the timing of Battlefront not tied to the theatrical release of the film in any way?","Peter Moore","It\u2019s a great question on Battlefield hardline, and as I think we all know on this call, we\u2019re coming into a very competitive holiday period. Notwithstanding Patrick\u2019s comments, which are the real reason we\u2019ve moved it, just to create a better game based on the feedback we got from the beta coming out of E3, and of course another beta to come as well. We actually like the window that Q4 offers us. It\u2019s a cleaner window. ","We look at Q4 fiscal, which is Q1 calendar 2015, and when you take the primary reason, which is to have a better game, and then you think about the ability for us to deliver in a cleaner window, it actually sets us up well, not only for the quarter but also take in mind how that will set us up for FY16 coming off what should be a very strong game that gives us a longer tail with strong catalog. ","I\u2019ll throw it to Patrick to talk about Star Wars.","Patrick Soderlund","As it relates to Star Wars, we\u2019ve shown parts from the game today, so you know that what we\u2019re building is more rooted in the traditional Star Wars universe and not so much necessarily linked to the movies being made. And that\u2019s just because we wanted to make a game that celebrated the history of Star Wars. ","Obviously there will be things in there that are somewhat tied to the new movie. I wouldn\u2019t say that we have a particular tie to the movie. Now, obviously we would prefer to be close to the movie, but I wouldn\u2019t say that we\u2019re directly tied to it. ","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian Pitz - Jefferies & Company ","Just a quick one on Battlefield, how are you thinking about annualizing this franchise? Basically, what are the metrics that you\u2019ll drive to go green light this franchise as an annual release?","And then separately, can you give us some color on the $122 million loss on licensed IP commitment? Specifically, is this Star Wars Knights of the Republic or maybe College Football IP? Or is it something else?","","Patrick Soderlund","I\u2019ll start with the Battlefield question. For Battlefield I think it\u2019s important that we have the right products at the right time. We need to make sure that we continue to drive innovation, and we continue to drive quality and that we get the best possible games in the hands of our gamers.","Now, does that mean that we need to ship a Battlefield game every year? In some years, that may be the case. In others, it may not be the case. But it doesn\u2019t mean that we want or need a Battlefield game every year.","I think this year we\u2019ve shown that we are willing to put quality first, and I think that\u2019s ultimately how we are going to be successful.","Blake Jorgensen","On the GAAP writeoff, I think the thing about it is when Andrew became CEO, we looked at a lot of things about the business that we had questions on, and one of them was a review of all of our licensed properties that we have. And as you can imagine, we\u2019ve been in the business a long time. We have a long stable of licensed properties, much the same way a movie studio might have with options on properties that they may or may not make movies on.","We then went through and decided which properties made sense to maintain and we decided that this property did not. It is not a property that you would, neither of the ones you mentioned, Star Wars or NCAA\u2026 And it\u2019s a property that most people wouldn\u2019t even know that we actually have a license on.","But when we decide to abandon a certain licensed property, accounting rules require us to recognize the loss from the decision, much like a loss is recognized maybe when you exit a lease on a facility, for example. And so that charge reflects the loss we will no longer use as part of that IP. ","Operator","The next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel. ","Drew Crum - Stifel","I want to stick on the gross margin topic. 70% in the first quarter feels like a milestone for the company. In taking into consideration the writeoff you just mentioned, Blake, have you reset expectations for gross margin? Can you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about gross margin longer term?","And then separately, can you comment on - and I think there was a comment made on the FIFA presales - can you comment on presales for sports titles generally relative to what we were seeing last year at this time?","Blake Jorgensen","I\u2019ll start with the gross margin and then I\u2019ll turn it to Peter on the presales. So, remember the charge we\u2019ve discussed is a GAAP only charge, and you\u2019ll see in our guidance that we\u2019ve made some changes to our GAAP guidance, but not to our non-GAAP guidance. ","So in our GAAP guidance, you\u2019d see a reduction - and this is in the GAAP to non-GAAP tables on our website - you\u2019ll see there\u2019s a reduction of gross profit or a constant revenue of $122 million. And that impacts our GAAP only results, and not our non-GAAP results. ","On the non-GAAP basis, we\u2019re pretty confident of our continued growth in digital business, which will continue to drive our gross margins. You saw that in the quarter, and you\u2019ll continue to see that as the year goes through.","Obviously, as a reminder, Q2 tends to be a lower gross margin time, because of all the sports titles that we ship in the quarter and the royalties associated with those. But we\u2019re fairly confident, as we\u2019ve reiterated our longer term full year guidance to stay the same on a non-GAAP basis. And we\u2019re very focused on driving value and continuing to drive our digital business, which we think will impact our gross margin over time.","Peter Moore","So on your question on presales on sports titles, as I mentioned, coming out of E3 we saw a strong pickup across the board for all EA sports titles. But maybe I can take this opportunity to reset some expectations of the importance of presales as a key indicator to the strength of a title.","Here at EA we not only track presales, and yes they\u2019re important and have been for decades, but also look on a daily if not hourly basis at the NPS, the net promoter score, what gamers are thinking about our title at any given time.","The [unintelligible] awareness, the definite purchase intake, the rating amongst aware. We\u2019re in a digital age now, and again, as important as presales are, and particularly through our key retailers, we\u2019re also looking at the importance of the sentiment that gamers have about what they\u2019re seeing every single day through social media and the assets that we\u2019re pushing out from our games team.","So yes, they\u2019re important, yes, they continue to improve, but they\u2019re just one single data point in a myriad of data points we now use to measure our success going into launches.","Operator","The next question comes from Ben Schachter with Macquarie.","Ben Schachter - Macquarie ","I wanted to follow up on a couple of the questions on mobile that were asked earlier in the call, maybe from a little bit different angle. It seems clear that you\u2019ve had a lot of success with the Ultimate Team so far, and I was wondering if you could talk about how you can translate this success to drive more growth for the sports titles on mobile specifically?","Frank Gibeau","Yeah, the teams that are working on Ultimate Team on console and on PC are the same teams that are building the mobile products. And so there\u2019s a lot of crossover and institutional learning that\u2019s going into the designs on mobile. In Q2, you will see two new designs from us on FIFA and Madden that will incorporate a lot of learnings that we\u2019ve accrued over the last several years as we\u2019ve grown the Ultimate Team business in both Madden and in FIFA.","Again, it really comes down to what I pointed out earlier, which is engaging the customer, giving them maximum value over maximum time, and that\u2019s something that the console teams on FIFA have done so well over the years, and they\u2019re bringing that to bear on mobile starting in Q2.","Blake Jorgensen","I guess the one thing to remember, though, is that mobile games tend to be played in shorter bursts of time, and they\u2019re typically played with one finger or two fingers. And different twitch mechanic then, on a console. And so we develop mobile games associated with things like FIFA or Madden that will take different forms than our current games or our current Ultimate Team franchise.","But we\u2019re in full alignment with where you\u2019re heading, which is we think there\u2019s a great opportunity to continue to expand on the fantastic sports partnerships we have with people like NBA, NHL, NFL, and FIFA to really drive mobile around the globe, particularly around the globe in places like Asia, where mobile games are so popular.","Operator","The next question is from James Hardiman with Longbow Research. ","James Hardiman - Longbow Research","Can you talk a little bit about retailers, both digital and physical, that are willing to pay a little bit more for exclusive content? I think GameStop recently said that they were going to at least look into putting a little bit more capital to work. It\u2019s not a completely new trend, but I guess at the end of the day, is that another lever that you can pull that will allow you to extract more of the economics of a game, and how do you balance that with consumer preferences. ","And I guess sort of a related question, as Sony moves further and further ahead of Microsoft with respect to the next gen, remind us how long the Xbox One exclusivity is for Titanfall. And is it safe to say that a sequel will be on both platforms? ","","Peter Moore","It\u2019s a great question. Let me also point you to clarification that Paul Raines of GameStop had with this paying for exclusive content. He clarified that the next day. This wasn\u2019t going into developers and publishers and giving them money to get content specifically for a GameStop. GameStop is a very progressive retailer. We work very closely with them around the world in providing them and other retailers with content that drives presales - to my original point - but also drives interest in the game itself. ","And again, I think that\u2019s just one thing that drives demand generation combined obviously with great marketing and a great game itself. We see this ability to be able to spur demand six months, nine months, 12 months out, through digital content and offerings. And I\u2019ll point you to my original comments on the Ultimate Team SKU for sports with $40 worth of content for an extra $10 on top of the standard SKU is just one tactic in this battle.","Our job is to get the attention of gamers, provide them with great value for the money, and work with our partners, both physical packaged goods retailers as well as digital retailers to be able to drive that business. And I think we do that pretty well. ","Andrew Wilson ","With respect to the relationship with Microsoft, we\u2019re not at liberty to discuss the terms of our exclusivity deal there in the construct of Titanfall. And we\u2019re not in a position to announce anything further, other than we continue to support Titanfall. The player base continues to grow, and as I talked about in the prepared comments, we\u2019ve just dropped some fantastic content for that product, and it had a great showing at E3, where it was on our floor. ","Operator","The next question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company. ","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Company","Just curious on the first person shooter category. One of your competitors has moved to a three-year development cycle with annual iterations of their shooter. And of course the attempt there is, I think, to raise the bar on quality. So I\u2019m curious how that sort of reshapes your thinking, theoretically, on Battlefield, perhaps, where maybe there\u2019s the idea that you\u2019d annualize that.","Patrick Soderlund","The first thing we have to do is get to a spectacular engine, and I think engine for us, in Frostbite, is key. That allows us to iterate and improve our workflows and pipelines so that our teams can work as effectively as possible in our engine environment. So we have a large team working continuously on improving and updating our engine. ","The second thing we need is teams. We need a bunch of really great development people that can get together and make spectacular games. And then the final thing we need is obviously time. If you look at that as it relates to Battlefield and our shooter segment in particular, Battlefield obviously historically has been made in Stockholm by the [Dice] team. For the reason that you outlined, we did put [Visceral] on it, who is here in San Francisco, and working on hardlines.","Now, since Battlefield 4, we\u2019ve had some people in Sweden working on expansion packs, but other people are obviously doing other things. So I think what they\u2019re doing mimics to some extent how we\u2019re thinking. Obviously, more time, if managed correctly, yields a better product. So I would say that we\u2019re similarly aligned, and that we\u2019re taking a similar approach, but we haven\u2019t articulated exactly what teams are working, because that would imply announcing things that we can\u2019t right now.","Peter Moore","One thing I would just add there, and to Patrick\u2019s point, the balance of those three things, a great engine, the right teams, and the appropriate amount of time, would actually - and Patrick and his teams have been working for some time on changing the construct. And that doesn\u2019t mean that you have hundreds of people working for longer periods of time. It really means that you have the right sized team at any particular point in time and development, operating at a very, very efficient optimized development environment, so that those at their appropriate size can deliver great creativity and innovation.","Mike Hickey - The Benchmark Company ","Blake, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve done a headcount update for a while. What\u2019s the total headcount for the company? And then if you could segment that between R&D and marketing, that would be great. And then how do you expect that to trend through your fiscal year end.","Blake Jorgensen","We don\u2019t disclose very often headcount. We haven\u2019t recently, and we don\u2019t break it out by groups. I would say you should trust the headcount is down from what it has been historically, and we think it\u2019s around the right size now. And we want to continue to move it around based on where the biggest opportunities are, so you might see headcount build up in one studio and down a little in another studio. ","But in general, we\u2019re trying to move out the ups and downs we\u2019ve had historically around headcount, because that clearly makes a better place to work, but also it creates more smooth financials as well.  ","Operator","The final question comes from Sean McGowan with Needham & Company. ","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company","A couple of follow ups. Regarding the two titles that were pushed out a bit, is any of the impact that you\u2019ve seen on your guidance for the fiscal year related to Dragon Age, or is that pretty much going to contribute whatever it would have contributed?","Blake Jorgensen","We haven\u2019t changed the guidance. The only thing that changed in guidance was the GAAP guidance, and that\u2019s because we recognized revenue over time based on the life of the game. So in moving Dragon Age and Battlefield forward, we\u2019ll recognize less GAAP revenue in the year, just because the deferral period gets shifted forward. But from a non-GAAP standpoint, we\u2019ve kept our guidance the same. So you should assume that we\u2019re assuming similar revenue for both products.","Sean McGowan - Needham & Company ","And then a clarification on that $122 million GAAP charge. Is that entirely royalty commitments? And doesn\u2019t that imply a rather large amount of revenue that would have been associated with that? Was that over a very long period of time? It seems like a title that would have generated that kind of royalty payment would be something we would notice","Blake Jorgensen","Yeah, don\u2019t necessarily assume it\u2019s a title. It\u2019s use of IP. So it might be either over multiple titles or it might be associated with marketing long term. And assume that it\u2019s a very long term contract, and thus part of reason we made the decision, because we weren\u2019t getting the value out of it that we thought we might get. Even though we get a lot of value out of the opportunities, it\u2019s not as much as we originally thought it might be.  ","With that, we\u2019ll wrap up the call. Thank you, everyone.

Sir, you may begin.","Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations","Thank you, Kay. Welcome to EA's fiscal 2016 second quarter earnings call. With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO, and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO. Peter Moore, our COO, will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, and a transcript.","A quick calendar note, our Q3 earnings call is scheduled for Thursday, January 28, 2016.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and the future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today.

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision.","All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Chris.","Q2 FY 2016 was a strong quarter for Electronic Arts, as we delivered new EA SPORTS experiences and dynamic live services for our players. Revenue, margin, and earnings were above our guidance, and we are raising our full-year outlook to reflect continuing strength in our business and excitement for our upcoming titles, including Star Wars Battlefront.","To understand how Electronic Arts is delivering for our players today, we look at player engagement in our games and services. We see our opportunity along three key vectors: bringing in more players to experience our games and services; enabling them to spend more time with the games they love; and making it possible to connect through more platforms and delivery models.","Time is the most valuable commodity we have in today's digital world. With every new game, every update in our live services, and every community interaction, we are focused on delivering more value for our players through deep and personal engagement.","Highlights from our second quarter demonstrate how more players are spending more time on more platforms in our games today. Monthly average players increased 30% year over year across our annual EA SPORTS franchises that launched new titles in Q2, Madden NFL 16, NHL 16, and FIFA 16.","Our live services for Battlefield Hardline and Battlefield 4 are thriving many months after launch, with more than 6 million monthly average players across the two experiences.","Madden NFL Mobile launched a full-game update this year instead of a new app download. The result was a seamless experience for players, which increased retention and resulted in game sessions up more than 300% over last year.","And last but not least, EA Access is accelerating. The subscriber base more than doubled in the last two quarters. We've added five new games to The Vault this year, and we're excited about what we're learning as players engage through this service. These titles and live services as well as many more in our portfolio are giving us strong momentum moving into the holiday season.","Looking ahead, they will be joined in Q3 by two of our most exciting and groundbreaking new experiences. First, the return of Need for Speed is here, with players able to join a trial via EA Access today, and launching for everyone on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 beginning November 3. Excitement in the community has been growing as fans learn more about the cars, customization, and unique stories in the game. The game looks fantastic. And after a closed beta conducted earlier in October, the Ghost Games team has been working directly with community feedback to deliver the experience our players want. With more than 70 different customization categories and twice the amount of road to race as our previous game, the passion for speed and car culture will be unleashed in the new Need for Speed.","Starting in just nineteen days, the galaxy far, far away will once again be at the center of our universe, as Star Wars Battlefront launches around the world. Engagement in and around the record-breaking beta was huge, with more than 9.5 million players logging on to play, 19 million viewers tuning into video streams, and almost three mentions per second on social networks during the beta week.","Stability and scalability of our online services continues to be a top focus for us. In addition to our extensive internal testing, the millions of gameplay hours logged during the beta across multiplayer, single-player, and co-op modes further tested our infrastructure to help prepare a stable experience for our players at launch and beyond.","Over the next few weeks, innovative new experiences will allow players to connect and learn more about Star Wars Battlefront. Our most avid Star Wars Battlefront fans can sign up for free to receive exclusive content and advance access to new information about the game. Through the largest-ever user-generated content program we've ever launched, awesome and inspiring moments from the game will be shared with millions in the player community. And a fully-immersive web experience will put fans right into the world of Star Wars Battlefront.","Through it all, our integration with the upcoming film will ensure we're fully connected to the rising passion for Star Wars that is captivating the world. Come join us in Star Wars Battlefront beginning November 17, or November 12 for EA Access members.","As we continue our focus on putting players first at Electronic Arts, we strive for quality and innovation in every experience. In addition to stability, security, and availability, we are taking creative leaps to make each game memorable and fun. We'll always work to take the necessary time to get the combination right for our players, and earlier this afternoon we announced that we are shifting Mirror's Edge Catalyst's release to May 24, 2016. We're going to take a few additional months to make the City of Glass and the unique first-person action in Mirror's Edge Catalyst even more spectacular.","With players spending more time in our games and live services and two stunning new experiences launching this quarter, we're looking forward to the holiday season and the remainder of the fiscal year for Electronic Arts.","Now I'll hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Andrew.","EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.15 billion, which was $71 million, or 7% above our guidance. The quarter's revenue was 6% lower than the prior year's as a result of an FX headwind of $110 million and The Sims 4 launch last year. However, on a constant currency basis, revenue would have been 3% greater than last year's thanks to strong launches of our EA SPORTS titles, led by FIFA 16 and Madden NFL 16 and from their associated Ultimate Team Live Services. As well as front-line success, we saw ongoing strength from our catalog, particularly The Sims 4 and Battlefield.","In addition to our strong performance, this quarter's revenue includes a $30 million benefit from the recognition of some revenue from special editions of sports games sold in the quarter. It relates to Ultimate Team content included in these versions we had originally forecast to recognize in Q3.","Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 6% year over year to $480 million, 42% of this quarter's revenue. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was up 15% to a record $2.31 billion.","Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $195 million, up 27% over the prior year. The principal driver of the growth was Ultimate Team across our sports franchises. In addition to the strength of these live services, we benefited from an extra week of FIFA 16 sales in the quarter compared to last year. The new games modes we added to Madden NFL 16 and FIFA 16 are proving effective in deepening engagement. In addition, FIFA Online 3, our PC free-to-play title for China and Korea, continues to perform well and is tracking to our expectations.","Mobile generated $113 million in the quarter. The free-to-download component was up 2%, or 9% up at constant currency. During the quarter, we launched Need for Speed No Limits, EA SPORTS FIFA 16 Ultimate Team, and a full-game update of Madden NFL Mobile. Madden has been a top-five grossing game in the U.S. on the iPhone Apple App Store in October. These new titles together with the just-launched Minions Paradise, the upcoming Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes, and our existing live services will help continue to grow our mobile business.","Full-game PC and console downloads generated $89 million of revenue, down 5% over the prior year, due in part to FX. At constant currency, this revenue would have increased, as the growth in console downloads more than offset the absence of The Sims 4 this year. Our new titles in the quarter averaged around 20% full-game downloads with the exception of FIFA, which skewed lower due to strong retail sales in Europe.","Subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue contributed $83 million, down 9% from last year, due to the natural decline in Battlefield 4 premium revenues. EA Access is delivering strong, sustained growth.","And finally with regards to subscriptions, we launched a major expansion for Star Wars: The Old Republic on Tuesday. Subscriptions are up 31% since the expansion was announced, to their highest level since February 2014. We're optimistic about its continued performance in terms of both subscribers and free-to-play in the run-up to the first new Star Wars movie in a decade.","Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 65.4%, a decrease from last year's 66.1%, but above our guidance of 63%. Last year's Q2 gross margin was exceptionally strong due to The Sims 4. About 100 basis points of the margin outperformance this quarter was driven by the $30 million in high-margin revenue mentioned earlier. A stronger than expected product and service mix also drove margins above our guidance.","Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $479 million, down $18 million year on year, driven by FX. The improvement on guidance was driven by phasing and continued cost control. At constant currency, OpEx would have been up approximately $16 million, chiefly driven by increased investment in R&D. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $0.65 per share, which is $0.25 better than guidance due to our strong top line performance, continued cost management, and the revenue phasing described earlier. At constant currency, EPS would have grown over last year.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.59 billion, or approximately $8.32 per share. Fifty-seven percent of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore. This is down from 64% held onshore last quarter, the difference being driven by the redemptions of our convertible notes and stock repurchases.","During Q2 we settled close to $200 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. And as of yesterday, we've received notices for an additional $95 million to settle in Q3. We have updated the dilution table on our website accordingly.","We also repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $126 million, leaving $798 million in our two-year, $1 billion buyback program we began in May 2015. The current rate of repurchases keeps us on track to complete the full $1 billion in that time.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $9 million. Operating cash flow was down $174 million from last year as a result of fewer launches in Q1 of this year compared to last, and also due to the timing of various items. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $818 million.","Turning to guidance, due to our continued strong performance, we are again increasing our full-year outlook. The open beta for Star Wars Battlefront was exceptionally well received by players. Consequently, we're raising our unit forecast for sell-in during fiscal year 2016 to approximately 13 million units. This is partially offset by increased FX headwinds and our decision to move Mirror's Edge Catalyst into fiscal 2017. And remember that the $30 million of the beat in this quarter was already in our annual outlook as part of our anticipated Q3 revenue.","Our new full-year guidance for non-GAAP revenue is $4.5 billion, up $50 million on our prior outlook. Our guidance for non-GAAP EPS increased by $0.15 to $3.00 per share. We anticipate an operating margin of approximately 28%. Since the start of the fiscal year, we've raised guidance by $100 million on revenue and by $0.25 on earnings. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.4 billion in revenue and $2.32 of fully diluted EPS.","Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $1.2 billion. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a free cash flow forecast of approximately $1.1 billion.","Guidance for our third quarter is for non-GAAP net revenue to be $1.78 billion, 24% higher than last year's. Growth is driven by the launches of Star Wars Battlefront and Need for Speed plus the growth of live services, particularly Ultimate Team. FX presents a year-on-year headwind of around $110 million to Q3 revenues.","Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 71.5%.","We expect our Q3 non-GAAP operating expenses to be $540 million, up slightly year on year, driven by increased investment in R&D and phasing from Q2, offset by FX. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $1.75 per share as compared to $1.22 last year.","Our Q3 GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.08 billion as compared to $1.13 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be a loss of $0.17 as compared to earnings of $0.44 last year.","Our business exceeded our expectations again this quarter. FIFA 16 in particular had a very successful launch, as measured both by number of unit sales and by engagement levels. This has provided a solid foundation upon which to grow our live services through the product cycle. Reception of the Star Wars Battlefront beta has led us to increase our unit forecast, and early indications for Need for Speed are excellent. The growth of our console installed base and powerful mobile devices continue to fuel the growth of our business. We're looking forward to an excellent holiday season and another year of strong earnings and cash flow growth.","Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Blake.","Around the world, billions of hours a week are spent playing video games. No matter what device you're playing on, what type of experience you seek, or where you are in the world, games are becoming a more meaningful part of our lives. The opportunity to connect more people to amazing experiences and to each other through play has never been more profound.","At Electronic Arts, we are focused on delivering more stunning games and groundbreaking services that will inspire the world to play together: epic fantasies like Star Wars Battlefront that span generations of fans; EA SPORTS experiences that unite millions of passionate players; mobile titles like Need for Speed No Limits, SimCity BuildIt, and Madden NFL Mobile that can immerse you no matter where you are or how much time you have; and services like EA Access and Origin that are helping players try more games and share the play experience with friends.","It's been a strong first half of FY 2016 for Electronic Arts, and we have amazing opportunities still ahead of us. The games and services we are delivering represent EA's greatest strengths, pioneering, creativity, and passion, channeled into experiences that will inspire play for a long time to come. We're excited for the road ahead.","Now Blake, Peter, and I are here for your questions.","Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations","Kay, if you could, open up the line for questions now, please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from Chris Merwin from Barclays. Sir, your line is open.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","You obviously continue to make a lot of progress on the margin front, and you're at slightly more than 50% digital as of last fiscal year. So as that shift continues, can you just update us on what the long-term margin target for the business looks like just in terms of non-GAAP operating income?","And then secondly, extra content sales growth reaccelerated really nicely in 2Q, and I think you mentioned that the new launch of FIFA 16 and FIFA Online 3 were drivers there. So should we expect the momentum to continue there through year end? And what are you implicitly including in your guidance just in terms of extra content for the full year? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, so this is Blake. In terms of the longer-term targets, we haven't really given detailed long-term targets. What we have told people is if we continue on the same pace of digital growth as we've seen over the last couple of years, we should be able to generate at least 100 basis points of gross margin expansion each year. Historically, it's exceeded that level, but I think at a minimum we should be able to see that.","If you combine that with control around our operating expenses and continued movement towards more digital marketing, we should be able to see earnings growth. And our target is to try to get to earnings growth at least above 10% or greater, closer to 15% on a yearly basis if we can. That's obviously general targets. We'll give you detailed guidance for FY 2017 at the end of the year. And to the extent that we have an update on that, we'll let you know. But we continue to be excited, obviously, about where the business and the potential is.","In terms of FIFA, the guidance for extra content and Ultimate Team in general, the guidance for extra content that we originally gave for the full year was around 10% growth of extra content. We've been exceeding that, and we hope that we can continue to hit that target or beat that target over time. We're very excited about the continued engagement levels that people are showing in all of our sports titles around extra content as well as the potential for extra content in other places in our portfolio.","As far as FIFA Online 3 goes, in China we had originally given guidance that that should be around $10 million to $15 million a quarter, and we're seeing that level, and we're pretty comfortable as that continues to grow over time.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay, thanks. Blake, you just raised your Star Wars unit guidance. I think you gave the overall revenue phasing guidance in the slide deck. But what's embedded in your guidance for how Star Wars will be phasing between your third and the fourth quarters?","And also secondarily, I think you mentioned 20% digital download. How far behind is the European consumer in terms of full-game download adoption on the console? And are you seeing that uptake curve I guess follow in a similar path as what you've already seen in the U.S.? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Stephen, good questions. I don't have the number off the top of my head, but you should assume that a fairly large portion of the original sell-in comes in the third quarter. And then depending on how that does through the Christmas season, we'll see the rest in the fourth quarter, so roughly probably 75:25.","In terms of the full-game downloads, a couple things to remember; we still sell Gen-3 products, and Gen-3 products are typically doing full-game downloads at a much lower level. And then second, our business, particularly FIFA, is skewed heavily towards Europe, and two factors bring down full-game downloads today in Europe. One is bandwidth speeds in some countries. And two is many retailers in Europe, particularly in Great Britain, use FIFA as a way of driving traffic into the store, and they like a physical copy to help do that.","We're seeing very strong full-game downloads continue in North America. And as a reminder, the PC business that we have, we see full-game downloads there roughly 75%. And so there's still a lot of headroom we believe in the full-game download opportunity for us going forward.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","The next one is coming from Colin Sebastian from Robert W. Baird.","Benjamin C. Gaither - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, it's actually Ben on for Colin. I just had two questions, more strategically. Could you talk a little bit about your e-sports initiatives and going forward whether you might have the rights from sports leagues to pursue some more formal tournament play?","And then secondly, are there any plans for annual sequels or franchise extensions for Star Wars, or do the cadence of those look more like Battlefield or Titanfall?","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Hey, Ben, I'll take the first question \u2013 it's Peter \u2013 regarding e-sports. I want to remind everybody on the call that EA has been doing e-sports, and it's been a fundamental part of the way we've engaged with our consumers for over a decade, beginning with the FIFA Interactive World Cup. We've partnered in particular with FIFA, with all of the individual leagues around the world, with tournaments, and have been doing that for a number of years now. So from the perspective of our e-sports strategy, it's well formed at an executional level.","When we think about partnering with the sports leagues themselves, we have those conversations. And whilst we've got nothing to announce yet, stay tuned because I think there's a lot of energy around this right now. We're obviously a very important part of that. Our IP has been used by many of the e-sports leagues to be able to drive their business, and we fully intend to be part of this going forward here. No real announcements yet at a higher level, but please rest assured it's very high on our radar.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And this is Andrew. To the second question around Star Wars and annualization, again, what we have talked about is we have a long-term partnership around the Star Wars license, and we expect that we will launch many titles as part of that long-term relationship.","In terms of annualizing that in any particular way, we've made no announcements on that. And certainly what we're always looking at as we think across our portfolio is where there's an added opportunity for engagement. What we talked about in the prepared remarks is we still have 6 million people engaging regularly in both Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Hardline. And it's important as we think about our business not just as a launch business, but as a large service and relationship business that we factor in when it's appropriate to launch new things. So more to come on that in the future, but certainly expect more Star Wars titles from us, but no decision made as to specific timing as yet.","Benjamin C. Gaither - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you, that's helpful.","Operator","Next is from Justin Post of Bank of America.","Ryan Gee - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Yes, hi. This is Ryan Gee on for Justin. Thanks for taking my questions. The first is about Star Wars. Can you guys talk a little bit about the gross margin structure, what you can, for Star Wars relative to owned IP like Battlefield or even licensed products like FIFA or Madden? And going back to the digital downloads, you're averaging around 20% for this quarter. Is there any reason to expect that Star Wars could be higher or lower than that number?","And then second...","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay, sorry. Sorry, Ryan, go ahead.","Ryan Gee - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","No, go ahead. I'll follow up on FIFA in a second.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Okay. So on the gross margin structure, I think we've told people that the license with Disney is a fairly typical royalty license. And most of our royalty licenses are in the high single digits or low double digits, and assume that the Disney license is there.","What we try to do is offset some of that cost by lowering our marketing expense, and clearly leveraging the strength of all the activities out there around Star Wars is allowing us to do that. And you'll see a lot of joint marketing between us and Disney as well as us and Sony to try to leverage our partners to be able to offset some of that. It will impact gross margins slightly, as you've seen in our guidance for the quarter, but we don't see it as a big issue for the overall profitability of the company.","On the full-game download side, the one caveat I would add there is normally it shouldn't really differ dramatically from any other title, with the one exception is it could be a title that's a heavy gifting title in the quarter, just because Star Wars is at the top of the list of many kids and teens out there what they want for Christmas. And gifting titles tend to be more physical versus a code, and so you might tend to see that. That could be, though, counterbalanced by the fact that we'll see another 10 million to 15 million new consoles sold in the next two months, in the Christmas time. And many of those people may choose to download digitally, particularly if they're the larger storage consoles. What was your second part of your question?","Ryan Gee - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay, great. That was great feedback. The second is on FIFA and really the sports catalog. It is encouraging to see the 30% player growth. Is there any reason to expect Ultimate Team to not also be up 30%? Is there anything you can call out either this year or last year that would make that be up or down? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We were cautious at the tail end of last year because we had some issues with coin farmers. We've adjusted the new FIFA Ultimate Team to try to prevent those issues. It's a constant battle. That would be our only caution going forward. So far, we haven't seen any impact from that.","What we are seeing is increased interest in Ultimate Team. We put in both FIFA and Madden this year a draft mode, which was essentially a way to help people understand how Ultimate Team works and how drafting and building a team works. And we're finding that that increases the engagement and increases the interest in entering into Ultimate Team. And so our hope is to continue to try to build that business across all of our sports franchises. And so far, things are going very well.","Ryan Gee - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next one is coming from Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Sir, you may begin.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the questions. The 9.5 million beta players on Star Wars, what is the overlap audience with the 6 million still playing Battlefield 4 and Hardline? Is Star Wars essentially bringing new gamers into the Battlefield type of game?","And also, any updates on preorders, including the $50 DLC season pass? I'd love to hear how the DLC attach rates compare to prior Battlefield releases. Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll take the first part on the 9.5 million. I don't have the data on hand. Anecdotally, what we have seen is that Star Wars is bringing in two groups that are very important groups to us. One are gamers that have lapsed, traditionally who have been big gamers in the past and maybe haven't played for a while, and it's certainly been a catalyst for those people to come back into the gaming universe as it relates to console. And two, onboarding a new younger age demographic.","And so as we think about that 9.5 million, while there's absolutely a crossover around our core shooter category that we have very good and strong relationships with, we're very energized by the opportunity to bring in, one, that lapsed gaming group, as well as adding a new younger demographic going forward. And remember that this is a title, a shooter title that will be more appropriate for younger players than maybe some other shooter titles in the market.","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","On preorders, I think when you look back, and you've heard from both Blake and Andrew how powerful this beta was for us, and that certainly spurred tremendous preorder growth. Every week subsequent to the beta, we had 9.5 million users who logged in 1.6 billion minutes of gameplay.","On top of that, we were very fortunate, obviously, that The Force Awakens movie trailer came right on top of that, and that's allowed us to be able to generate even more publicity for the game as people start to anticipate the movie in mid-December. You combine that with all the engagement that our players have creating content themselves, a lot of user-generated content with millions of hours now of gameplay coming out of the beta on YouTube and Twitch. Now if Han Solo was here, we'd say great but, \"Don't get cocky, kid.\" Our ability to be able to deliver against this is solid and the preorders are excellent, so you've heard from both Blake and Andrew. We feel very good about 13 million units.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Was there another question?","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Battlefront season pass. As we've seen with Battlefield with Battlefield Premium, our ability to extend, and as you've seen, with 6 million people still engaged with both Battlefield 4 and Battlefield Premium, is key. The engagement numbers \u2013 and we see a season pass as integral to that. What we've announced is four extra packs over the next 12 to 18 months coming post-launch. And from our ability, to be very clear, that's FY 2017 revenue for most of it. You'll see both new universes. You're going to see new player actions, obviously new weaponry as well. We think that added engagement and we think the ability for us to be able to deliver against what we need to be able to do from a season pass increases the engagement, and a very important part of keeping the content fresh and our players engaged.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","The next one is coming from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee CRT.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to congratulate you guys on another great quarter. I wanted to ask a couple questions. One is, Blake, if you could, maybe talk a little bit more about the $30 million revenue benefit, maybe some clarification there. I think I heard you say it was already part of the guidance.","And then, Andrew, just your thoughts on virtual reality, any update there now that we have a little bit more clarity in the marketplace?","And then one last one, can you maybe talk about Need for Speed, how the beta, what is the size of the beta and the unit expectations versus the last one? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, Arvind, first on the $30 million, when we planned our guidance, essentially we sell special editions of some of the sports games, FIFA and Madden, for example. And part of those special editions include Ultimate Team currency, and we decide how to defer that over time in conjunction with our internal accounting team and our external auditors. As we got into the quarter, we determined that some of the content we thought we would defer, we actually didn't defer. We were able to book it in this quarter. And we wanted to be transparent on that so people: one, understood one of the sources of our over-delivery; and two, understood that that was just shifting between two quarters.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Arvind. On VR, our position hasn't changed on that at this juncture. Again, what we have said in the past is that \u2013 and I personally am very bullish on VR and believe it will be an integral part of our industry and our business on a go-forward basis. As we think about what players are trying to do, which is immerse themselves inside these wonderful worlds and experiences that we create, and that it overcomes the social disconnect created by sitting 10 feet or three feet or one foot from a screen.","With that said, we don't expect it will have a material revenue impact in the near future. We still think there is work to be done to get to a point where this is really a mass market consumer proposition that delivers great VR immersive experiences for a mass community. But at the same time, we are investing heavily in ensuring our Frostbite engine has all of the capability to deliver spectacular VR experiences, so we are well positioned as this market develops.","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Arvind, this is Peter. On the Need for Speed beta, very successful for us. As I think most of you on the call know, Need for Speed now is available to play if you're an EA Access member as of today. The team, as it always does with a beta, use the beta results to tweak and do some last-minute polishing to the game. Every indication \u2013 and preorders are very strong around the world, every indication this will be yet another successful launch, having been two years away from consumers, as we see the numbers coming in, in the final few days here for next week. So Need for Speed goes live next Tuesday in the United States and Canada, and at the end of the week in the rest of the world.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Great, thank you and good luck.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Arvind.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","Next one is coming from Drew Crum of Stifel.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. Can you remind us what the incremental FX hit is for fiscal 2016 now, and what the revenue foregone is from the shift of Mirror's Edge?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So roughly, Mirror's Edge, you should think about it as a $70 million-ish title for that quarter, so moving out of the fourth quarter. And our original FX guidance was roughly $250 million \u2013 or $290 million. Originally it was $250 million, and we think it's probably closer to $300 million now.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, good. And then any launch metrics aside from the mobile performance for Madden that you can offer, and any commentary around the full-game download performance of that franchise? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","In terms of the Madden franchise, you mean?","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Yes, Madden NFL 16.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It's been pretty consistent. Obviously, it's a dominant North America title relative to FIFA, and so we tend to see higher full-game downloads on Madden than we have with FIFA globally, for the fact that I mentioned earlier. And so you're seeing north of 20% on Madden obviously. And as the season goes on, we find that the initial purchasers tend to be the people who line up at the retail stores at midnight with their football jerseys on. Obviously, that skews the early days of Madden. But by mid-season we tend to see levels creeping up closer to 40%, at least based on last year's data. We don't know yet this year, but a strong focus on that. And the strength of Ultimate Team with Madden was very powerful last year. I think that draws more and more people into digital purchases as part of that ongoing gameplay.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next one is coming from Ben Schachter from Macquarie.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey, guys, a couple housekeeping questions and a couple of broader questions. Blake, just to be clear, the 13 million unit Star Wars forecast, is that for 3Q FY 2016 or lifetime?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","For full year 2016, fiscal 2016.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay, and then really quickly maybe...","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Stephen had asked earlier what I thought the split is. I said 75%. It's probably closer to 80% in Q3 versus Q4. I just looked up the numbers.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then if you could, just help us maybe translate that 30% player growth into unit growth for FIFA and Madden. And then I have a couple of broader follow-ups after that.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I wish I could translate it, but we don't think about it that way because we think about it around engagement. Clearly, it will show unit growth, but the 30% really is a measure of not just people buying the initial game but playing the game. So it's hard to put \u2013 those are apples and oranges in that respect. But you should take that as continued unit growth in FIFA, which we are seeing.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Okay. And then, as you know, given the strength this year, there are already concerns about comping revenue growth next year. I don't want to get too far ahead of ourselves in the guidance. But how should we think about the types of games or the games that are going to come next year that will help comp against Star Wars?","And then following up on Arvind's VR question, I have to keep asking these. But is EA going to wait until there's a mass market installed base, or could we see at least limited VR experiences during the launch window for some the 2016 VR hardware launches? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'll let Andrew touch on the VR one if he'd like, but I'll touch on the other question. I think we try to resist giving full-year guidance ahead of time. We have mentioned in the past on our past call that you should expect another Battlefield title coming next year. We've shown Mass Effect at E3 this year. You should expect that again. And there's some indication there will be some other titles obviously that are popular along those lines, like Titanfall or others. But we are very confident we can continue to grow the business. And we also are confident that the Star Wars franchise will live well beyond this year and we think, like Battlefield, get a long tail on Star Wars into helping drive our FY 2017 business.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","On VR, what we talked about in our prepared remarks is our great strengths, creativity, passion. One of those things is pioneering, and our desire as a company to lead and our belief that we have a responsibility given our position in the industry to lead. Part of why we're investing at an engine level is so that we can drive from a leadership position.","While we don't have anything to announce today certainly for next year, we are looking at opportunities to do things sooner and earlier than complete mass market adoption. But again, we will be getting to a point \u2013 it's less about is there mass market adoption and more about is the technology ready for mass market adoption, and that's what we're working through right now. But we absolutely have a desire to lead, as is our responsibility for the position we have in the industry.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","The next one is coming from Mike Hickey of Benchmark.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, and I also want to extend congrats on another great quarter. I guess as much as you can, I'm curious your view on Vivendi's recent investment in Ubisoft. Do you feel that perhaps there could be other potential acquisitions in the industry? And if you could update us on your current thinking around M&A and strategic partnership strategy, that would be great. And I have a follow-up.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We can't comment on Vivendi because we just don't know. You probably know more than we do. So I'll just resist on any comment there.","In terms of our acquisition strategy, nothing has really changed. We look at a lot of opportunities, but we're very excited about the opportunities we have internally. Both our own IP, we've got quite a few things cooking. As you've seen, we've hired Jade Raymond from Ubisoft to help us build some new products, Amy Hennig as well. So there's a huge opportunity for us to continue to build our own IP as well as leverage our great partnerships with people like Disney and Lucas to build off of Star Wars or any of our other licensed IP. And so we see very little need right now, but we keep our eyes open, and we're always interested in seeing how things are evolving out there.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Cool. Fair enough, thank you. And I guess thinking about Nintendo's NX platform, the dev kits have apparently shipped, and it looks like it's working towards a calendar year 2016 launch. I'm just wondering how you plan to manage your resources to that emerging platform. Do you anticipate being more aggressive on the front end or perhaps a little bit more cautious given the Wii U underperformed expectations?","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm going to address that slightly differently. As we look to the future, we see a world where more people are playing on more platforms in more geographies than ever before. We see the platform cycle now not just as a traditional six-year console cycle, but as a six-month refresh rate on mobile devices, smart TVs, Internet-enabled refrigerators, or whatever it might be. And what we're doing in terms of resource allocation is really investing at a core digital platform level, at an engine level, and at a game architecture level to ensure that we are able to deliver amazing experiences, six inches to 60 inches and beyond, two minutes to two-hour session times and beyond across any and all relevant devices where gamers are playing.","And as it relates to Nintendo, we've had a tremendous relationship with them over the years. And we will evaluate any and all opportunities with them in the same way we do all platform opportunities.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","All right, guys. Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Mike, next question.","Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations","Operator, do we have any more questions? Kay?","Operator","Next one is coming from Mr. Neil Doshi from Mizuho. Sir, you may begin.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great, thanks for taking the questions. Can you guys talk a little bit about micro-transactions and how you guys think about micro-transactions for some of your larger games down the road, including Star Wars, Battlefield, and Need for Speed as well?","And then, Blake, I think marketing spend was a little bit lighter than we were looking for in the quarter. Any more color in terms of whether you're finding better ROI in terms of marketing channels, or whether you have to just defer some marketing spend? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll take the first part of that question. As it relates to any and all of our products, what our players are telling us, particularly as they engage online with their friends, is that they want to play our games longer and more frequently and for more hours at a time than ever before. And our objective, anytime we provide additional content in any form, whether free or paid, is to ensure that in all cases we provide value for the investment of any money and the investment of their time, and that in all things we are extending and enhancing the experience so that they can continue to enjoy playing the games we make with their friends for many months and years to come.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","On marketing expense, it's hard to look at any one quarter and see a major trend because of how the titles fall. And we may have marketing expenses in two quarters ahead of a title or getting spread over multiple quarters. But our general view is we've been working very closely with all of the people involved in marketing to really leverage the engagement we have with our consumer base.","We're connected to all of our consumers. We have a unique opportunity to better target our marketing activities to those consumers and not needing to use some of the more traditional marketing vehicles that have less effectiveness. And you're going to see a lot more out of us in the future. You'll hear more. You'll see things related to Star Wars, for example, over the next couple of weeks, which really help people better understand the product and help target-market to specific cohorts. And it's just the way we're shifting marketing. The team has done an amazing job really redialing how we approach marketing, led by our new CMO, Chris Bruzzo. And we're going to see more of this, and we hope that it will help us continue to manage our marketing expense over time.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations","Next question, please, operator.","Operator","Next one is coming from Eric Handler of MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thanks for taking my question. So I'll ask another Star Wars question. When you look at the film, international revenues could potentially double what we're seeing here in North America. I wonder if there's any correlation in how you're thinking about sales for the game on a North American basis versus international basis.","And then secondly, just one housekeeping issue with, you gave a couple reasons why guidance didn't move higher, including FX, Mirror's Edge. With the dilution from the convert because of the warrants that are there, is that another thing we need to consider for reasons why guidance didn't move higher?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'll let Peter address the Star Wars question and then I'll talk on the dilution question.","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","I think from the perspective, Eric, we look at the anticipation of what is arguably the biggest piece of intellectual property in the world that has not seen a movie in many, many years. As I think you know, the anticipation, whether it's North America, whether it's Europe, whether it's Asia, is off the charts.","I don't think it correlates necessarily to how we think about it, but this is a global title. I've been traveling the world recently and checking in on all of our retail and digital channels on a global basis, and we're fired up and ready to go. The movie feels like one of the true global launches. When you start to speak with consumers around the world, the anticipation levels are high. I don't think there's a direct correlation to how we would phase our revenue from region to region. It's going to be big and bigger.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","In terms of the dilution issue, I'd just remind everyone that the current shares that are being redeemed were issuing shares that are counterbalanced by shares in the hedge transaction that we set up. And so until the actual bond is redeemed fully next summer, the clock then starts to tick on the potential future dilution around those shares. And so the dilution will be approximately 90 days after the bond is fully redeemed, and so thus no dilution this year. We have updated our table on the website, on our IR website, to reflect that. The future dilution could occur late next year, and we'll be back to you with some of our ideas around how we're going to manage that.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","The next one is coming from Doug Creutz from Cowen & Company.","Douglas L. Creutz - Cowen and Company","Thanks. You guys were I think close to flat year over year on your physical console revenue. According to NPD and I think some of the data in the UK, you were down double digits in sell-through. Obviously, you had FX headwinds elsewhere. Can you help to square that circle? Is this a case of your retailers taking more inventory? Hello?","Operator","Excuse me, sir?

These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Now, I'll return the call over to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Chris. Q3 was an outstanding quarter for Electronic Arts. Dragon Age: Inquisition was named to more than 200 Game of the Year lists globally. More than 6 million people on average were playing FIFA games every week across the world. Madden NFL Mobile had its biggest day in franchise history on Christmas Day, reaching number four on the top grossing charts in the U.S. Apple App Store. And we finished the calendar year as the world's leading console games publisher, a testament to the strength and breadth of EA's IP.","Our excellent financial results reflect the strong player engagement and critical success of our titles. Revenue and earnings for Q3 were beyond our guidance, and we delivered another quarter of strong cash flow.","At the core, we continue to focus on putting players first. As we listen, learn, and deliver for our communities with games and services that they love to play, we're experiencing new milestones in engagement. On console and PC platforms alone, more than 3.1 billion hours were spent playing EA games in Q3.","Dragon Age: Inquisition captivated fans and critics worldwide, as it launched in November, and it quickly became the most successful launch in BioWare history. More than 113 million hours have already been spent exploring the depth and detail of the single-player experience in Dragon Age: Inquisition, and more players are joining each day.","Named, Game of the Year, by 32 media outlets around the world, including RGN, Game Informer and the Associated Press, Dragon Age: Inquisition is a true masterpiece from the team at BioWare and a game that is sure to be played for a long time to come.","FIFA 15 and Madden NFL 15 also continued to deliver for fans in our third quarter. FIFA 15 was the number one title in Europe and a top 10 title in the U.S. in 2014, with engagement growing in Q3. There were nearly 50% more users logging in each week as compared to Q3 last year. Meanwhile, Madden NFL 15 was the number two best-selling title in North America for 2014 across all genres, and gameplay hours were up 30% year-on-year in Q3.","In our Ultimate Team services, engagement is deeper than ever. The total number of players entering Ultimate Team across FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15, and NHL 15 has increased nearly 45% year-over-year.","Our Maxis Studio delivered three major game updates to The Sims 4 during Q3, providing fun new content and adding some of the most wanted community features. Each update has driven more players to engage with The Sims 4, and we have plans to continue delivering fresh content and gameplay to the vibrant Sims community.","EA Mobile had a breakout performance over the holiday period. Our EA SPORTS titles are drawing more sports fans in the mobile games, averaging more than 45 million monthly active users during the quarter. Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team led the way, averaging 45% more monthly players through Q3 compared to our previous iterations in the same period last year.","The newly launched SimCity BuildIt was downloaded more than 22 million times in the first month, reached the top 5 iOS game downloads in more than 100 countries, and to date players have already logged more than 1.2 billion gameplay sessions.","New games like Madden NFL Mobile, FIFA 15 Ultimate Team, and SimCity BuildIt, as well as perennial fan favorites like Real Racing 3, The Sims FreePlay and The Simpsons: Tapped Out, demonstrate one of our key opportunities in mobile, leveraging our IP and specifically designing experiences from the ground up for players on mobile devices.","We are listening and learning from the feedback in our mobile community, tuning the experiences based on testing and soft launch periods, then keeping players entertained with new content and challenges.","Overall, the momentum that we're seeing across different platforms today gives us great reason to be excited for the future. On consoles, the install base on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 continues to show strong growth, while new players joining on previous-generation consoles are also tapping into our amazing IP catalog.","On mobile, innovative games are opening up new growth genres, like sports, with highly-engaged players. On PC, our Origin service continues to grow fiscal year-to-date and offer exciting new ways to play. Across all of these platforms, live services are extending the experience and bringing players deeper into the games they love.","With the dynamic nature of this industry, platform preferences, player interests, play patterns and game experiences will constantly evolve. We are confident that through our efforts to put players first, to continue to digitally transform our business and to operate faster and more focused team, we will be in a position of strength to make these industry changes our greatest opportunity.","I'll now hand the call over to Blake for a deeper look at Q3 financial performance, then I'll return with a few final thoughts.","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks, Andrew. EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $1.43 billion, which was $153 million or 12% above guidance. The quarter's revenue was only 9% lower than the prior year's, which included the launch of Battlefield 4. However, our focus on live services, strong title performance and expense control, drove operating margins up significantly this quarter to 36.3% from 33.8% last year, and this resulted in excellent cash generation and earnings.","This extraordinary performance was led by FIFA 15, Madden NFL 15, and Dragon Age: Inquisition. In particular, Dragon Age: Inquisition had by far the most successful launch in BioWare's history, exceeding our expectations. In addition, game sales for last-generation consoles were also much stronger than we had anticipated.","FX negatively impacted revenue by about $20 million this quarter, but our hedging program offset about half of this, and combined with the natural hedging from our international operations, largely neutralized its impact on earnings.","Our non-GAAP digital net revenue for the quarter increased 34% year-over-year to $693 million, 49% of this quarter's revenue and a new high. The trailing 12-month digital net revenue was also a record, up 17% to $2.18 billion. This is the first time digital sales have generated more than half our revenue in a 12-month period.","Breaking down our digital revenue into its key components highlights the performances of each of these businesses this quarter. Extra content and freemium contributed $314 million, up 47% over the prior year, with Ultimate Team continuing its strong performance across our FIFA, Madden NFL and NHL franchises, up 82% year-over-year in total. FIFA Online 3 in Korea continues to grow year-over-year, and the early indications from our partner in China, Tencent, are that it is already performing extremely well.","Star Wars: The Old Republic, also contributed to the segment with the expansion, Shadow of Revan, attracting many more people into the game with its epic new storyline. Star Wars fans remain deeply engaged in The Old Republic universe, and we're more excited to see how that will build, as we get closer to the launch of the Star Wars movie this December.","Mobile generated a record $139 million in the quarter, up 13% over the prior year. A $125 million or 90% of this was from digital extra content and advertising. This was up 28% versus the prior year and continues to more than offset the decline in the premium business. Premium full game download revenue was just $14 million, down 44% compared to the prior year.","Mobile had a strong December in particular, driven by the success of SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile and FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Mobile as well as continued strength in the rest of our mobile portfolio. Leveraging proven IP like this reduces the cost of player acquisition and drives the long-term profitability of our mobile business. SimCity BuildIt has proven to be a highly engaging title that has been a top-10 grossing one on iPhones in 85 countries and on iPad in more than 100.","Full game PC and console downloads generated $140 million in revenue, up 22% over the prior year, driven by growth in the installed base of PS4 and Xbox One consoles. Although, the percentage varies considerably by title, platform and geography, the trend towards full game downloads continues.","Subscriptions, advertising and other digital revenue contributed $100 million, up 52% over the same period last year. The primary growth driver was Battlefield 4 Premium revenues. EA Access, our subscription service for Xbox One, continues to grow and we're seeing subscribers play more games, engaging more broadly with EA's offerings.","Moving on to gross margin. Our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 72.8%, an increase from last year's 68.1% and better than our guidance of 70.5%. The increase over the prior year was primarily due to growth in our digital business, strength in current-generation consoles and a one-time benefit from NHL revenue deferred from the second quarter. This was partly offset by the higher proportion of sales from royalty-bearing titles in this quarter compared to last year's Q3.","Outperformance versus our outlook was driven by the record-breaking Dragon Age: Inquisition performance. In addition, sell-through was extremely healthy across the market, enabling us to maintain margins above our expectations, while keeping channel inventory clean.","Our non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $521 million, down 4% year-on-year, $19 million below prior year, but $6 million above our guidance. Compared to last year, we were able to continue to reduce advertising spend by focusing on fewer frontline titles and increasing the efficiency of the way we advertise. This was partially offset by an increase in the accruals we made for variable compensation and legal expenses, which were not in our guidance.","The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS was $1.22 per share, $0.32 better than guidance due to strong revenue, higher gross margin and continued cost control. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $2.94 billion or approximately $9.48 per share. 66% of this cash and short-term investment balance is held onshore.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $682 million. On a trailing 12-month basis, operating cash flow was $1.15 billion, a record for this period.","During Q3, we repurchased 2.5 million shares at a cost of $97 million. As a reminder, our $750 million stock buyback program was initiated in May 2014 and has a two year timeframe. The current rate of purchase keeps us on track to complete the full $750 million in that time.","Turning to guidance, we're increasing our full year guidance. For fiscal year 2015, our non-GAAP guidance for revenue will increase by $78 million to $4.253 billion and our non-GAAP EPS will be increased by $0.30 to $2.35 per share. This results in an expected operating margin of nearly 24%.","Although this guidance passes through essentially all of the Q3 earnings outperformance to the full year, it does not pass through all the revenue. The reduction in our Q4 revenue expectation is based on uncertainty around future currency movements and the decision to move EA SPORTS PGA TOUR and the first Sims 4 expansion pack into fiscal '16.","In addition, there is uncertainty, as to when we will start to recognize revenue from FIFA Online 3 in China. However, gross margin improvements and continued expense control offset this conservatism in revenue, allowing us to substantially reaffirm our Q4 earnings expectations. The GAAP guidance becomes $4.485 billion in revenue and $2.57 in fully diluted EPS.","Regarding cash flow for the full fiscal year, we are increasing our operating cash flow guidance to approximately $1.05 billion, which would be the largest fiscal year cash flow in the company's history. Our capital expense forecast remains approximately $100 million, resulting in a new free cash flow forecast of approximately $950 million.","Guidance for our fourth quarter is now non-GAAP net revenue to be $830 million, a 9% decrease compared to last year's $914 million. The year-on-year difference is largely driven by Battlefield 4 catalog sales, which were very strong in Q4 fiscal '14, the quarter immediately after we shipped Battlefield.","Our next major launch title, Battlefield Hardline, will start to ship in the third week of March, so its impact on the quarter will be limited, even though we expect it to build into a significant title through next fiscal year.","Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be 74%. We expect our Q4 operating expenses to be $515 million on a non-GAAP basis. This results in a non-GAAP diluted EPS of $0.22 per share as compared to $0.48 last year.","Our Q4 guidance for GAAP net revenue is expected to be $1.16 billion as compared to $1.12 billion in the prior year. GAAP earnings per share is expected to be $1.07 as compared to $1.15 per share in the prior year.","We're pleased with our third quarter results, and most importantly, with the consistent growth of cash flow and earnings. We're well ahead of where we expected to be at this stage of our transformation, largely as a result of the strength of our digital live services strategy, our ability to control costs and the continued great commitment of our employees to drive performance, but there is plenty more opportunities ahead of us.","We expect these factors will continue to drive growth in cash flow and earnings, and to be augmented by a growing mobile business, as we continue to apply our core IP to this platform.","Now, I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew Wilson","Thanks, Blake. It was a great Q3, and there's more to be excited about as we look to Q4 and beyond. The launch of Battlefield Hardline will be the culmination of efforts by the team at Visceral and across EA, to engage our players and deliver a rich and innovative new experience.","Battlefield Hardline is a fresh combination of speed, story and strategy, a mix of an engaging single-player campaign inspired by popular TV dramas, new speed-based multiplayer experiences and classic Battlefield multiplayer modes.","We are getting great response to the game in recent playtests, and we look forward to opening it up to the community with the upcoming multiplayer beta. This is a fast, fun and intense new experience, and we think players are going to love it. We look forward to launching this new take on Battlefield beginning on March 17.","Our slate for the coming year demonstrates EA's commitment to exciting players through brand-new experiences as well as our live services. Players in our current experiences, including Dragon Age: Inquisition, The Sims 4, the EA SPORTS portfolio and Battlefield 4 will continue to see updates and new content in the future. ","We will now launch PGA TOUR in Q1 FY '16, in line with some of golf's biggest tournaments, and it will be joined by our line-up of annual EA SPORTS titles next year. Our Need for Speed franchise will return in FY '16 with a game that is already looking spectacular. And, of course, the new blockbuster Star Wars Battlefront is set to release in the holiday quarter this year. We'll share our full FY '16 calendar, including a slate of new mobile games, during our next quarterly call.","I said earlier in the call that the very nature of the games industry is that it is dynamic and constantly evolving. That plays to the strengths of Electronic Arts. Change is one of the constants in the history of this company, and we continue to challenge ourselves to listen, learn and lead an exciting new future for gaming and our players.","You will see us focus on our player relationships, to engage and understand what inspires each gamer to play. You will see us investing in new IP and innovation, from ground-up new experiences to cutting-edge digital services. And you will see us focus on quality at every turn, stability in our services and delivery of long-lasting fun with games that are played for months and years, not just days or weeks.","Throughout FY '15, EA has focused on putting our players first and strengthening the foundation of our business. We now look forward to a strong finish in Q4, and carrying momentum from FY '15 into FY '16. ","Now, Blake, Peter, Frank and I are here for your questions.","Chris Evenden","Gabriella, if we could open up Q&A now please.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Colin Sebastian, Robert Baird.","Colin Sebastian","I guess, first off following up on the commentary regarding the full-game downloads, console games, I wonder if you could quantify the mix of digital versus physical? And then how much of the downloads are driven by promotions and bundles? And then secondly, regarding the market for last-gen games, you mentioned this segment exceeded your expectations, I wonder if we can now say that that portion of the market has stabilized or is that specific to what you're doing over the holiday period?","Peter Moore","So 100% of full-game downloads are digital from a mix perspective. As I've said on previous calls, we're seeing about 15% of our sales come from full-game downloads via primarily the Sony and Microsoft platforms, of course, as well as our Origin platform. I will say in the last couple of weeks to your question that we've seen an interesting and encouraging pickup in our sport titles in particular where we're seeing this significant increase above that number for full-game downloads on the console and PC platforms.","As regards, current-gen or Xbox 360, PS3 platforms, we saw about $100 million in incremental revenue in Q3 on those platforms, I think driven by a number of factors. I think it's been great value for consumers to pick those consoles up at this stage in their lifecycle, I think Sony and Microsoft continue to support them well. There is a great portfolio of titles. And in particular what Electronic Arts brings is blockbuster IP that gamers are very familiar with, and there're relatively easy purchases. We are also seeing strong digital pick up on those platforms as well.","Blake Jorgensen","Just to follow-up on Peter's point on full-game downloads, I think you'd asked \u2013 trying to get a sense of how much of that was coming through bundling. We did have some bundles in the quarter, but not substantially more than we would normally have. So the real full-game download trend is being driven primarily by full-game downloads on the new generation consoles.","One phenomenon, though, we do see in the Christmas holidays is that people like to give physical gifts that fit under the tree or wherever you do your gift giving. And so oftentimes, we don't see the pickup in full-game downloads until after people have played their first round of games they've gotten for Christmas presents, and Peter's point was we have seen a just most recent pickup in the last couple of weeks of full-game downloads, which would tie back to the notion that people are now starting to really understand the power of their new consoles and starting to pick that up.","Peter Moore","And this is the convenience factor, I think, kicks in there.","Colin Sebastian","So the 15% that's digital that you mentioned, Peter, that's specific over the holiday period, and you'd expect it to be higher than that.","Peter Moore","Colin, that's been our rate for the last two or three quarters, but as I said, we are starting to see a pickup in that. To Blake's point, I think what we are seeing is consumers finding the convenience of full-game digital downloads from Xbox Live and PlayStation network, as they buy their next games after they consumed their games, they got their physical games for the holidays.","Operator","Our next question will come from Edward Williams with BMO Capital.","Edward Williams","A couple of questions. Can you give us a little bit more detail about how EA Access is performing? And Blake, if you can elaborate a little bit more on what sort of an FX impact we're seeing in your operating expenses?","Blake Jorgensen","So on EA Access, I'll let Peter address that first and then I'll talk about the FX.","Peter Moore","Yes. EA Access continues to perform extremely well, Edward. Not giving numbers yet, but as you know, it's Xbox One exclusively, but we are seeing significant increase. We're seeing better positioning on the Xbox Live Dashboard for the product. I think gamers are seeing great value for money and the three legs of the stool that is EA Access. Obviously, the early trial, the discounted elements of what we do in particular and the ability to access a vault now, which continues to grow with its titles.","And we're seeing significant playtime on EA Access as well as what we believe now is consumers buying games, as they become available and launches are being, in particular our iterative titles. So I think we're optimistic that that will continue to grow as we go into FY '16 in particular, but a great start for EA Access.","Blake Jorgensen","On FX, we have a hedging program in place, where the objective is to reduce the impact of currency moves on operating income and cash flow. And in addition, we actually get a natural hedge based on the fact that we have substantial number of employees and offices in Europe as well as in Canada. And we tend to focus on four core currencies, the euro, British pound, the Canadian dollar, and the Swedish krona, which are really the four core centers of where we have employees as well as where our core revenue exists.","We're exposed to other currencies beyond that because they're not as large in the overall mix. The reality is that we're able to hedge our revenue, but rarely can we hedge a 100% of that. We're able to hedge partially because of actual hedges and partially because of natural hedges, more of our operating income swing. So we tend to see a larger swing on the topline that we do on the bottomline. This quarter, we saw virtually no impact on the bottom line, and as I said about a $20 million impact on the topline.","The real unknown for us going forward is exactly what we think the euro is going to look like six to nine months out, where our hedges are less impactful going forward. We'll know more when we give guidance in May for the full year. We see a little risk in the fourth quarter, if you see continued decline in the euro. But I think the big unknown for us is what does the euro look like all through our next fiscal year and does that present a risk, and we'll give you an update and we're doing our best to try to hedge out as much of that risk as possible.","Operator","Our next question will come from Arvind Bhatia with Sterne, Agee.","Arvind Bhatia","I wanted to see if you guys could maybe talk about how you are viewing the market for next year in light of the success you've had with the next gen. But also the stability that seems to be happening on the old gen just as that mix changes, how do you view the market growth?","And then you guys have been exceeding your margin goals consistently and that's been great. Just wondering if, Blake, you would take a shot at maybe a medium-term operating margin goal going forward, in light of all the cost savings you've already realized and how sort of the gross margin benefit you've gotten from the mix?","Blake Jorgensen","Let Andrew start and then I'll come back to the operating margins question.","Andrew Wilson","As we look at the year ahead, we are very confident. We're seeing continued uptake of PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The new boost that we had through this quarter on what was Xbox 316 and PlayStation 3 is also a very good for us. Again, we have a very, very strong portfolio of titles. And we would expect that we will continue to benefit as both generations of consoles continue to show strength and growth, albeit for different markets, given the breadth and the strength of our portfolio. In addition to that, we're seeing continued engagement with our live services, and players playing longer and engaging deeper with those live services across both generations of console.","And as we've talked about, we had a very strong quarter with respect to mobile and we're starting to see that value of our IP combined with the learning experiences that we've had over the past couple of years with respect to mobile. So all-in-all, when we think about two console generations of strength, we think about ongoing engagement with our live services, and we start to see the benefits of the learning and the strength of our portfolio in mobile, we feel very good about the year ahead.","Blake Jorgensen","When it comes to the operating margin, we're not yet ready to give sort of next year's guidance or even a longer-term guidance on our operating model. But we will in May talk a little bit about multiple year potential here. I'll use the time though to remind people that we, about two-and-a-half years ago, we were in the single-digit area and through focus of the entire organization and the whole management team, we've really pushed to change how we operate, both from a consumer perspective very focused on a gamer first mentality and second on a financial perspective.","And that's allowed us to move into what looks like now roughly 24% operating margin for the year with obviously this quarter showing operating margin well under the mid-30. We do believe that we've got potential continued upside on the gross margin side of the business as we push our digital business, and as we add more and more revenue via either digital live services or mobile, we think that will continue to benefit us through some operating leverage and give us more operating upside.","We kind of view the first stage of this change as the turnaround. We feel that that's been done and now it's really time to focus on the transition and transformation that we believe as a potential here, driving much higher operating margins and cash flows overtime.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Merwin with Barclays.","Chris Merwin","First question is just, as it relates to your cash flow guidance, it looks like that came up by about $200 million for the full year. I think it was about $100 million more than net income. So maybe, Blake, if you could just talk about what's improving free cash flow conversion? And if that's something we should expect to continue going forward? And then, just secondly, I was hoping if you could just please provide some more color around how FIFA Online 3 is doing in China? How is that compared to the launch in South Korea, just in terms of the user growth and monetization?","Blake Jorgensen","So I'll start on the cash flow, and then Andrew or Peter can weigh in on FIFA in China. Cash flow there's a couple of benefits, one, is just obviously the strength in the business across the board and the strength in our physical retail partners, I think helps people pay faster when they're in a stronger position.","And then, second, our digital business obviously fuels a much faster cash collection cycle. There is relatively little inventory in the channel. That's a very good positive for us. And all that comes together and try to drive significantly upside on our cash flow. We've been continuing to manage our CapEx aggressively, and that's helping on the free cash flow side of the business. But I'd say the bulk of it is really just a flow-through from the real strength in the operating earnings that are coming out of the business, as we're really hitting on all cylinders.","Peter Moore","Our FIFA Online 3 in China, as you know, being published by our partner Tencent there, we're still yet to get to the official launch, but we're in a very strong soft launch period right now. Tencent themselves announced in December that they have reached 500,000 peak concurrent users, which was a new record for a sports title in that marketplace. So all of the key indicators are very, very positive.","We expect at some point in this quarter to go fully live. And as we mentioned in our prepared remarks, we're yet to determine when to recognize revenue against this title. But all key indications are that this is record breaking stuff. We're very optimistic, but more primarily an impact on FY '16 at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Michael Olson","You're talking about higher engagement in live services and moving from a transition phase to kind of a transformation phase. Can you give us a sense for how you envision EA's business model will evolve maybe over the next three to five years? I realize that's light years away from now. But how should we think about EA's mix of revenue from newer business models, like subscription or free-to-play or other digital models, and maybe kind of compared to traditional retail physical disc sales, et cetera?","Andrew Wilson","As Blake has talked about and as Peter has talked about, we are definitely seeing a greater trend towards digital revenue and over this quarter certainly that trend continued. As we look to the future and we think about the various opportunities inside of digital revenue, we look a lot at our adjacent media companies that provide music and television and movies, and recognize that an opportunity for us is to capture the greatest possible share through the offering of multiple consumption models.","So as we've talked about on calls in the past, we have been investing for some years now in a digital platform that will facilitate transactions in any number of ways, either through a free-to-play micro transactions-driven model, a premium download model or a subscription model or some combination of those things. So as we think about our digital future, we are really looking at various platforms, various markets and various business models in that digital realm and looking to offer that in a way that any particular player might want to consume the great games that we make.","Chris Evenden","Next question please, Gabriella.","Operator","The next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.","Ryan Gee","This is Ryan Gee calling in for Justin Post. Just two quick questions on the digital business. First, it's encouraging to see the growth of Ultimate Team, both players and sales. I was wondering if you could talk about some of the drivers last quarter. Was there anything in particular about this year or last year we need to keep in mind and whether this growth trend that you are seeing there is sustainable? And then second, the growth in Ultimate Team compares to the mobile business, which around 13% is tracking below the digital average. Can you talk about your plan to either reaccelerate that business or as feature phones or there is still a headwind that we should be looking at going forward?","Blake Jorgensen","Why don't I start and then I can toss it to Frank. The one reminder is underlying growth in mobile is really 28%, if you pull that premium business out, which it's a legacy for us. It's down to about $40 million a year and declining year-over-year. We can't force that any faster than we are already doing, because it's embedded in a lot of way people play games still. But Frank can talk about the exciting growth idea as well as growth that we're seeing in the mobile business.","First, just on the Ultimate Team side of the equation, the key for us in Ultimate Team right now has been discovery, making sure people understand what it is and how exciting and fun it is. Still a smaller portion than -- of all the people that buy the game, less than half of people actually enter into Ultimate Team, and a small fraction of those people actually get heavily involved in Ultimate Team and ultimately monetize. And so part of our goal is increasing visibility of Ultimate Team and making sure that people understand how to play it and how fun it is.","So you see, when you load up the Madden disk for the first time, you see Ultimate Team come up on your screen. We're trying to make sure people understand, get into the funnel essentially and understand how passionate and powerful it is, as you start to play it. And we are trying to encourage people to play with their friends, and so you'll see more and more of that drive Ultimate Team.","Clearly, it's of a scale today, that you question how much larger can I get, but we're surprised every quarter about continued growth. And we do know particularly how much people love it, particularly how much opportunity there could still be going forward. So exciting times ahead and we're looking at ways that we can leverage an Ultimate Team mechanic and more games than we currently have, even non-sport style games.","Frank Gibeau","The question on mobile, really what I'd draw your attention to is the new releases that we put out with Madden, FIFA and SimCity BuildIt, which were built from the ground up as freemium services. We've spent the first part of this year taking the best and brightest from inside Electronic Arts as well as from outside, bringing in from the industry, to build a world-class mobile team. And those three products really represent what we believe the future potential of big brands with natural organic acquisition advantages coupled with great quality, great technology and a focus on engagement and live service represents.","So in the quarter, if you strip away the headwind from the premium download business, we're growing around 28%. But that growth actually accelerated as we stepped into December and we picked up share there, with the release of SimCity. And our next product up Need for Speed BuildIt, another huge brand that will acquire very well. We have to build from the ground up freemium service layer. We're really bullish on how the slate will unfold going forward and really drive that growth rate that's currently in the high-20s to something that we're pretty proud of.","Ryan Gee","And then one follow-up quick question, if I may. We saw in the NPD, the retail data in December, that there was some weakness in the average selling prices, particularly on the new-gen consoles. Is that something that you guys have seen in early January continue? And is that something we should be concerned about maybe in '15, just faster price cutting by retailers?","Peter Moore","No. I don't believe so. I think Ryan what you were seeing was maybe some promotional short-term promotional as retailers, particularly here in North America, we're trying to gain market share over the holiday period. I think things then revert to normal. I haven't seen that. My teams in the field haven't seen it. I think what you saw was a short-term blip.","Blake Jorgensen","And you guys have heard me say this before, but I'll say it again, and that is, be really careful using NPD data, it's becoming less and less valuable, as more and more of the business is going digital. And there is obviously not a digital comparison to it. But both in volume and in pricing, it can be sometimes a very large distraction, and then when you add in that there is no international piece to it. It really underestimates the strength of our business, I think as you can see in this quarter.","Operator","Next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel.","Drew Crum","I wonder if you could comment further around Battlefield Hardline. I think you suggested that it would not be material to fiscal fourth quarter numbers. Is that from a revenue perspective or is that apply to profit as well? And should we expect most of it to shift to the first quarter of fiscal 2016?","And then on gross margin, I have two questions. Can you pull out the NHL benefit you saw in the quarter? And then, Blake, just thinking kind of longer-term, your gross margin guidance for fiscal '15 is now above 70%, but digital is a little more than 50% of total non-GAAP revenue. Any thoughts on longer-term gross margin upside for the business?","Blake Jorgensen","Don't take my comment on Hardline to be in any way negative. It was simply to say that we don't ship it until the third week of March, and so it's primarily a sell-in only and we'll see a very large impact as we roll into next year with that title. As an example, right now the levels of people playing Battlefield 4 are some of the highest we've seen in the last year. And so people play and buy Battlefield products for a long time and in the future. And so we think the selling will be very strong for Hardline, it will be important for the quarter, but I think it's a strong indicator going forward.","Andrew Wilson","Yes, Drew, just want to add to Blake's comments there. It's a great window for us and our retailers around the world see this late March window, to Blake's point, not hugely material for the quarter, because it will be what we call an initial purchase quantity or a one-day load, and then a little bit of replenishment.","Huge opportunity I think for FY '16, but retailers like GameStop here in North America in particular, always see this as a go-big title are really getting behind it. And we're seeing the same across the rest of the world. I think it's a huge opportunity for us to be able to reestablish a new offshoot for the franchise that is Battlefield. As Blake said, it's one shot on the quarter but FY '16 looks very strong, when we look at our forecast for this title.","Blake Jorgensen","As Andrew mentioned, the speed and the excitement of the game exceeds almost anything we've done in the Battlefield franchise. And I think that's going to really catch people by surprise and you're going to see a lot of people -- the momentum is going to build on it as more and more people start to play it and want their friends to be able to come in and play it.","The things you're able to do is vehicles, with weapons in the urban centers, it is jut almost unbelievable and you will start to see more and more screen, more and more live game play of that over the next few weeks as we start to crank up the marketing activity. And then obviously, the beta that Andrew mentioned. So more to come there, it's pretty exciting though.","On the gross margin side NHL it was $150 million in terms of revenue that was deferred end of the quarter, and so that really probably took gross margins up by about a point, relative to the overall over delivery of gross margin. And so it obviously helped, that's why we wanted to call it out, we did that because we had more to deliver on NHL, when we did during the quarter and that's why we deferred some of NHL revenue.","I think longer-term gross margin, more to come when we give guidance next year, but we do believe that we could operate in the 70% to 74% gross margin longer term. This year, we're in that 70% to 71% and in couple of quarters bouncing higher than that. But we do believe there is potential particularly as we continue to ship that digital business and the live services moving forward, so more to come on them.","Operator","Our next question will come from Mike Hickey with Benchmark Company.","Mike Hickey","Two questions. The first one relates to your fiscal '16. And I realize, Blake that you are not providing guidance, but perhaps as a broad stroke how you guys are thinking about your title count growth for frontline console releases in the year? And then your headcount assumption what sort of headcount growth you are thinking about in fiscal '16? Then I have a follow-up.","Blake Jorgensen","So first on the title, you should assume all the sports titled obviously will be in their regular rotation. I would assume that we're going to continue to try to double-down as we mentioned on our Ultimate Team and try to expand that business. We have Need for Speed back in the rotation, next year which is the positive. As Frank mentioned, there is Need for Speed coming on mobile, but also we're going to have another couple of unannounced very exciting mobile titles as well in the quarter or in the year.","And then, last but far from least, we've got a Battlefront, Star Wars title coming in before Christmas next year, aligned with the Star Wars movie rollout. We're extremely excited about that and we think there is huge potential for that title. More to come in the next couple of months on that as more about the movie comes out as well as more about our titles comes out, but you should consider that a very large activity for us next year and very large focus, similar to how we thought about Battlefields in the past.","Mike Hickey","And maybe you can talk on headcount, Blake.","Blake Jorgensen","I'm sorry, yes. And in terms of headcount, I think our focus on margin and on cost discipline will not stop. We're very focused on that. We're focused on what that means for headcount around the world as well as marketing spent around the world, and that focus is going to stay. So you shouldn't see a dramatic change in headcount, probably think about it roughly as flat. And really our challenge is how do we offset some of the natural increases in compensation cost during the year and we've got everybody trying to drive efficiencies through their business to try to offset some of that.","We were remaking some of the headcounts, so we're moving towards more live services, that means more customer service, more live service management, and that will have to be offset by reductions in another places where we can balance that headcount or remix headcount amongst what people do in their day-to-day job.","Mike Hickey","And the last question for me is I'm sort of curious how do you think about free-to-play becoming a more viable business model for consoles over the medium term, particularly for sort of multiplayer-only experiences that are starting to pop up a little bit more than prior cycle?","Andrew Wilson","On free-to-play with consoles, we think about this much to everything about free-to-play overall. And there is a couple of different vectors to this. The first is, as we look to the future, we believe a very big part of that player base will expect a free-to-start experience. When we look at film, television, music, books very often there is this free trial notion that actually on boards new players, new listeners, new readers or new viewers into a service. We're actively looking at how we could offer that type of experience to our players, console and across other platforms.","From there, it really comes down to, do they make their next step in terms of a premium download, a micro-transaction in a free-to-play type environment or a broader relationship through a subscription. And our expectation is that we will be offering all three of those options to players, both console and across other platforms.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean McGowan with Needham.","Sean McGowan","I have a couple of follow-up questions from earlier ones. Blake, on the hedging, I just want to be clear. Are you actively engaged in trying to hedge more than just the transactions that you have and extend that into translation?","Blake Jorgensen","So we had both balance sheet cash flow as well as earnings, and we're hedging essentially the core currency that where we operate around the world. So think about it as effectively trying to minimize the swings and exchange rate, the impacts of the swings and exchange rates on our P&L and on our balance sheet. We don't try to place bets to try to make money on hedges. We simply are trying to offset swings that occur. So ideally for us it would be we're constantly neutral to any currency moves.","Now, obviously, that's hard to do and it gets expensive. And so when you see rapid changes in FX like we've seen in the last six weeks, it's harder to be able to protect against that over a long-term period of time, because it just gets very expensive to do. So we have rolling hedges that we add overtime to smooth our hedging and we try to make sure that we're protecting both, revenue line, but most importantly the cash flow and the earnings lines.","Sean McGowan","But is it safe to say that the driving assumption as you enter those hedged transactions is that the current rate persists or you're making some bet about the direction?","Blake Jorgensen","We'll make some bet about the direction, but we're not trying to make a bet about the direction to make money per se. It's just simply to protect where our cash flows are coming from.","Sean McGowan","And I'm not sure who should take the next questions, it refers back to the stability that we're now seeing in the old gen, previous generation sales. We've seen some zigging and zagging in recent quarters about that. So is the stability more a function of your expectations getting better honed or is there really a change in the marketplace going on?","Peter Moore","I don't think there is a change. We're entering the ninth year of the cycle here. So I think we're seeing the strong tail. I think both Sony and Microsoft to their credit are providing support behind their current gen, between both Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It's having been in that side of the business, as you will remember it's a strong opportunity for both of these to continue to leverage the power, that very large installed base. There is a great portfolio of title that stretches back nine years. The hardware is great value for money for consumers that haven't jumped in yet for a console hardware.","We were concerned and we were called probably two or three quarters ago that all of the actions was in Xbox One and some PS 4s. But I think what's happened is that that consumers moved on and there is plenty of consumers they are still looking to get involved in games. Great deals for retailers around the world in Q3 and holiday period, and our job obviously is to be able to take full advantage of that, and nobody in the industry has more recognizable blockbusters than Electronic Arts.","And I think it's as simple as that our teams are well-positioned with our content, with both our retail partners as well as full game downloads of those titles. And this is where great brands of great IP shines, with consumer that maybe coming in a little late and looking for recognizable content. So I think you can characterize it, as a stable situation. I think as we look at our FY '16 numbers, we expect that to continue and to take full advantage of it.","Blake Jorgensen","During the year, there were roughly 3 million old generation console sold here in the U.S. And half of that came in the last two months of the year. So obviously, Christmas discounting probably drove a lot of that sales. And if you're buying a console for the first time, as Peter said, there is a high probability you're going to buy FIFA or Madden or Need for Speed or one of the titles, Battlefield titles that people really know are the great title to play.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies.","Tim OShea","Another question on the balance sheet. You guys ended the calendar year with over $2.9 billion in cash and equivalents, and by my math, I think that's up from about $2.1 billion last year. Just given the elevated levels, I thought it made sense to revisit your current thinking with respect to things like how much cash you need on the balance sheet, about share repurchases and maybe even those 0.75% convertible notes that are due 2016. Just wondering if you are thinking has evolved that as the balance continue to rise? And then I have a quick follow-up.","Blake Jorgensen","So clearly, we have flexibility that as we get more and more cash on the balance sheet. We're very focused on making sure that that cash goes back to shareholders in the most efficient way. As we're thinking about our cash needs, obviously the first we think about just the general operating needs, and we always are weighing on the notion that now 60% of that cash is sitting onshore, but that's a benefit from the repatriation that we did a-year-and-a-half ago or a year ago. There is a natural cash build that occurs internationally and so that will start to deplete over time and will go back to probably a greater cash balance internationally than domestically.","Also weighing on our thinking is the current converts that are due in August of next, August calendar year '16. And we're thinking through ways in which we either can refinance those or pay those off, but that clearly weighs on how much cash we hold at least in the interim.","And then last but not least, we're very committed to continuing to buyback stock. We are on track to be able to complete the $750 million two-year buyback, and as we generate more cash we'll consider greater buybacks over time. It's not complicated. I think we just have a simple model, which is saying how do we get that back to shareholders.","Tim OShea","And then just looking at guidance, it does appear you only drew a portion of the beat to full year. Just curious, is there anything out there in the March quarter that maybe you're a bit more cautious, perhaps around FX or is this just reflects some general conservatism on your behalf?","Andrew Wilson","Yes. Well, unfortunately, I guess I'm just starting to think that we're conservative all the time, which I guess we are, which is a good thing. I do remind people, we started the year with guidance of $4.1 billion and $1.85 in EPS and some the original conversations I had with people thought we were crazy to guide that high.","And obviously, now we're at $4.253 billion and $2.35. As I said in the call, I think the major driver not flowing through all $150 million of the revenue fee was: first, we decided to move two titles out of the quarter, small titles, but titles nonetheless, PGA Golf and the first Sims expansion pack will both fall into Q1 now. Those are originally in our thinking for Q4.","Second, we don't know where FX is going to go. I don't think it's going to go in a lot more, but I said that when the euro was $1.30. So there is some uncertainty there. And then third, we are waiting to see when we'll be able to recognize our revenue on the FIFA Online 3 in China with our partner Tencent.","There are some contractual obligations that need to be met and we don't know if those will get met in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter. And so those uncertainties stopped us from flowing all $150 million through, but what we did is flow through essentially the operating income benefits to really flow through the entire EPS in the quarter.","Chris Evenden","All right. One last question.","Operator","Our final question will come from Neil Doshi with CRT Capital.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Rob on the call for Neil. I just wanted to quickly ask on the nice marketing efficiency that you showed in the quarter. I think if you could just maybe give us a little bit of color on how much of that is due to -- or how are you thinking about and how much of that is due to improvements in game quality versus structural shift to live services versus changes in marketing tactics?","Blake Jorgensen","I'll let Peter answer that. The one just simple thing to remember is we didn't have Battlefield this year in the quarter, we had last year in the quarter and Battlefield was scale of a product and going to spend a little bit more money. So that's really just a simple fact, but there are a lot of efficiencies that we're also focused on.","Peter Moore ","I think, Rob, to answer to your question all of the above, I think it's obviously great to have a title with the quality of Dragon Age: Inquisition, that's not only our great marketing, but then organically grew with the quality of the title and the ability for it to be able to get picked up virally by games who then passed on their recommendations to fellow gamers is something that we see.","Secondarily, yes, we've been talking for two, three years now about increased systems and efficiencies that we're applying as a company to watch the way that we communicate with our games. And you're seeing that, you're seeing that in every single quarter, obviously we would continue to ratchet down our expenses without revenues dropping and without our efficiency actually increasing in the way that we communicate directly with our gamers.","We track metrics that are based on demand and tend to purchase aided awareness. Those continue to grow across all of our franchises. And our ability to track our consumers on a day-to-day basis rather than simply launch with big TV campaigns, which may have been what we've done many years ago, you are seeing the resulting efficiencies as a result in our marketing spend as a percentage in that revenue and that will continue.","Blake Jorgensen","There is one more dynamic, I will just add to that and Peter is right on all fronts. The other dynamic, of course, that's happening is by virtue of our life services and the ongoing engagement with our players, we are now more connected with our player base for much, much longer. And so the need to go out and kind of re-recruit players who we may have had a disconnect with or a disengagement with is something that we are not having to encounter at the same rate that we maybe did two, three years ago.","So there's ongoing shift to a life services philosophy, it's not just helping it in terms of the ability to deliver amazing experiences to our players, but also it's keeping us connected with them, so that we can ensure that they know about the latest, greatest experiences that we have.","End of Q&A","Blake Jorgensen","Thanks, everyone. Appreciate the time today. We'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","And with that, we conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect your lines at this time."],"7894":["Electronic Arts, Inc.

Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Chris, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today.","FY 2015 was an exceptional year for Electronic Arts. With a clear focus on putting our players first, we delivered new experiences that were award winners, global best-sellers, and breakout hits. Our live services for franchises like Battlefield, FIFA, Madden NFL, and The Sims are thriving. The communities in our mobile titles continue to grow. And through constant dialogue, we are forging deeper relationships with our players.","We broadened our portfolio on key platforms, introduced new service models, and delivered quality through stable, scalable, and innovative experiences. All of this contributed to outstanding player engagement in EA experiences across console, PC, and mobile in FY 2015.","Our financial results were consistently strong throughout the year. Revenue and EPS were above our guidance for the full fiscal year, and we have reached an all-time high in operating cash flow. EA today is performing with focus and efficiency, and we're leaning into our strengths to deliver great experiences to a growing and diverse audience of players around the world.","Dragon Age: Inquisition and Battlefield Hardline are both terrific examples of the focus we have today. Moving launch dates is never easy, but we are committed to making the hard decisions that will benefit our players. With Dragon Age: Inquisition, those extra few weeks of polish allowed BioWare to deliver a truly epic new experience. Not only did it win dozens of Game of the Year awards. More importantly, our players gave it the highest form of praise, with nearly 200 million hours of Dragon Age: Inquisition played life to date.","Our Visceral team opened up to player feedback earlier and more than ever before while developing Battlefield Hardline, and the input from our community was a catalyst for greater innovation. With the added development time, Battlefield Hardline delivered a complete package for different types of play: core strategy-based Battlefield gameplay that our fans love; fast and fun new multiplayer modes like Hotwire; as well as a deep story-driven single-player campaign. We are very happy with how well the game has sold to date, and more importantly, that we've brought many new fans into the Battlefield universe.","Meanwhile, EA SPORTS had one of its best performances ever. Nearly six months after launch, FIFA 15 remains a top-five title in the Western world, with more than 18 million matches played on average every day in Q4. Gameplay hours of Madden NFL 15 were up nearly 30% for the quarter over last year, and the hours played in Madden NFL Ultimate Team in the quarter increased a massive 97% year over year. Passionate sports fans are spending more time in our games today and engaging in our Ultimate Team modes to extend the fun long after the season is over.","We continue to see major growth in player engagement with our live services and digital offerings across all platforms. Our investments in Battlefield 4 brought greater stability to the experience and allowed us to apply our learnings to ensure that Battlefield Hardline was stable and scalable at launch and beyond. We now have two Battlefield experiences with large, highly engaged audiences, and both will receive new expansion packs in the coming months.","Other services are showing strong momentum with players as well. Monthly engagement levels on Origin were up significantly over the previous year, and the subscriber base for EA Access continues to grow as we learn more about the innovative new delivery model on console.","For players on smartphones and tablets, we've built a strong foundation of key titles, and now we're adding to it. Players are going deeper into SimCity BuildIt, logging more than 2.4 billion game sessions in Q4. And Madden NFL Mobile continues to capture more sports gamers, with gameplay up 25% over the previous quarter.","But perhaps the greatest example of our core strength in mobile, designing experiences that will provide years of entertainment, is The Simpsons: Tapped Out. Nearly three years after launch, The Simpsons: Tapped Out averaged more than 16 million monthly players throughout FY 2015. We are building some excellent momentum in our mobile business, and we're excited to launch new Minions and Star Wars experiences later this year.","In FY 2015, we captured hundreds of millions of players with new RPG, sports, shooter, simulation, and casual experiences across console, PC, and mobile devices. Now as we look at the opportunities ahead of us in FY 2016, we are positioned to build relationships with millions more through entirely new experiences as well as new games in our major franchises.","Just three weeks ago, the world got its latest look at Star Wars Battlefront from our DICE studio. The reaction has been powerful. Our Star Wars Battlefront trailer has been watched more than 29 million times to date across social platforms. Brought to life through an unprecedented partnership with Disney and Lucasfilm, Star Wars Battlefront will immerse players into the Star Wars universe like never before. The power of our Frostbite engine technology enables us to deliver intricately detailed visuals and a completely authentic environment for players to live out their Star Wars fantasies.","Anticipation is now building for the launch of Star Wars Battlefront in November, and we're excited to be a part of one of the biggest global pop culture events of the year with the return of Star Wars. We look forward to showing more of Star Wars Battlefront to players at E3 in just a few weeks.","In addition to Star Wars Battlefront, we will leverage the breadth of our IP to reach a wider audience of players across multiple genres and platforms in FY 2016. EA SPORTS will excite fans throughout the summer and fall with the latest releases of Rory McIlroy PGA Tour, Madden NFL, FIFA, NHL, and NBA Live, including industry-leading gameplay, compelling new features, and fresh Ultimate Team experiences.","FY 2016 will see the return of Need for Speed as we introduce a new console experience as well as a new mobile game. Maxis will continue to deliver great new content for The Sims 4, including another expansion pack, multiple game packs, and additional game updates for the growing Sims 4 player community. After Plants vs. Zombies Garden Warfare became a sensation last year with console players young and old, we will be returning to the Plants vs. Zombies universe with a bigger and bolder new console experience in FY 2016 that we'll share more about at E3. Minions Paradise, our first game with the popular franchise in partnership with Illumination Entertainment, will be one of at least five new EA Mobile titles this year. In spring 2016, Mirror's Edge is set to revolutionize the action-adventure genre with its stunning first-person gameplay.","And of course we'll continue to bring new content to our communities in Battlefield Hardline, Battlefield 4, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Star Wars: The Old Republic, our EA SPORTS titles, and EA Mobile games. Our live services will continue to keep these experiences fresh and fun for players throughout the year.","Across the world today, more people are playing games and spending more time playing games than ever before. The audience is wider and more diverse than we have ever known. Games are truly becoming the best form of entertainment, and EA is well positioned to benefit. Building relationships with new players and strengthening existing ones through meaningful engagement is at the core of our objectives as a company. We are continuing to invest in our digital platform, infrastructure, security, live service systems, and community engagement teams to scale to the needs of a growing global player base that hold games as a vital and intrinsic part of their lives.","FY 2015 was a transformative year for EA, as we put our players first, delivered amazing high-quality games and services, and drove greater speed and efficiency into our business.","I'll now turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our Q4 financial performance and a view into the year ahead.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Andrew.","As Andrew mentioned, we had another great quarter and a phenomenal 12 months. Before going into the details, I'd like to step back and consider the journey we've been on for the last couple of years.","When we first started talking about improving the performance of Electronic Arts, I suggested it would take three years to double our non-GAAP operating margins from 10% to 20%. We've exceeded that in two years. In fact, at nearly 25%, our fiscal 2015 operating margin is over 500 basis points above our guidance at the beginning of the year and at its highest point in over a decade. We've dramatically increased our efficiency. Non-GAAP operating expenses are down a full 10 percentage points, from 56% of net revenue in FY 2013 to just 46% in FY 2015. And we've done so without adversely impacting our revenue or the effectiveness of our R&D or marketing.","This year we delivered the best Dragon Age of all time, grew our sports franchises, expanded a core franchise with Battlefield Hardline, and announced new IP, including Star Wars Battlefront. In addition, we've continued to grow our digital live services and leveraged our IP portfolio to establish a strong position on mobile platforms. Our core product catalog and digital live services are helping the company deliver more consistent, repeatable revenue and cash flow each year.","These improvements have more than quadrupled our free cash flow over the same period, from $218 million in FY 2013 to $972 million in FY 2015, and driven a threefold increase in non-GAAP diluted EPS, from $0.84 a share to $2.51 a share. But there's plenty of road left to travel on our journey to build both great games and shareholder value.","Most significantly, the digital transformation sweeping the whole industry is still in its infancy. This transformation presents opportunity to continue to grow margins by increasing the proportion of full-game downloads, by providing extra content for games, and by taking our IP to mobile platforms. Downloads of our games for current-generation consoles continue to increase. Meanwhile, our extra content and subscription strategy generated $1.3 billion in net revenue in FY 2015 and continues to grow strongly. Finally, our mobile business at $524 million is now the third-largest in western markets and the eighth-largest worldwide, and we anticipate continued healthy growth going forward.","As well as driving gross margin improvement, we continue to look for opportunities to better leverage our investments. For example, our digital platform strategy will help us better understand and engage with gamers for more efficiency. And standardizing on one game engine across studios amortizes core technology development across all our titles and accelerates our innovation. Bottom line, we believe we can continue to grow non-GAAP EPS into the future.","Moving to the fourth quarter results, EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $896 million, which was $66 million above our guidance and $18 million below last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by sales of Battlefield Hardline and the ongoing strength of our catalog titles. In addition, our mobile business continued to grow, led by SimCity BuildIt, Madden NFL Mobile, The Sims FreePlay, and The Simpsons: Tapped Out. One note, because FIFA Online 3 was launched in China in April, we did not recognize any revenue in Q4. We expect to start recognizing revenue for this service in Q1 FY 2016.","EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $602 million. This resulted in a fiscal year digital revenue of more than $2.2 billion, about 52% of total revenue. Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of each business. First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $247 million, up 2% over the prior year. The growth of extra content slowed this quarter due to FX headwinds resulting from the fact that most of the FIFA Ultimate Team business is in Europe, and from changes we made to reduce illegitimate coin selling in FIFA Ultimate Team. Nevertheless, for the year FIFA Ultimate Team expanded over 40%, and Madden NFL Ultimate Team more than doubled. Overall, Ultimate Team grew 53% on top of the prior year's 62% growth.","We took steps during the quarter to reduce the trading of illegitimate FIFA Ultimate Team coins, which had distorted the economy and made it difficult for many players to build the team they wanted. We've made changes to limit the game exploits and automated processes that used to generate those coins and taken steps to rebalance the game economy. However, some risks remain, and we've factored those into our Q1 and full-year guidance.","Second, our mobile business generated $150 million for the quarter, up 22% over prior year. Premium mobile only accounted for $9 million of the mobile revenue this quarter. Excluding premium, our ongoing mobile business grew 38% year on year.","Third, full-game downloads added $114 million to the quarter, flat year on year, with strong sales of Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition, and The Sims 4 offsetting the fall-off in Battlefield 4 and Titanfall sales. Our Origin service for PC gamers increased its monthly player engagement levels by two-thirds over the previous year and continues to strongly grow revenues and users.","And finally, subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue totaled $91 million, up $22 million or 32% over the same period last year, driven largely by Battlefield 4 Premium. EA Access again outperformed, and we expect its contribution to accelerate this year as we start to promote this service with Microsoft and continue to add titles to the EA Access Vault.","Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 75.4%, 140 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of Battlefield Hardline. It was down from 77.4% in Q4 fiscal 2014, primarily due to the strength of our sports titles.","Operating expenses for the quarter were $513 million, up $10 million from last year and $2 million lower than our guidance. The year-on-year increase is primarily due to marketing expenses for Battlefield Hardline.","The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.39 per share, $0.17 above our guidance.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $198 million compared to $281 million in the prior year, primarily due to the timing of titles. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in company history at $1.07 billion, a very significant increase over last year's cash flow of $712 million, and above our twice-revised guidance.","Fiscal year 2015 capital expenditures were $95 million, resulting in a free cash flow of $972 million.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.02 billion or $9.75 per share. Approximately 62% of this was held in the U.S.","During the quarter we repurchased 1.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $53.44 per share.","We far surpassed our expectations for the full fiscal year. On a non-GAAP basis, we exceeded our original revenue guidance by $219 million, gross margin by 250 basis points, operating cash flow by $267 million, and EPS by $0.66 a share. The new EA is delivering more consistent revenue, increasing the proportion of high-margin digital revenue, and growing operating margins, earnings, and cash flow.","This has given the board confidence to authorize a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. This new program has a two-year timeframe and replaces the remaining $356 million portion of our previous $750 million buyback program. It represents an expected return to shareholders of approximately 50% of forecasted free cash flow.","On to fiscal 2016 guidance; with regards to the market, we expect the console transition to continue at a rapid pace, and another 22 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 27 million units in place at the end of calendar 2014. This is much faster growth than in previous generations. Illustrating how far the transition has already come, approximately four out of every five copies of Battlefield Hardline sold for consoles that were either Xbox One or PlayStation 4.","In addition to the console growth, we are expecting our mobile franchise to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android. We're anticipating the installed base to grow by over 600 million to nearly 3 billion devices by the end of calendar 2015.","On a constant-currency basis, we expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 8% to $4.65 billion. The anticipated strength is broad-based and driven by the launch of Star Wars Battlefront, the continued growth of our core sports titles and associated live services, the expansion of our mobile business, and the addition of new Need for Speed, Mirror's Edge, and Plants vs. Zombies titles, as well as some other unannounced games.","We expect foreign exchange rates will have an impact on our forecasted results. At our FY 2016 guided exchange rates, we anticipate an FX headwind of approximately $250 million, leading to our expectation for non-GAAP revenue of $4.4 billion. Volatility in exchange rates during the year may cause us to reconsider these assumptions, and we'll update you on a quarterly basis.","Non-GAAP gross margin is expected to rise about 50 basis points to 71.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue. This forecast reflects gross margin pressure from product mix, as one of our major launches this year is Star Wars Battlefront, a royalty-bearing title. As a reminder, the major non-sports titles last year were Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition, and The Sims 4, all of which are wholly-owned IP.","Although the dollar's rise has a negative impact on revenue, it has a positive impact on expenses since about 46% of our R&D expense is outside the U.S. This natural hedge is worth approximately $100 million in FY 2016 and offsets the increased investment we're planning for new IP and our digital platform. As a result, we expect non-GAAP operating expense of $1.98 billion, marginally down compared to fiscal 2015.","This would deliver an operating margin of approximately 26.5% and non-GAAP EPS of $2.75, up 10% year on year. This includes an adverse impact of $0.21 from FX and a benefit of $0.11 due to a change in tax rate. The strong growth of our business outside of the United States is having a long-term benefit to our corporate tax rate such that we now view our long term non-GAAP tax rate to be 22% instead of 25%. Our non-GAAP EPS guidance does not factor in any share repurchases that may take place during the year. The earnings presentation on our investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year.","On a GAAP basis, guidance is for net revenue of $4.25 billion, gross margin of 69.4%, and EPS of $1.90. Segmenting the sales provides further insight into key drivers of our full-year non-GAAP revenue guidance. As a note, all of these revenue numbers assumed guidance exchange rates.","Packaged goods and other revenue is forecasted to be approximately $1.85 billion, down 11%, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery. Digital revenue is forecasted to be nearly $2.55 billion, up 14%. Breaking down our digital revenue into its four primary categories, we see the contributions from each group.","Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 25% as we broaden our revenue base through the launch of more free-to-download games based on our own IP, such as Need for Speed and licensed IP such as Star Wars and Minions, while continuing to generate income from existing titles. In addition, the headwind remaining from the winding down of our premium mobile business is now very small.","Revenue for full-game downloads is anticipated to grow in line with last year's growth. Full-game downloads on current-generation consoles are now over 20% for a newly-launched game, and we're seeing higher percentages for our catalog titles. As a reminder, we count bundled games as physical sales, regardless of whether it's a disk or a downloaded code in a box with a console. 've seen a dramatic increase in PC downloads since 2010, and we believe the same forces that drove this on the PC are at play on the latest generation of consoles.","Extra content and free-to-download is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by FIFA Online 3 and Ultimate Team. Our strongest markets for Ultimate Team are overseas, so this forecast bakes in a significant FX headwind as well as the changes we've made to improve the FIFA Ultimate Team experience.","Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to decline approximately 15% to 20% this year, driven by a fall-off in Battlefield 4 Premium revenue, partially offset by growth in the EA Access and by Battlefield Hardline Premium revenue.","GAAP operating expenses for the fiscal year are expected to be around $2.17 billion.","Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal year 2016, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.15 billion and capital expenses to be approximately $100 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.05 billion versus $972 million in fiscal 2015.","Focusing on Q1, our Q1 is seasonally the quietest of our fiscal year. And although we have no major launches this quarter, we do anticipate strong catalog sales, particularly of FIFA 15 and of Battlefield Hardline, which launched at the very end of Q4.","GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.14 billion as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.14 as compared to $1.04 per share in the prior year. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, a 17% decrease compared to last year's $775 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rates, Titanfall, the launch of 2014 FIFA World Cup and UFC, and from Battlefield 4 catalog. The decline is offset by Battlefield Hardline catalog, but we are not planning any HD launches this quarter.","Our revenue phasing for FY 2016 is different to the prior year, with a much larger proportion in the back half due to our launch schedule. The expected phasing of our revenue is in the earnings presentation posted to our website.","Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%. Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $475 million, $16 million higher compared to last year, driven by the extra week in the quarter, offset somewhat by more favorable exchange rates for overseas expenses.","For the quarter, we expect non-GAAP diluted EPS to be zero cents per share as compared to $0.19 per share last year.","Looking further into the future, we remain focused on driving our business model and improving profitability. We will continue to leverage one of the core strengths of our business, the reoccurring revenue generated by our annualized titles, live services, and ongoing mobile business. While not guaranteed, this revenue is highly dependable and accounts for 60% to 70% of the total.","For the next few years, we expect further improvements in gross margin, on the order of 100 basis points a year, through growing our digital business. In addition, we will continue to invest in new and existing IP and in new technology infrastructure to support our growing live services business. In marketing, we will continue to increase personalization and customization and leverage our player network to further improve efficiency and impact. These efforts will help us move operating margins from the mid-20% to the high 20% and continue to grow our earnings and cash flow power.","In conclusion, fiscal 2015 we made considerable progress on our journey. We were able to massively grow earnings and cash generation. And we have built a solid and consistent business with a strong operational foundation that enables us to capitalize on the shift to digital content, the console cycle, and the growth of mobile.","Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Blake.","We are entering a new global age for games, with a growing audience that spends more time playing games across more platforms than ever before. New consoles are being adopted faster than the last generation. Mobile continues its global expansion. New delivery and business models are poised to break through on consoles and PC, and there's huge innovation happening in game experiences across every platform.","Players are at the center of this new era, and our focus is on building long-lasting relationships. As humans, we all need entertainment. For our players, we are delivering the best form of entertainment. Through amazing new games, dynamic and enduring live services, vibrant communities, and meaningful dialogue, we are enabling their passion for inspiration, immersion, competition, social connection, and fun. The passion we have for that opportunity, to lead this new age of gaming built around our global audience of players, is what will drive us in FY 2016 and beyond.","With that, Blake, Peter, Frank, and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Colin Sebastian of Robert Baird. Go ahead, sir, your line is open.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks, good afternoon, congrats to each of you. I guess first off maybe for Blake, with all the progress and the success to date on managing expenses, I can only imagine that there's some pressure to invest more, given all the growth opportunity. Can you talk a little bit about the ability to keep expenses roughly flat, adjusting for the FX impact, and if that's a realistic expectation in future years?","And then secondly, maybe Peter can add some color on the specific impact you're seeing on Ultimate Team on FIFA with the pricing changes and the transfer market resurgence.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So thanks, Colin. The first question on our guidance for OpEx, we're actually saying, as we said in the script, roughly $100 million of investment that we're making. It's flat because of obviously the FX impact on our international based investments. I think we're making substantial investments in new IP, in mobile IP, in our game engine to try to continue to expand cross-buy across multiple products and in our underlying infrastructure. We're continuing to focus on making marketing more efficient and effective by leveraging our digital connection with our consumers, and that will benefit us in our marketing expenses. But I guarantee we'll continue to support our brands in a fairly healthy way. I think we're making the right investments going forward and it will continue to help drive the top line of the business and the effectiveness of our products.","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Colin, it's Peter. Just on Ultimate Team, as Blake said in his commentary, FIFA Ultimate Team expanded 40%, and Madden NFL Ultimate Team more than doubled. So overall Ultimate Team grew 53%, and that's on top of the previous year when it grew 62%. As you know and you're aware when you track it, that we did put some measures in place, outlined by both Andrew and Blake, to look at some of the more nefarious actions that were going on. We continue to monitor that, keep a very close eye on what's going on, trying to balance the economy, keep some of the coin sellers out. But we have great optimism that our growth in Ultimate Team will continue going forward in FY 2016 and beyond.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, thanks very much.","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Colin.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Justin Post of Merrill Lynch. Go ahead, your line is open.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you. Obviously, a lot of anticipation into Star Wars. Can you give us any thoughts on how you've incorporated that into your guidance, how it might affect gross profit? And is there going to be a marketing benefit from that title given all the hype around the movie? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, we certainly hope that we can leverage a lot of the hype. We certainly have done that so far, and we've got a great partner in Disney and Lucasfilm on that. They're very excited for our title as well.","For us, we're thinking about it with two bookends. One bookend is the historical Battlefront, which did roughly 9 million units. The other bookend is our core first-person shooter franchise of Battlefield, which typically does around 15 million units. So I think in our guidance, we've roughly put in there roughly 9 million to 10 million units for the title, with we believe some upside obviously if things goes well. It is Gen-4-only and PC, and so that needs to get factored into people's thinking, but it is a very exciting title.","It will put, as we said in the script, some pressure on gross margin in the quarter. We've been trying to target 100 basis points of gross margin improvement, and this year we're forecasting roughly 50 basis points, and much of that is due to the fact that there's a royalty on that to Disney. And at a level of 10 million units, that's a fairly large pressure on gross. So we're very optimistic and excited about the title. And obviously, the market has been the same way as the feedback we've seen from recently the Disney Celebration, where we showed the title for the first time. We'll obviously show it more at E3. And so everyone will get a chance to start to appreciate the depth and the excitement around it.","Justin Post - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you and congrats on the execution last year.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Ju of Credit Suisse. Go ahead, sir, your line is open.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So, Andrew or Peter, some of your competitors showed off what I thought was a pretty interesting piece of technology, which allows streaming of game content from either the smartphone or the tablet onto the TV. So this obviously creates some interesting opportunities for you as a publisher to take stuff off the console. So is this an area of focus for you right now, or should we expect some of your less graphics-intense titles you're shipping currently with the console releases at some point in the future?","And secondarily, how much data are you collecting from all of your users just broadly? And where do you think you are in terms of using that data to influence your content development? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, I'll take that, two great questions. One as it relates to streaming, streaming is a technology that's still in its infancy, I would say. Certainly, we have a few incubation efforts going on around the company to see how best we can benefit from that. But as you think about our core objective, which is to build more relationships with more players across more platforms around the world, streaming certainly represents an opportunity for us. Lots of work to go there in order to deliver the kinds of experiences we believe our players want to play, but certainly we have efforts going on.","As it relates to data collection, we are collecting \u2013 I heard one stat once that we collect more data on a daily basis than the combined U.S. Library of Congress, which as you can imagine, is a lot of data. At a more core level, what we're starting to understand better about our players is how engagement works, how engagement works where a player engages on more than one platform, how engagement works where a player plays more than one franchise, and the effect of engagement over the long term as it relates to the likelihood that a player will continue and buy the next version of a title provided we can keep them playing over time. So there's a lot in our data right now as it relates to our players. We are using that data: one, to build better games; and, two, deliver more enhanced and extended and engaging experiences over time that keep them playing and entertained for longer.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Merwin of Barclays. Go ahead, your line is open.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you. So just in the context of your guidance for 2016, Blake, I think you talked about 10% growth for the extra content business, and I think a lot of that might have been coming from FIFA Online in China. Can you quantify at all what you're expecting in terms of dollars for FIFA Online in China? Or maybe asked another way, do you think this could be bigger than FIFA Online in Korea?","And then secondly on the Mobile business, I don't know if you can give out a margin for that business. But are you seeing stability in that margin or even improvement as you roll out this more branded IP? I imagine that relative to competitors, you might even have lower sales and marketing costs for mobile given that you are leveraging branded IP that has a built-in audience and I imagine would lower the cost of customer acquisition. Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so let me start on FIFA Online 3 China, and then I'll have Frank address the mobile economics. On FIFA Online 3 China, as we said, we did not recognize any revenue in Q4 for that. We will start recognizing revenue in Q1, this quarter, which will include the revenue that we generated last year for that title. It will roughly be around $40 million this quarter. I think going forward for your models, I'd probably focus on $10 million to $15 million a quarter. And as that business grows, we'll keep you updated.","We're very optimistic about it. Tencent has been very public around their optimism. But we remind people it's taken us three to four years to grow Korea to where it is today, and Korea is a more fluid market than China right now, and so it's probably going to take some time. Also, soccer is much more prevalent in Korea than it is in China, but it's growing fast in China, so we hope to follow that. So, it's a longer story for us, we think, but I think there's a lot of potential and everything is going very well. Frank, on the mobile?","Frank D. Gibeau - Executive Vice President, EA Mobile, Electronic Arts, Inc.","The question on mobile I'll take. When we look at how Electronic Arts is constructing its mobile businesses, a couple of key competitive advantages that we're trying to harness. And the first is we have the broadest and most diverse and powerful portfolio of brands in the business, and that translates into very strong organic acquisition advantages. So pound for pound, people have heard of SimCity, The Sims, the products like FIFA and Madden. And organically they install at very high rates. If you looked at how SimCity did over the break, we were generating tens of millions of installs without really spending any money in paid acquisition.","That's also combined with a really powerful network that we're designing. So it allows us to cross-promote and understand based on telemetry and data what our gamers are doing at any given time and what's the right message at the right time and what are the right games that we can put in front of them that might interest them. So the combination of a profound organic acquisition advantage coming from brand power and a network effect we believe will allow us from a long-term standpoint keep marketing and sales as a percentage of revenue very low, very low certainly relative to other mobile game companies. And as we look to grow the business, we'll continue to harness those advantages.","Chris Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Arvind Bhatia of Sterne Agee CRT. Go ahead, your line is open.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Thank you and I'd like to add my congratulations, guys, a couple of quick ones. Just going back to the FIFA Online 3 China question, we got the revenue guidance. I would assume that most of that revenue comes in at pretty full margin. I'm wondering if you could maybe comment on that.","And then you touched on EA Access. I'm wondering if you can maybe elaborate a little bit more how we should think about the adoption rates right now. What are some of the puts and takes there?","And then lastly, Andrew, I would love to get your views on the overall market, the console market in particular, over the next couple of years. We see your breakdown of the physical versus digital revenue. I'm just wondering how you think about the progression over the next couple of years. Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, Arvind. On FIFA Online 3, we don't disclose obviously the profitability of the individual lines of business. But what you should assume there is Tencent is essentially delivering the product and doing much of the marketing in the local market. We're doing the product development and helping Tencent on any issues around hosting and delivering the product. So we obviously have product development costs. We don't have some of the marketing costs that you'd see in our normal business. So you should assume that it's good profit margins, but that's about as far as I can go on that.","On EA Access, we're extremely pleased with the growth of EA Access. As I said on the call, we haven't really started to promote that with Microsoft. We will this summer. We've now added \u2013 we've got 12 titles in the vault. And that's why we feel like it's a great time to start to promote it because much of the value is around those titles in the vault. The subscriber base continues to grow. It's still not a meaningful part of our financials, and thus we're not calling out the actual numbers or the stats, but we will consider that in the future as we see how it grows. But overall, we're very interested in it and we're learning a great deal from the service around players' interest in subscription models and where they get the most value out of the service. I'll let Andrew catch the last one on consoles.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Overall, we're very happy with the speed at which this console generation has been taken up by players. As we talked about in the prepared notes, it's much faster than the last generation. We would expect close to 50 million consoles by the end of the year, and that's a meaningful install base for us to build games for. And the level of engagement we're seeing on a per-game basis is also very, very high, with people engaging in the live services that we're building around our games for much, much longer than before.","As we think about retail versus full-game downloads, certainly we've seen growth in that area. It varies from geography to platform. But on a Gen-4 game like Battlefield Hardline, in the West we're seeing nearly 20% numbers, and we would expect that growth to continue. We've seen a dramatic increase in PC downloads since 2010. And we believe the same forces that drove this in PC are at play on this latest generation of consoles. And so as bandwidth increases, lower-cost storage increases, we would expect continued growth in this area.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Great.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","We always give this stat on every call. We're up 51% over the same period in Gen-4 versus Gen-3. So 17 months since launch the install base of Gen-4 consoles is now up 51% versus the same period for Gen-3.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Great. Thanks, Peter. Thank you, guys.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Olson of Piper Jaffray. Go ahead, your line is open.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon. Just to follow on regarding the full-game downloads, you mentioned 20% on games like Battlefield. Are you trying to accelerate that as fast as you can because it's better margin, or are there reasons to take it slowly? I guess in other words, are there risks to a rapid transition to full-game downloads, or are you just putting the pedal down on pushing that as fast as you can?","And then secondly, regarding the pipeline, we noticed Titanfall is not in your announced title slate as of now. Does that mean that it won't ship in fiscal 2016, or does that mean that it may or may not ship in the year, but would currently be an unannounced title if it were a fiscal 2016 launch?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So first on full-game downloads, we're essentially allowing the consumer to vote. We would like the consumer to consume games where they want to consume them. And if that's in full-game downloads or if that's in retail, we want to be there. We've got great partners in retail. GameStop, Target, Walmart, Game (45:30), others are very powerful and helpful to us. And so we want to make sure we're delivering the experience in the way the consumers would like it. Obviously, it's better economically for us longer term to do digital, and we're focused on all the digital content, not just full games. And we see that that's the direction the industry is going, but we're not trying to do something unnatural to push it one way or the other.","In terms of Titanfall, you should assume that that's not in fiscal 2016. It's more likely in fiscal 2017. And a title of that size, we want to be pretty clear as to when it's falling in the title slate, and so your assumption should be 2017.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Drew Crum from Stifel. Go ahead, your line is open.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So I just want to go back to FIFA. You guys talked about a lot of the puts and takes that will contribute to results in fiscal 2016. If you take a step back, you're comping against the World Cup last year. What are your expectations for the franchise maybe on a constant currency basis or a headline number?","And then separately as it relates to Star Wars, you mentioned that you're going to be publishing on Gen-4 only. Is that a strategy you intend to employ across other franchises going forward? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, Drew, on FIFA, we expect continued growth in that franchise. Obviously, at the size that franchise is now, the law of large numbers makes big growth numbers difficult. But we've continually year in and year out been able to grow FIFA by improving the quality of the game, by adding extra additional services around the game like Ultimate Team, and driving into continued new geographies around the world.","The popularity of football in America continues to grow, and that's been fueling the growth of the product here in the U.S., even though it's always been very strong internationally, and we think we'll continue to see that. So we're very optimistic about FIFA and we hope to see that continue to see upside growth, and that's what's built into our forecast. Your second question was...","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","As far as Star Wars is concerned...","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks. So we will see a slow movement away from Gen-3. As a reminder, we've been making Gen-2 console games up until the last year or so. For some of our bigger franchises like our sports franchises, we'll continue to make Gen-3. But we're making some decisions on new franchises and titles to focus on Gen-4, partially because the power of the platform allows for exceptional gameplay and incredible graphics. And for something like Star Wars, we wanted to make sure that we provided the highest level of quality for the game experience, and you can do that only on Gen-4 and PC.","Drew E. Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ben Schachter of Macquarie. Go ahead, sir, your line is open.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hi, guys, congratulations again on the execution, a few questions for you. First, some very large companies seem to be focusing more and more on virtual reality. Can you talk a little bit how EA is working in that space? And are there meaningful investments there yet, or is it just still too early?","And then, if you could, also just describe how FIFA is actually monetized in China, and remind us how the revenue recognition works.","And then finally, Blake, I think you said the new $1 billion buyback anticipates returning about 50% of free cash, and then you guided FY 2016 to $1 billion. So does that mean that FY 2017 free cash should be flat with 2016? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Ben, I love how you do your math. I was not implying at all that 2017 free cash flow was going to be down. I was simply trying to help people understand how we're thinking about return of capital. The goal would be if we were to continue to be able to increase cash flow over time, we would continue to increase our buybacks over time, and we're thinking about that as a two-year program. As you can see, we started a two-year program a year ago, and we replaced that with a new two-year program this year. I'm not predicting what that's going to be for the future, but think about it more like a progression over time versus any guidance around fiscal 2017.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Got it.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'm very optimistic about 2016 and 2017. So that's that piece.","FIFA Online 3 is a free-to-play PC game, which means much like in Ultimate Team, you monetize based on collecting and trading players and playing with those players. You don't have to monetize. You can play the game for free. But like all free-to-play games, to build a better team, to get further ahead in the game, to win against your friends, you will possibly monetize to build that team. The revenue recognition issue was simply a one-time issue for us, and that was we were waiting for the formal rollout of the game in China with our partner Tencent. And that occurred in early April and thus the ability to start to recognize revenue. We did not want to recognize revenue until the game was fully functional, fully rolled out, moved from soft beta to hard beta to full rollout, and it had all the features available for gameplay, and that's why we now start to recognize. But we shouldn't have a recognition issue going forward on that.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Sorry, I meant recognition. If a player spends a dollar in China, are you booking only the piece that you're getting from Tencent, or are you booking the full dollar?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yes, good question. Yes, we are. Much like we do with mobile, we only book net.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","On virtual reality, again, I would say that this is a technology that has the potential to profoundly impact our industry over time. I think the notion of immersion as a key motivation that our players are looking to fulfill when they play our games is something that could certainly be well fulfilled through the notion of virtual reality technology. As a company with creative innovation as one of its core pillars, it's very important that we stay ahead of this. And as a result, we have some clear and focused investments in the space. As you will know if you follow this, there are a number of different potential providers and manifestations of virtual reality right now that go everywhere from wearing a pair of goggles to a holographic type experience, or to a room overall that you step into. We are looking at any and all of these things and have a few incubation efforts going on around the company so that as this begins to manifest itself, we are, as a creative and innovative company, able to lead from the front.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Hickey of The Benchmark Company. Go ahead, sir, your line is open.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hey, guys, congrats on a great quarter and year. Enjoy it, you guys have definitely deserved it here.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thanks.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","A couple questions. I was curious on your capital allocation strategy as it relates to share repurchases and intensifying your effort there when your company's valuation is near an all-time high versus potentially accretive M&A opportunities, particularly as you begin to increase investment in new IP, as you outlined today. And then I have a follow-up.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, so we look at a couple of components when we think about return of capital to shareholders. We first and foremost believe that that's a critical goal of the company is to continue to return capital to shareholders. We balance that with two things: one, our need for capital internally; and two, our onshore versus offshore balance of capital. Right now we have about 60% of our capital onshore. Our need for capital in terms of CapEx is roughly $100 million a year, as we've talked to. We have, obviously, our outstanding convert that we will either refinance or pay off over time. That's due next summer. And we believe even after that, we have plenty of capital to respond to any opportunities that come our way either on acquisitions or internal investment. We've got substantial debt capacity based on our performance and substantial onshore cash to be able to address \u2013 or offshore cash for international acquisitions to be able to address anything that comes along.","But we're really focused on driving the business out of our existing IP or licensed IP. We see a huge future for the company with what we have today. And we feel like we want to make sure we're focused on that first and foremost before we run and chase other acquisitions. Doesn't mean we wouldn't do something, but we're very focused on the opportunities that we have today.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","All right, fair enough, Blake. Thank you. Last question, you had a few game delays last year, and obviously that happens. And ultimately, you seem to have crafted an advantage from the delay by providing a higher quality product. But curious on Star Wars, how confident you feel today on the development of this game and the anticipated quality as pacing within that desired launch window, seeing that the timing of this drop is perhaps more important given the launch of the movie in December and, as you noted, related marketing benefits hopefully from that. I'm also curious if you plan to have a beta or early release within your EA Access program. Thanks, guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'll let Andrew touch on the Star Wars question.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So again, as someone who grew up making games in this company, making games is hard, building fun is hard, and getting that right on a day is even harder. And what you saw over the past year was our commitment to players in building great properties and the willingness to make hard decisions around that.","With that said, there are any number of things that might contribute to a miss or a need to move a date. As it relates to Star Wars Battlefront, I would say as it stands right now, we feel very, very good about the trajectory and the velocity of the development team. They're building on platforms now that have been in the marketplace for a number of years. They're building on the core engine that has launched a number of products, including Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline, Dragon Age: Inquisition, all of which have been great properties. And they're a tried and tested development team who have a very, very clear focus and understanding of the type of game they're making.","The game is fully playable. We released a gameplay trailer a couple of weeks ago at Celebration, but some of the inside community also got to see a fairly lengthy full gameplay demo, which is very, very exciting. We look forward to showing more of that at E3. But as it stands right now, we feel good about the trajectory and the velocity and our ability to ship that game at the appropriate time this year.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Thanks, guys, best of luck.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sean McGowan of Needham. Go ahead, sir, your line is open.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","Thank you. I just wanted to circle back on a couple of things mentioned before for clarification. When you were talking about the estimated unit sales of Star Wars, I think you said 9 million to 10 million. Are you talking about in the fiscal year or over the life of the product?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","In the fiscal year of our guidance.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","Thanks. And I don't know if this would be for Peter or Andrew or Blake, anybody. You said you count a bundle as a physical sale and you're still getting 20% full-game downloads. What would that number look like if you counted that as a digital sale?","Peter Robert Moore - Chief Operating Officer & Executive Vice President","Sean, it's Peter. That varies from quarter to quarter, year to year depending on the bundles. But I want to make it very clear that whether it's a code or a physical disk that goes into a bundle that is primarily put together by our first-party platform partners, that is physical media to us and that's how it's accounted for. Our full-game downloads that you're seeing, they do vary from title and by geography. But the latest data we've got shows us at a 20%-plus for Battlefield Hardline, and that's up from about 13% to 15% this time last year for our AAA title releases. So we're seeing the growth. And as Andrew said, if we stay on a path that's analogous to PC, that will continue to grow over the coming fiscal years.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay, thanks. And then my last question was on the any variability around the June quarter. Considering that there are no major launches, it seems like this might be a quarter where there's not a lot of variance off of the guidance. Is that a fair way to look at it?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","I'll let you guys look at history and decide that.","Sean P. McGowan - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay, got to try. Thanks","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We try our best, guys, to give the best guidance as we can at the moment that we're giving it, so one last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Brian Pitz of Jefferies. Go ahead, sir. Your line is open.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for the question, just a quick Star Wars follow-on. Just curious how DICE is really prepping to ensure the smooth launch of Battlefront, including not only gameplay but also things like connectivity and even various types of IP protection that might be in the works. Basically, are there any out of the ordinary aspects to the game that could cause an unforeseen delay? I know someone else was asking about a delayed timeframe. Just any additional color on out of the ordinary stuff would be great. Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think there's anything out of the ordinary, I think we treat every game launch with security, stability, and scalability of paramount importance. Certainly as we talked about in the prepared comments, we learned a lot coming out of Battlefield 4. We've launched a number of very, very large-scale titles on our infrastructure since then and have performed very, very well by market standards. Dragon Age: Inquisition launched. Battlefield Hardline launched, so we've been making significant investment into our core infrastructure around security, stability, and scalability. Game teams have been making significant investments in terms of development process and QA around that. So while we can never foresee everything, we have demonstrated now that we've learned from some of the things that we've gone through over the past. And we don't expect anything unforeseen or different with respect to Star Wars than we have around our other giant titles.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","And the reason I ask is just going back to Spore with the DRM limitations back in the past that backfired. With a bigger IP title like this, that's the only reason I'm asking.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, it's a good question, but we don't see anything at this time.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Great, thank you, everyone.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations","Thanks, everyone.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference.

In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. After the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call, and a transcript.","A couple of quick notes on our calendar.

Coming up next week, on Tuesday, May 17, is our Investor Day.

Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results. We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year, unless otherwise stated.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Chris.","FY 2016 was a phenomenal year for Electronic Arts. Our non-GAAP revenue, earnings and cash flow for the year were all at record levels and exceeded our guidance. It was a year of growth and milestones, demonstrating our unique ability to connect hundreds of millions of players across genres, geographies, and platforms to the games they love and to each other.","To highlight a few examples, we kicked off a new generation of Star Wars games from Electronic Arts with extraordinarily successful games on console, PC, and mobile. Nearly 54 million unique players engaged in our EA SPORTS console titles during the year, up 65% from last year.","Across our portfolio of live services, we launched hundreds of content updates throughout the year, bringing players deeper into their favorite games. Our Sims 4 player base grew by almost two-thirds throughout the year, and our Battlefield franchise saw 9.4 million unique players in Q4 alone.","In addition, players are spending more time with our new games and ongoing franchises on mobile. Engagement in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes is exceptional, with players spending nearly two hours per day on average in the game during Q4. Madden NFL Mobile continues its strong performance, with engagement up more than 30% in Q4 over last year, and The Sims FreePlay has now reached 200 million installs life to date.","With all of our games and live services, our focus continues to be on putting players first and delivering unmatched creativity, depth, and value. Engagement is critical in today's world, where everyone faces such intense competition for time. Combining great franchises, innovative IP, and sophisticated services, we continue to build networked global communities for our games, where players can connect to more great content and to their friends, maximizing the fun every time they play.","As we move into FY 2017, we're incredibly excited to launch a slate of groundbreaking new games and add to the breadth of live services available to our players.","Our first new game this fiscal year will be Mirror's Edge Catalyst, launching on June 7, with fluid movement and combat rendered in stunning beauty by our Frostbite engine.","The first of our EA SPORTS titles for this year, Madden NFL 17, NHL 17, and FIFA 17, arrive in Q2, each taking a major leap forward in personalization, immersion, and competition. We are also working on a new and engaging way to bring players into our NBA LIVE franchise on consoles, and we'll share more on that in the quarters ahead.","In a global livestream last Friday that was watched by more than 2 million people, Battlefield 1 made its debut. Fans got their first look into the intense, visceral combat and epic scale of this groundbreaking new game from DICE, and the response was immediate and extraordinary. The trailer was viewed more than 21 million times in the first four days, a new record for EA, and it's now our most-liked trailer in history. With Battlefield 1, we've set out to deliver the biggest and most innovative Battlefield game ever, with a deep story and unprecedented variety in the gameplay powered by our Frostbite engine. Battlefield 1 is set to launch worldwide on October 21.","In partnership with the talented team at Respawn Entertainment, Titanfall 2 will launch in Q3. The first Titanfall delivered a fast, fluid experience that invigorated players and ignited the genre. Titanfall 2 will come to players on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. The excitement from fans since our official announcement of the game has been outstanding, and we can't wait to debut the first gameplay from Titanfall 2 at EA Play on June 12.","Late in the fourth quarter, Mass Effect: Andromeda will bring an all-new story to the critically-acclaimed RPG series from BioWare. And throughout the year, mobile players will see launches from some of our biggest brands. Building on the continued success of Madden NFL Mobile, we're excited to bring new EA SPORTS experiences from our NBA LIVE and FIFA franchises to players in FY 2017. Fans of our PopCap franchises will have new experiences as well, with Bejeweled Stars launching today and Plants vs. Zombies Heroes set to arrive later this year.","Our excitement for the year extends well beyond our title slate. The gaming industry continues to rapidly evolve and grow, and in each dimension EA is at the leading edge. In addition to being the number one publisher in the western world on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in FY 2016 and the most downloaded mobile game publisher in calendar year 2015, we are investing deeply to pioneer new growth opportunities.","Our competitive gaming programs will seek to engage players at all skill levels, with competitions like the Madden NFL 16 Championship being just the tip of the iceberg. Our unparalleled Frostbite engine will power more of our games this year, including an all-new Star Wars Battlefront experience for PlayStation VR.","In addition to delivering strong and stable service architectures, our technology platform teams continue to implement a cross-platform, cross-title identity system to help our players stay connected to their games and their friends. Across our studio teams, partners like Respawn Entertainment, and labs groups, we are working on more new ideas, technologies, and IP. And this June in Los Angeles and London, EA Play will bring players closer than ever to our games and help them share those experiences with the world.","FY 2016 was the strongest year in the history of Electronic Arts, and we are just getting started. Looking to FY 2017 and beyond, we are confident that our trajectory is even stronger.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Blake for a deeper look at our financials.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Andrew. The end of the year is a good point at which to reflect on the progress we've made, and it has been a great year.","Using non-GAAP metrics, fiscal 2016 revenue at $4.57 billion was an all-time record. Our operating margin, at just 9.5% four years ago, was 28.5% this year, its highest ever. Gross margin at 71.4% and earnings at over $1 billion were also all-time records, as was operating cash flow at $1.2 billion. We were able to deliver these results despite significant FX headwinds, which impacted our top line by over $300 million.","Digital revenue is now 55% of our business, up from 52% last year. Extra content was a record $1.1 billion. Within that, our Ultimate Team business reached $692 million, up 18% at actual FX, and up 26% at constant currency. Our mobile business delivered another record year at $570 million in revenue.","During the year, we returned over $1 billion to shareholders through repurchasing stock, again, a record.","Moving to the specifics of the fourth quarter results, EA's non-GAAP net revenue was $924 million, which was $49 million above our guidance and $28 million above last year. The quarter's outperformance was driven by digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile live services. Ultimate Team continues to thrive, as do our mobile titles, led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile.","EA's Q4 non-GAAP digital net revenue was $712 million. This resulted in a full-year digital revenue of more than $2.5 billion. Breaking down Q4's digital revenue into its key components highlights the performance of these businesses.","First, extra content and PC free-to-play contributed $310 million, up 26% over the prior year. The key driver was FIFA Ultimate Team, which grew 38% in the face of significant FX headwinds. At constant currency, our FIFA Ultimate Team business would have been up 48% year-on-year.","Second, our mobile business generated $173 million for the quarter, up 15% over prior year. Growth was led by Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and Madden NFL Mobile. The strength of these mobile live services adds to the broad portfolio of EA Mobile games which deliver a consistent and profitable revenue stream.","Third, full game downloads added $134 million to the quarter, up 18% year-on-year. And finally, subscriptions, advertising, and other digital revenue totaled $95 million, up $4 million over the same period last year.","Moving on to gross margin, our non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter was 76.9%, 90 basis points above our guidance due to the strength of digital, particularly Ultimate Team and our mobile business. It was up from 75.4% in Q4 fiscal 2015.","Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter were $499 million, down $14 million from last year, and $1 million lower than our guidance. The resulting non-GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter was $0.50 per share, $0.10 above our guidance and $0.11 above the prior year.","One note as you review our GAAP operating expenses relative to our guidance. GAAP earnings for fiscal 2016 includes a material income tax credit due to the reversal of the valuation allowance we had against our U.S. deferred tax assets. This credit of $453 million increased our diluted GAAP EPS for fiscal 2016 by $1.37 per share to a total of $3.50, but it had no effect on non-GAAP earnings or on cash flow.","Net cash provided by operating activities for the quarter was $396 million, compared to $198 million in the prior year, primarily due to Star Wars Battlefront. Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year hit its highest level in company history at $1.22 billion, a 15% increase over last year's cash flow of $1.07 billion, and above our raised guidance. We continue to grow cash flow due to the underlying strength of the business and the greater profitability unlocked by our digital transformation. Fiscal 2016 capital expenditures were $93 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.13 billion.","During the quarter, we raised $1 billion in the form of five-year and 10-year investment-grade senior notes. In connection with this, we also announced a $500 million stock repurchase program, over and above the two-year, $1 billion program we already have in place. We completed this new program in the quarter, and continued our steady progress on the ongoing program, resulting in a total repurchase this quarter of 9.9 million shares of common stock at an average price of $63.70 per share. This leaves $539 million from the two-year program available for repurchases.","For the fiscal year, we've returned over $1 billion to shareholders through the repurchase of 15.7 million shares, approximately 5% of shares outstanding. As a result, we estimate that our fiscal non-GAAP diluted share count will be 319 million shares.","During Q4, we settled $177 million in early conversions of our convertible notes. Through March 31, we've redeemed $470 million of the $633 million total and as of yesterday, we've received notices for an additional $27 million to settle in Q1. Dilution from these redemptions, the warrants, and future redemptions are already accounted for in our non-GAAP diluted share count.","Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $3.83 billion, or $12.74 per share. Approximately 47% of this was held in the U.S.","Now, on to fiscal 2017 guidance. With regards to the market, we expect sales of current-generation consoles to continue at a rapid pace, with another 25 million units to be sold this calendar year, adding to the 55 million units in place at the end of calendar 2015. In addition to the console growth, we expect our mobile franchises to benefit from the continued expansion of iOS and Android, and we're continuing to see strength in PC gaming.","We expect non-GAAP revenue to increase approximately 7% to $4.9 billion. The anticipated strength is broad-based, primarily driven by the launches of Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2 and Mass Effect: Andromeda. Other important drivers include the continued growth of our core sports titles and associated live services, and the expansion of our mobile business.","The expected phasing of our revenue is disclosed in the earnings presentation posted to our website.","The non-GAAP gross margin is expected to rise 110 basis points, to 72.5%, driven by the increase in digital revenue and improved product mix. The margin benefits from the wholly-owned IP of Battlefield 1 and Mass Effect: Andromeda are partially offset by the royalty fee associated with Titanfall 2.","We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $2.1 billion, up almost $140 million from fiscal 2016. The increase is driven by R&D investments in new franchises, particularly in the action genre; an extension of our partnership with Respawn; our digital player platform; competitive gaming; and new mobile games. These are offset somewhat by FX.","This would deliver an operating margin of 29.7% and non-GAAP EPS of $3.50, up 11% year-on-year. This includes the addition of $41 million in new interest expense on our recent debt offering, but is partially offset by a reduction in our non-GAAP tax rate from 22% to 21% and the reduction in our share count to 319 million shares.","The change in tax rate is due to the continued growth of our business outside of the United States and the interest on our debt. The change in share count was driven by the additional $500 million repurchased in the quarter. And, with regards to forecasted share count, note that our standard practice is to include an estimate of dilution for our employee equity programs, but not to factor in any potential reduction from our on-going buyback program.","The earnings presentation in our investor website contains more information about our exchange rate assumptions for the year.","Segmenting the sales provides further insights to the key drivers of our full-year non-GAAP revenue guidance. Packaged goods and other revenue is forecasted to be approximately $2 billion, down slightly, driven by the continued shift to digital delivery and offset by growth in sales. Digital revenue is forecasted to be $2.9 billion, up 15%.","Breaking down our digital revenue into its four primary categories we see the contributions from each group. Our mobile business is expected to grow approximately 15% as we add new titles to our diverse and successful bases of live services. As part of this, we'll leverage the learnings from the success of Madden NFL Mobile to our other sports titles.","Revenue from full game downloads is anticipated to grow 25%. We saw a strong growth in digital downloads in fiscal 2016. For example, downloads of Madden for all consoles are up 50% year-on-year, and we expect this trend to continue.","Extra content and free-to-download is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by premium offerings for Star Wars Battlefront and by the Ultimate Team. Battlefront extra content started to contribute in Q4, and we're expecting an attach rate for Season Pass of around 10%.","Lastly, subscription revenue is expected to grow approximately 10% this year, driven by growth in Origin Access and EA Access, and partially offset by the falloff of Battlefield 4 Premium revenue.","On a GAAP basis, guidance is for net revenue of $4.75 billion, gross margin of 71%, and operating expenses of around $2.31 billion, and EPS of $2.53.","Finally, cash flow will continue to be a key metric for us going forward. In fiscal 2017, we're forecasting operating cash flow of approximately $1.3 billion, and capital expenses of approximately $110 million, resulting in free cash flow of approximately $1.2 billion, up from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016. The anticipated increase in CapEx is primarily due to upgrades to our platform infrastructure and facilities.","Focusing now on Q1. Non-GAAP revenue for the quarter is expected to be $640 million, an 8% decrease compared to last year's $693 million. The year-ago quarter benefited from more favorable exchange rates, Battlefield Hardline catalog, a one-off recognition of revenue from FIFA Online 3 in China and the fact that it was a 14-week quarter versus 13 weeks this year. Non-GAAP gross margin is forecasted to be approximately 74.5%.","Non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be $485 million, $13 million higher than last year, driven by investments in future products, offset by the fact that it's a shorter quarter and by a stronger dollar.","For the quarter, we expect a non-GAAP loss of $0.05 per share, as compared to earnings of $0.15 per diluted share last year. GAAP revenue is expected to be $1.25 billion, as compared to $1.2 billion in the prior year. And GAAP diluted EPS is expected to be $1.30, as compared to $1.32 per share in the prior year.","As we look forward to Q2, please note that FIFA 16 launched two weeks ahead of the end of Q2 fiscal 2016, rather than the usual one week. The extra week enabled us to capture an extra week of FIFA sales. This was primarily high-margin Ultimate Team and digital revenue, and boosted the quarter by approximately $75 million. This year, we'll see a return to a more typical pattern, with a much greater concentration of operating income in Q3 and Q4.","In conclusion, it was a great year for EA, with financial and engagement records set across the board. Looking forward, we're embracing digital to continue to drive the business. We expect these trends along with growing sales of our existing titles and new franchises under development to continue to drive strong revenue, EPS, and cash flow growth into the future.","Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Blake.","Our industry continues to grow. Across the world, more players are engaging in more games on more platforms across more geographies and business models. Yet as our audience expands, it is evolving as well. The competition for time means there is no room for transient experiences. Players today expect more from the games they play, and in return they will spend more time with the games they love. In a world where discovery is increasingly difficult and engagement decisions are made every second, connecting players with the right experience when and where they want to play is critical.","In this transforming world, our focus continues to be on meeting and exceeding our players' needs through direct relationships that add value at every turn. Today, Electronic Arts engages hundreds of millions of players, and in the future potentially billons, through great games and live services in our powerful brands like Battlefield, FIFA, Star Wars, The Sims, Plants vs. Zombies, Mass Effect, and more. This portfolio of IP combined with great talent and robust technology in our underlying platform differentiates EA in our ability to connect players to more games, to more friends, and more ways to engage in a global network of play.","It always begins with great games, and in FY 2017 we will deliver some of the most creative, engaging, and biggest experiences to date from Electronic Arts. We also continue to foster and grow thriving communities across our portfolio of live services. Our teams are leveraging technologies like Frostbite to deliver new experiences across more devices. As we evolve our core platform, we are learning more about our players and adding capabilities to unlock greater value for them.","New programs, including competitive gaming, will help us reach and connect more players around the world. These are the dimensions of connected play that today's players seek and that Electronic Arts is positioned to lead.","These are foundational times for the future of games and how we play them. We're excited for FY 2017 and beyond and look forward to sharing more with you in the quarters ahead.","With that, Blake and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from the line of Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you for taking my question, two questions. Can you talk about your investment this year and your guidance for the action adventure titles, and could we see something as soon as fiscal 2018 on that front? And then a large competitor, maybe this is for Andrew, has talked a lot about eSports. And how do you see that opportunity for your first-person shooters and also your big sports titles? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Justin, thanks for the question. Why don't I start with the investment piece? We're making broad investments that fuel the growth of the company well beyond fiscal 2018 and 2019. Really today we're building an action genre product that's probably in our fiscal 2020 or 2021, as well as action-oriented games around the Star Wars genre. Most of what we're investing in that's incremental now probably comes in fiscal 2019 and 2020. But clearly, some of our investment is to grow out our product base for what we're going on as well.","We do have a new IP coming next year. We haven't yet announced it, but it's something that you'll see probably coming up soon. And clearly that's part of our investment for the franchise, as well as continuing building out the Battlefront franchise with Star Wars for fiscal 2018 as well.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","As it relates to competitive gaming, Peter Moore, our Head of our Competitive Gaming Group, is going to deliver a lot more in terms of understanding at our upcoming Investor Day. The group overall is focused on enabling global communities through great games. So this absolutely includes the elite division, but we also believe there is an opportunity to celebrate the talent and skill at every level of game play. So for some, that will mean elite play. For others, that will just mean the joy of competition with friends, and we believe there is going to be a robust community and resulting engagement that we can build as a result of that.","Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from Chris Merwin with Barclays.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","All right, great. Thank you. I just had a couple questions. So first of all, on extra content, that reaccelerated really nicely in the fiscal fourth quarter. So I was wondering if you could provide a bit more color about what drove the improvement there. I think you called out mid-20% in constant currency growth for Ultimate Team, but I was also curious what lift you got from the Star Wars DLC as well.","And then just a second question on non-GAAP gross margins. I think you got about 100 basis points of margin expansion year on year, which is consistent with the long-term guidance, but I just was curious what that assumed for digital downloads as a percentage of total for the year and how the download patterns for Battlefield One might differ from Star Wars Battlefront. Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So extra content obviously was dominated by Ultimate Team, but also FIFA Online 3 in Asia continues to grow, which falls in that. We saw continued growth of our original Star Wars product, Star Wars: The Old Republic, as well as extra content associated with The Sims, with Battlefield 4, and obviously the start of the Battlefront extra content. The bulk of that, though, is on components I just mentioned that really drove outsized performance in the quarter for extra content.","In terms of guidance going forward, assumptions around full game downloads, we assume that we're continually going to see growth that we saw like in the past year. Industry now is above 30%, I think it's reaching 32%. And we're fairly consistent with that, with some titles as we mentioned in the script that are well north of that. Gen 4 Madden, for example, was well north of 50% when you look at a full-year number. So you're starting to see dramatic movements there. We should see greater improvement next year because we won't have the skewing towards physical that we saw in the Battlefront gift giving that we saw around the holiday and we mentioned in our last quarter. And that forecast has driven what we're seeing in our uptick, about 110% in gross margin growth year over year.","Christopher David Merwin - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question is from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks. So, Andrew, I'm looking at the proposed release slate for 2017. I think you have Titanfall launching alongside Battlefield and NBA launching during the basketball season? So obviously this brings up concerns around cannibalization and mistiming, so I'm wondering if you can offer some additional perspective there.","And also what do you think the underlying factors were that drove success for Madden Mobile and Galaxy of Heroes, and how much of this can be replicated in your other mobile sports or action releases? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So in terms of the Titanfall, Battlefield One question, this is a giant category in our industry, $4.5 billion category. There is a very broad and diverse set of players who play games in that category who are looking for \u2013 to fulfill different game play motivations.","Some people play very quick play, some people more strategic play, and some people want both in different context. The result of those, we feel like we actually have a really strong position to deliver the broadest set of game play mechanics as it relates to first-person shooter genre across the two titles, and feel very confident that we are well-positioned to do very well in that category in a year. Certainly as you see, the reception around Battlefield 1 we feel very good about that. The energy around Titanfall 2 is also building very nicely, and we look forward to showing more of both of those titles at EA Play in June.","As it relates to Madden Mobile and Galaxy of Heroes, there is really a couple of things that we believe we are in a place to better understand now. One is how to best manifest sports IP or in fact large-scale IP like Star Wars in the mobile space, and what that means in terms of screen size, session time, UI, and just general game play mechanics, but perhaps the bigger opportunity that we feel like we are capturing now is the opportunity for live service. These are not far and forget games. The teams launch what is a spectacular game and then work diligently with the community to make that game bigger, better, more dynamic and more diverse on every given day, and we believe we have an opportunity across our sports games, certainly, but also across some of our other very well-known and well-recognized IP in the industry.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Stephen, I think a good analogy is the successful formula that drives Ultimate Team is continual events and activities. Team of the Week example would be a great example. We're using that same approach in many of our mobile games to drive that same type of engagement where people are continually coming back because we're making the game exciting, fresh, new, and competitive. And that's exactly what people want to get out of an experience that they've invested time in. And it's a great formula. And we certainly, as we mentioned on the call, hope to be able to leverage that in our other sports games as well as non-sports games.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks and congratulations on another good quarter. I have a couple of questions. First one to ask, follow-up on Battlefield 1 and the selection of World War I as the background setting. On one hand, this sounds quite intriguing and we know that the World War II genres in the past did quite well. So notwithstanding that, the initial reception sounds very positive here. I wonder what your consumer testing says about the appeal of this historical event in a genre that's been dominated by futuristic backdrops, and then I have one follow-up.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think it's a great question and certainly one that we've been asked a number of times. When the teams set out to deliver the next version of Battlefield, they wanted to do a lot of things with the game. They wanted to be the biggest Battlefield game. They wanted to be the most diverse Battlefield game. They wanted fundamentally new game play mechanics with evolution of story, interwoven characters, storylines, evolution of machinery, evolution of weaponry, a real opportunity to build and grow inside of a Battlefield universe.","When I took a step back and asked themselves what was the best place to set a game that had that kind of ambition, World War I was really the only place to do it. And what very few people remember from their history classes, I guess, is that people rode into World War I on horses and came out on planes and tanks and submarines. And we think that level of innovation and evolution of battle in a short period of time gives us a tremendous opportunity to deliver a very epic and full-scaled experience and I think what we've shown so far is a small taste of that and we look forward to spending time and giving people even more information and a deeper look at that as we come into EA Play in June.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks, Andrew. And looking ahead in terms of the Star Wars franchise, I wonder if you could update on the progress and the potential timing of the titles from Motive and Respawn and how they fit into the release cadence for that license over the next few years. Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We'll most likely have at least one Star Wars title a year over the next three years to four years. Next year we will see Star Wars Battlefront back with bigger and better worlds, because we now have the new movies to work off of, not just the historical movies that we used before. We also are working on a Star Wars action game that part of the Motive team is working on as well as the Visceral team. And that's most likely the following year.","And as we've announced, we're working with our partners, Respawn, to work on another Star Wars game. They're very excited about that. They were asking us to include them in the franchise, and we felt that they could add a huge amount to a new title there. So the cadence should be at least every year along with the cadence of the large and small movies that Disney is doing, or side movies that Disney is doing, relative to Star Wars. And then obviously we'll continue to layer in mobile titles where possible as well to try to have a diverse Star Wars activity from shooters all the way through action and strategy, but at the same time taking advantage of all the new great IP that's being developed by our partners at Disney.","Colin A. Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thanks, Blake.","Operator","And your next question is from Brian Pitz with Jefferies.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Thanks so much. One more on Battlefield. It's getting very positive reception on YouTube and other online forums so far to date. We don't actually recall such strong early interest in the franchise. Are there other internal metrics that you would provide to give us confidence that this game is truly tracking ahead of the previous versions? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And, again, we have been delighted with the reception. It's our most liked trailer to date. And depending on what metrics you look at from YouTube, it may be the most liked trailer ever on YouTube. We see that as a real positive sign for the franchise. The community has been asking for innovation, the community has been asking for something different. And our DICE team did step out and build something truly epic and respond to the community's demands. And their feedback has been resoundingly positive.","As it relates to how the game is tracking, the game is doing really, really well. We recently had key franchise reviews where more of the game is playable at this stage than has ever been in the case in Battlefield before. The Frostbite engine is robust in its foundation and this is a very tried and true team who build unbelievable experiences. And so we have deep confidence in them to execute against their ambition. And we look forward to demonstrating more of that at EA Play in June.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And like most of our large titles, you'll tend to see more and more during this summer, at Gamescom late in the summertime. Most likely some further game play either in the form of a beta or something to that extent. So you'll have plenty of ways to better understand the depth of the product and excitement around the product as the next few months come by. And we'll try to keep you informed in our next earnings call on how we see the demand developing for the product.","Brian J. Pitz - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Your next question is from Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Thank you. Great quarter, guys. I was wondering if you could talk about Titanfall 2 a little bit and how we should think about the title relative to its predecessor in terms of units perhaps. Obviously the previous one was very successful, but it had some unique circumstances. It wasn't on all-platforms, but I know it had a high attach rate as being one of the key early titles. So if you could just put that in perspective. Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Clearly, we're very excited about it. We've seen it a couple of times over the last few months, and it's well along the way. And it has evolved substantially from the first Titanfall. First Titanfall was fantastic. This has added a whole new level to the game and the experience. It will be on both platforms, which obviously means, a bigger audience for Titanfall, particularly with the Sony platform is the one that hasn't experienced it. So they'll get a chance to experience the game. But at the same time, obviously the attach won't be anywhere near as high as it was, because it was one of the first AAA titles for the new Xbox One. And so obviously a lower attach. We think you're going to see numbers clearly larger than our Titanfall 1 franchise. And we've got good expectations for it, but we've tried to be prudent in how we forecast that in our guidance.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee CRT","Great. Thank you, guys. Good luck.","Operator","Your next question is from Michael Olson with Piper Jaffray.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Hey, good afternoon. I had a couple questions if I could. First you might dive into this at the Analyst Day but in addition to continued mix shift towards full game downloads and digital add-on content, how do you think about the evolution of revenue mix over the next few years related to subscription, free-to-play, et cetera? I guess should we anticipate much of a change or will it be kind of primarily a continuation of growth in full game downloads and add-on content that we're seeing today?","And then second, regarding past comments that you've made on revenue growth consistency, how disciplined do you plan to be on keeping revenue growth in the single digits? In other words, if it appears that it could be tracking towards double digits part way through the year, would you push titles into fiscal 2018 in order to manage the growth rate? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So on the first piece, I think we will continue to see subscriptions grow, particularly with EA Access and the strength of that product. And obviously based on the strength of that, we rolled out Origin Access, which is our Origin-based PC-based gaming with a similar structure as EA Access. We'll continue to push that. We think subscriptions are an important part of the future of this business, and you'll see that continue to grow.","In the past, remember, we've had some accounting differences between products where something that looks like DLC might have been booked as a subscription because it was a series of DLCs over time, and that's what's made the subscription number go up and down over time. You'll continue to probably see some of that as we have different accounting methods. But I think the combination of extra content and subscriptions should continue to be a larger and larger portion of our business over time. I think that's an important piece of the mix.","I think also as you look at the business, you'll see greater mobile concentration of growth, and the combination of mobile plus extra content and subscriptions is now starting to create a very nice foundation for the business. With that plus full-game downloads, we mentioned worth $2.5 billion, that's a wonderful foundation to make the revenue much smoother over time.","On the revenue growth, let me be clear. It's not our aspirations to have single-digit revenue growth. It's our focus to try to maintain discipline on the operating model in the company. We don't want to over-invest and not deliver the revenue. That was the problem we had historically. So we talk about single-digit revenue growth simply because that's how we think about our investments, but we're trying to drive higher revenue growth if possible. And we'll do that on a case-by-case basis and decide if we can push the revenue harder or not. And sometimes products get moved based on when those products re ready or timing in the marketplace. But our goal is to try to drive both revenue, top line growth, and drive earnings growth. And if we can get both of those in double digits, that would be fantastic. We've been lucky enough to drive double-digit bottom line growth, and we'll continue to see that over the next few years, we believe.","Mike J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel Nicolaus.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks. Good afternoon, everyone. So the guidance for OpEx this year is $2.1 billion. You ran through the details behind that. Is that a new normal or the run rate we should expect beyond fiscal 2017?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","It's probably in that zone. It could be plus or minus $25 million or $30 million. I remind people there are a couple components to that. One is our marketing and sales. We've tried to target that number between 12% and 13% of revenue. So obviously in a bigger revenue year like this year, we're going to spend more on marketing and sales to support things like Battlefield and Titanfall. So that's going to see a flux up and down based on the revenue component.","Our R&D expenses we've tried to target around 21% to 22% of revenue, and we're tracking around that level now. And we feel like there's a huge opportunity for us to continue to invest in new areas of the business like the action genre where we haven't competed historically. It's a very ripe opportunity for us. And we've been able to bring great talent in to try to build out that part of the business.","Our mobile areas with new studios coming on has also been important for us, and we'll continue to invest there. And then last but not least, continuing to build out the platform in which we operate all our games on and we're trying to leverage through that network will continue to be a key part of our investment. So you'll probably see that rough level as a percentage of sales be the focus going forward, which is a combination of the R&D level around 21% to 22%, marketing in the 12% to 13%, and G&A in the 7% to 8% range.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Got it. Okay, and then one question for Andrew perhaps. Some of your competitors have talked about plans or initiatives around advertising in their mobile titles. Is that something that's contemplated in your 2017 guidance? And then can you talk about any targeted advertising you're doing or would like to do in some of your sports titles going forward? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's again a great question. Advertising is certainly an important part of our business, both now and going forward. We have had ads in both our console games and our mobile games for some years, and that business has continued to grow. We often walk the fine line between maintaining the integrity of the entertainment experience with the provision of advertising inside those experiences. Right now, we have ad technology that we are implementing in some of our key mobile titles that is very targeted in nature and we believe is additive to the overall experience in the long term, and players have been responding positively to that. So there is some advertising in our FY 2017 number. I would expect that as our network continues to grow beyond the hundreds of millions that we have today that it will become a more meaningful part of our business in the future.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","One thing to remember there, particularly for us, is that there's both the ability to sell advertising but maybe equally or more important is the ability to cross-promote to players to keep them in your network. And as we have a broader and broader portfolio of games, particularly in mobile, that cross-promotion advertising is very valuable to us. Holding on to a player in your network is very powerful, and so you'll see that type of advertising, which may be less obvious to the average user than a traditional advert that you might see in a game.","Chris Evenden - VP, Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","Your next question is from Ben Schachter from Macquarie Research.","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","Hey, guys, congratulations on a great year. On the full-game downloads, is there anything you guys are going to do to try to increase it via discounts or other promotions, or are you pretty happy to see it grow organically? And then also, if you're already over 30%, where do you think that number will be in FY 2017 in the next two years?","And then separately, on Battlefield 1, any notable increases in in-game monetization, or will it be continued more maps and those kind of things? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So let me take the first one and then I'll have Andrew talk a little bit about Battlefield. It's a difficult prediction. We know that PCs took about eight years to go from zero to 75% in full-game downloads, but there are a lot of differences between the PC business and the console business. We do know that the consumer is very interested in convenience, and we want to have product wherever the consumer wants to shop, be it a retail store or a console.","We obviously have great partners in retail and we want to continue to have great partners over time, and so we will support them with great in-store merchandise and training and support. And at the same time try to help educate our console partners as well on how to best market the products digitally. Our best guess today is that growth continues at about the pace that it has over the last couple of years since Gen 4 consoles were rolled out. So could we see another 5% pop, meaning going from say the high-20%s to the mid-30%s? We do think that's possible.","I think the big issues remain bandwidth. They remain cashless transactions. Many of our customers may not have a credit card and they need a cashless transaction method to be able to play digitally as well as, obviously, the residual value that some game retailers provide. All of those things are changing over time and we see that will continue to help support the growth of full game downloads. But we want to allow the consumer to decide.","We'll give them opportunities to buy certain things digitally that they may not be able to buy physically \u2013 special digital-only offers. But at the end of the day, we really want to make sure we're allowing the consumer to buy the product wherever the consumer wishes to do that. And we want to make sure we're there.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","As it relates to Battlefield 1 and the extra monetization opportunity, taking a step back, anytime we think about extra monetization inside an experience, we really think about it on two vectors. One, are we able to provide value to the gamer in terms of extending and enhancing their experience? And two, are we able to do that in a world where we give them choice? We never want to be in a place where there is a belief that we are providing a pay to win mechanic inside of one of our games. I think what you've seen from us over the last couple of years is our ability to balance this and deliver tremendous value through choice to our player, which is why our extra content line of business has continued to grow healthily.","As we look at FY 2017, we are forecasting again continued growth in that category. Given that in Battlefield 1 you will see a both macro monetization opportunities from us like maps and large-scale content as well as micro monetization opportunities, smaller increments of game play. And then over time what you will see from us is elements of game play that allow gamers to engage and drive and extend and enhance their experience much the way people will do with FIFA Ultimate Team or Madden Ultimate Team today. And we feel very confident in our ability to deliver that in a way that is deemed valuable by our player and drives increasing engagement over time with them","Benjamin Schachter - Macquarie Capital (USA), Inc.","And then if I could just get one more in, I don't want to front run the Analyst Day too much, but what are the key areas that you really want to spend more time on with investors? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, again, we have been undergoing a fairly fundamental transformation of our business over the last few years. We feel like we're in a very, very strong place. We feel like we have a strong and predictable revenue source and that the company is operating very well right now, and the management team are doing great things in a world where our industry continues to grow. And we want to take the opportunity to share our vision for the future, how we see the industry growing, where we think the vectors for growth exist inside that industry and how we believe Electronic Arts is uniquely well positioned to benefit from those vectors of growth in the years ahead.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And, Ben, I think part of that, the goal is to make sure we're giving both the sell-side and the buy-side exposure to the broader management team. And the chance to see the depth of what we've developed here as we feel very confident of it, and we're excited to make sure we showcase that next week.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mike Hickey with The Benchmark Company.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Great quarter. Blake, you gave 25 million units growth for, I think, calendar year 2016. I'm curious if your assumptions, if you were expecting ease of new consoles this year, any price cuts of existing hardware? Or maybe any other sort of key considerations to that estimate? And then, I realize obviously you can't announce any new hardware plans from your partners, but there has been sort of wide speculation that you have a mid-cycle upgrade coming. And I was curious if you could sort of shape for us why a mid-cycle upgrade could be positive for the industry. And also if there is any potential development expense to developing games in 4K. Thanks guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I can't tell you a lot about what Microsoft or Sony or other console makers plans are. I think we've all seen some of the discounting that's been going on in the industry both through the holidays and post holidays. And there is continued aggressive bundling across the industry. And I think all of that acts to continue to drive people into consoles. I think the other thing that's important to remember is there are very few Gen 3 titles being still made. Most of the new titles that we're talking about as well as the industry is talking about are Gen 4-only, and that is a \u2013 will clearly start to push people to ultimately buy a new console if they've resisted, because they've had a choice to play a game on either Gen 4 or Gen 4.","In terms of any mid-cycle upgrades, once again I can't predict. But what I can tell you is that what was heard I think publicly from the console makers is they're realizing that the compatibility issue across consoles is an important consumer issue. And as Microsoft has shown, they've tried to do with some backward compatibility on to older titles and new titles. I think that's going to be an important part of what a mid-cycle might look like if there is one, which removes a lot of the risk associated with what we've seen historically with console cycles. We don't spend a lot of time worrying about it, because we feel like our ability to develop for whatever new technology comes, the risk of that's been minimized because we've moved towards one single engine, Frostbite. And we're able to port that to whatever platform or point that to whatever platform is evolving or is upgraded.","In addition, our business model is so much more diverse now than it has been historically, that the notion of a console cycle becomes somewhat irrelevant in our ability to generate strong earnings and cash flow. So we'll all be interested to see where Microsoft and Sony come out if they do something at E3 or sometime in the year to come, but we're excited about the continued growth in the business and not afraid of a cycle change if that was to occur.","Michael Hickey - The Benchmark Co. LLC","All right, thanks, Blake. Best of luck, guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question is from Neil Doshi with Mizuho Securities.","Neil A. Doshi - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. First, on mobile, we've seen a couple of quarters of very strong mid-teens year-over-year growth. Is the plan there really to focus around the core AAA titles and develop the mobile ecosystem around those games, or can we see some original IP on the mobile front? And then, secondly, with the fairly healthy cash balance, Blake, how do you think about M&A as another way of putting that cash to use? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Chief Executive Officer & Director","As it relates to mobile, again, when you have the benefit of the depth and breadth of our portfolio of great brands and IP, in a world where discovery is becoming challenged and the mobile market is increasingly fought with competition, utilization of those brands is certainly a great strength for us. And as you heard us in our prepared comments, we had the most installs of any publisher in calendar year 2015, and a lot of that is driven around the recognition of our brand and our IP and the quality experiences that come as part of those brands.","As we look forward, certainly you will see more great experience from us that are based around the depth and breadth of our IP portfolio, but at the same time, like in our console business and our PC business, we also look at opportunities to develop new IP in the space, and so you would expect from us in the future a balanced approach to the marketplace, but certainly, we're not turning our back on our existing portfolio.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In terms of M&A, I think over the last three years, we've gone through quite a transformation as a company, and three years ago we could not have talked about M&A without having most of you throw something at us. And we feel like we've now at least earned the right to talk about it. The reality is there is not a lot of things out there to buy. This is an industry that's fairly consolidated already. We look at everything that's being considered to be sold out there, or shopped. Most of them either we're not interested in or are at a price that doesn't make sense to us to create value for shareholders, but we'll continue to do that and we'll continue to look for ways to bring in new talent and new properties over time if those are an opportunity. But we're certainly listening probably more than we did three years ago and we're well aware of the opportunities out there and we'll continue to look at them.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","With that, I think we're wrapped up. So I want to thank everyone. And we'll see people here next week for earnings \u2013 or for Analyst Day. And if not, we hope to see you at EA Play in June. Thanks for your time.","Andrew P.

We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of today, October 30, 2018 and disclaims any duty to update them.","During this call, the financial metrics, with the exception of free cash flow, will be presented on a GAAP basis. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated.","Note that our results reflect our adoption of ASC 606 as of the beginning of fiscal 2019. This doesn't materially impact our net bookings metrics, but does change our GAAP reporting in several ways. Prior periods have not been restated. For more information on this change, please see the accounting FAQ we have posted on our IR website.","And now I'll turn the call over to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","We had a strong second quarter, launching high-quality new games in our EA SPORTS franchises and delivering revenue and earnings above our guidance. With a busy and competitive holiday quarter ahead, our focus is on delivering for our players with new games, new experiences in our live services, and more fun and excitement across all platforms during one of the most popular times of the year for playing games.","At EA, our strategy is to create and offer a collection of amazing games and content, wrapped in compelling services, with more ways to play, watch, share, and connect for players around the world. In Q2, we delivered against that with four new games, hundreds of content updates in our live services, record viewership in our esports programs, and continued expansion of the experience in our subscription services.","For EA SPORTS, we released highly rated new experiences and content in Q2, including major updates and new ways to play in mobile. With FIFA 19, we set out this year to create a game that expanded our core FIFA product, adding UEFA Champions League and innovative new game modes. Our objective is always to grow the audience for FIFA through content that extends and enhances the experience. And our amazing development team delivered with a game that has been critically acclaimed as one of the best games of the franchise.","As we have seen previously when we have delivered innovative and creative new ways to play, such as The Journey, FIFA players will jump into the new content first and over time move into Ultimate Team. So far since launch, we have more players engaging across a great breadth of modes, from Career Mode to Kickoff and Tournaments. For those players that have already moved into Ultimate Team, engagement is high, with more games played and more games per player on average year over year since launch.","Players in Weekend League, our most competitive mode in FIFA Ultimate Team, have grown more than 75% year over year since the launch. As we now ramp into our live events inside the service, we expect the participation in Ultimate Team will continue to grow.","We designed FIFA for long-term engagement. And while Blake will talk about how some of the engagement in this new content has shifted our FUT monetization in the near term, FIFA 19 is a game that will engage a growing global community every day from now until we launch the next one and beyond.","Madden NFL 19 continues to bring new players into the franchise with the most immersive NFL experience we've ever delivered. Madden Ultimate Team, including popular modes like Seasons, Solo Challenges, and Weekend League are showing strong year-over-year engagement as we ramp into some of our biggest live events.","Across our EA SPORTS portfolio, NHL 19 was our highest-rated NHL game on current generation consoles. NBA LIVE has been recognized by fans and critics for the unique connection to basketball culture, and FIFA Mobile daily active players increased significantly year over year in Q2, leading up to the new season that is set to launch on November 7.","Excitement and engagement in our competitive gaming programs continues to grow. The 2018 FIFA eWorld Cup Final wrapped up our second FIFA esports season in August, setting records, including a 4x increase in global viewership over last year and more than 20 million players participating through the course of our FIFA 18 Global Series.","As we set out this quarter for our third season, FIFA esports is now a global phenomenon. We will have three times as many major events, and we expect to launch with 15 official football league partners holding top flight competitions, including the Bundesliga, La Liga, Ligue 1, MLS, and the world's most popular league, the Premier League.","Both FIFA and Madden are proving a unique multiplier of traditional sports through the context of esports. Players who watch our esports content play more, return more frequently, and are choosing to invest more. With expanded competitive ecosystems and new experiences for our players this year, we see strong potential for continued growth, including increased revenue streams through sponsorship, licensing deals with esports leaders, and broadcast agreements, including ESPN, that continue to reach new audiences.","Across consoles, mobile, PC, live services are increasingly the lifeblood of the experiences that players are engaging with today. This is when games continue to evolve for our player communities and where we can continue to deliver the choice, value, and fun that keeps them together with their friends over weeks, months, and years.","In our Sims 4 live service, fans have downloaded nearly 30 million expansion packs life to date. And with our monthly average players continuing to grow year over year, we see a long future ahead for this game and its thriving community.","We've also learned a lot through Star Wars Battlefront 2 about how to construct a strong first-person shooter live service. We're now beginning to deliver fan-requested Clone Wars content, and we have more to come for the community next year. These two games and many more give an important view into how we are creating games today that evolve with their communities well into the future.","Throughout Q2, we had more than 10 million unique players engaged in our Battlefield games, building excitement for the launch of Battlefield V. On November 20, we will bring the community into a new Battlefield that has been designed from the ground up as a service. At launch, Battlefield V will be the deepest game we've ever made in the franchise, taking players into the unseen fronts, untold stories, and intense combat of the world's greatest conflict through bigger than ever multiplayer and gritty single-player War Stories.","Then, just about two weeks later, our Tides of War live service will begin a regular cadence of major content updates delivered to all Battlefield V players. Each chapter of the service will bring a new dimension to the experience, fundamentally changing how the game is played.","For the first three chapters, here's what to expect. In early December, our first chapter will launch, including a new single-player War Story, a new multiplayer map, tank battles, and more customization options for players. In chapter 2, we're adding co-op and new multiplayer experiences, including the fan favorite Rush Mode. In our third chapter, set for March, Firestorm Battle Royale will arrive along with another new location in Greece. Tides of War is a highly innovative new model for a massive, ever-expanding Battlefield, and we're very excited to begin bringing players into Battlefield V next month.","As you saw with our announcement this morning, Command & Conquer: Rivals is set to launch worldwide for mobile players on December 4. It will also be our next official EA competitive gaming franchise, with the complete ecosystem beginning to roll out in Q4, including community tournaments and a championship pro scene. This is a fast-paced head-to-head strategy game that is easy to play, a lot of fun, and perfect for competitive play. We've had great engagement and feedback in our soft launch testing and strong interest from competitive players. This is our first entry into mobile esports, and we're excited for Command & Conquer: Rivals to expand our global audience of players and spectators.","Looking ahead, our focus continues to be on connecting more players to more great experiences. On February 22, BioWare will launch their stunning and ambitious shared-world game, Anthem. The team has done an outstanding job executing against their vision for a game with amazing levels of complexity, scale, and innovation.","Anthem has won more than 90 awards, including recognition as one of the most anticipated games of the year, and player feedback continues to be highly positive through our pre-launch testing. We can't wait to see this game come alive for fans at launch and through the long-term live services to come.","Across multiple studios, we have new projects underway, including games from Respawn that are slated to launch by next holiday season.","In our multi-product subscription services, we are pioneering a new value model that is lowering friction for members to access new content, including more than 100 games from EA and third-party developers and publishers.","We have deeply talented and creative leaders and teams across the company, driven by the opportunity to put our scale behind their ideas and helping us continually push the boundaries for the global gaming community.","We're looking forward to our opportunities ahead, building long-term engagement and lifetime value for players in ever-evolving live services like FIFA 19, Battlefield V, Anthem, and more.","Now I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","We're pleased with the strong profitability of our business through the second quarter, and particularly with the record Q2 digital net bookings. The digital transformation continues, with growth in full-game downloads and live services and the launch of our first frontline subscription service.","I'll report our results on a GAAP basis, then use our operational measures of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of our business. To compare this quarter's results to historically reported non-GAAP measures, please refer to the relevant tabs in our downloadable financial model.","EA's net revenue was $1.286 billion, above our guidance by $16 million. Operating expenses were $610 million, $64 million lower than our guidance, driven by compensation and related expenses and some phasing of marketing expenses.","GAAP operating income was $258 million compared to an operating loss of $41 million a year ago, and resulting in an earnings per share of $0.83, $0.35 better than our guidance. Underlying profit was much stronger than we had expected, driven by increased sales, better gross margin, and lower operating expenses.","Operating cash flow for the quarter was negative $126 million, down $178 million from last year. The decrease was driven primarily by the timing of cash receipts, the timing of royalty payments, and by increased tax payments.","Operating cash flow for the trailing 12 months was $1.458 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $31 million, resulting in free cash flow of negative $157 million. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information.","During the quarter we also repurchased 2.3 million shares at a cost of $299 million, leaving $1.88 billion in our two-year $2.4 billion buyback program we began in May. Our cash and short-term investments at the end of the quarter were $4.5 billion.","Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Total net bookings for the quarter were $1.222 billion, up $43 million on the prior year and $62 million above our guidance. Performance over guidance was driven primarily by full-game sales of FIFA 19 and FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams.","Digital net bookings were $637 million, up 10% on the year-ago period and a new record for the second quarter. The main drivers of the increase were FIFA 19, FIFA and Madden Ultimate Teams. Digital net bookings now represent 69% of our business on a trailing 12-month basis compared to 63% in the prior year. This is a new record for the period.","Looking at each of the components of this quarter's digital net bookings in turn, live services net bookings were up 6% year on year to $328 million, a new Q2 record. The increase was driven by FIFA, Madden and Madden Ultimate Teams, and The Sims 4, offset by the effects of the transition from FIFA Online 3 to FIFA Online 4 in Asia.","The Sims 4 live services are in their fourth year, continued to perform very strongly and are on track to grow 20% over fiscal 2018. In addition, our subscription services continue to grow, and we expect the launch of Battlefield V to drive additional subscriptions to our Origin Access Premier service.","As a reminder, over the course of a year, our live services business is about 50% Ultimate Team, 30% other live services such as Sims 4 expansion packs and FIFA Online 4, and 20% subscriptions, advertising, and other.","Mobile delivered net bookings of $152 million, up 1% year on year, with growth in our FIFA franchise on mobile mostly offset by a decline in Madden Mobile. The Madden team is working hard to turn this around, adding new social features, new game modes, and competitive tournaments. We have two updates out already and a major update coming in December. FIFA Mobile also has a long list of new features coming.","Full-game PC and console downloads generated net bookings of $157 million, 32% higher than last year, another Q2 record. Growth was driven by the ongoing shift to digital, timing of the recognition of net bookings from FIFA 19, and the earlier launch of Madden this year.","The digital portion of Madden sales increased 9 percentage points year on year to 42%. FIFA 19 launched just days before the end of the quarter. But based on the first three weeks of sales, it was about 29% digital, up from 24% in the comparable period for FIFA 18. Over 42% of our unit sales were digital rather than physical, measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to just 36% a year ago.","Turning to guidance, our expectation for full-year GAAP revenue is $5.15 billion and earnings per share of $3.11. We expect operating cash flow of about $1.65 billion. We continue to anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of about $1.525 billion. The reduction from prior estimates is driven by lower net income and a greater balance of bookings in the fourth quarter, some of which will be collected in fiscal 2020.","To reiterate our guidance from our August announcement, we anticipate net bookings of $5.2 billion. This guidance was driven by the later launch of Battlefield V, which also reduces our expectations for live services and subscription revenue in the year, the FX headwind, and lower mobile net bookings. Our revised outlook is for net bookings to be roughly flat to the prior year.","We're updating our digital growth targets for the fiscal year to give you more visibility into the changes within our business. We now expect live services to be approximately flat to up 5% year on year, with growth driven by FIFA Ultimate Team. This is lower than our original guidance, primarily due to the reduced expectations for Ultimate Team, the delay of Battlefield V, and the FX headwind.","As Andrew mentioned, FIFA players are engaging with the new content we have added to FIFA 19, and this may be delaying the entry into FIFA Ultimate Team. However, once playing FIFA Ultimate Team, engagement metrics are up on last year.","We expect our mobile net bookings to be about flat year on year. We have a couple of titles performing below our expectations, and we've moved Star Wars: Rise to Power out of fiscal 2019. Meanwhile, Command & Conquer: Rivals is performing well in soft launch, and FIFA Mobile is off to a strong start in China.","Net bookings from full-game downloads are expected to grow 20% to 25%. This is significantly above our original expectations, primarily driven by the strength we are seeing in Anthem, which we expect to skew strongly digital, plus the digital shifts for our other titles. We continue to model an underlying shift of around 5 percentage points a year to digital.","For the third quarter, we expect net revenue of $1.375 billion, cost of revenue to be $446 million, and operating expenses of $730 million. OpEx is up year on year primarily due to increased investment in R&D. The results in earnings per share of $0.61 for the third quarter using the diluted share count of 306 million.","We anticipate net bookings for the quarter to be $1.725 billion. This is down 12% year on year, primarily because we had two extra launches in Q3 last year, Need for Speed: Payback and The Sims 4 for consoles. The fourth quarter will be stronger than we had originally forecast, driven by higher expectations for Anthem and Command & Conquer: Rivals.","In conclusion, we delivered a strong quarter. Our business model is robust because it is diverse with global revenues across multiple platforms, business models, and geographic territories. As a result, even with the challenges this year, we expect net bookings to be roughly flat year on year, with strong cash generation and continued growth in underlying net income. The digital transformation continues, and we're moving ahead with our growth strategy.","Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Blake.","At EA, our transformation continues in constant pursuit of the future of interactive entertainment. The very definition of a game is changing, much as it did when we went from offline to online experiences. Games are evolving from finite experiences to live services with infinite potential. These are experiences that are constantly evolving and beginning to bypass the boundaries of devices, geography, and time. This is how games become an even more meaningful part of our daily lives, creating shared connections between you and your friends that exist both in-game and in the outside world. We are investing in the talent, the content and services, and the technology to deliver these breakthrough experiences in our games today and in the years to come.","Across the organization, we have more than 5,000 deeply talented creators on our development team. We've cultivated incredible teams in our studios to deliver that across an unmatched breadth and depth of franchises and IP. These are the teams launching Battlefield V and beginning a long-term journey with millions of players through our live service. These are the teams that continually deliver for hundreds of millions of fans across EA SPORTS, The Sims, Star Wars, and more.","Our Command & Conquer team is not only delivering a great new mobile game, but are also working with the content for the franchise's PC core. Teams across our studios, including BioWare, Respawn and Motive, are executing on their visions to bring next-generation experiences and content to life.","And in other areas, we're fostering new dimensions of our creativity. We've recently launched a new internal creative council to incubate great content ideas and provide support to nascent projects, and we're advancing the work of our SEED Labs team working on disruptive new game designs.","We're also well-positioned to lead through the rapid advancements in the technology landscape that are shaping the future of games. Engine technology, cloud, social layers, services, and distributed networks are converging to unlock new possibilities. We're expanding the capabilities of Frostbite with advances in ray-tracing, scalable world editing, AI, and other features that are bringing next-generation experiences to life.","As we shared yesterday, we've also been developing Project Atlas, bringing together Frostbite with an expanding suite of digital services into a fully integrated platform that will enable us to more efficiently create and execute on new games that deliver amazing scalable, social, and deeply interactive experiences.","Cloud gaming will enable games to reach new audiences and geographies, and we're continuing development on the streaming capabilities we debuted in June and exploring the disruptive combination we see for streaming with our industry-leading subscription services.","Underpinning it all will be our Player Network, enabling our players to stay connected to their friends and the content they love wherever they are in the world. We're executing for our players today and positioning EA to lead and grow in the next evolution of games and entertainment.","Now Blake and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question come from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi, thank you very much. My question is really on the confidence you have for the outlook for fiscal Q4. When you mentioned higher expectations for Anthem, I'm curious what gives you confidence behind that. And also how much certainty do you have that the delayed live services revenue will materialize on FIFA?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I think we're confident in both. I think everyone knows we tend to approach things fairly conservatively, and I think we've shown that in our recent guidance and results.","We monitor FIFA on a daily basis and Ultimate Team on a daily basis, and we're seeing extremely good and strong metrics, as Andrew mentioned and I mentioned, around all the players who are playing. We also know how players are playing in other modes in the game, and we know the game is designed ultimately to steer them into Ultimate Team. And so we're confident that as they consume the content in FIFA, they will move into Ultimate Team.","And we have a great many set of exciting events leading up to the holidays and then after the holidays. For example, this weekend we had our Halloween events around the globe. And despite the fact of Red Dead Redemption taking up a lot of attention in the marketplace, we had one of our strongest FIFA weekends we've seen \u2013 Ultimate Team weekends we've seen in a long time. So we're confident but we're also careful in how we forecast. We want to make sure that we're being straightforward with investors.","We're also very excited about Anthem. Andrew mentioned it was getting a lot of positive feedback. We think it's a fabulous game, and you'll see a lot more of it to come after we get out of this holiday window into early next year. And I think our original expectations of the game were probably too low, and thus we think that's important.","Remember also that our assumption is we'll sell more Battlefield V in Q4 than we would have originally anticipated as we move that out by four weeks. And any live services associated with that game or with Anthem obviously will also benefit Q4.","Alexia S. Quadrani - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","And your next question comes from Mike Olson from Piper Jaffray.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hey, good afternoon. I just had two questions. On Battlefield V, does the strength of the launches of the competitive titles in recent weeks leave you encouraged that there's a strong appetite for console titles in the current environment, or does it leave you, I guess, concerned that gamers maybe spending their budgets on those titles now?","And then second, can you talk about some of the changes in creative leadership during the quarter and just how investors should be thinking about the talent that's moving in and out of the business? Thank you.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Sure, I'll take both those questions, Mike. In terms of our confidence in the Battlefield V launch with respect to other things that are happening this year, I think the industry is vibrant and growing, and we couldn't be more excited for our Battlefield V launch. As I said in the prepared remarks, we've still got over 10 million players on our existing Battlefield games that we are in direct communication with as we go into launch. Battlefield has a tremendously rich and robust community who love those only-in-Battlefield moments. We're coming out with strong multiplayer, strong single player, but also the promise of a tremendous live service with content that's free for all players in the months and years to come. So I think we feel good about that, even in the context of what have been some other strong launches, and I think that's additive to what we're going to do there.","In terms of creative leadership, again, as I talked about in the prepared remarks, we have over 5,000 developers in the organization. I think we've got one of the deepest and broadest benches of creative leaders. We made some changes through the quarter in service of stronger creativity in the organization as well as stronger execution across the organization.","Again, as we think about the future of games, and I talked a little bit about that in my prepared remarks, we are planning for the future. We see a world where games are no longer bound by device or CPU or GPU. We see a world where they span across platforms, across business models, across geographies. In some of the divisions we made during the quarter, specifically around Samantha Ryan, we're bringing these types of games together who service a very particular player cohort in the context of action, adventure, RPG, and simulation. And we feel very good about the level of collaboration we're going to able to achieve across that group to deliver both creativity, innovation, and execution more broadly.","Michael J. Olson - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan from UBS.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, guys, maybe one on capital. Given how much the stock has underperformed recently, I wanted to get a refreshed view on the way you guys are thinking about leverage, possibly returning capital to shareholders, and with the arsenal of ways to create equity value, how you also might be thinking about the M&A landscape. Thanks, guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So good questions. Clearly, we've been active at buying back stock in the quarter. We try to pace our buybacks around the life of the program versus any certain stock price. We oftentimes don't even pay attention to the stock price on a day-to-day basis because we know there are lots of things that move the market that are well beyond our control. And so our goal is to simply allocate a certain amount of capital to buybacks and then be in the market to buy back that stock every single day and hit our targets of, in this case, $2.4 billion over two years.","In terms of M&A, we're clearly keeping our eyes open on everything that's out there. This is all about collecting great content and talent, and we're looking for ways to do that at every possible opportunity we have, and we'll continue to do that. I can't predict anything at this point in time. But part of the reason that we want to leave dry powder both in the terms of cash and in the terms of debt capacity, our capital structure is for the opportunity that could come to us at some point in time to be able to step in and buy an asset or acquire talent and titles that would be helpful to our long-term vision of both subscriptions and streaming.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","And your next question comes from Laura Martin from Needham.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Hi there. I need some help on mobile. So it looks to me like we have a trailing 12-month mobile fees of $93 million, but a projected full-year for 2019 at $220 million, but mobile is growing at 1%. And can you bridge that? I thought those were rev shares on the mobile platform. How is it that the mobile fees are growing so much faster than mobile revenue? That's my first question.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I think you're probably missing possibly some deferrals as you go from GAAP to our management reporting numbers. The mobile platform fees are purely what we pay to the mobile platforms like Google or Apple. So essentially, that's the 30% that they take and we book 70%. We can probably go through with you offline the specific numbers just to line them up.","I think the key growth driver to remember is we'll add a new title, Command & Conquer, on December 4. We just announced this morning. That will drive substantial growth in mobile during the tail end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter and give you some of the mobile growth for the full year. But we have, as we showed on the script, adjusted our mobile full-year guidance off of what we originally thought we would do to now a lower level, which we believe to be really around flat for the year. So a combination of all those things probably gets you back to where would like to see it in your model.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Okay. And then I was really intrigued by this prior comment on Samantha Ryan, where you're servicing a particular player. Is that a pivot towards looking at creating an organizational design around identifying player segments and actually targeting games, a series of games to particular players now?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So yes, that's one piece of the puzzle. Again, we have a lot of data across our more than 350 million players in our network and certainly many more players across our mobile games that we don't know as much about. And what we have come to understand over the recent years is that players are always looking for very specific motivations in the context of play. And some players are looking to fulfill different motivations at different times or on different platforms, and we've started to better understand that in terms of creating new and innovative and creative content for our players.","And one of the things that we've seen, particularly as we look to the future when we think about moving many of those experiences to the cloud over time, which unbounds them from the platform that they may have previously been subjected to, is that we have to start thinking about in the context of how they fulfill those motivations over time.","We've seen tremendous strength in the collaboration across our EA SPORTS portfolio, both in the context of our core game, core feature sets, and the live services that we built on top of those. And part of what we've looked at in this construct is our ability to do that across action-adventure, RPG, and simulation, all of whom support a collective player set who are looking to fulfill similar motivations. And you should expect over time as we continue to transform the nature of discovery, purchase, and enjoyment across games that we'll continue to try and organize around player cohorts to better service their needs and support what they're looking for out of their games.","Laura Martin - Needham & Co. LLC","Thanks, that's super-helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Andrew, FIFA is already out and localized in China. But can you update us on what your distribution partners may be saying about changes to the approval process there in what looks like a more stringent operating environment, as this might impact your ability to release other new games in the country?","And, Blake, the digital download gap between Madden and FIFA is at 13% based on your prepared remarks. So I guess some of this was due to greater payment friction in Europe and other factors. So is the adoption path for those users now similar to what you saw in the U.S. at the same time? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Sure, I'll take the first one. Right now, we have our products out in China. And because they're approved, they're in the marketplace and doing well. As far as we can tell at this stage, this should not impact our titles. FIFA Online 4 and FIFA Mobile are doing well, and the next title launch in China for us is some way off. And so our hope is that delays are fixed by then. And while we continue to monitor the situation, we don't see any direct impact right now.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Our understanding is it's more through interactions with Tencent and other partners, it's more of a backlog problem than an actual not really approving games. I think as they changed agencies, the backlog built up fairly quickly. So we don't see that as an impact for us, at least in the next year or so, as we focus mainly on FIFA.","In terms of the full-game download stats, we've always seen FIFA lag Madden because Madden is pretty much a domestic U.S. business, where FIFA is a global business. And in many parts of the world where FIFA is shipped, the bandwidth speeds are still slow and there may be some payment issues or just payment cultures that differ. Germany, for example, tends not to use credit cards, and so we have lower full-game downloads in that marketplace.","That is changing, and we've seen the pace of change of FIFA track pretty much the same pace of change with the other games. It just started from a lower base. And some of it historically was due to the fact that retailers would use FIFA to drive traffic into their stores. That's starting to abate because, once again, fewer and fewer people are buying physical disks. So we believe that same pace will continue, and obviously it's great to see all of our games tracking as a whole at 42%, meaning that some games are well north of that if FIFA is on the south side of that.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great, thanks, a couple of questions for me. I guess first with respect to the third quarter guidance, I'm wondering if you could expand on how much of a promotional environment you're baking into the outlook for the Battlefield V release.","And then as a follow-up to the live services segment and the guidance, just given some concerns that still exist around user monetization maybe beginning to flatten out a bit, I wonder if you could talk about how much growth we should expect in ARPU within the individual franchises such as FIFA and Battlefield versus growth in the user base as a driver. Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So in terms of the promotional plans, our promotional plans are pretty consistent with what we've had in the past. With the case of Battlefield, actually we will not be on promotion on Black Friday because we ship that week. There may be selected retailers that choose to promote it on their own, but we're not supporting those promotions. And then we'll have the regular promotion schedule that you would see through December into the holidays.","Similar things for each title, the timing is different and the retail mix will be different. But you should see promotions, both digitally and physical copies, but not that different than what we've seen historically with the exception of the Battlefield V issue relative to Black Friday. And we see that that's pretty consistent with past years. It's always a promotional time of the year. It drives a lot of volume, and we're very supportive of our retail partners and our platform partners who want to continue to keep people engaged.","In terms of the Q3 numbers, our focus is always on driving more users into the live service. That's the way to keep a very large market in place and continue to keep it very healthy. The moment you stop focusing on that, you really lose the strength of live services, which is a large marketplace where people can all play together. If you focus too much on revenue generation per person, you start to squeeze the players, and we're very careful not to do that. It happens naturally in some cases due to people's level of engagement, but we're very careful not to allow people to start to spend too much because we know they'll churn out of the business.","So our goal, as I think Andrew mentioned before, is to build really exciting great games. We think we've done an amazing job with FIFA, probably the best FIFA we've ever built. And it's got so much content in there that that allows people to play a long time. And if that means that they start playing Ultimate Team or playing Ultimate Team at a level a little bit later, we're fine with that as long as they're enjoying themselves in the game. And we think that's what's going on during the \u2013 and what we're seeing in the quarter.","I also remind people, we didn't give new phasing for the quarter when we moved Battlefield out. We just told people what the total year's numbers were, and we left it to everyone to deliver their own phasing. And so I caution people to be overly emphasis on comparing to what they had because what they had before wasn't informed by our giving some sense of things like the mobile title that moved out, when Command & Conquer would start, the impact of FX on the quarter, and the general overall view of our business during the quarter. So just don't over-index on the two quarters, focus on the full-year guidance, which did not change.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.","Matthew Cost - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, it's Matt Cost on for Brian. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two. So on that point about the Battlefield delay, can you give a little bit more color, if you can, around the unit potential for the game, and then bigger picture, how you think about the potential for in-game monetization in the new Battlefield compared to the prior installment?","And then the second question is subscription and streaming obviously is a topic you guys have been very forward on. You recently announced Project Atlas. What do you think are some of the key next steps needed to drive a material transition into subscription and then streaming-based ecosystem? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So why don't I start and then I'll let Andrew talk about the second question. Battlefield, the overall forecast really only changed just because of the timing. So when we told people that that moved roughly 3 million-plus units out of the quarter that we originally had expected, some of that into Q4 and some of it into next year's Q1.","What you'll find when you get into Battlefield, and I'll leave it up to the Battlefield team to help people understand the excitement around where Battlefield is going and how that might include in-game monetization, but what I'll just say is there will be dramatic evolving gameplay over time: new ways to experience it, things like fortification and reinforcements and new hardware vehicles, weapons, gadgets, and there could be exciting ways to earn those over time or possibly even purchase those over time; new experiences through the single-player stories that will continue to be rolled out; game improvements and excitement around a Battle Royale style mode that will come in the March timeframe; and a pretty exciting live service that we hope will keep people highly engaged. And over time, that may include monetization opportunities to keep them even more engaged.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","In terms of content streaming, we've talked a lot about this, that the greatest disruption of the consumption of entertainment media over the last five years has been a combination of those two things. Right now, we're treating them on separate vectors, but ultimately expect that we will bring them together over time.","We launched our first subscription what is now over four years ago as a catalog subscription on Xbox and then took that to PC, and we're able to get tremendous learning out of that. And what we have seen is that people who come into that subscription \u2013 again, by definition a subscription is the offering of an amazing collection of high-quality content at a great consumer value proposition with as low friction as possible. And what we have seen from people who have come into that is they play more games, they spend more time, and ultimately they monetize higher in live services as well.","We know that great new blockbuster content adds subscribers, and we know that great catalog content retains subscribers, no different than traditional linear media. And so what we have started to do with the launch of our Origin Access Premier this year is to add front-line blockbuster content, and Battlefield V will be the first opportunity for us to truly understand that. We saw really strong uptake after Madden. But remember, Madden hadn't been on PC for nearly a decade. The PC community of Battlefield is very, very strong, and we expect to get tremendous learning out of that as we grow that.","In terms of next steps, you should expect us to continue to try and aggregate more content for our players, again, always improving the collection of content and the consumer value proposition, so that players can come in and play more games and spend more time. Some of that will be the creation of new content organically inside of our company. Some of it will be working with indie developers or third-party developers and publishers. And as Blake pointed out, as a long-term vision, we also expect that we would look to acquire both content IP and talent over time.","As you think about the context of streaming, we announced and demonstrated in June a streaming service that was working at EA PLAY. We've continued to develop that and continue to work on making that a better experience for players. We're also working with some other third parties that you may have heard about who are developing streaming services, and we believe that our service can work in conjunction with their services over time, ultimately, substantially increasing the total addressable market of players that we have access to and the ability to deliver great games and experiences to.","You referenced Project Atlas. That's really an ambitious plan that we've been executing against to make it easier to move these experiences to the cloud by bringing Frostbite and a collected digital platform of services together, so that our game makers are able to effectively execute and deliver the types of innovative game experiences that they see players will want over the next three years.","As you can imagine, we've had a lot of inbound requests around that platform and third parties out there who would look to \u2013 who would love the ability to utilize that technology, that combined platform of engine plus digital services. And as we think about adding more content to our subscription over time, we also see that as a tool that would allow us to do that.","So add more content to our sub through licensing and potentially acquisition, continue to develop on our streaming solutions both as an isolated service for us as well as in conjunction with others, and then bringing our combined digital platform engine and digital service and Project Atlas to help us get there faster, more quickly, more efficiently, and with more innovative and creative games both developed internally and potentially at some time developed externally.","Matthew Cost - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it, thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Raymond Stochel from Consumer Edge Research.","Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great, thanks so much for taking my question. I guess a couple things on Project Atlas. So number one would be how are you thinking about user-generated content in games longer term? You alluded to that in the Project Atlas announcement.","And then secondarily, in a streaming world, can you give us a better sense as to your mobile strategy? You obviously have a number of mobile titles in development that are exclusive mobile titles. How do you think about development over time in a more cross-platform and streaming way? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Two great questions. So first in terms of user-generated content, as we look out in the world today, some of the richest ecosystems have a robust community of creatives that are delivering new content experiences for their fellow players on a daily basis. And for us, The Sims franchise has been that since its inception. Part of what we're doing now, we're building that capability into our toolset so that game makers can implement that in future games and bring communities together.","Again, in a world that we have a vision of entertaining 1 billion people in play, we are very aware that delivering against the insatiable appetites of that many players across the globe is beyond the scope of just our creative organization. But in the context of having our creative organization see these great worlds and these great characters and these great stories, and having AI amplify that effort in conjunction with large and robust communities of tens and potentially hundreds of millions of players creating content in large scalable simulated worlds, we feel like that's the future of games. We've been investing for some years against it. We're now in a place when we're ready to talk about it, and we're starting to invite people in, including these community creatives, to help us really build out that robust toolset.","As we think about mobile strategy going forward, again, over time we do believe that many experiences will move to the cloud and they'll no longer be bound by local devices, whether it's CPU, GPU, memory, or battery life. And more the experiences will be governed by the screen size you have access to and the session time that you have.","With that said, we also understand that there will be some players that only ever play on their mobile device, and some players who spend a great or disproportionate amount of time playing on an 80-inch screen. And so we will continue to develop experiences that are rich and robust as those native experiences today, but always with a view of allowing them to connect their experience across streams, but more importantly, to connect with a global community of players regardless of which screen they access a game through.","And that's a fundamental shift in how we design the architecture of games. It's also a fundamental shift in how we design the features of games. But in all things, it's about entertaining with innovative and creative experiences that you can experience based on your choice of how you want to play, but where you never feel disconnected from this global community of friends that you have.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Ryan Gee with Barclays.","Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question, so one question on live services and a clarification. So live services are now expected to be up plus or minus plus 5%, and I think you point out that Ultimate Team is the biggest driver there. It seems to be growing mid-single-digits in the first half results prior to indications. So can you help us understand in the second half why the live services overall shouldn't be up in Q4 year over year just given Battlefront II and Star Wars really didn't really have any updates last year? And I think you have already Black (51:03) coming already in December with Battlefront V this year. Is there anything we should look to for emerging trajectories for Ultimate Team versus maybe (51:14) both year over year, any of those comments?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So assume that we've got very little live service revenue in for either Battlefield or Anthem because they're very new. And until we understand exactly how well does it monetize, we didn't put much of that into our forecast. We'll still see some of the transition impact on FIFA Online 4, which will continue to be a drag. And we've got a forecast for subscriptions, but we're guessing a little bit as to the uptake of Premier based on the fact that we haven't yet seen the real true PC-based titles like Battlefield and Anthem. We'll have a lot better sense once we get through those. So I'd say some of it is just conservatism and forecasting, and some of it is the associations that I just mentioned around live services.","Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay great, and then just a quick clarification. It's been a couple years since Respawn has done anything with its flagship Titanfall franchise, but I'm not sure if I heard that correctly. It sounded like we should expect games, plural, from Respawn I suppose next year. Did I hear that correctly? I know that you revealed Star Wars 2 at E3, but is there anything else that we should be aware of?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So you weren't coming through very loud. But I think I got what you said, which is you heard Andrew use a plural when he said games from Respawn. Just consider that a little Easter egg left in the earnings call for you. We'll announce more when we get there. But clearly we've got a lot of things working with all of our studios, and you should assume that there will be some things that we haven't announced that come out later in the year when we go to give guidance for next year.","Ryan Gee - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Brandon Ross with BTIG.","Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC","Hi, thanks for taking the questions, a couple of topics. First on Anthem, can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing there that made you raise your outlook for Anthem in your guidance?","And then a follow-up on mobile, I guess growth there has really stalled. What changes need to be made to restimulate growth in mobile? And if you could, just tell us how important you see mobile being to your future and if you need to make an acquisition there, potentially a larger one, to improve that business. Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Let me start with Anthem and I'll let Andrew address the mobile piece. Anthem, it's a brand-new IP. And so when we originally forecasted it, we forecasted it at a pretty low level, as we thought about without a lot of information. That was last May or April when we put that forecast together.","As we've gotten deeper into the final parts of the game and we had it tested with a lot of people, clearly the excitement is building. It started building at E3 as people learned what the game was and saw it. And so typically, when you're forecasting a brand-new IP, you usually start lower and then build that forecast over time, and that's essentially what we've done.","We're getting excitement both internally and externally about the game. As Andrew mentioned, it's very different than anything BioWare has built in the past. It looks stunning and it plays extremely well. And that's what's given us more confidence around the forecast.","But remember also, as I said earlier, we did not provide new phasing of a forecast. So you should assume that it's not all coming from Anthem. There may be obviously stuff -more from Battlefield V in Q4 than we originally were thinking in our forecast, as well as the mobile title that we talked about, Command & Conquer.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","In terms of mobile, as Blake highlighted earlier, where there is an opportunity to bring on new teams or new IP of any category or across any platform, we're open to that right now. However, as I look at the mobile industry and the mobile Top 20 or Top 30 charts, it's not immediately apparent what you would go after. We've seen some fairly significant shift in the mobile marketplace from where it was even a year or two years ago. And it's now also pretty well understood that many of the players that were reaching some fairly serious revenue heights over the last year or two were also outspending their revenue and weren't profitable companies and weren't growing profitably.","I think what we have always maintained across our mobile business is that we believe we have a tremendously strong portfolio of content, and we were going to take the time to ensure that we delivered profitable growth over time. And while that growth has slowed this year as a result of some title shifts and title moves, we feel actually very bullish on the future.","Command & Conquer I'm very excited about. I think it's a unique and innovative new entry into the mobile genre. I think we clearly have the leading sports business, which is a business that we are committed to and we'll continue to grow.","We're seeing \u2013 we have some other products in development right now that will come out in the years to come that I think have started to play into the strength in mobile, as mobile players are looking for creativity and innovation in their experience. And again, as we look at the Top 10 or Top 20 charts, there's also a much greater representation from China, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia in terms of title strength.","And as I look at what we're doing with Command & Conquer, which has a tremendous fan base throughout the Asia region, and FIFA, I feel good about that. And so while we're always open to acquisition, I think that we also feel very good that the mobile industry is actually moving in a direction where the types of games that we make will be very, very well received.","Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Matthew Harrigan with Buckingham Research.","Matthew Harrigan - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Thank you. I was just curious if you had any thoughts on the decision by Sony as well as Microsoft to do a next-gen console and how that laces into your perspective, interlaces into your perspective on the business and the evolution toward the cloud and the continued importance of consoles.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So I think that there is a few articles out there and a few rumors and a little hearsay as to what they are and when they're coming and what they might be. I don't think we're in a position today to have a conversation on that. But just know that we've worked with Microsoft and Sony and Nintendo for many, many years and look forward to working with them for many, many years more, even if collectively we all seek to move either some portion or all of our experiences to the cloud.","Matthew Harrigan - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.","Great, thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","One last question.","Operator","Your last question comes from Matthew Thornton with SunTrust.","Matthew C. Thornton - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for sneaking me in here, a couple clarifications, if I could. Blake, you talked about the FIFA franchise. To be clear, I guess are front-line players and hours up year on year and thus we just need to get the monetization lever moving here over the coming months and quarters, or are players and hours down and thus monetization has got to work harder? That was question number one. And again, I apologize if I missed that answer.","Secondly, you talked a little bit about a second Respawn title next year. Would that also be in the holiday quarter? I'm not sure if you mentioned that or not or if you have any color around timing.","And then just finally, Andrew, you talked a lot about Project Atlas obviously. So it sounds like that might be a platform you would think about licensing out to other developers, either on a per seat type of basis or revenue share type of a basis, but building a part that's open to third-party monetization. I just want to make sure I understood that correctly. Thanks, guys.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So FIFA, we said FIFA sales were strong in the quarter. So you should assume we've done well with FIFA. We also mentioned that people were playing more modes in FIFA. We also still have quite a few people playing FIFA 18. We were successful bringing them into World Cup, and many of those have not yet converted over to FIFA 19.","So it's hard to say today ultimately how it will play out because we're still early in the third quarter. So I would just say we'll see what that looks like over the next two and half months or two months as we get into the rest of the year and even into the fourth quarter. FIFA tends to sell well all through the holidays. And so it's just too early to say one way or the other what people are spending their time on or not.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","In terms of Project Atlas, again, when we set out on this journey, the objective was to ensure that we had industry-leading technology for our developers to build the most innovative and immersive and creative games, everything from sports games to large world simulations. And in a world where it's becoming increasingly complex to do that, we also understand that is hard for other people.","And so as we have started talking to developers and publishers about bringing content into our subscription over time, as you might imagine, we've had a lot of inbound interest on the utilization of a technology platform like Project Atlas that would make it easier for them to create content in this growing complex world.","And so while we have no locked-in plans or timelines today, we're certainly developing the technology with a view that over time our objective is to bring the greatest collection of content together as part of our industry-leading subscriptions. And at some level, that might mean offering our technology for use by third parties so that they can do that and then ultimately put their content into our subscription.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And on your Respawn question \u2013 I skipped over it \u2013 we'll have more to come on that. We'll read people as we get into the fourth quarter timeframe before we run into next year's full-year guidance. Thank you, everyone, talk to everyone next quarter.","Operator","Thank you.

With me on the call today are Andrew Wilson, our CEO, and Blake Jorgensen, our CFO and COO.","Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com.

Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Chris.","FY 2018 was a year of growth and continued transformation for Electronic Arts and a year where our commitment to putting players first grew even stronger. We expanded our global player base, grew engagement in our leading games, live services, and subscriptions, and continued our focus on listening and learning from our communities.","Our revenue and earnings for Q4 and the fiscal year 2018 were above our guidance given in January, and we are well positioned for continued growth in FY 2019. Our strategy is to deliver a collection of amazing games and content wrapped in services with new and innovative ways to reach an expanding global audience.","Here are a few of our achievements in the year just completed. Our EA SPORTS franchises FIFA, Madden NFL, NBA Live, NHL, and UFC continue to be some of the most powerful sports brands in the world. In FY 2018, our EA SPORTS player base grew to nearly 90 million players life to date on current-generation consoles, and many tens of millions more across mobile and PC.","Our sports games are also powerful platforms for competitive gaming. Nearly 18 million players engaged in competition across FIFA 18 and Madden NFL 18 this season, up more than 75% year over year. And viewership of our top level competitions continues to break records on networks and digital channels.","We are growing our reach across all platforms. Our Battlefield ecosystem of games has more than 54 million players life to date across current-generation consoles and PC, as fans continue to play their favorite Battlefield titles for years after launch.","Our Sims community spans across generations and platforms, with more than 80 million active Sims players across PC and mobile in FY 2018. Our Sims 4 community continues to grow nearly four years after launch, and we have a great deal more content coming to our PC players this year. Alongside the ongoing success of the Sims FreePlay, we've had strong early growth in the player base for The Sims Mobile, giving us two games on mobile delivering the breadth of experiences that Sims fans are looking for.","FY 2018 was our strongest year ever for the EA mobile portfolio. Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes continues to have one of our most committed and deeply engaged fan bases, driving player satisfaction scores to an all-time high in Q4.","Our EA SPORTS titles SimCity BuildIt, Real Racing 3, and more continue to entertain global communities on a daily basis, and we will add more breadth and depth to our portfolio in FY 2019.","We also helped players experience more games, including innovative new IP. Our EA Access and Origin Access subscriber titles continue to grow, and we've expanded Origin Access to include dozens of third-party titles in addition to EA's PC portfolio. And with our EA Originals program, we saw outstanding success with A Way Out, the innovative co-op game from Hazelight that engaged nearly 2 million players in the first four weeks after launch.","Through all of these examples and many more, we hold an unfaltering commitment to our communities. We will also always push forward to innovate and create new experiences. That's in our DNA.","We also continue to listen, learn, and act in service of our players. We have a deep appreciation and commitment to our Star Wars fans. And as promised, we delivered a major redesign of the progression in Star Wars Battlefront II in Q4, updating it to a more linear system that our players wanted. We've also brought new content modes and fan requested updates to the game, and we have much more coming to the launch of the new movie Solo: A Star Wars Story.","As we begin FY 2019, EA is uniquely positioned to lead. Through our investments in IP, technology, competition, and new ways to play, our talented teams continue to deliver new experiences that will disrupt and expand the future of play.","There is no bigger event in sports than the World Cup, and we're excited to kick off an unprecedented year of new experiences across our FIFA franchise with our new World Cup content in FIFA 18. As we announced last week, we are bringing all the teams, matchups, and so much more of the World Cup experience and making it all free for FIFA 18 players.","Building on the momentum of World Cup, we then have some very exciting plans for FIFA 19, which we'll speak to at EA PLAY in June. This is a major year for EA SPORTS across all platforms, with more innovation coming to Madden NFL, NBA Live, and NHL as well as our EA SPORTS titles on mobile and FIFA Online 4 going live soon in China and Korea.","This year we also plan to deliver two massive new games, our next Battlefield title and our new IP, Anthem. Both of these experiences are introducing new dynamics that begin to change the way fans interact with their games and with each other.","With our next Battlefield game, the team at DICE is bringing the intensity of combat to life in new and unexpected ways. Every battle is unique and every mode brings its own challenges, from the way you interact with the environment around you to compelling single-player stories to the next level of large-scale multiplayer that spans across multiple maps and modes. This will be a deep and fully featured shooter and ongoing service that will evolve with major new experiences for our community, beginning right from launch.","Building on the success of Battlefield 1 and taking inspiration from DICE's core DNA, the new game will advance the state of the art for the franchise while still delivering a signature gameplay and Battlefield moments that have captivated and grown our global community.","Later in the fiscal year, we will launch our stunning and ambitious new IP, Anthem. Every dimension of this game will offer something entirely new for a wide audience of players. From a new universe with unique stories that BioWare is creating to the cooperative gameplay to the epic and beautiful environment that constantly evolves around players, Anthem is a fundamentally social experience and will open new ways for fans to join the community and play early, enabling us to shape and refine the game with their input and feedback. We're deeply excited to launch this brand new franchise and equally excited to work with our players to make Anthem a game they can't wait to play and share with their friends for years to come.","EA's mobile portfolio will continue to grow in FY 2019. In recent years, our mobile games have been some of the most engaging new games to enter the marketplace. We are doubling down in FY 2019 with two new titles, Star Wars: Rise to Power and another game we'll reveal at EA PLAY, both unlike anything else in our mobile lineup today. Each game crosses into new genres with social layers designed to bring together global communities.","In competitive gaming, we continue to expand our global esports audience of viewers and players that are experiencing the thrill of high-stakes competition through FIFA and Madden NFL. This year we will grow our competitive footprint with more franchises, events, broadcast content, and sponsorship. We'll hold our first Battlefield competitions in FY 2019, and we're set to bring competition to another new title later this year.","In FY 2019, we will also continue to lead with innovation in our subscriptions and new technologies. We will introduce a new offering to one of our industry-leading subscription programs, delivering unprecedented access and value. Our advanced technology development, including cloud gaming, AI, and Frostbite will enable us to create and deliver next-generation experiences at scale. All of these and more continue to fuel the future of our player network that will connect players across games and devices.","There has never been a more exciting time to be making games. Our industry is dynamic, evolving, and full of new opportunities. With the updates to our organization and structure that we announced last month, EA is positioned for continued growth and leadership. We will push the boundaries of entertainment in a world where change is accelerating. We will strive to be the disruptors shaping the future of play.","Now I'll turn the call over to Blake.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Andrew.","Fiscal 2018 was a record year for Electronic Arts as measured against almost every major financial metric, from revenue to operating income to cash flow. Our success is driven by the way we have changed and continue to change our relationship with players. They want more depth in their favorite games and fresh content that can hold their attention year-round.","As a result, we've gone from one-off interactions at a moment in time to ongoing engagements with consistently changing dynamic worlds. It's a situation analogous to the transition we've seen in the software-as-a-service industry. Consequently, our business already looks very SaaS-like, with live services and subscription making up a greater and greater portion of our revenue. This has made our business much more stable and enabled us to deliver a dependable and growing cash flow to investors.","Now I'll provide our results on a GAAP basis before using our operational metric of net bookings to discuss the dynamics of the business. EA had a record year, with net revenue of $5.2 billion, cost of revenue of $1.3 billion, and operating income of $1.4 billion. These results enabled us to deliver record operating cash flow of almost $1.7 billion. We also returned over $600 million to shareholders through our share repurchase program.","Total net bookings for the year were $5.2 billion, a record. Digital net bookings accounted for 68% of this, up 7 percentage points year on year. Live services net bookings were a record $2.2 billion. Net of hedges, FX was immaterial to net bookings and a slight headwind to underlying profitability.","Now moving on to the details of our fourth quarter, GAAP net revenue was $1.6 billion, $50 million above our guidance and $55 million above the year-ago period. Cost of revenue was $233 million, in line with our guidance of $234 million and up from $202 million last year.","Operating expenses were $596 million, $23 million below our expectations and $12 million less year over year. This drove diluted earnings per share of $1.95, or $0.09 higher than guidance and $0.14 higher than last year. Net cash provided by operating activities was $615 million.","Operating cash flow for the full fiscal year was a record $1.69 billion, beating our guidance of $1.6 billion and up 7% over last year's. Fiscal year 2018 capital expenditures were $107 million, resulting in free cash flow of $1.59 billion. See our earnings slides for further cash flow information. At the end of the quarter, we held $5.33 billion in cash and short-term investments.","During the quarter, we repurchased 1.2 million shares at a cost of $148 million. Today, we announced that we have replaced our old share repurchase program with a new $2.4 billion two-year stock repurchase program. We returned about 38% of our free cash flow to investors in fiscal 2018. This new program aims to return approximately three-quarters of our annual free cash flow. We believe this is an appropriate target based on our current cash needs, our ability to access international cash, and our desire to maintain flexibility for future growth investments.","Now I'd like to turn to the key drivers of our business this quarter. Net bookings were $1.26 billion, above our guidance of $1.23 billion and up from $1.09 billion last year. Digital net bookings delivered $1.05 billion of the $1.26 billion total, up from $885 million last year. This increase was driven by our ongoing success with our event-driven live services.","Looking at each component of this quarter's digital net bookings in turn, live services net bookings were up 31% year on year to $679 million. The increase was driven by Ultimate Team, The Sims 4, and Battlefield 1. By adding features to broaden Ultimate Team's appeal, layering in a packed calendar of events, and building esports on top of that, the team is continuing to grow fun and engaging games that players want to come back to time after time.","Mobile delivered net bookings of $176 million, roughly flat year on year. Strength in Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes and FIFA Mobile was offset by anticipated decline in some of our older games. Full-game PC and console downloads generated $193 million, roughly flat year on year, driven by Star Wars Battlefront II and strength in FIFA 18, offset by the success of Battlefield 1 in the prior year.","The long-term trend towards downloading games continues. And across the portfolio, 39% of our full-game unit sales were digital measured on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 over the last 12 months. This compares to 33% a year ago.","Turning to our expectations for fiscal 2019, we expect sales of current-generation consoles from Microsoft and Sony to continue to be strong, with the installed base growing to 130 million consoles by the end of calendar 2018 from 103 million at the end of calendar 2017. Nintendo Switch is expected to have built an installed base over 30 million by the end of the calendar year. In dollar terms, we expect the PC gaming software market to be approximately flat and the mobile market to grow in the mid-teens in the calendar year.","A note on accounting for fiscal 2019, as mentioned, we have adopted ASC 606 going forward. This does not materially impact our net bookings metric, but it does change our GAAP reporting in several ways. Most significantly, more of our GAAP revenue will be recognized up front, bringing GAAP reported numbers closer to our historical non-GAAP reporting.","Also, as a result of the introduction of ASC 606, we will now be reporting most of our mobile GAAP revenue on a gross, not net, basis. We will continue to report the metrics that enable you to bring back to measures comparable to our historically reported numbers, including mobile net bookings. These and other issues are discussed in more detail in the expanded accounting FAQ we posted on our IR website today.","Primarily as a result of the changes in the U.S. tax law, we are reducing our management tax rate from 21% to 18%. Guidance for fiscal 2019 is for GAAP net revenue of $5.6 billion, cost of revenue of $1.6 billion, and GAAP EPS of $3.55. This outlook was prepared in accordance with the new ASC 606 standard, and includes approximately $300 million of additional mobile revenue resulting from the accounting change to reporting mobile revenue on a gross, not net, basis.","With regard to cash flow, for fiscal 2019 we expect operating cash flow to be approximately $1.825 billion. We anticipate capital expenditures of around $125 million, which would deliver free cash flow of $1.7 billion. CapEx is up year on year as we invest in IT infrastructure for our player network and upgrade facilities, including the Respawn offices in Los Angeles.","Turning to business drivers, we anticipate net bookings for the year to be $5.55 billion, up 7% year on year. This is driven by growth in live services, mobile, and Battlefield. We have disclosed the phasing of net bookings through the year in our slide deck. As a result of the timing of launches, we expect this year to be more back-end loaded than fiscal 2018. We're excited about how both Anthem and Battlefield are shaping up, and we look forward to sharing more with you about them soon.","Our projections assume a benefit from FX to net bookings of over $100 million and an extra $30 million in OpEx relative to last year's rates. Both of these numbers are net of hedges. Our currency assumptions are disclosed in our earnings presentation on our website.","Drilling down further into the key drivers of our full-year net bookings guidance, net bookings for packaged goods and other are forecast to be approximately $1.5 billion, down 9% year on year, driven by the shift to digital. Digital net bookings are expected to contribute $4.1 billion, up 14% year on year.","Further breaking down digital net bookings, we expect live services to grow 10% to 15%, led by Ultimate Team, The Sims 4 expansion packs for PC and console versions of the game, and by growth in our subscription business. The World Cup will have a positive effect on FIFA Ultimate Team engagement, but remember, it's only a four-week event split across Q1 and Q2, and we have modeled that accordingly in our revenue forecast.","With regards to our mobile business, The Sims Mobile launched just before the year end, and we have two games coming in the second half of the year. Thus, we expect our mobile business to grow strongly, on the order of around 15% to 20%, led by The Sims Mobile, FIFA Mobile, Star Wars: Rise to Power, and the unannounced title. Note that this growth forecast is based off of our net bookings metric, not gross revenue or gross bookings.","Net bookings for full-game downloads are expected to grow 10% to 15%, driven by product mix and the ongoing change in consumer behavior. We continue to model an underlying shift of around 5 percentage points a year to digital.","Focusing on Q1, we're expecting GAAP net revenue of $1.1 billion, GAAP cost of revenue of $226 million, and GAAP EPS of $0.64. We expect Q1 net bookings to be $720 million, slightly down year on year.","As discussed on our last call, Q1 fiscal 2018 benefited from the deferral of over $50 million of net booking from Mass Effect: Andromeda and some other one-time events. On a management reporting basis, OpEx will grow year on year, as we continue to invest in our growth drivers. As we look ahead to Q2, we see growth in FIFA and mobile particularly offset by declines in other areas, including a difficult comp against Battlefield 1's performance in fiscal 2018.","We discussed the idea of recurring revenues at our Analyst Day two years ago. At the time, about 75% of our net bookings fit into this category. Since then, we've continued to push our business in that direction, and our guidance implies that 85% of our net bookings in fiscal 2019 are expected to be recurring.","Our drive to greater recurring revenues and cash flow will be fueled by our investments in subscriptions, live services, esports, broadcasting, and cloud gaming. These are all components of our Player Network strategy, and we look forward to updating you on our progress as we continue to pioneer their adoption.","Now I'll turn the call back to Andrew.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Blake.","We're excited to begin another year in our journey at Electronic Arts, at a time where there is so much passion for games around the world. As an industry, we are reaching an amazing nexus, where the creative energy in game-making is intensifying and converging with technology innovation that is unlocking gateways to access, delivery, and sharing of game experiences on a global scale. Games are becoming a truly ubiquitous form of entertainment, we believe the best form of entertainment. And through the evolutions to come, we are seeking to connect more players to amazing games and to each other.","Creativity is the central strand of everything we do at EA. Every experience begins with creating something new and unexpected. That's why you'll see new dynamics in gameplay, new social layers, and new ways to interact with the worlds we create in games like Anthem, our next Battlefield, and our new mobile titles. It's powering new projects in development at Respawn, Motive, EA Vancouver, Criterion, and more. It's behind our EA Originals program and our commitment to support indie developers with amazing ideas. It drives us to continually evolve and update our games through live services because the creative cycle in service of our player never ends.","This isn't just a creative revolution. It's also a revolution of access and choice. New forms of content, new consumption models, and advanced technology investments are accelerating how we will reach more players in a networked world and satisfy their unique needs.","Whether you're a player or a viewer, our competitive gaming experiences for games like FIFA, Madden NFL, and more are becoming must-see programming for fans around the world. With more games and content available to players today, subscription services like EA Access and Origin Access are continuing to build momentum, and we are pioneering new offerings that will expand how players can experience more of the best games.","Looking further ahead, the combination of subscriptions and cloud gaming capabilities combined with our Frostbite engine and digital platform will power the growth of our Player Network that scales across games, devices, and geographies.","At the center of this are our players and our global communities. Everything we do is in service of our players, and we grow stronger in this commitment every day. This year, we will continue to expand how we connect with our players early and often, from thousands of hours with our studio teams and play-testing, to large-scale soft launches and early play opportunities.","One month from now, we'll open up our annual EA PLAY event, in what has become a cultural moment for games and our communities. We'll welcome tens of thousands of players that join us in Hollywood to go hands-on and millions more that join us online around the world to hear more about our games and services, our commitments, and our plans for the future. At every touchpoint with our players, in our games, in our network, in our communities, and beyond, we are constantly working to bring them closer to the games they love.","In FY 2019, we are set to take major steps forward towards our vision of a networked future and our opportunity to connect 1 billion people in play. We look forward to sharing more updates with you in the months to come.","Now Blake and I are here for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And your first question comes from Eric Handler with MKM Partners.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Yes, thank you very much for taking my question. Just looking quickly, Blake, and I don't want to quibble about the size of your buyback, but you've got free cash flow this year of $1.7 billion, and you're going to do a buyback, assuming you do it on an even pace, of $1.2 billion. So you're already sitting on cash of about $5.3 billion or $17 a share, and you'll add another $500 million or so to that. I'm assuming you're going to repatriate a lot, so you'll definitely have a lot more cash flow to play with. I wondered what are your other opportunities or what you're thinking about with your excess cash?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","The call is only 30 minutes gone by and I'm already being criticized for doubling the buyback. It's amazing.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","It's a high-quality problem.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","It's a high-quality problem, and I appreciate the question. It's a good question. Our view is, in today's world, financial flexibility has huge power to it. And we want to return as much to shareholders. We've consistently, over the last four years, grown that buyback fairly dramatically and will continue to do that as we continue to build. But we also want to maintain flexibility should something happen that we either want to deeper invest in or want to purchase something. I'm not signaling that anything's happening. I think you guys know we've been consistent in how we grow the buyback, but also try to be prudent and safe with our capital to prepare for potential opportunities down the road.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","All right, thanks, and then just one follow-up question. The new Star Wars mobile game, will you still be supporting Galaxy of Heroes?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Without a doubt.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Are they complementary games, and can you market between those two games?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, without a doubt. The perfect example of that is if you look at our Sims FreePlay game, which has been around for four or five years, has not gone down at all with the introduction of the new Sims mobile game.","Mobile games have \u2013 there are so many audience members out there. There are so many opportunities, and game styles are very different. The game style between the new Star Wars game and Galaxy of Heroes is going to be very, very different, different style audience. And we think both will remain extremely successful for a long period of time.","Eric O. Handler - MKM Partners LLC","Thank you very much, I appreciate it.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Great. Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Drew Crum with Stifel Nicolaus.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. Blake, I just want to ask about the guidance, net bookings growth of mid-single digits and low double-digit non-GAAP earnings growth. Can you talk about the lack of leverage there? Last time you guys grew top line at a comparable rate, you achieved 25% earnings growth. That was back in fiscal 2016. Your book tax rate is 300 basis points lower, and you're buying back more stock, which I would assume is accretive. So I just want to understand the puts and takes behind the earnings growth that you're forecasting.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Let me hit just real quick on the buyback. We don't build the buyback into our forecast because we don't like to forecast what stock price is going to be. But assuming that the buyback \u2013 assuming the stock price is where it is today, you'd probably see $0.04 to $0.05 of earnings accretion going forward. You'd probably see share count down to around 308 million by year end, in other words, if you want to do the math that way.","I'd say the other issue is back in fiscal 2016 we were not investing as much in the future. I think we were still coming through the tail end of the transformation. We are now investing much more heavily in the future, and you see that in our OpEx growth. And that's trimmed some of the earnings growth power, at least in our guidance. Remember, this is guidance, not actual results. And I think if you went back a couple of years, you'd see the same pattern as we've given annual guidance.","But I do think what you heard from Andrew earlier is continued investment in both new IP as well as way people will play games in the future and the way games will be delivered in the future. Investing in our network, investing in subscriptions, investing in cloud gaming, you're going to continue to hear and see those investments from us over time because we believe that's the way this business will be transformed. But at the same time, we're going to always look to get earnings leverage, and we think that that model is pretty consistent with how it's been in the past.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, one more for me. Just any update on the release window for Battlefield? Historically, you guys have targeted October. It looks like a very crowded window this year. Any opportunity to push that out later in the December quarter?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes, you'll hear more about E3 timeframe on Battlefield. You'll hear quite a bit coming up about the game and the plans for it. We're very excited. But you should assume \u2013 back to your guidance question, you should assume that we built in the guidance some conservatism and caution because we know it's going to be a crowded third quarter for us, fourth quarter calendar year. But the benefit that we have \u2013 I think that we've always had is we have a very strong Battlefield community, and we think they're going to be extremely excited about this new Battlefield game. And we've been able to compete against others like Call of Duty in that same timeframe in the past, and we will work hard to try to do that going forward. But more to come on exact timing and a lot more about the game, which is pretty exciting.","Drew Crum - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, thanks, guys.","Operator","And your next question comes from Chris Merwin with Goldman Sachs.","Christopher Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, great. Thank you. I just have a couple. First for Blake, even with the backdrop of Fortnite, yet another very strong quarter on live service, up about 30% year on year. Was it FIFA Ultimate Team and competitive gaming that were the main driving force behind that, or was there anything else that you would call out like Star Wars and MTX, which I think you brought back late in the quarter?","And then just a second question for Andrew, there have been some reports in the press about a couple countries labeling loot boxes as illegal gambling and going for the removal from games. I know in FIFA, you've made some efforts to ensure that in-game currency can't be redeemed for real currency in any sort of illicit market. So maybe can you update us on where talks stand with regulators on this topic and how we should think about any changes to the Ultimate Team mechanic in the affected countries? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So on the live service piece, it was Ultimate Team across FIFA, Madden, and hockey and to a smaller extent NBA, but really Ultimate Team number one driver. Sims 4, number two driver, and that's been consistent through the year. It's been extremely strong as we continue to add extra content to that game. And Battlefield 1, we're at the tail end of extra content along Battlefield 1. Battlefront was not a major addition since, as you mentioned, MTX came in very late in the quarter.","But the other thing to remember is the breadth of our extra content, subscription, advertising, all the other components continue to add up and help us build that base that we've been able to build, now over $2.2 billion, is what's so great about that live service business because it continues to maintain a fairly large consistency year-over year. I'll let Andrew hit the loot box piece now.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes and good question and certainly timely. As you might imagine, we're working with all the industry associations globally and with regulators in various jurisdictions and territories, many of whom we've been working with for some time and have evaluated and established that programs like FIFA Ultimate Team are not gambling. And we don't believe that FIFA Ultimate Team \u2013 all loot boxes are gambling.","Firstly, players always receive a specified number of items in each FUT pack. And secondly, we don't provide or authorize any way to cash out or sell items in virtual currency for real-world money. And there's no way we can make value assign to FUT items in game currency. And while we forbid the transfer of items of in-the-game currency outside, we also actively seek to eliminate that where it's going on in an illegal environment, and we work with regulators in various jurisdictions to achieve that.","And so net-net, we're going to continue to push forward. We're always thinking about our players. We're always thinking about how to deliver these types of experiences in a transparent, fun, fair, and balanced way for our players. And we'll communicate with regulators around the world on it.","Christopher Merwin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay, thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Colin Sebastian with Robert W. Baird.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Good afternoon and nice quarter again. First off for me, without creating a separate SKU for World Cup this time around, I wonder if you could talk in a little more detail about the monetization strategy within the core game.","And then secondly, looking at the phasing of the year in terms of revenues, it looks like the fourth quarter is expected to be similar to this past year, and I wonder what that means in terms of your expectations for Anthem, given that you also have the Battlefield content in Q4 as well. Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I'll take the first and I'll let Blake take the second one. As it relates to FIFA, what we've come to understand over the years, and many of you might remember, I worked on this franchise for a long time and built both FIFA and World Cup games. And as each year passed and digital became a more prevalent way for our players to access games and connect with each other through games, liquidity in the player base became really, really important. And players weren't wanting to opt out of one experience to play another soccer experience. And so part of why we brought the two experiences together in our core FIFA experience and what is the biggest sporting event in the world in the World Cup is really deliver on the needs and requests and motivations of our players to stay connected in a global soccer community.","And as we've announced, we're releasing all of the content, all the teams, and things around the World Cup to allow people to play offline and online. But you should expect that for all of our players in FIFA Ultimate Team, they'll be very, very specific and interesting and entertaining and enjoying and engaging live service events in and around the World Cup.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So on the guidance piece, a couple things I think you'll note. We didn't use unit sales metrics for any of our titles. And as you've heard in the past, we're trying to move away from that. This is an example of how our business model has changed. Unit sales are much less indicative of long-term franchise health due to the significant power of our event-driven live services now.","The live services component is really the bedrock of our business. And while units sold to grow that are important, they become misleading in many ways to the Street. And so we'll stay away from unit predictions for any titles going forward unless there's some unique reason for it.","In the case of Anthem, the real issue is, the game will be shipped in the last quarter of the year and in the last month of that quarter, meaning we'll probably have limited restocking of the title, even if it's extremely successful. Since it is new IP, we're being conservative in how we're thinking about it. We're very excited about the game. It's extremely unique, and I think players are going to really enjoy playing it, but we're careful not to put too large of a forecast in there. And clearly, it will impact this year as well as next year as we not only continue to sell more into the next year but start rolling out the live services associated with that game.","Colin Alan Sebastian - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Eric Sheridan with UBS.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question, maybe two if I can. Andrew, you talked a lot about extending gameplay as you look out for the future of gaming. I wanted to know if you can give us your perspective on the title mix and what you see as some of the key titles, especially with respect to mobile, where you could extend gameplay beyond console and PC into a mobile-first world and how you think about the pace and cadence of that going forward.","And then following up on I think it was Drew's question from before for Blake, anything you want to call out in terms of the pace or cadence of R&D and marketing as we go through the year quarter by quarter given the way that you laid out revenue and bookings, just so maybe we have some guideposts to think about margin evolution as we go through the year? Thanks, guys.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So let me grab the first one. At its very core, you've heard us talk a lot about subscription plus cloud gaming and the opportunity for those two things to fundamentally disrupt the way people access and enjoy games like nothing before, much in the same way as it's disrupted enjoyment and engagement in movies and music.","And so we've talked about a three to five-year time horizon. We believe that cloud gaming is going to make a meaningful contribution to the way players engage with games. And of course, what that does mean is it really doesn't matter what device you're accessing it by. The experience that you have is governed by the size of the screen and the amount of time you have to play","And so everything we're building right now, we are thinking about a world where we will not be bound by device. We will not be bound by local compute or memory, but much of these experiences will exist in the cloud, and you'll access them based on whatever device you have access to at the time.","And we think about that at a core technology level. We think about that at a game design level. We also think about that as how we think \u2013 how we interact with our players and how they interact with the games. And you should expect to see us between now and that time start to push more of our experiences, particularly ones with really large global communities, to be able to interact with experiences across devices. And you've already seen this from us with FIFA and the ability to access Ultimate Team and do a great deal of interactions with Ultimate Team through FUT mobile and on PC and on your console experience. And we look forward to driving more of that in the future.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","So on the second question, you should assume that we'll see some phasing of R&D over the year as we start to build out our games \u2013 new games. We have better leverage, obviously, as revenue grows in the third and fourth quarter on that number, but you should see \u2013 in real terms, you'd see some slow growth of that during the year. We do tend to use more part-time employees during the third quarter as we're leading into large layout or large new titles. You can see that in the past P&Ls in terms of the phasing.","G&A is pretty consistent year on year. And marketing, as you know, we're targeting around 12%. And so that's really dependent on titles and marketing that we're doing ahead of a quarter around a title. But obviously, our bigger quarters, you're going to see larger marketing spend both at the tail end of the second quarter and all through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter.","Eric J. Sheridan - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from Tim O'Shea with Jefferies.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Yes, hi, so thank you for taking my question. So Andrew just talked about the future of play and how the industry will evolve over the next few years, and Blake spoke about how the revenue stream is already looking more SaaS-like. So my question is, as we start to think about cloud gaming, what does the business model look like? Is it subscription, ads, full price? Is it microtransactions or DLC? And with this cloud gaming offering, is that a standalone EA offering, or would you offer your games on a third-party platform, maybe something analogous to the current console paradigm? I just want to hear your thoughts as you think about how this industry is evolving. Thank you.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes, great question. It's something that we've given a lot of thought to and plan towards. And again, if we look at other entertainment industries and other SaaS-like industries for guidance, what we discover is that multiple business models coexist. And if I think about how I consume movies right now, I have a Comcast subscription. I have a Netflix subscription. I buy things on iTunes that I watch on a plane, and I also watch a lot of free content through YouTube and other online mediums.","But what we're also discovering is that even while those multiple business models exist, and our ideal here is to capture engagement and offer access through any business model on any device for all of our players in a growing global community, what we're seeing is a real move toward subscription as the best way to access content and the most frictionless way to access content and a way to build a relationship with a platform play who offers that collection of content wrapped in services.","And so our expectation is while we will continue to offer the access to content through any and all business models that our players tell us they want to utilize, we expect that consumers, much the way they have in other industries, will move more towards subscription. And that will become a far more meaningful part of our business and maybe even the majority of our business in the years to come.","And as we think about that, we're in a unique position to offer subscription as we're doing today by virtue of the breadth and depth of our content and our ability to get to a large global player base of diverse cohorts, diverse backgrounds and diverse geographies.","We also understand and appreciate, however, that even with the size of the portfolio we have, there are other elements of gameplay that will be important to a broader subscriber base as we continue to grow. And what you're seeing from us now with what we're doing with our Originals program is bringing new content in. What you're seeing from us with signing third parties is bringing new and interesting and different content in. You might imagine that front-line content will become an important part of that in the future and that we might work collaboratively with other content creators and developers and publishers to ensure we have a truly robust subscription offering.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And a streaming approach allows \u2013 while that technology still is evolving and we know that it could be two to four years away, it allows for the concept that you could play games on many different devices versus on one device typically found in your home.","And we may partner with people as well as work on our own technology to help deliver that. And as Andrew said, we think that can be delivered in many different ways. And still many years from now we'll have gaming across consoles, PCs, possibly streaming-enabled TVs, or other devices as well as mobile devices. And that's the exciting part about the business. We think that continues to help grow the market. It doesn't bifurcate the market in a negative way.","Timothy O'Shea - Jefferies LLC","Thanks so much and congrats on the quarter.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Your next question comes from Evan Wingren with KeyBanc.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks. Blake, just looking at the guidance, if I did my math right, you're actually implying that units are down year on year within the initial guidance. So I'm just trying to understand the puts and takes there, given you have a favorable comp, one would think with Battlefield and Anthem obviously coming into the fray.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I'm not quite sure how you're doing the math to get to the units being down, but maybe you can give me the details on that offline. But we're saying \u2013 a couple things to note is you've got a whole bunch of pieces in the puzzle. That's why I don't know if you can do the math.","Live service growth, remember, subscription growth is part of live services growth. And so in a subscription world, you actually may have or will have less units sold, but you'll have more consistent revenue over time. And we're expecting a few inflection points in our subscription programs this next year, which should help drive more growth.","So that's why I come back to my statement earlier that said we're moving away from discussing units because it's either live service revenue or subscription revenue that you're going to tend to see growing over time, which neither of those will show up as units in any way.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then just on Battlefield this year, could you maybe just give us a sense as to how your multiplayer approach for this game might differ from historical Battlefield games?","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Again, we've got lots to talk about in the weeks and months to come, and you should imagine that we will be talking at great length about it. The DICE team has a core DNA, maybe the strongest in the industry, around multiplayer, and more importantly innovation in multiplayer. They were the first team to get to 64-player multiplayer. They were the first team to get to destruction in multiplayer.","And so you should imagine that, as we talked about in the prepared notes, all the things that a Battlefield fan would expect out of a multiplayer game from DICE in the Battlefield universe will be there, while additional innovations in how we're thinking about the future of multiplayer in first-person shooters will also be there, both at launch and over time as part of a live service.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Watch closely in the hint.","Evan Wingren - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","We certainly will be, thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","More things to come.","Operator","And your next question comes from Ray Stochel from Consumer Edge Research.","Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","Great, thanks for taking my question. In thinking about the potential of your future subscription strategies, what percentage of customers repurchase titles like FIFA or Madden every year versus new customers coming in to purchase the title? And then similarly, how many people could be considered lapsed users that could come back in at a different price point or monetization strategy? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I don't have the exact numbers, but quite a few. Since Ultimate Team has gained scale, we're north of 70% with titles like FIFA and Madden. Pre-Ultimate Team, this goes back some time, it was oftentimes less than 50% bought every year. So you're seeing a much more consistent buying pattern because people want to reengage in Ultimate Team. People are \u2013 70-plus percent of the buyers are engaging in Ultimate Team, so you would expect to see that type of pattern.","We do, though, spend a lot of time on how do we bring lapsed players back in and how do we maintain a consistent world with those players. And I think in that world, subscription will only help because they'll constantly be getting upgraded over time with their versions of the game. And I think that keeps people engaged, and most importantly keeps them involved in the live service components, which makes the game more fun for everybody.","Raymond L. Stochel - Consumer Edge Research LLC","That's great, thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brandon Ross from BTIG.","Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC","Thanks for taking the question. More on subscription, what do you think the timeline is for you to immediately add your own front-line releases such as a FIFA or a Battlefield or an Anthem to Access and Origin? And when you speak about there being an inflection point in subscription, are you alluding to that happening this year potentially?","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","That's a good question. Go ahead, sorry.","Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC","I was going to ask about capital allocation afterwards.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Okay, so I'm going to hit the first one and then you can ask it. We don't have anything to announce today, but I'd just say assume that our subscription strategy, as Andrew said, will be evolving quickly. I think that's this year and next year you start to see new things in that subscription program, be it new third-party titles, potentially at some point front-line titles. But clearly we'll continue to push that. We believe the platform can do all those things. We also want to add more social layers into the platform and more tools, and you'll continue to see that evolution going on as well through the Origin platform.","So more to come, we're pretty excited. Don't take my inflection point comment too literally, but you should see continued growth and you'll probably see some spikes in growth as we add new and exciting things to the service. You've got a capital allocation...","Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC","Yeah, on capital allocation, a couple things. I think you've been considering a dividend. Can you walk us through why you decided against that? And you mentioned leaving capital for potential opportunities. What are the ideal M&A opportunities for your organization at this point? Is it mobile or supplementing with studios and genres where you're weaker or on the technology side? Thanks.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","I'll hit that first. It's all three of those things. As Andrew mentioned, running a broad subscription service requires great content. And so we're always looking for great content and really great studios that can build that content. We partnered with Respawn for some time to get to know them. We believe they're a studio that can build not just the great games they're building today, but great games for a long time to come. And so it's a great studio and great partners that we can bring to the table in both mobile and console and PC, but also technology that will help us either in subscriptions or streaming, and you'll probably see some of that stuff to come.","Most of it is probably more small to midsized than large just because there's not that many large companies out there, but we'll look at everything, and we want to maintain that flexibility. And that was really the primary reason for not doing a dividend is that we felt if we started a dividend it would be much harder to stop it if there was some reason to flex up to do something larger. And that's the reason we decided to stay with the buyback. We feel it's the most efficient way to do it and it gives you full flexibility going forward.","Brandon Ross - BTIG LLC","Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Great, thanks, next question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America.","Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you, a couple questions. First, your live services up 31% in what could be a big Fortnite quarter. How did you factor in that competition and then the holiday competition in your guidance?","And then the second thing, Overwatch League is up and running, NBA starting this month. What have you learned from esports? And would you say you're more optimistic on the opportunity or about the same? Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Yes, so let me do the Fortnite piece, and then I'll let Andrew talk about esports. We welcome innovation in the industry. That's what makes this business so exciting and fun to operate in. If you look back over the 20 or 30 years, the innovation that one game team has done has been going through the whole industry. It's fantastic, and we welcome innovators like Fortnite or PUBG that really help push everyone's thinking. And we feel that that's great for the business as a whole.","We don't feel like any one player or any one game, from FIFA to Madden to Battlefield, is going to capture that 100% of the marketplace. It just doesn't happen that way. And so we haven't seen a giant impact, but it's guessing around what our forecast was. We try to be conservative. We try to anticipate as we do with either new titles coming out or existing titles or even things we don't know about. But we do think in the case of Fortnite, it's helped grow the whole marketplace. And in particular, it's bringing younger people into the marketplace and younger people into first-person shooters. And I think that's good for the long-run health of that category for all of us in the industry, not just one player.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","And in terms of esports, we talked about this a little bit last quarter. We saw tremendous engagement in both our Madden league and our FIFA league up significantly year over year and breaking records in both broadcast television and on digital channels.","We're going to continue to double down there. We've got an entire competitive gaming group that are pushing to grow that and really think about the ongoing evolution. We're excited and energized by the level of inbound queries and questions and requests for involvement that we've had. Again, we have the world's biggest game and this country's biggest game in soccer and American football, and there are a lot of people that really want to engage with that in order to get access to the audience that's really playing and watching our esports events there.","Also in the prepared remarks, we talked about ongoing investment in Battlefield. Again, Battlefield has multiplayer and competition core to its DNA. And we're excited about what the DICE team is doing and innovating as it relates to competitive play in and around Battlefield. And we've got another one that we're launching later this year too that we've yet to announce.","So I think the macro message you're hearing from us is that we always believe this would grow engagement and grow revenue. It's happening much quicker than we anticipated, and we're doubling down to make sure that we maintain that momentum and continue to grow engagement both from players, viewers, and sponsors and broadcasters in and around our events.","Justin Post - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Thanks, Justin, one more question?","Operator","Your last question comes from Stephen Ju with Credit Suisse.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks. Andrew, I think given what I think you and Blake have alluded to in the past with the expected timeline for the ramp of FIFA mobile and how long it took Madden mobile to ramp, I was a little bit surprised to see Tencent recently announce the game for China. So I'm wondering if it's a different or the same version of the game and how your thinking may have evolved in terms of catching up to Madden mobile monetization.","And also, I think you called out the launch of FIFA Online 4 with Nexon and Tencent in your prepared remarks. Can you provide us with an update on your efforts to I guess migrate the users from FIFA Online 3 to 4? Thanks.","Andrew P. Wilson - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Wow, there were a lot of questions there. So first is FIFA in the West, you heard in the prepared remarks, continues to grow and certainly contributed to the growth in our FIFA business this year, even in the face of some of our older titles in decline, as they would have expected to be at this timeline. We're excited about what that team is doing and expect that that will continue to do very well and grow this year. Particularly in a World Cup year, you should imagine that there will be a series of events and opportunities for mobile players to engage in that.","We also have a game in China that we're doing with Tencent in and around FIFA Online 4 that is a Chinese-specific execution, and we're excited about that. And then we are actively transitioning across to FIFA Online 4 in both Korea and China. And that is going as well as we planned, and it's certainly getting the full support of Nexon in Korea and six-star marketing support in China. And so all in all, we're very, very happy with our performance in mobile and free-to-play in Korea and China and in the West.","Stephen Ju - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Blake J. Jorgensen - Electronic Arts, Inc.","Great. With that, we'll call it and see everyone, if not at E3, in the near future. Thanks very much for your time today.","Operator","Thank you.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I will turn the meeting over to Mr. Rob Sison, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Rob Sison","Thank you. Welcome to EA's Fiscal 2012 Third Quarter Earnings Call. With me on the call today is John Riccitiello, our CEO; Eric Brown, CFO; Frank Gibeau, President of Labels; and Peter Moore, our COO will be joining us for the Q&A portion of the call. Please note that our SEC filings and our earnings release are available at ir.ea.com. In addition, we have posted earnings slides to accompany our prepared remarks. Lastly, after the call, we will post our prepared remarks, an audio replay of this call and a transcript.","This presentation and our comments include forward-looking statements regarding future events and future financial performance of the company. Actual events and results may differ materially from our expectations. We refer you to our most recent Form 10-Q for a discussion of risks that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed today. Electronic Arts makes these statements as of February 1, 2012, and disclaims any duty to update them.","Throughout this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. Our earnings release and the earnings slides provide a reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP measures. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered in isolation from, as a substitute for, or superior to our GAAP results.","We encourage investors to consider all measures before making an investment decision. All comparisons made in the course of this call are against the same period in the prior year unless otherwise stated. ","Now I'll turn the call over to John Riccitiello. John?","John S. Riccitiello","Thanks, Rob. We are pleased to report a strong third quarter on both the top and bottom line. Our results reflect a great performance by Battlefield 3, Star Wars: The Old Republic, our entire EA SPORTS lineup, especially FIFA and a nice boost from our digital games and services.","This was the kind of quarter a CEO loves to report. It is one which generated our highest operating cash flow in 31 quarters and reaffirms our strategy of creating big hits, digital revenue streams that extend the revenue, profitability and consumer engagement in our brands. We gained share in packaged goods in both North America and Europe on the strength of 2 titles, each of which sold more than 10 million units, Battlefield 3 and FIFA 12. We were the #1 publisher on high-definition systems worldwide for all of calendar year 2011.","We also hit an important milestone at the end of the calendar year. We delivered more than $1 billion in non-GAAP digital revenue on a trailing 12-month basis. ","At the end of the quarter, we launched Star Wars: The Old Republic, recording strong initial results with this very important digital service. 2 million people have purchased the game from our retail partners and via direct digital downloads on Origin. This great launch makes Star Wars: The Old Republic the fastest-growing subscription MMO in history. We're incredibly pleased to see this great game from BioWare off to a very strong start. Both Frank and Eric will share further details in their prepared comments.","In terms of guidance, the midpoint of our fiscal year range remains unchanged from the raised guidance on our last call. This implies a more conservative outlook for Q4. Eric will provide detailed guidance in his comments. Our revised Q4 outlook is based on 3 factors. ","First, retail demand for Star Wars: The Old Republic was strong, and we shipped units right at the end of December that we had anticipated shipping in early January. Second, we are moving an important social game launch from Q4 F'12 to Q1 F'13, and with it the associated profit. We believe this move will enable us to launch a more highly polished and ultimately more successful title in early FY '13. And third, we are concerned with the financial condition of one of our major European retail partners, which could lead to both increased bad debt and lost sales.","None of these issues are material or consequential for any periodic beyond fiscal '12, but taken together, these may have an impact of as much as $0.15 EPS in Q4. All in, we've delivered another strong quarter and expect to finish the fiscal year consistent with our original and our recently raised guidance.","Next, I want to give you a progress report on our 3 strategic initiatives: brands, platform and talent. ","Brands. EA has a powerful advantage with our more than a dozen globally recognized brands. Our mission now is to transform each of these powerhouse brands into year-round businesses, with steady flow of downloadable content, extensions on new platforms like mobile and social. More content for our consumers, more revenue and better margins for our investors.","Leading the way were 2 brands that sold more than 10 million copies each in FIFA and Battlefield. Each of these global brands is succeeding on multiple platforms, ranging from PC to social and console to mobile from a packaged goods and purely digital channels and business models. This is the template for all of our major brands.","Platform. The next priority is to build a platform for games and services that allows the consumer to connect their experiences across multiple devices and formats. Progress in several projects reflects success on this strategic initiative. Nucleus registrations, which are essentially a database of our consumers, were given a big boost by the launch of Battlefield 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic. Nucleus registrations now total 168 million, up 63% year-over-year.","Another big beneficiary of the Battlefield and Star Wars launches is Origin, our direct-to-consumer digital service, which serves as a window into our own platform. Origin has been busy setting and breaking its own records. We have surpassed $100 million of non-GAAP revenue since our launch in June of this year. The client is now installed on more than 9.3 million desktops, and within the quarter, Origin recorded a milestone, over 1 million daily unique users. In Q3, they established breakthrough partnerships with Warner Bros. Interactive, THQ and Capcom. Last month, we added Trion, Robot Entertainment and 9 other new partners.","Talent. When I say talent, I mean that we're stretching our key executive talent to work across platforms in broader experience and ultimately be more engaged in more interesting work than can be found with our competition. We're investing to grow our capabilities in core engineering and in digital skill sets.  In general, these goals describe what we're doing inside our studios engineering and marketing teams.","This past quarter, these changes reached to the very top of our organization. In October, we hired Rajat Taneja as EA's Chief Technical Officer and asked him -- tasked him with completing the fundamental infrastructure for our online platform. In January, Playfish co-founder Kristian Segerstrale took on a new role as our EVP of Digital, assigned to improve our digital marketing, consumer acquisition and cross promotion of our products and services. These 2 new positions round out an executive team of some of the most tested and accomplished leaders in the industry, including our Chief Operating Officer, Peter Moore; and Label President, Frank Gibeau. ","Within Frank's organization are 5 creative leaders, each of whom run a standalone P&L, which is bigger and more efficient than most of the competitors in the industry today. They include Lucy Bradshaw at Maxis, Dave Roberts at PopCap, Ray Muzyka at BioWare, Patrick Sutherland at EA Games and Andrew Wilson heading up EA SPORTS.  That's an executive team that balances EA veterans with Internet entrepreneurs.","Our talent strategy provides better career development for our employees, better structure for our brands and better management for the fastest-growing part of our business.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Eric.","Eric F. Brown","Thank you, John. Starting with a review of Q3. EA performance in Q3 exceeded the non-GAAP revenue and EPS guidance that we provided on the Q2 earnings call. ","Total Q3 GAAP revenue was $1.061 billion, relatively flat compared to the same period last year. GAAP loss per share was $0.62, a 36% improvement versus the loss per share last year. Total Q3 non-GAAP revenue was $1.651 billion, growing 17% versus last year. This is slightly better than the top end of our guidance range and was driven by the successful launches of Battlefield 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic and the continued success of FIFA 12. The strong performance of Battlefield 3 more than offset some weakness on Need for Speed.","Q3 digital non-GAAP revenue increased 79% year-over-year to $377 million, and on a trailing 12-month basis, our digital revenue exceeded $1 billion. ","DLC and free-to-play micro-transaction content was $123 million in Q3, up 86% versus last year, primarily due to the continued digital success of FIFA. Specifically, FIFA 12 generated almost $50 million of non-GAAP digital revenue for Q3, 4x what FIFA 11 did during the same period last year. Additionally, the inclusion of The Sims Social and PopCap also contributed to our digital growth.","PopCap had a strong finish for the calendar year. PopCap outpaced the overall market by growing revenue more than 30% on a standalone basis this year, excluding the onetime effects of the acquisition.","Mobile and other handheld digital revenue was $84 million, up 25% versus last year. This quarter, we saw a continued growth in our smartphone and tablet-related sales and growth in our Asia mobile business, offset by the decline in standard feature phone revenue. This quarter, the revenue contributions from smartphones and standard feature phones were about equal, with smartphone revenue growing more than 70% year-over-year.","Revenue from subscriptions, advertising and other was $67 million, up 14% year-over-year. ","Full game downloads were $103 million, up 442% year-over-year, driven by downloads from EA's new digital direct service, Origin. Specific titles that drove most of the increase were Battlefield 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic.","Our Star Wars launch was more successful than we anticipated. During the course of December, server performance and stability exceeded our expectations, allowing us to make more product available to our consumers at launch and through the end of the December quarter. To date, we have sold through more than 2 million units. Our sell-through success to date is not as apparent to the public because nearly 40% of the December sell-through went through Origin, which is not recorded by third-party data services. This was achieved with a level of Q3 marketing well below that of a AAA holiday quarter launch.","In summary, relative to our previous non-GAAP guidance, revenue was $51 million above the midpoint, gross profit margin of 67.4% was slightly better than guidance and operating expenses came in below our estimate. It was another good quarter overall.","Turning to cash. Net cash provided by operating activities this quarter was $475 million versus $349 million a year ago. This marks the highest level of quarterly operating cash flow in 31 quarters. A significant level of operating cash flow is due to the solid revenue results and our continued efforts to become more efficient, evidenced by our inventory turns increasing to 19x on a trailing 12-month basis and our inventory balance dropping by more than 30% year-over-year.","The trailing 12-month operating cash flow was $243 million. EA has approximately $5.39 per share in cash, short-term investments and marketable securities. Roughly 45% of our cash and short-term investments are onshore. ","During the quarter, EA repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $41 million. $312 million remains authorized for the repurchase program over the next 5 months.","Sector performance. Overall, the Worldwide Interactive Entertainment segment with packaged plus digital combined was up mid-single digits in the December quarter. Digital grew more than 20% year-over-year, offset by a 4% decline in packaged goods. ","For calendar year 2011, the Western world packaged goods market was down 8%, comprised of high-definition platforms being up 2%, offset by a 22% decline in standard definition platforms.","For calendar year 2011, EA was the #1 publisher in the Western world, with 20% share in Europe, 17% share in North America and 18% share overall in the Western world, up 2 points compared to calendar year 2010. ","Moving now to Q4 guidance. We are providing non-GAAP EPS guidance of $0.10 to $0.20. This is lower than last quarter's implied Q4 guidance midpoint due to the following: first, we previously envisioned having a more limited Star Wars launch through December. However, during the critical launch period, the servers stood up to the challenge, and we were able to withstand the heavy utilization as we announced in our December 26 momentum release. This gave us the confidence to make additional product available to our consumers, more than we had initially planned, and a portion of expected Q4 sales were realized in Q3. ","Secondly, a key social game has been delayed and is now targeted to launch after the close of the fiscal '12 year. Although this detracts from our Q4 earnings, it helps shore up our title slate for our fiscal year 2013 social games. ","Third, we are focused on some isolated European retailer issues that have recently been announced. A negative outcome could adversely impact our Q4 results. ","And fourth, based on the success today of the Star Wars: The Old Republic, we have decided to increase our marketing spend in Q4 to take advantage of this momentum.","Breaking down the Q4 non-GAAP revenue guidance. Non-GAAP digital revenue is expected to be approximately $400 million to $425 million, while non-GAAP revenue from EA published titles is estimated to be between $500 million to $525 million. The balance is approximately $25 million of expected distribution revenue. ","Q4 GAAP revenue and EPS. Our Q4 GAAP net revenue guidance is approximately $1.425 billion to $1.475 billion. Our Q4 GAAP EPS guidance now ranges from $1.45 to $1.59 diluted earnings per share. GAAP tax is expected to be a benefit of approximately $15 million.","Gross profit margins. We expect Q4 non-GAAP gross profit margins between 67% and 66%, and we expect GAAP gross profit margins of approximately 77%.","Operating expenses. We expect Q4 non-GAAP operating expenses to be at least $560 million. GAAP operating expenses are expected to be at least $610 million. Our Q4 non-GAAP EPS guidance range includes approximately $3 million of expense in the other income expense line, a full year non-GAAP tax rate of 28% and an estimated 338 million diluted shares.","Cash flow. We expect fiscal '12 operating cash flow to be about $250 million, consistent with the lower end of our previous guidance. We expect fiscal 2012 capital spending of approximately $140 million.","Foreign exchange. Our guidance assumes the following foreign exchange rates for the fiscal year: USD $1.30 to the euro, USD $0.98 to the Canadian dollar and USD $1.55 to the British pound. The strength in the U.S. dollar since our October call had a negligible impact on second half non-GAAP EPS versus our prior foreign exchange rate assumptions.","Turning to fiscal 2013 guidance. We will provide detailed guidance for fiscal 2013 in our next earnings call, but at this juncture, we can share the following considerations: In fiscal 2013, we're estimating double-digit percentage growth for both non-GAAP EPS and revenue. In fiscal 2012, we expect our non-GAAP digital revenue to be approximately $1.2 billion, and we expect to see accelerated growth in fiscal 2013. As we continue our strategy of generating more revenue with fewer titles, we expect to launch less than 20 packaged goods titles in fiscal 2013. Star Wars: The Old Republic is going to be an important factor to next year's results, and there could be a wide range of outcomes. We will be able to provide more informed total company guidance since we have better insight on the trajectory of Star Wars.  And finally for Q1 fiscal '13, given the light packaged goods title slate, we expect a non-GAAP EPS loss of about the same level as Q1 last year. ","And lastly, our assumptions on the sector for calendar 2012 are similar to current trends, at the mid to high single-digit growth overall, comprised of greater than 20% growth in digital, continued low single-digit growth in high-definition consoles and PC, offset by a mid-teen percentage decline in standard definition. ","Now I'll turn the call over to Frank Gibeau.","Frank D. Gibeau","Thanks, Eric. Today, I'm going to take you through some highlights from our biggest games in Q3, including some perspective on the launch and consumer experience with Star Wars: The Old Republic. I'll also take you through some of the games that we intend to release this quarter to complete our fiscal year.","I'll begin with Battlefield 3 and FIFA 12, 2 games that prove that making bigger hits out of fewer titles is a winning strategy. ","With Battlefield 3, our DICE Studio in Stockholm nailed every objective we set, including our goal of gaining share in first-person shooters. In Q3 last year, EA held just 13% of the lucrative Western FPS market. This year, we captured an additional 11 points and rose to a 24% segment share, a big leap in our plan to retake leadership in FPS.","Battlefield 3 sold through more than 11 million units and kept consumers playing and paying with premium downloadable content with the Back to Karkand expansion pack. Battlefield 3 is a global blockbuster with an ambitious plan for more content and services in the months ahead.","Next is FIFA 12, a game from EA SPORTS studio in Burnaby, British Columbia, which also broke through the 10 million unit mark. Innovation that makes this franchise so unique is FIFA Ultimate Team, a digital game extension that creates a massive online community where football fans can build, manage and compete with their Ultimate Team. In just 3 months, FIFA Ultimate Team generated $39 million in micro-transactions. That's 69% more than we generated in the same period last year.","Our third global blockbuster in the quarter was Star Wars: The Old Republic. You've heard all the superlatives, the only thing I can add is BioWare Austin has delivered a game that millions of people are going to be playing for a very long time. ","Let me offer some metrics on purchase and subscription that will help you understand this business. As John stated, we have sold through 2 million units of the game since December. We currently have a little over 1.7 million active subscribers. The rest have either not started playing yet or have opted out. This is an outstanding start for an MMO, and the metrics on engagement suggests players are loving the game. Unique log-ins are averaging about 1 million per day, and their average playtime is approximately 4 hours per day. ","And throughout the launch, server performance and stability exceeded our expectations, allowing us to accelerate the introduction of new players in December. Outside of scheduled maintenance, our servers have been up and running 99.5% of the time, which is a big win in and of itself. Every major MMO launch has had significant service issues until now. Star Wars: The Old Republic broke that cycle, leading PC Gamer to write, \"BioWare hit a homerun with server stability.\" ","I want to take a second to correct the reports, which speculated that a lack of congestion was a sign of slow participation. Shortly after launch, we doubled the efficiency of each server, allowing us to handle twice as many players and remove the waiting lines. The lack of congestion is a function of great engineering.","In the next phase, our goal is to grow the number of subscribers with frequent releases of content that make the game even more exciting. With this in mind, BioWare has just released an extensive game update that provided additional higher-level group missions and new game features to keep players engaged. We plan on delivering another major update even larger than the first in March.","In summary, we nailed the launch. Adoption and daily usage among core MMO users are trending very favorably. More people are buying the game and subscribing. More content is on the way. Going forward, we have an ambitious plan to reach the broader market, the millions of Star Wars fans all over the world. You'll be seeing that very soon.","Next, I'm going to highlight some of the big titles planned for the rest of this, our fourth quarter. On February 28, EA SPORTS will launch SSX, a reinvention of one of the great arcade classics of all time. Also from EA SPORTS in March is FIFA Street, a great pick-up-and-play action game built on the FIFA engine. ","And from Curt Schilling and 38 Studios, one of the most anticipated RPGs of the year, Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning will ship on February 7 in North America and February 10 in Europe.","Finally, on March 6 in North America and March 9 in Europe, another blockbuster from BioWare, Mass Effect 3. This is a sequel to a title that many critics voted Game of the Year. Fans love this franchise and want more. Pre-orders for Mass Effect 3 are running substantially ahead of where we were at this point with Mass Effect 2. The buzz is building, and we're betting that we've got another big hit from BioWare.","That's it. A smashing Q3 based on blockbuster launches for Battlefield 3 and Star Wars: The Old Republic, the continued success of FIFA 12 and more great games to come. ","With that, I'll hand back to John.","John S. Riccitiello","Thanks, Frank. Before we move to your questions, I want to offer one last perspective. EA will finish the fiscal year, a profoundly different company than where we were at the start. ","We've launched Star Wars: The Old Republic, Battlefield 3, FIFA and The Sims Social, 4 games that reflect the evolution of our business, a traditional packaged goods model to one with a deeper relationship with the consumer and a 365-day revenue potential.","PopCap, a fantastically talented group of developers elected to become part of EA, and in doing so, they vaulted us into leadership in casual games. ","We proved our Fewer, Better, Bigger thesis and are now making more revenue on fewer titles and have now turned the page to focus on 3 new strategies: building our brands, our platform and our talent. We shattered our digital non-GAAP revenue goal, achieving the $1 billion target in calendar 2011.","We're a much better company than we were at the start of the fiscal year, much better position for growth in the years ahead. ","And with that, Eric, Frank, Peter and I will take your questions.  Operator, we're ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Brian Pitz with UBS.","Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just regarding Star Wars and the margin opportunity going forward, I was wondering if you could help us think about the impact of the 1.7 million subscribers? When will we start to see that affect really start to play out? And then you talked a bit about how you'll be delivering fresh content for Star Wars. Can you help us think about the level of R&D required to support this game on an ongoing basis?","Eric F. Brown","So this is Eric, I'll take the first part of the question. I think it's important to note that we're at the very, very early stage of the Star Wars launch. We're not even 2 months into this, and so it's difficult to -- if you'd extrapolate off of where we are today with 1.7 million active subscribers. Suffice it to say, it's been a really strong launch, great stability and a great take rate and create engagement. As to the future content plans, I'll pass that to Frank.","Frank D. Gibeau","Sure. We have very ambitious plans for the content strategy in front of us for Star Wars, including very frequent, high-quality releases in areas such as the Elder Game, PDP, in addition to future expansion packs. So that's going to require some level of R&D that we will continue to maintain post-launch. And part of the R&D that was pre-launch will also flip into the ongoing service and infrastructure of the service. We will be setting up smart goals for operational efficiency gains and looking at ways to continue to leverage the business now that we're in the market and live. It's a little early yet to identify what those enhancements will be, but we have an ongoing plan and look forward to being able to report on that later in the future.","Peter C. Ausnit","Yes, this is Peter, as well. As Eric mentioned, we've got a strong marketing plan to support those initiatives here in Q4. You're going to -- if you haven't seen it already, network television, very strong boost to our marketing support of this very important title.","Brian J. Pitz - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great. And just one really quick follow-up. Can you give us a sense for how many of those 1.7 million active subs we could expect to convert to paying subs after the initial free month? How should we kind of think about that?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, let me -- maybe what I can do is I'll define active subscribers for you, and then give you a little color on that. We're not going to be able to talk too deeply on conversion just because it's so early in the life of the product. We're only 10 days past our first month anniversary. But essentially, we're using the industry standard for active subscribers. If anyone paying a subscription or playing on an active prepaid timecard, and those who have registered to play are still in the trial subscription period. I can't tell you that the majority of the 1.7 million are paying subscribers for us currently, which is great considering we're only, like I said, 42 days into the launch, and you have a 30-day trial period. So a lot of people are voting that they want to be a part of the service and are engaged, which is great news.","Operator","And the next question comes from Justin Post with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I don't know if you can help with this question, but how would you say Star Wars in total is contributing to this year's earnings? And can you help us at all on how it might affect next year's earnings? Like are you expecting a lot of contribution next year versus this year? And how would you think about that? And then maybe you can give us an update on Sims Social, how that's gone against your plans? And do you think you can grow kind of games and your presence or market share in that category as you look out to fiscal '13?","John S. Riccitiello","So Jus, This is John. I'm going to give you a very high level. We don't generally break out profitability on individual titles. I would say, more or less, the way to think about Star Wars is in terms of its trajectory, as both Eric and Frank noted, we need to know more about the trajectory of the business, but where I can give you a full and balanced projection for fiscal '13. One of the reasons we're going to do guidance in May is we think we'll be in a good position to do that. Another way to look at it is the lion's share of revenue from any given purchaser of the game is in subscription, so the packaged goods sale isn't frankly that influential to the total P&L by comparison to subscription. And I would note that we basically go from a 4-month business this year to a 12-month business next year. And frankly for years prior to this we were carrying pure cost, so we definitely identified this as one of the positive levers in our P&L if you move in F'13. We will give you a lot more color on that in 3 months. Peter is going to pick up the question on Sims Social.","Peter C. Ausnit","Yes. On Sims Social, as you know we launched back in August, I think the game has settled in nicely. As I look at update right now realtime, we're over 4 million DAUs, daily active users, and 21.7 million monthly active users. You can expect to see, over the coming weeks and months, rich content and features that will continue to drive, in particular the DAU number back up again our studio, our PlayFish studio in London in collaboration with access here obviously. Overseas The Sims IP are working very, very closely together, as well as with the community, and making sure that we keep these contents and feature insertions into the game, keeping those MAUs and DAUs pointing upwards. But overall, we're very happy where we are. We're at the top 5 game on the Facebook platform in gaming.","Justin Post - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And is the monetization meeting your expectations? And any update there on revenue per DAU?","Peter C. Ausnit","We don't give update on that, but the monetization is meeting our expectations. And in fact, we expect that to increase as you would expect with the introduction of fresh content and features.","Operator","Your next question comes from Brian Karimzad with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I know you don't give profitability by title but maybe directionally, you can help us out, not for Star Wars actually but on your social and smartphone businesses. Can you give a sense of what the current run rate is on operating margin there when you factor in both what's launched and the overhead of development that will be continuing as we go forward?","Eric F. Brown","This is Eric, I'll respond to that. Again we're talking about businesses at slightly different stages of maturity. So our overall mobile business, where we're the leader in Western world, is more developed and has margins in excess of certain other areas in digital because it's at scale, it's growing, it's taking share, it grew 30% year-over-year, and we're working through a transition of feature phone to smartphone. So mobile is a good example, they scale, which we've defined as greater than $100 million business, with margins well in excess of where we are as a company overall. ","The portfolio of social games is at a slightly different stage of development. To date, we've brought out one major EA intellectual property, The Sims Social, in this fiscal year, and we're realizing a portion of that in fiscal '12. As we look to fiscal '13, we will have more social titles with the benefit of EA branding and history behind them. And so I would not compare that profitability of that business directly to that of mobile just given the stage of development. But it will indeed scale profitability over time, and we expect it to be additive to our total company operating margin.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And when you think within mobile, though, on the smartphone side, is that one that's operating currently above your total company margin? I understand the feature phone side was very high margin to begin with.","Eric F. Brown","Well in terms of mobile overall, feature plus smartphones isn't measured on a kind of standalone basis, it is above -- it delivers a net margin above that of the composite EA op [ph] margin.","Brian Karimzad - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then quickly on the double-digit revenue growth for next fiscal year, can you just give us any sort of walk you have on puts and takes or maybe it's just all puts and no takes?","Eric F. Brown","Well there are -- no, there are a series of puts and takes. I would say that John's already called out one of the really important adds year-over-year, that's 12 months of Star Wars subscription revenue in the fiscal year versus effectively 2.5 months of paid subscription revenue in fiscal '12. So that's a significant delta or improvement year-over-year. On the packaged goods title slate, we have highlighted that we expect to have fewer titles next year compared to this year, so there are some puts and takes within that portfolio overall. The other thing is to keep in mind is the rest of our digital business is trending very favorably. Great example of this is downloadable content on the FIFA franchise. We're expecting in fiscal '12 to realize $100 million in total digital revenue, net digital revenue from the FIFA franchise, from -- principally from the FIFA Ultimate Team mode. And that's a number that has compounded very, very nicely over the past couple of years, and we expect those types of trends for certain franchises like FIFA, Battlefield FPS to likewise continue into FY '13.","Operator","Your next question comes from Edward Williams with BMO Capital Markets.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a couple of questions. Can you comment a little bit about your plans for Star Wars as far as international markets are concerned? As we -- as you look to increase your marketing overall, are you looking to move it into existing markets? And as we look into fiscal '13, are we going to see it migrate into more markets on a global basis? And then secondly, looking at the success you've had with FIFA and driving the digital revenue, can you comment a little bit about how you're looking to achieve the same sorts of goals with some of your other key sports title, such as Madden and potentially the return of an NBA title?","Peter C. Ausnit","So this is Peter. Let me -- I'll take the Star Wars question, and hand it over to Frank on the other one. Yes, I mean in succinct answer to your question, we are looking at global expansion from the perspective of, in particular, looking at the Asian market. We recently announced that we're -- on March 1, that we'd be in Australia and New Zealand. It's all about, as you might imagine, server location down there, but we have a very strong demand from all of our consumers in that particular part of the market. We're looking at other opportunities to go into Asia as well. But you will see more and more announcements as we roll this title out globally. We want to make sure the level of service is there, and that does require the investment in hardware. But demand is certainly there, and you're going to hear a lot more about that in the coming weeks.","Edward S. Williams - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","How long could it take to kind of get into the Asian market?","Peter C. Ausnit","Well certainly we're taking the low hanging fruit of the Pacific, if you will, with Australia and New Zealand. I was there personally and saw the demand there a couple of months ago. It may take a few months. We need to make sure that we're meeting obviously the service level agreements that we have with our studio on making sure that it's the best experience for the consumer. But you've got to be thinking in months rather than weeks, that's for sure.","John S. Riccitiello","To put a fine point on that, though. Just if the individual major Asian markets will be -- announcements that take place when they take place, we're bound by confidentially agreements with our Lucas partner. We're trying to give you an indication that we're keen on getting there, and we have work underway. But these are going to be discrete announcements, and I think they can yield some really good upside. By way of example, when WoW was introduced in November of 2004, they were shortly after that in Korea and within 9 months, they were in China. I would admit that in those days, it was easier on the -- if the service had temporary outages or failures that was considered par for the course. It's certainly not par for the course today. And so what Peter's getting at and I think Frank would underscore is what we would seek to do with any Asian expansion is execute flawlessly as we have in the North American and Western Europe launch.","Frank D. Gibeau","And this is Frank. On the question about digital expansions within the Sports label based on what we've been able to do with Ultimate Team, we're certainly looking at that as an opportunity in our other sports, but not just limited to our sports. We have a very ambitious plan to drive digital revenues off of our console businesses in our shooters category, in the racing category, in action. So we're taking the key learnings that we're developing from Battlefield and FIFA and we're applying it to our entire suite of brands and across all of our different labels.","John S. Riccitiello","One of the things that I think just to build on that just a little bit, and I don't have the statistics at my fingertips, but I would point out that some folks have thought of EA as driving to $1 billion in digital and the growth we exceed from here is being somewhat acquisition-driven. The vast majority -- or at least the significant majority of our digital revenue is in fact, based on EA IP and coming from studios like BioWare. In the scheme of things, we are extremely excited about the fast growth from additions like PopCap and Playfish, et cetera. But at this point in time, the majority of our business is actually organic. And I think that's worth noting and we expect to continue to drive organic growth there and have the M&A deals we've done, extend our footprint, our channel exposure, our business model exposure.","Operator","Our next question comes from Doug Creutz with Cowen and Company.","Douglas Creutz - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Yes. Sims Social was a big hit back in August, and I think people were surprised that in the 6 months since then, you guys have kind of gone a bit of radio silence as far as new social titles. We've seen that the trends in that space seem to be that the titles do really well for a few months and then start to shed users rapidly, and your major competitor has clearly made a decision to vastly increase their frequency of title output. So I'm just wondering, I know you're a little reluctant to talk about what's coming for competitive reasons. But if you could just talk about how many social titles you think you're going to release in the next 12 months, that would be really helpful.","Peter C. Ausnit","Doug, it's Peter. So yes, as per the prepared statements, you did hear us say that we slipped a title out of this quarter into Q1. It is a major title based upon a major piece of the EA brand IP, and that's an important point. What we do here may be different than our competitor is leverage the power of our brands in IT in a way that has top quality game assurance to the consumer. And so they do take a little bit more time because quite frankly, they're better. And so from the element of us putting out a lot of games on the quantity basis rather than quality, we're always going to err towards quality. Having said that, you can expect approximately 5 new social games based on our IP going forward next year, and I'm talking about the Facebook platform specifically. Social is a broader scope for us than obviously just Facebook. But from that perspective, the Playfish studios in London, San Francisco and Beijing are working diligently, making sure they convert our intellectual property where relevant to that platform. But we're not going to ship a game before its time. And in particular, this one that we're referring to, we felt the engagement monetization elements of the game were better served holding on for a few weeks. And so you'll see that one in this quarter of FY '13.","John S. Riccitiello","Just to give you some color on that, think about our social games being in these categories. BioWare is where we consolidated KlickNation, and so we have a social game capability there. Our Sport studios have already launched 2 social games, learned a lot from that and are fast working on that -- 3, excuse me. We've got our Playfish studio, which is what Peter is referring to, and then we have PopCap. So I will admit that we have -- our SKU plan is such that it appears that we pulled back. I think you'll see a good, solid slate from us on the strongest of our intellectual properties in fiscal '13. And we'll probably be just as coy with you on the May launch except for the one significant game that we'll have launched by then. We have to deal with the reality that -- I won't call it copying, but say mimicry is common in this industry, and fast generation and mimicry is something we have to guard against. And so we don't put out a lot of information on the individual titles, Doug, to your exact point when you started the question.","Operator","And your next question comes from John Taylor with Arcadia.","John Taylor","I wonder if we could talk a little bit about sales and marketing and your commentary about the timing of Star Wars shipments. So I'm really interested in and an update in how you think about leveraging Origin since those numbers are ratcheting up really quickly, and what implications that might have for your assumptions for sales and marketing? And that being sort of a larger question but the more specific tactical question is, I think you indicated sales and marketing in Q4 was going to go up a little bit to support Star Wars. So was some of that -- is some of that, new spending that you didn't expect? Or is there a shift from Q3 to Q4 on that one? Can you help us with the timing of the shipments and matching those up with the sales and marketing spend on Star Wars specifically.","Eric F. Brown","This is Eric. I'll take the first part of that. So I think it's important to recognize that Star Wars was exceptionally stable in terms of its rollout. We talked about bringing them more users than what we'd originally anticipated. We sold more units in Q3, at the very end of Q3, units that we otherwise would have expected to meter out in early Q4. So that was a definite phasing benefit in regards to Q3 due to the success of Star Wars. In regards to the comments about we expect to spend a bit more marketing on Star Wars in Q4, it's to maintain momentum and take advantage of this incredibly successful MMO launch. And so we're moving from a phase where we had a lot of preregistered demand, and we're looking to reach out past the core audience and bring new users into the funnel in our fourth fiscal quarter. That will benefit not only in Q4 but obviously, it sets us up nicely in terms of fiscal '13.","Peter C. Ausnit","JT, it's Peter. Let me just add on to that. What I talked about earlier is a major mass-market network television campaign. Interestingly as well, that we'll take advantage of some of the synergies that we're working with our partner at Lucas. That as you probably know, there's the 3D movie coming out in the next 6 or 7 weeks, and you're going to be able to see a lot of cross promotion between the 2. And in particular, you'll see our ads are tagged with the movie as well. We think there's a huge synergy right now, and we fully intend to take advantage of the momentum we've got coming out of the quarter, as well as our ability to get to that more mass-market consumer that is a Star Wars fan, and that's what you're going to see on network television, and that's where a lot of the spend is going.","John S. Riccitiello","Can I provide just a little bit of perspective? The intention here, right, is we're connecting so many of our games online. And I would say that in terms of that massive synergy where all of the 300 million or so consumers we connect to between Nucleus accounts, nearly 170 million plus mobile and social, which are currently not in there and direct and redirect traffic, the million of consumers hitting our Origin website. If you're on the question of is there marketing synergy in that? The answer to that is yes. And in my prepared comments, I referenced what Rajat and  Kristian do. I would say that we are on the -- I'm not sure you'd even call it the early innings of realizing that synergy. We might still be arguing that we're sort of dragging fly balls in the pregame exercise. But what we're starting to see, by way of example, is the ability for EA to send hundreds of millions of impressions to an individual title from other parts of our company to help drive exposure. We've just begun to do that at scale, and we expect to be able to do that at much greater scale. I'd say that we'll be, JT, what, maybe 1\/4 of the way there or 1\/3 of the way there through the FY '13 time frame and more fully and robustly take advantage of that opportunity in F '14. Frankly a huge, high leverage transformative aspect of what we're trying to do as a company, and it's the reason we've invested in Nucleus. It's reason that we've pushed so hard to become a player in social and mobile in addition to our packaged goods business. It's a reason that we're pushing the play-for-free model. Is we are trying to aggregate the eyeballs, minds and wallets of gamers around the globe.","John Taylor","Okay, great. Let me ask a follow-up, if I can. Maybe this is for you, Peter, or for you, Frank. When you look at the download, the DLC that you're attaching to Battlefield, to a Battlefield user, to a FIFA user, so on, can you give us a sense on what's going on turn-wise with average revenue per?","Peter C. Ausnit","I think -- this is Peter. I think it varies radically from game to game. The engagement levels are different. One thing I will tell you, and Frank can elaborate, is that we've got plans for all of our major franchises to turn them into more of as we're seeing with FIFA and with Battlefield more as games for service that have constant flow of downloadable content. But it does vary with the pinnacle, as Eric pointed out, being FIFA. But we're 3 years in into a pretty well established and sophisticated global audience with FIFA there and the Ultimate Team, which we also do in both Madden and NHL, works out very well. Same, you're going to hear some announcements from us on Battlefield actually as early as next week in an event we've got in New York. But Frank, I don't know if have anything else to add?","Frank D. Gibeau","Yes, we're trying a lot of different models here, and they're working very effectively. In the case of Ultimate Team, because it's a micro-transaction-based system, we actually are able to generate a sizable number of whale-type consumer behaviors, and it becomes a business that scales much more aggressively than maybe some of the traditional DLC models you've seen where it's a download pack every once in a while. The MTX level really helps us do some really dynamic and interesting things there. So we've got a lot of different programs in place right now. We're learning from all of them. All of them seem to be succeeding in double-digit ranges. And on the ARPU level, we're seeing some great enhancements to our P&L's.","Eric F. Brown","Yes JT, this is Eric, too. Maybe to put some rough numbers on this. If we compare the total digital revenue from FIFA 11 Ultimate Team to what we expect for FIFA 12 Ultimate Team in this fiscal year, we're looking to see about a 25% increase franchise-to-franchise, and so the overall packaged goods units sold is not increasing by 25% year-over-year. So we are expanding by a decent margin, the micro-transaction revenue per user of FIFA.","John S. Riccitiello","What we're basically finding -- I know you've kind of caught us, I think we all like here, so we're expanding a little bit because I think it's really important. When we look at what we do and what our competitors do, there's a number of examples of I would call it as sort of the best work of our industry in terms of making this work. A lot of it is clearly the Xbox Live in terms of monetizing online consumers. One of them is clearly Ultimate Team, which we pushed across a range of our titles, and it's doing really, really well. One of them is what we've done recently with FIFA online in both Korea with our Neowiz partner and in Japan on mobile social with GREE. Frankly, I gave a compliment to one of our competitors. It's got a subscription on the back end of an FPS title. I think that's a best-in-class performance. And we study all of these, and by way of example, when we put Ultimate Team out there, we had a competing idea with Madden, none of which I'm sure -- none of whom I believe on the call would even know the name of it because it quickly faded and it was replaced with Ultimate Team because we're learning from best practice. So the reason this is such a fast-growing revenue stream for us is we're identifying and implementing best practice across the range of our products, and you'll see lots more to come including an announcement near term that Peter just alluded to.","Operator","And our next question comes from Atul Bagga with Lazard Capital.","Atul Bagga - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I thought I would give you guys a break from Star Wars questions and maybe talk a little bit about EA Origin. If I look at EA Origin, it still seems like it's more of a digital marketplace than a gaming platform. I was wondering if you can maybe highlight what are the milestones we should be looking for Origin as you're taking Origin and building it more as a game as a service platform and what your plans might be for taking Origin beyond desktop to include mobile also?","Peter C. Ausnit","Atul, it's Peter. So you're exactly right. We're only 7 months in. Let's all remember here, we only announced this in June of last year as regards, the inception of this platform. It has started off and has done very well. It's a commercial platform for us to transact directly to our consumers. You're going to see, over the next 12 months, some milestones and a roadmap of features that will include more social features, enhancements to the way that our consumers can access Origin, and to your point, not only just focus on the PC but other platforms as well, and then building in different business models, so that we can not just do direct-to-consumer downloads as we currently do with full games or DLC but also different types of business models will allow us to aggregate our consumers and provide them with better opportunities and price value relationships for our content. So there is a very detailed and long-term roadmap to make this a portal to our consumer on a global basis. Rolling it out in a fundamental way as well globally is part of our plans as well. It's pretty much Western world only right now, and as you can imagine, our ability to reach into other regions will be very important. But think about more social community-oriented features, think about different models and think about more and more third-party publishers coming on board than already the pretty good slate that we have right now. And I think 12 months from now on this call, I'll be able to report that we have a full and very robust portal to the consumer on a global basis regardless of platform or geographic location.","John S. Riccitiello","And if you take your Android or iOS device right now and open for example, Scrabble and hit the EA button at the bottom, you'll be linked to what is essentially the Origin store, and that's transacting today and effectively so. So it's a very early implementation, but it provides access to your Origin friends, has links to all of your Facebook friends, has access to all of our mobile content. And that's been deployed. I use it everyday. We haven't made a big noise with it yet, primarily because it's in its early stage, think of it as a second early beta. But those who are interacting with it like it, and short-them on our roadmap is a big lift there in terms of features and functionality towards the end of the fiscal year.","Atul Bagga - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And John on mobile, I mean you've seen pretty strong traction from your smartphone business. But seems like, again, most of your smartphone businesses games, which are download -- premium download businesses not as such on social mobile games. Can you talk a little bit about what your strategy might be for social mobile games?","John S. Riccitiello","I think Peter is going to look at some data for you. But I think our growth in the holiday quarter was on Free to Play. And so -- which is essentially what you're asking about, the Free to Play micro-transaction model. I think it's very fair to say we were a little late to that party. We were running mostly download games in the early part of the year but there's an awful lot coming there. And you can imagine the blend of our own IP, what we're doing with Playfish, with PopCap and you can see a very substantial, I think, lift for us there. One of the -- one great example of this is social mobile game for FIFA that we launched with GREE a few months ago. It went to #1 and #2 on their platform, an enormous success for a Western IP in Japan. And so it may not be as visible to those of you who live in the U.S. but a good hit, and we're pursuing similar strategies around the world.","Peter C. Ausnit","Yes, just to add to that. The real growth is freemium. As John said, we shipped Sims FreePlay, FIFA Superstars, Theme Park and as we've spoken about on the GREE platform in Japan, FIFA World Class Soccer. That title in particular is a big breakthrough for us because the FIFA franchise has had difficulty in the Japanese market, competing for a number of reasons, and this is a major breakthrough for us. So freemium is where our growth is. You're going to see continued growth on that. I also want to point out that we continue to be the #1 worldwide publisher on iOS. We had, I think, if I would just look at my notes here, 10.5% market share. That's more than double the segment share of our nearest competitor, and then our ability to continue to grow that on a global basis. Keep an eye on the Japanese situation because I think it's great.","Operator","Your next question comes from Arvind Bhatia with Sterne Agee.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I wanted to actually go back to your March quarter guidance for a second. You cited, I think 4 different reasons, and I think John you said $0.15 impact from these. I was wondering if you could maybe rank the importance of these? How much of this is from pulling demand for Star Wars? How much of this is marketing-related moving to social game? And then the bad debt you talked about. That would be great.","Eric F. Brown","This is Eric, I'll respond to that. I would say that the ability for us to have pulled forward and sold in more units of Star Wars, I think, is the most important thing to call out. It was hundreds of thousands of extra units versus our expectations, and bear in mind, this is a PC product with a very, very high gross profit margin percentage and hence, very, very good flow-through. The marketing spend on Star Wars is also, I think, a change again. 90 days ago, we were somewhat cautious in terms of our expectations for the rate at which we'd be able to roll out the service in correlation to its stability. We've clearly done much better than that and scaled much more rapidly than any other MMO to date. And we're taking advantage of that, the momentum, and that's going to be reflected in the type of marketing and acquisition campaigns that Peter alluded to. And so I would probably rank that as #2 on the list there. And then in regards to the isolated retailer risk, hard to call that one exactly so -- it's on the list, it could very well be a significant. We have to wait for the quarter to play out. So that has a range on it. And so that's how I would characterize that particular item.","Arvind Bhatia - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And one last one from me. Going back to Star Wars for a second. I think the only number in terms of profitability that you guys have talked about that I can remember is that it takes about 0.5 million subscribers to be profitable on a sustainable basis month-to-month. Has anything changed in terms of the launch, the interest level, et cetera that would make you want to update that? Or would you still work with that assumption?","John S. Riccitiello","I think that was me that made that comment a number of times. What I basically said is 0.5 million subs, we could break even at the margin, 1 million subs would be meaningfully profitable but nothing to write home about. It would just --  it certainly would not make us feel good about the investments to date. It would simply be a good business on an ongoing basis. And then from there, as we scale, the business gets to be very attractive. I don't think anything has changed with regard to that general summary other than it looks like we can take the bad scenarios off the table at the present. And what we're now trying to figure out is what combination of customer acquisition, managing through the funnel and attrition will yield the P&L were looking for going forward.","Operator","And your last question comes from Neil Doshi with Citi.","Neil A. Doshi - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Just had a question on social and mobile in terms of how you guys think about rolling out EA branded titles versus developing new titles for these platforms. And then secondly, on the mobile side, are you starting to see more traction in tablets versus smartphones? And is there a greater revenue opportunity on the tablet side versus the smartphone side?","Peter C. Ausnit","This is Peter. So on that concept, we are focused on obviously extending our brands across all platforms. And that's why you see a more deliberate approach, and that's why you see a better quality of experience from our perspective. We also, at the same time, look at opportunities to be able to build where the consumer's looking for IP that is relevant to that consumer game mechanic. But you're seeing The Sims Social obviously, you see what we do in Sports. These are all based on Electronic Arts international property or license intellectual property that we feel A, has a relevance to the consumer on that platform and B, in a lot of instances, has a global reach, and we'll continue along that strategy, interspersing with some of the other IP as well. Second question, John, do you want to?","John S. Riccitiello","Let me just add a little bit on that second question. First off, there's no question that smartphones outnumber tablets by a gigantic proportion, and we monetize very well on smartphones particularly iOS. We've seen an improvement on Android in terms of monetization on their platform as they've made improvements to their marketplace. So those bode very well. Personally, we're all really bullish here on the tablet business because it's a great presentation of our products. But right now, the installed base and even the wildly optimistic expectations for the installed base are likely to keep it smaller than what's going to happen on the handheld devices. I think moreover, the most important point is this, we're pretty much agnostic as to whether a consumer gets our fare on a console, a PC, a handheld, smartphone, a social network or tablet, and we're able -- we're driving revenues with our IP across all of those. So for us, I know this is maybe an odd way to say it, tablet or a phone to us are both similar opportunities, and we're chasing the consumer wherever they want to play the product. A lot of consumers are playing, by way of example, SCRABBLE crossing an Android device, an iPhone, an iPad and Facebook, and I'm in circles right now where that's happening. So I think that's more of the future than trying to think of it as independent channels.","With that, Operator, I think we're going to wrap up. Thank you, everyone.","Operator","Thank you very much for your participation in today's call. The call has concluded. You may disconnect at this time. Thank you."]}}
