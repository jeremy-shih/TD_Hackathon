Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John D. Porter - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Julia. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com.","These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us. Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL and Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to General Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Great. Thank you, John and thanks everybody for being on the call this morning. We've got a lot of things to cover today, but before we discussed the second quarter results, I'd like to briefly comment on the WMB Board Strategic Alternatives process that's underway. And as you'll recall, Williams announced on June 21 that it planned to explore a range of strategic alternatives that could include among other things, a merger, a sales of Williams or continuing to pursue the company's existing operating and growth plan.","A robust competitive process, we believe, is the best way to get the best options on the table and to maximize shareholder value and the board's review is meant to accomplish just that. The process is underway and we're pleased with the progress to-date.","As I'm sure you'll understand we do not intend to comment further on this thorough review of these alternatives before the WPZ transaction today and we won't be commenting further on that until the process is completed and a more definitive course of action is determined by the board.","In the meantime and I can assure you that our focus remains on maximizing value and we continue to act in the best interests of our shareholders as we through this process. And so, with that, let's move on to the first slide and talk about the tremendous growth that we enjoyed in the second quarter and a strong trajectory of growth in front of us.","So look here on slide two, the package, here in the second quarter, certainly, demonstrates the benefits from our clearly defined strategy of capitalizing on the significant natural gas market growth by connecting the very best supplies to the best markets. We've been on this strategy for quite some time and is really starting to deliver a lot of significant growth, particularly in our fee-based revenues.","For this quarter, WMB's adjusted EBITDA was $1.02 billion, up 32% versus second quarter of 2014 and at WPZ, we had a record distributable cash flow of $701 million and delivered an adjusted EBITDA of $1.01 billion, which was driven by fee-based revenue growth.","Overall, we had solid performance from four of our five segments, and the performance was delivered despite the fact that volumes were lower in some areas, as a result of price related shut-ins and also because we are operating in a historically low commodity price environment. So when we say lower, just we mean lower than they could have been. We actually had very significant growth in lot of those areas, but certainly, significant impact from volumes being shut in from gas prices.","So let me walk through some of the numbers here. First of all, in the Atlantic-Gulf, really the strong performance from Atlantic-Gulf, $389 million in adjusted EBITDA and this was up 44% on fee-based revenues from new projects. And this group really is managing a tremendous amount of growth, and just keeps on delivering this growth in a very safe and reliable manner, so couldn't be prouder of all the great work going on there.","At Access, $345 million, up 25% on fee-based revenue growth, and I have to say that certainly we're pleased with the contributions being made from this acquisition, and it's not just the predictable growing cash flows that we all expected, but I would tell you, probably, the piece that's been most impressive from my perspective is the great injection of new talent and ideas that are coming from our new fellow Williams' employees that came from this acquisition.","So integration and the synergies are going even a little better than expected there and we continue to see great opportunities out in front of us, as we take in a lot of the ideas and we merge the entities, particularly seeing a lot of opportunity up in the Northeast and we're really starting to get into some of the synergies within our operational excellence and E&C areas as well.","In the Northeast G&P, this is $92 million, up 21% and impressively on 54% higher Ohio Valley Midstream gathering volumes, so really starting to see that come through and noted that the team had a record volume there just this week, and really pushing out some big numbers there, as those volumes start to come in and I'll let Jim Scheel address that later.","In the Northeast, in general, I would say that as the face of the energy in the U.S. has changed over the past years and where it's coming from, we have certainly worked very hard to get ourselves into a position to unlock the tremendous value of the Marcellus and the Utica areas like never before.","And we have put ourselves in a position and we are the leading gathering systems in the Northeast. And we believe our shareholders are going to see great long term value from this tremendous position that we've been able to accumulate in the Marcellus and Utica position.","On to the West, EBITDA was $150 million, and this was down 27%. But as we mentioned, this really was driven by lower NGL margins and so that really was the big story out there. But I will tell you, from an operational standpoint, continuing to see great performance there on both reliability of our operations out there and the safety of our operations out there. And in fact, in the quarter, our gathering volumes were flat really as compared to the prior quarter and as the year-over-year quarterly comparison and our equity gallons, so the gallons that we take for our account, and our plant inlet volumes were both higher on a year-over-year comparison. So West continues to hold its own, but certainly impacted by lower prices there in the second quarter.","And then in the NGL and Petchem space, the adjusted EBITDA was just $33 million and that number is certainly lower than last year due to the absence of the business interruption proceeds that we reported in the second quarter of 2014. And the near zero prices for propane that we saw in the Edmonton spot prices from our Canadian operations.","But this, of course, was a little bit offset by the Geismar, as Geismar began to ramp up here in the second quarter. But really that was probably the disappointment from my perspective, for the quarter, was not getting Geismar up as soon as we would have liked to, and we did have some very serious electrical power problems on the feed into the plant and we've gotten that behind us now, but it has certainly hampered our operations there in the second quarter.","So once again, I want to reiterate the overall growth our teams are delivering, and we've begun to enjoy the fruits of our labor as we manage the tremendous growth that we really have thought very hard to win on our Transco system in the deepwater, and certainly, in the Northeast G&P, and we expect big improvement now in our NGL and Petchem services group for the balance of 2015, with Geismar now online and Horizon coming on towards the very end of 2015.","Moving on to the next slide here \u2013 sorry I'm going back to \u2013 stay back on the slide sorry. When you look at our results this quarter, you'll see that our fee-based revenue growth really is coming through in a big way and pretty powerful the way it overpowered lower commodity prices in the quarter. And I think that's really important that we are executing on that strategy in a big way of shifting our business to fee-based revenues and this quarter is an example of where that really pushed through what was some really strong headwinds on the commodity price this quarter.","And in fact, at WPZ, our fee-based revenues were up $537 million or 72%, and while a lot of that was driven by the Access acquisition, a lot of this came through our major projects that we're ramping up. And so, if you look at just the WPZ historic assets, our fee-based revenues were up 17%. And this doesn't include fee-based revenues from things like our proportional JVs. So for assets like Discovery, which of course got a big boost from the Keathley Canyon project coming on and our UEO investment in the Utica, big improvements in fee-based revenues there, but given the way we account for that, that does not show up in that $130 million of incremental fee-based revenues.","On the NGL margin side, we certainly experienced some serious headwinds and our NGL margins were down $56 million here for the second quarter of 2015. In fact, we only recorded $38 million of NGL margins for the quarter, and it's been a long, long time since we had that low a report for NGL margins.","The Geismar plant, just to mention what's going on there, did ramp up in the second quarter. And albeit that was slower than we expected, but it is now online and consistently operating at or near its full production capacity and we expect significant contributions from the plant here in the second half of the year, as I mentioned earlier.","On a personal note, I'd just like to recognize that that leadership team there at Geismar has been through a lot. And I want to recognize the fact they have really kept their eyes on getting that plant back up in a safe manner, and they continue to hit some really impressive safety records there, despite a tremendous amount of activity going on at the plant there. And I can't tell you how hard that team has worked to get the plant back up and running safely and I'm very appreciative of their efforts.","And so, let's move on to guidance. First of all, we are reaffirming our Williams dividend guidance for 2015 through 2020. And I would point out that the guidance that we've provided is based on an assumption of the completion of the acquisition of the Williams Partners public units by Williams.","We are also reaffirming our adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2016 through 2018, although we are lowering the 2015 adjusted EBITDA midpoint guidance that we issued in February by about 6%. And of course, this reflects the lower commodity prices that are showing in the market right now for the balance of the year, and as well the problems that we had at Geismar and the ramp-up in the second quarter. So the Geismar impact of that is really already in our second quarter, and the balance of that lowering is coming through commodity prices for the balance of the year.","We also are reaffirming our dividend of $0.64 per share in third quarter of 2015, or $2.56 annualized, and also our dividend of $2.85 in 2016 with 10% to 15% annual dividend growth coming through 2020.","And so, on to the last point on this slide, certainly, a tremendous amount of growth continues to come at us. And I want to say that we're very excited about how the major projects that are now contributing on the fee-based revenue side are really starting to drive our business and also a lot of projects that are on our list right now that will continue to build the stream of growing cash flows for years to come.","Now, moving on to the next slide here and this is slide four. First of all, the projects that are beginning to contribute. We said back in the first quarter at our Analyst Day in May that the demand side of the natural gas market is driving our project list and we are really reinforcing that here again today. And as we look at some of the significant projects that we put into service here in the second quarter, it's easy to see that we've really been executing and delivering on these projects.","And here, as you look at the second quarter, for example, on our Transco system, you can see here we delivered three very important projects in the quarter: the Rockaway Lateral and the Northeast Connector project that goes with the Rockaway Lateral, so \u2013 but two independent projects there.","The Mobile Bay South 3 project, we brought into service in April of 2015, and that was on time and on budget. And our CPV Woodbridge project, which was brought into service on schedule and below budget. And our New York Bay expansion project, just one more example, we did make our FERC application in July here just recently as well.","So a lot of hits just keep coming on the Transco side. Gulfstar One, these big projects that we put on into service at the end of the first quarter really provided a lot of strong contribution here in the second quarter. And the production volumes from the Tubular Bells prospect there does continue to grow. And in fact, the fourth well was just brought on recently there by the operator.","Our Discovery Keathley Canyon Connector, certainly drove our proportional JV EBITDA in the quarter. And again, these are fee-based revenues that are coming from Exxon's Hadrian facility and Anadarko's Lucius facility. Our Discovery system is running completely full now, and we are really liking the prospects that sit around the Keathley Canyon system and the kind of high margin business that will continue to flow in on this system that is so well-positioned now in the Keathley Canyon.","We also completed an acquisition of the Fox Creek gathering and treating system. And this expands Access's Eagle Ford footprint. And as we said in the last call, we expected to see producer systems come into the M&A space and this acquisition is a really good example of that. So this is a bolt-on to our business there in the Eagle Ford and a very nice addition of predictable fee-based cash flows coming in there.","We also acquired some additional interest in UEO and that interest is now up to 62% and this area is really enjoying tremendous volume growth here in the Utica.","On Geismar, as I said earlier, Geismar is now producing near its full expanded capacity. And in fact, our production here on Tuesday was about 5.27 million pounds a day of both ethylene and propylene, and so, doing very well there and we'll continue to optimize between our ethylene and propylene production depending on margins.","Coming soon, as we look forward, there's a lot of exciting projects left to come on for the year. Our Virginia Southside project is expected to come in-service in the third quarter of 2015. And our Leidy Southeast project is expected to come on in-service in fourth quarter 2015. And so, we're making good progress on those items.","Our Canadian off-gas processing, we're making great progress towards bringing our CNRL Horizon project startup in 2015; and our Kodiak tieback, which is a tieback to our Devils Tower platform, is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of 2015. And these tiebacks that we're getting to experience out here are really powerful tools in terms of driving a return on our business, as they require very little capital and large amounts of fee-based revenues. In fact, our Devils Tower field is now nearly 12 years old and this is the fifth field to be produced from this platform now.","And Gunflint will be the first tieback to our Gulfstar platform and that is expected to come on in 2016. And I would tell you that is well ahead of our original expectations that we had for that investment thesis in Gulfstar. So really enjoying the benefits of really learning to aggregate and tieback production in these big deepwater spars.","Once again, this list is certainly very extensive, and I'm very proud of our team's progress, as they really are delivering the growth that's out in front of us now.","Moving on to slide five, we've said many times that Williams is uniquely positioned to connect the best natural gas supplies to the very best markets. And we've certainly focused our strategy on natural gas and are positioned to take advantage of the demand growth that's both here today and is coming in the next few years. We have bought and built our way into being the largest gas gatherer in the largest and fastest growing gas supply basin. And we've built Transco into the largest and fastest growing natural gas pipeline.","Our second quarter results are certainly a reflection of the fact that our efforts are driving tremendous cash flow growth, despite stark commodity price headwinds and our large scale fee-based projects are meeting or exceeding our expectations as they begin to contribute in a big way.","So the revenues from big projects like Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar are really doing very well, and in many cases, as I said, going beyond our expectations. Our focus on the fee-based growth means that we're expecting about 89% of WMB's 2015 through 2017 gross margin to come from fee-based revenues. And we have $9.8 billion of the total 2015 through 2017 in-guidance growth CapEx and 96% of that is focused on fee-based projects.","We have committed and potential growth capital through 2020 of over $30 billion. And I'll tell you that is very rapidly growing. We really haven't updated that guidance in quite a while. But I'll tell you that book of business is rapidly expanding. It also \u2013 when we put that out, we do not include things like our M&A bolt-ons. And so, we've got a lot of M&A bolt-ons that are coming at us and are very \u2013 we're very well positioned for and those are not included in that opportunity list as well.","So our backlog of projects does continue to grow and we just have not updated that just because it is so large to start with, but we do continue to see great opportunities in our business, both in terms of the known projects and the potential projects both continue to expand.","So I'd like to just sum things up like this, with over $1 billion of adjusted EBITDA for the quarter and the record quarterly DCF, both of these are driven by strong fee-based revenue growth and we're very pleased with our second quarter results, as the headwinds of lower commodity prices are certainly being overwhelmed by the tremendous growth in fee-based revenues that will continue for years to come. So some pretty serious headwinds that have been out there, but well, it's really impressive now to see all these projects starting to take hold and really starting to make our NGL margin rather insignificant up against the growth of our business.","And certainly, the growth that we're seeing demonstrates the performance of our premier asset footprint in the natural gas infrastructure space. And this includes the fastest-growing pipeline in the U.S. and the largest and fastest-growing positions in the tremendous Marcellus and Utica basins.","So with that, as we move into the Q&A session, I'd just like to remind everyone that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our operational and financial results for the second quarter of 2015. And I ask that you please limit your questions to these topics. We won't be taking questions on the Strategic Alternatives process or the WPZ transaction. And once again, I can assure you that the focus of our strategic alternatives review remains on maximizing value and that the board and management team will continue to act in the best interests of our shareholders. And we're excited about doing that.","And so, with that, let's move on to the second quarter Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today comes from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Unknown Speaker","Good morning.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Actually, a big picture question first up. Alan, you suggested that the backlog is actually growing, no change to the official guidance. What \u2013 just kind of qualitatively, when would we or should we expect some updates there and is it just as things come to fruition or is it more of a quarterly type event?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I would say there's really two things you should see moving there. One is that many of the projects that are in our potential backlog so that are in that $30-plus billion, some of those projects will start to be moving in to guidance as we close deals there.","So a lot of big opportunity right now, particularly in the Northeast, and as well as Transco continues to be very successful in contracting for new business along its system. And so, you'll start to see some business migrate from that $30-plus billion into the guidance numbers. So in terms of timing, we'll just update that in that particular case, as those deals are closed.","Secondly, on the potential bucket, I would just tell you we just \u2013 the demand side of our business is really picking up in a big way and we're extremely well-positioned to capture a lot of that. And so, we are seeing a lot of additional interest in that, and we just obviously don't update that every single quarter.","On the potential side, for one reason, it's so large already, it's not going to drive all that much, but as we see significant projects move in there, we're beginning to expand that. But I think the first thing you should expect to see in the near-term is projects in the guidance side starting to build.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's actually very helpful. And then, somewhat related, you mentioned Access operational synergies kind of showing up here recently. Is there anything \u2013 any detail that you can provide around that or any specific synergies that you want to highlight?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Thank you for that question. We had identified that we would have 25 last year upon the acquisition and then 50 on the merger. And right now, we have in our sights a number that's better than 50 here for 2015. And because some of that is being \u2013 even though it will show up in 2015, some of that will be full run rate; next year, we'll actually see a larger number than that next year.","So a lot of those things are on some of the support services side, but we also are in the process. We've reorganized our leadership in the Northeast under Jim Scheel there and so we're starting to look at that the synergies that are available to us in the Northeast gathering area as well, and those really will be 2016 kind of improvements in synergies, and we're just really starting to identify what that really looks like.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","So stay tuned for the 2016 guidance number on synergies?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. That's good for me for right now. I'll hand it over.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni of UBS.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good morning guys. Couple of questions on my front here. I was wondering, first, if we can sort of talk about the MVC exposures at the old Access assets. There's been a lot of discussion about it lately. When you look at your exposures relative to your producer customers, I was wondering if you think of it on a basin-by-basin basis and if there are any regions where it's possible the producer customer has, I guess low to negative IRRs. And I guess that likely is in the case in Northeast, but I was wondering if you could comment if there's any regions where you see some weaknesses where producers are likely to be at or below the MVC should the commodity prices continue to be at the current levels, or possibly get worse?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Let me try to take that and then look a little bit to Bob here. If you are speaking of MVCs outside of the Chesapeake business, for instance, we do have some shut-ins in the Marcellus area. And those contracts are under cost of service. And so that value proposition of that would come back to us when that rate gets adjusted on an annual basis. And so that's I think the best way to think about that relative to the Chesapeake business.","The MVCs that exist in the other Northeast, I would say, we're well above those \u2013 even at current shut-in production levels, we're well above those. I think the way you should think about that is that the volume support that we really have with that will come when the big pipeline projects come into service and there is known obligations to volumes into those downstream pipelines. So Constitution, Atlantic Sunrise and Leidy Southeast obligations into those projects will drive some support for volumes just because we know what the obligations are into those take or pay obligations on those pipelines.","Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area","Let me...","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","So...","Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area","Yeah, I was just going to add the two areas where we've got through MVCs, the Barnett and the Haynesville, obviously, were below the MVC in the Barnett. We do look at them on a basin-by-basin basis. And our view is that drilling in the Haynesville will come under the MVC that's growing in that area. And you're seeing that in the volumes that are showing up. But the Barnett is just not attracting the drill bit right now, and we don't think will be for a while, but it still is producing good cash flow in terms of its lifting cost compared to the current netbacks.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","So just to confirm, the Barnett is not attracting the drill bit, likely negative returns for your producer customers and is that the case also in the Haynesville? And that's why you're saying it's going to probably come under the MVCs at some point?","Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area","Well, I wouldn't speculate as to Chesapeake's returns in that area in total. I'll just note that the Barnett's producing good free cash flow in almost any environment and that that Haynesville is attracting drill bit currently.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. My follow-up questions, there was a big pickup in ethane volume sales in the Northeast. I was wondering if you can sort of talk about the big shift. Is it something that you did, is rejection suddenly not happening? I was just wondering if you can sort of give us a little bit of color on that.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure. One thing we didn't mention was that towards the end of the second quarter, we brought our ethane pipeline up there into service. And so, we now are running our de-ethanizer and that ethane pipeline feeds in to the \u2013 some of the contracts where producers have to sell their ethane. And so that is what's driving that. So now, we're getting incremental fees for those ethane services that we wouldn't have been getting until that pipeline and the de-ethanizer replacement service.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Final question. I realize you can't talk about the strategic review process and so forth. I was just wondering if you'd confirm whether a data room is currently open or not.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We're not going to talk about that, Shneur. We're just going to have to hold a very, very firm line on this (32:42) answer your questions on.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. No problem. Thank you very much, guys. I appreciate the color.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just for the strategic process, I appreciate you might not be able to say anything here, but I wanted to bounce a couple of thoughts. Is there anything you can share with us as far as what the timeline might be there? And also, you talked about some smaller bolt-on acquisitions. Does this process interfere with any larger M&A aspirations you might have?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'll take the second question just to say that it is business, as usual, in terms of our bolt-on M&A efforts. And so, we continue to execute on our plan and our strategy in that regard.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for that. And then, in the Northeast, it looks like gathering volumes were down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, but processing was up. I was just wondering if you could share a bit more with us in terms of what you hear with regard to producer customer activity there in the back half of the year, and how you guys are thinking about volumes at this point?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure. I'll just take that real quickly and then if you've got some more detail, Jim Scheel can chime in. Really, the only impact, the gathering volumes and production available is actually growing pretty rapidly. And as you saw, the big increase we had in OVM volumes with a 54% increase in gathering volumes in the Ohio Valley area. But the real impact was from shut-ins, particularly from producers up in the Susquehanna County area and some very substantial shut-ins that are due to lack of infrastructure availability.","So we hear the term gas price there, but in fact, it really \u2013 the problem isn't the gas prices. They were enjoying $270 gas price up there. They would be pulling everything they could, but in fact, with all the constraints and lack of takeaway infrastructure right now, they're not getting that kind of pricing level and so some of those big producers start to bid against themselves as they put additional supplies into the market and so they're taking actions to curtail that production and so \u2013 but in fact continue to develop the reserves, and are making ready for when these big pipeline projects like Leidy Southeast, Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise come on up there.","And so there are some big volumes and big gas purchase contracts that will stand behind those, and so they're readying their availability to deliver against those obligations. And so it's just about that simple. The rest of the business, the Northeast volumes are, in particular, like I said, OVM volumes are doing well and the Utica volumes are doing well as well on the joint venture operations that we have there.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for that. And...","James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast Gathering & Processing","No, I'm sorry. I think Alan got it, thanks.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just a follow-up on the Northeast. You'd outlined some of the cost savings that the Access merger had brought into the fold. I was wondering if you might be able to talk a little bit more about the commercial synergies that you might see. And I think during the Analyst Day, you talked about specific hubs there and opportunities related to that. So are there any further thoughts as far as what joint commercial opportunities could occur after the combination?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Sure. A lot happening there. Probably, the most obvious and the easiest to talk about is in the OVM, in the Ohio Valley Midstream area, where Access's North Victory system sits just to the north of our OVM system and extends the reach there. And as well, the ACMP team's capabilities on building out the gathering systems and the modular compression to attract those volumes is well-known by producers in the area.","And so we have a really big list of producers that we're working with right now that leverage off of the combination of those existing ACMP systems feeding into OVM, as well as the expansion of those systems into new acreage that's been taken up there. So a lot happening on that front, and it really just boils down there \u2013 within OVM, it boils down to the expansion and the reach of our system just got a lot bigger into the OVM processing and fractionation complex.","In addition to that, though, I would mention two other things. First of all, the Utica dry is really starting to hit some \u2013 people \u2013 far exceed especially our expectations, I would say, in terms of the potential of those reserves in production. And we're extremely well-positioned there on capturing the Utica dry business. And so, again, the reach of the Access system that's in the area along with the OVM system is powerful in that regard.","And then, finally, the joint ventures between the Blue Racer Midstream business and the UEO system, both are very well-positioned on the Utica, and are enjoying growth there. And of course, we're looking to find ways to combine those systems in a way that really provides a super system for the area. And we think we're extremely well-positioned to bring that about. So a lot happening there that really is the combination of the historic Access assets and the historic Williams assets.","And I think when we back up couple of years from now and look at this very impressive coverage of the area, in terms of being able to offer producer services on both Utica dry, the Utica wet, and the Marcellus wet, and particularly where those things cross over. So a lot happening there and we couldn't be more excited about the number of opportunities that are coming at us right now in Jim Scheel's area.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And do you see more opportunities to kind of take advantage of that liquids production, extending your footprint further downstream?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know, there's a lot of great projects out there. We are certainly working with our producers who control those liquids to try to find the right opportunities and certainly, are encouraging that infrastructure to get built on the downstream side. And so, I think from our vantage point, we're looking to try to encourage the development of that infrastructure, but it's really our producers' volumes and they'll be the ones that need to speak for the support of those projects.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. And then just one last one if I could. With regard to Geismar, how close will 3Q 2015 be to a complete full quarter? And is the O&M run rate in 2Q, is that a good run rate for the segment?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me have John Dearborn take that.","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams","As Alan mentioned, we made about 5.27 million pounds per day on Tuesday. I think that would be a pretty reasonable rate to expect, because we've been able to demonstrate that for reasonably long periods of time, in excess of a week through this past several weeks as we brought the plant into full operation. So we're very encouraged with where we are today. So I think that's a fair way to look going forward.","I think the one thing to take into consideration on the O&M numbers is we did face a rather substitute power failure, during the second quarter, which would have seen some higher O&M costs. I'm going to venture to say somewhere in the range of about $6 million to repair furnaces, which were unexpected. Those furnaces \u2013 it's a pretty normal thing when you face a significant power outage that you've to go in and repair the furnaces. That's what takes time, and it took some money in the second quarter.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for all the color.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning, Craig.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","So I got one follow-up on Brandon and Jeremy's question in the Northeast and then a couple on commodities. So picking up on the Northeast opportunities, there's been a couple absolutely monster Utica dry gas wells. I think one was just reported this morning, but in the last week a couple really big ones. Is there any way to give a rough range of the potential size of midstream service opportunities in the dry gas area out there?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Great question. And I will tell you that I think the challenge for everybody up there right now is getting the takeaway capacity out of the area. And so, there's no doubt that the potential was there at this point. I don't think anybody that's involved or engaged in the business up there doubts the potential.","And especially, in areas where you already have pads established for the Marcellus wet and even some of the Marcellus dry, the underlying Utica under that and the ability to take advantage of the existing pads and existing infrastructure to bring that production on is where we think a lot of that big production will come on when there's an adequate call for it by the market. But as we sit today, the market \u2013 the supply side is desperate to see those expansion projects come online on the gas takeaway side to be able to alleviate that. So I think that's really the curtailment, if you will, right now, that will stop that from being \u2013 going gangbusters, but it is impressive.","In terms of the opportunity for us, we've got a multi-billion dollar opportunities right now that we're looking at in terms of expansion of our systems up there, a lot of which is driven by both the Utica dry and where it overlays with the Marcellus wet. And so, we've got very \u2013 we're very far along in negotiations. And as I mentioned earlier, that's really where you ought to start to see our growth come from in terms of our potential projects. Besides the Transco demand side, you also should start to expect some of that business that was in the potential start to move into the guidance, as we start to close up on some of that business that's out there in front of us.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. That's helpful. And then, on the commodities side, a couple of related questions. First, on the $150 million of EBITDA guidance change relating to commodity price deck, can you roughly split that between Geismar olefins and all other and elaborate on what you're seeing as drivers right now for olefins crack spreads into 2016? And are you still seeing or expecting at least a couple cent premium to Belvieu there? And then the final thing on new projects relating to commodity issues, any updates on PDH or Geismar 2?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Boy, that was a lot of questions, Craig.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I'm sorry.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Trying to digest them all here.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I can take the \u2013 of the $150 million change in commodities since our February \u2013 we issued that guidance on February based on the price outlook at that time, I'd say something under $60 million was olefins, and the balance was NGL margins and related curtailments.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I got you.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I'd say that's certainly the big numbers was on the NGL piece and then the Geismar piece, which is really behind us now.","The PDH and Geismar 2 \u2013 great progress, really, on both of those projects and both in terms of putting the finishing touches on the contract for the polypropylene at PDH, and we do expect to be bringing that forward here in August before the board for further consideration on that project. But things are actually improving on that project in terms of \u2013 as we've started to getting quotes for a lot of the big equipment for that project. So we're really excited about the way that's going right now.","On Geismar 2, very strong interest from two parties that we had narrowed that down to. And I would say we're into some pretty serious diligence now, with one party, in particular, at this point and I think very serious interest on their part and our part in terms of going ahead with the Geismar 2 project. So really great progress on both fronts there.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And I'm sorry for the barrage at you. The one additional item, I just noticed that with 2015 that coming down, but 2016 unchanged, I think there was over a 30% increase in expected crack spreads, and I was wondering if you could give some additional color around drivers that you're seeing in the 2016 at Geismar.","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams","Yeah, I think there are a couple of things. Let me take that one third in line. First, I'd like to just add to the earlier answer that I gave that that power outage that we faced was related to a utility power failure to our plant so that was not inside our plant. It was rather the supply to the plant that took the plant down, totally unexpectedly, in a very significant severe manner.","Second, you had asked about premium to Belvieu, I believe. And now, with Evangeline running, with us running, that premium has essentially fallen back to more normal levels in the $0.01 or $0.02 range, though remember that Louisiana is a thinly traded market, and so, you don't get every day visibility into what that premium is.","Also, remember that our customers have a call on about 80% of our production. So we have only available to us about 20% sell into the spot market, and coming through the second quarter, certainly, through June and in July, we have been satisfying our full contract requirements to our customers, so selling essentially all of our volume in that contract. There've been some de minimis volumes that we have sold into the spot market only when there were some discontinuities between what our customers needed and what we were able to produce. And now that I've gotten through those two, somehow I've lost track of what the third question was.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It was the 30% increase in crack spread.","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams","The 30% increase in crack spread. Thanks. Well, looking at this year, I think earlier in the year, we were saying that we saw inventories rather low in ethylene and that we could expect some demand growth and we could expect perhaps some disruptions in supply that might drive to a tightness in ethylene that would help improve that situation.","We haven't seen that materialize quite as yet in this year, but certainly, as time passes into next year and subsequent years, up until the time when the new crackers come on, you would expect that continued demand growth, and of course, recoveries of international markets and the like that might be hampering volumes these days would result in some strengthening opportunities for margin growth. And I think that's what we see behind the future there.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Ross Payne of Wells Fargo.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","How are you doing gentlemen?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Couple of quick questions. Could we get a rough debt number or debt number for WMB or WPZ? And secondarily, thanks for the guidance on the fee-based from 2005 (sic) [2015] to 2017. Can you give us a rough estimate of what fee-based is currently for the company?","And then third, I was going through your press release. Can you talk about the profits that the Geismar is currently generating or what it was maybe in the second quarter? Thanks.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Ross. This is Don Chappel. The debt numbers are in the 10-Q that we filed this morning. I'll try to grab something real quick here for you. But again, we filed the Williams and Williams Partners 10-Q this morning. All that detail is out there.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Long term debt, this is at Williams, $21.285 billion.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. I'll check the Q on that.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, great. Thank you.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And on the fee-based?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","The fee-based percentage, I think, for this quarter and for 2015 is going to be in excess of 90%. I think somewhere in the 92% range given that Geismar was down for a portion of the year and kind of where commodities are. We're estimating or forecasting the fee-based percentage to be just a little below that over the three-year period, 2015 through 2017 is about 89%.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And the Geismar profits?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I don't think we've disclosed the specific Geismar profits, but we did indicate that there was $50 million of gross margin for the quarter.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. All right. When I'm looking at the press release and it goes over the Geismar incident adjustment of the negative $126 million, how do I think about that?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That was business interruption and insurance proceeds. Again, a year ago, the plant was down, but we had business interruption insurance. And we estimated that during the second quarter of last year that we had a right to about $122 million. Since that date, we've collected -- we have a $500 million policy. We had losses, property losses approaching $70 million with just a little over $430 million, I believe, of BI. We've collected more than $420 million. We have a claim for $20 million that's open that's still being negotiated with an insurer, but again, the vast majority of our insurance claim has now been paid.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Looking at this, I mean it looked like it was $96 million in the second quarter 2014 and then it swung to a negative $126 million for the second quarter of 2015, so.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Again, there's a difference between GAAP and adjusted. So for GAAP, for financial statement purposes, we record the cash, the insurance proceeds when we have a signed settlement agreement with the insurers or we actually receive the cash. For adjusted earnings, we in effect accrued it based on our expectation of collection.","John Dearborn from Investor Relations can walk you through the...","Unknown Speaker","John Porter.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","John Porter.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","John Porter, excuse me. John Porter in our IR shop can walk you through the GAAP to non-GAAP numbers.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And just one more, do you guys know the timing of when your strategic review will be complete? Thanks.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","There is no timing announced.","Ross Payne - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. Great. Thanks, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, thanks very much, Ross.","Operator","We'll go next to Timm Schneider of Evercore.","Timm Schneider - Evercore ISI","Hey, good morning, guys. Hey, Alan, when we spoke in April, I think you were saying this was the earliest time you guys had locked up all of your Conway storage and rail racks for some of the Northeast NGLs. Obviously, if you look at some of the E&P numbers, realizations were pretty awful. I was just wondering how you guys see that shake out as we get into the shoulder season of 2016, right, Q2, Q3 without really any incremental export capacity slated to come on until the end of that year and what impact that's going to have?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, Timm, great question and certainly one that a lot of people should be paying attention to, obviously.","I do think that even though the export capacity, not any new export capacity coming on, there is, as you know, that hasn't been fully utilized. And I think the limitation there has been on ships having the capacity to carry that out. So I think that's kind of the next bottleneck, if you will, for the industry to face. And so, I think keeping a close eye on the availability of the shipping capacity to get out of the exports is probably the next thing to keep our eye on in terms of opening the markets up.","But other than that, I don't really see much changing here domestically in terms of either storage capacity or rail loading capacity. I would say everything that can move and store NGLs right now is in full utilization, and building up behind the next bottleneck, which, as I mentioned, in this case is the export capacity getting the shipping capacity available to them.","So I think that's the next thing to keep our eyes on here in the shoulder month. But certainly we don't see any near-term big relief here. I think we're probably three to four months out before we start to seize a lot of that capacity out there (56:35).","Timm Schneider - Evercore ISI","Okay. And then my follow-up is, you obviously saw a large proposed merger transaction up in the Northeast with two of your competitors. From your standpoint, how does that change the competitive landscape in the Northeast in terms of competing for projects and whatnot, how do you guys see that from your perspective?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't really expect a whole lot of change. I think from our perspective, we're pretty excited to see Marathon bringing their business and they've always had an interest and are very well positioned to take care of lot of the heavies and the condensate in the area. And so, we're really excited to have them engaged in bringing takeaway solutions to the area.","So I would say that's kind of the net positive out of it. In terms of competition, I think we've got such major acreage dedications already to us and it's a matter of getting the takeaway capacity coming online for the Northeast and now, even for the Marcellus and the dry Utica. And I think that will be really the drivers there is that capacity coming online and then we will be in a position to provide a lot of supply infrastructure to handle that, as those markets open up in the future. So I really see that as really the determinant up there more than the competitive landscape.","Timm Schneider - Evercore ISI","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","We will go next to Sharon Lui of Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Just a quick question for John. Perhaps maybe you can just talk about your outlook for NGL pricing up in Canada and how maybe the recent weakness could impact I guess the returns of some projects coming on in the back half of this year?","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams","Yeah, it's a great question. And perhaps I can take it on by giving a little bit of background on how we make money there. And I think it's important for us all to remember that we make money on the spreads between gas and what is substantially an olefin stream. So we make money between gas and propylene and gas and uplift. And of course, we're protected on core price on our ethylene production up there in Canada.","And so, really the substantive exposure that we face that I think \u2013 and certainly causes us concern is on the NGL portion or the (59:20) portion of that production. And certainly, today, propane is not returning a cheap value. And so, therefore, it's the one product that is not making money for us up in the Canadian pocket right now. And so we're just looking for opportunities where we might be able to mitigate that situation.","We haven't found it yet. So I don't have a clear solution for you yet, but we have found a way to deal with the heavier part of the barrel. It's making money now and all the rest of the parts of the barrel are making money. And so, if you think about the pocket in that way, I think you'll understand that we're still contributing income in Canada despite the NGL difficulty.","One last point, though, and that is the stranded (1:00:13) nature of that propane up in Alberta does substantiate our thesis on why we think the PDH and the creation of a demand center (1:00:22) in Canada creates a value-added project and a sustainably advantage project into the future.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Do you see any potential catalyst that would decrease that propane oversupply in Canada?","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams","Well, if you mean by catalyst a process that uses a catalyst to convert the propane into something else? I'm sorry.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Or maybe a project that would alleviate the oversupply situation up in Canada, like any drivers?","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams","The only thing that we occasionally seek through is whether (1:01:05) would ever reverse but right now, the (1:01:07) is needed up in Canada, and so, in the absence of another large pipeline that traverses rather long distances to move the propane to the Midwest or somewhere else in the United States, I think it's very hard to imagine something that's going to alleviate the situation on propane.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would just say, Sharon, and certainly, we've got our eyes on that, and as John mentioned, there are ways that we're looking to help mitigate that. And part of that is to getting the propane back into the fuel markets. So if you think about that, where there are big straddle plants that are extracting propane, our facility extracting propane, the simple way is to get those propane barrels back into the gas stream where they came from in the first place in the most part and I think you'll see moves on people's parts to start to get a lot of that propane back into those streams.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess just a follow-up, how should we think about the near-term returns on the Horizon investment?","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams","Well, in the near-term while NGL prices are still where they are, I'd suspect they're probably going to fall a little bit short of where we would expect long-term returns to be. I think on a volume perspective, think of Horizon as being about a third of what we're doing (1:02:37) today. So I think that gives you a view on both the margin and the kind of volume.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So just to remind you though on that, Sharon, the bulk of the income on that asset really comes off the propylene and the butylene and then the ethane, which has the fee-based contract or the floor (1:02:59) contract for the ethane already embedded, which gives us a margin on the ethane and ethylene. So that's really where the bulk of the value comes from and the propane stream, even though it's very depressed right now, certainly has not been and isn't expected to be a big contributor to value in the future.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And our final question in the queue comes from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, Alan. Thanks for the color this morning.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","I have a few questions. I promise to be quick. First, following on Shneur's inquiry about the relationship with Chesapeake, I'm just wondering \u2013 you were speaking specifically or inquiring specifically about the MVCs. I'm just curious sort of more broadly about the counterparty exposure you had to them. There's obviously been some visible setbacks for them over the last couple of months. So I guess within the context of that, have you tempered at all your expectations for the cost of service growth in the Northeast? I know your guidance in aggregate remained unchanged 2016 to 2018, but wondering if there was any movement within that on cost of service efforts, given CapEx headwinds potentially? And then, related, any recent conversations with them about the midstream contracts you have with them, any effort to renegotiate, do you see that as a risk?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'll take a stab at the broad relationship and the contract discussions, and I'll ask Bob Purgason to speak to the cost of service expectations in the Northeast and broadly.","First of all, on a broad level, I'll just tell you we continue to enjoy very good relationship with Chesapeake. We're very impressed with their responsiveness to the situation that they're in. And I can tell you that they continue to work hard. Obviously, they announced an asset sale in the quarter. And they continue to look for opportunities, and we continue to be constructive in working with them where we can on that. And I would just tell you, again, I remain very impressed and very confident in their actions to put themselves in a position to have the right capital focused on the right assets. And I'm confident that they're going to be able to do that.","And in terms of restructuring, certainly, they take the lead on that, and we try to provide support and find win-win ways where they can add volumes that help offset some of those obligations and that's the kind of things that we're looking at. And I'm not going to get ahead of them on that, but I would just tell you we're very excited about some of the new opportunities that we can help with where they can bring on new volumes up against existing obligations.","And with that, I'll have Bob try to take the cost of service question.","Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area","Yeah. Just in terms of our cost of service growth, there in the Northeast, it's really in our Marcellus north area where we're adding some compression to continue to support the development there.","I'd note that's an area where the cost of service contracts are delivering, we'll call it, great market fees. You noticed we had a fee reduction in the first quarter, and it was related some \u2013 a part of it was the fee reduction in that north area due to the high volumes that drive that fee lower. So we continue to see that.","And then our Utica area, which is cost of services well continuing to expand compression there to support really great wet Utica results that you're also seeing show up in our UEO OVM volumes. So, no, we still see particularly those Northeast contracts as good strong pieces of our portfolio and also look to be good in Chesapeake's activity as well.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay, great. Thanks a lot for that color. I guess, sticking on the Northeast and this is sort of a follow-up to Craig's question about the monster dry gas Utica wells we've seen recently. From a gathering perspective, can you address those types of wells or pads with the same type of infrastructure you've been using? Or is it a concentrated magnitude of production from those wells is going to alter how you have to service them and does that have any ramifications on either the type of return or the profile of return you might see gathering for such well?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would just say that certainly already having the right-of-way and the infrastructure in the area, as you know, in a lot of our OVM area, we have a loop system, so we have one line that we can dedicate to rich service and one line that we can dedicate to lean service. Having said that, the kind of size of some of these wells that are being hit are obviously going to require some massive expansion of those systems.","And I will just tell you that having the right-of-way established and having the interconnect into multiple takeaway pipelines is going to be what is valuable. And that's exactly how we're positioning ourselves out there. But I would just \u2013 if you think about it, an existing pad up there is almost like \u2013 and sometimes I think it's even more so the case, it's almost like an offshore platform, because the real estate up there, getting a flat spot, and having a road into it, and having pipelines into it in that very difficult terrain up there is really a precious piece of real estate.","And so that's where you'll see the development of a lot of that Utica drive, particularly in the northern part of West Virginia there. And so we have the pipelines into those locations and the right-of-way into those locations. And I think we'll be very successful in continuing to pick up those volumes as they come on there.","But you're right, the existing infrastructure \u2013 to the degree that we get takeaway capacity established out of the area, and by that I mean long haul pipeline, long-haul interstate pipelines established in the area, the existing infrastructure would be overwhelmed if the producers started going after drilling plan in those areas, because there is so much productivity available from those areas. Obviously, though the productivity is going to have to stay in check with demand in the market.","Robert S. Purgason - Senior Vice President, Access Operating Area","Yeah. I think it's a great example of where Access legacy and The Williams fit together, right, because this initial wave of development is going to be used in existing plumbing, to the extent that we've got proximal pipelines and\/or rights-of-way we can give near-term service. And then we can wait for this big takeaway opportunity which is going to create a whole new wave of large infrastructure investment to meet these big wells. So I think we're positioned well to capture that business and give near-term service to those who want to produce dry wells given their economics.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think one of the interesting elements of all this big Utica dry gas that may or may not be obvious at this point, is that it really is going to provide a lot of blending capacity into the gas pipelines. And so, if you think about this concern about the ethane recoveries and ethane takeaway, all of this big dry gas really provides a lot more capacity to put ethane into the long haul pipeline and still meet gas specs.","And ultimately, what that means is it somewhat it helps solve the storage problem or ethane feed into some of the big crackers that are being developed there, because in effect, the gas pipelines become that storage element, and if there's a problem with the cracker, the ethane just goes into the gas stream, but still stays on spec. So that's actually one of the really interesting developments from our perspective coming out of this big Utica dry volumes that we're seeing show up.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","That's a great point, Alan. I guess my final question. You mentioned takeaway from the basin, and so I just wanted to follow-up with you quickly on Constitution. I think at the time of your Analyst Day, you were waiting or hopeful for a New York DEC permit in June. I know that didn't happen, but I'm just curious for an update on where the regulatory process for that project stands? I realize it's not a huge CapEx item for you in the greater context, but when we think about the effect on the basin takeaway, just curious for an update.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'd just tell you we've been working very closely with the DEC and are excited and very optimistic about where we stand and would hope to see a permit very soon.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Is there a point, at which \u2013 does it have a cascade? Is there a point at which it has a cascading effect on the timeline that you've put forth for in-service, or are we anywhere near that in your mind?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think right now, we feel good about the date that we put out there for getting that finished by the end of 2016, and so, I think right now, we feel pretty confident in that and feel like we've got a good path to get that done. So there're certainly some tight windows that will be pushing through here and we hope in the very near future. But we remain confident as we see here today in that.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Great. I appreciate your time. Thanks again for taking my question.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Well, thank you all very much for joining us today. Really tremendous amount of fee-based revenue growth that's coming on, excited to have the Geismar expansion behind us and having that up and running and really excited about the way the execution is going on these major projects that are out in front of us and we're just going to continue to march our fee-based revenue growth up 17% in the first quarter growth, 17% here in the second-quarter growth, and we're just going to continue to see a big march as these projects come on.","So I appreciate your involvement in the company and we look forward to updating you on our shareholder value propositions as that becomes available.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Porter","Thank you, Glynne. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners.","Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying Analyst Packages; a presentation discussing these results, guidance updates and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.","This morning, Alan will make a few comments, and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our Midstream business; Frank Ferazzi is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel, is also available to respond to any questions.","In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that's been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Thank you, John, and thanks to all of you on the phone and webcast, who have joined us this morning. I'm certainly looking forward to your questions. Before we open up the phone lines, I want to take the opportunity to briefly touch on a few key themes for the Williams and Williams Partners investment story. In short, we are rewarding investors now with strong dividend and cash distribution growth through the guidance period and we are expanding our business to create continuing value growth in a very resilient future dividend and distribution growth.","First, let's take a look at our fourth quarter performance. We turned in solid results in line with our third quarter guidance, despite a natural gas liquids margin environment that dropped even faster than we expected. To give some scale to that drop and to the headwinds we were facing, it's important to understand that our fourth quarter NGL margins were down 46% from the prior year, margins took another 8% hit from what we thought were low third quarter levels; and from a financial perspective, our fourth quarter NGL margins were off about $75 million compared just to the midpoint of the forecast that we shared at the third quarter results.","Much of this didn't show up in the unit margin because we didn't produce ethane when it was in the negative margin territory. So what you saw there is a little bit higher unit margin than you might have expected but lower volumes as a result of that ethane rejection. We provide some detail in our slides regarding the positions that allowed us to overcome these very low NGL margins but here are some of the highlights there. First, we're successfully growing our fee-based revenues in this business for Williams Partners. In the Midstream segment, we generated fourth quarter fee-based revenues 18% higher than a year ago. For both the Midstream and gas pipeline business, we generated fee-based revenues that were up 5% from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. And second, we continue to benefit from the natural hedge against ethane exposure that our Olefins business creates. Williams Partners benefited in the last 2 months of 2012 with the acquisition of the Olefins business and there is even greater benefit for WPZ ahead with the well-timed expansion of the Geismar facility expected in service later this year.","This combination supports our ability to reward investors with strong growth in cash dividends and cash distributions. We are reaffirming our guidance at midpoint to grow Williams' cash dividend by some 20% with this year and -- for both this year and next year. And for Williams Partners, we are reaffirming our guidance at midpoint to increase the cash distributions we pay unitholders by approximately 9% in both '13 and '14.","When we add our large platform of growth capital projects and the rapid growth in cash distributions we're expecting from a recent investment in Access Midstream, what you'll have is a value-creation engine that is powerful, durable and resilient and will continue to grow for many years to come.","In our earnings announcements yesterday afternoon, you also saw that we are lowering our 2013 and '14 earnings and cash flow guidance. We expect the growth in our fee-based business will partially offset the effect of sharply lower ethane and propane prices and ethylene prices in '14. And we will see Williams Partners benefiting from the late 2012 acquisition of Williams' Olefins business and a significant expansion of our Geismar facility in the fourth quarter. And I also would remind you that we have quite a bit of collared contracts that are expiring here in the first quarter of '13 and of course, those allow us to get even better exposed to the weak ethane price and continue our short position at Geismar there on ethane.","Our coverage at WPZ is certainly being impacted by the heavy load of investing about $12 billion in growth capital during the 3-year period from '12 through '14. But we're deploying that capital towards a vast array of great growth projects across our operating areas from the Marcellus and Utica Shales in Canada to the Eastern Seaboard and the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico. These are projects that we know and understand, many are well into the construction phase and the essential ingredient in these value-creating projects is largely within our reach, it's our execution.","If I can direct you, for future reference, to Slide 13 in the quarterly presentation materials that are posted on our websites, you'll see here exactly where we are spending that $12 billion and when exactly it begins to contribute to our cash flows. I think you'll agree that these projects are very strategic, they are large scale and they move us even more significantly toward a business mix dominated by a revenue stream that can support strong continued growth in dividends and distributions, and these growth investments largely start contributing in meaningful value in 2015 and beyond. So there is much good yet to come with these major strategic investments that we continue to invest heavily into.","This natural gas infrastructure super cycle is creating tremendous opportunities for North America, our industry and importantly, for Williams and Williams Partners. We are aggressively pursuing and executing on these opportunities to deliver shareholder value for years to come and we remain committed to the idea that there is a lot of value associated with this large-scale infrastructure.","Now let's open the phone lines and I'll let others on our executive leadership team help answer your questions this morning.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","How are you guys planning to fund the coverage shortfall at WPZ in '13? Is it going to be with debt or are you going to do IDR waivers? And can you just remind me what has been disclosed to date for IDR waivers, is it $105 million in '13 and $16 million in '14?","Donald R. Chappel","Christine, this is Don Chappel. In terms of the exact funding plan, we've not disclosed that but we do have a lot of flexibility around that. It will be a combination of debt and equity. Certainly, Williams is well positioned to support WPZ in many ways. But we have no additional IDR waivers contemplated at this time. The IDR waivers that are currently have been granted are very modest and I think you mentioned those numbers and they just go out for 2 years.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Can you just talk about what your plans are for the extra cash at WMB otherwise? Especially with the...","Donald R. Chappel","We have a number of investment opportunities in the NGL pipeline, Petchem pipeline space, where Alan has laid out our strategy earlier about building that business and Alan can speak to that again. So that's an opportunity. And the balance, we have some flexibility. And so we'll look at the facts and circumstances to determine what the best use of that excess cash is.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Can you give a little more detail about how the investment in ACMP brought your cash taxes to 0 in '13 and 10% in '14?","Donald R. Chappel","Sure. Our investment -- again, there is an allocation for tax purposes. The inside basis at ACMP did not change. Our investment was allocated between hard assets and intangibles. In terms of the hard assets, they enjoy accelerated depreciation. And the intangibles enjoy straight line depreciation. But it's really the depreciation of that investment that's creating a very large tax deduction for us, which, over the next few years, will significantly lower our tax rate. In addition, the January '13 fiscal cliff legislation included an extension of bonus depreciation. And given the large amount of capital that we continue to invest, that's pretty significant as well.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, I noticed that your Geismar expansion, the start date was pushed back by a quarter. Can you talk about what's going on there?","Alan S. Armstrong","I'll address that now and I'll ask, maybe Rory, to hit a little harder on that. We really didn't push it back as much as -- that's not really the cause of the drop in volumes there. But we are giving ourselves some room for the tie-ins and some expanded tie-in work on there. So I would just say, we're being fairly conservative and knowing that when you go to start up a facility like that, often, there is bobbles and interruptions as you try to do that, and we're planning for that rather than explaining that later. So that's really the purpose for that, but really, the startup is still scheduled right into the October time frame.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then, you talked about how you started to recently see ethane rejection during the fourth quarter. How much did you reject in 4Q? And then, also, you've talked about how you're assuming that all your equity volumes are going to be rejected in the first quarter of '13, what does your guidance assume for the rest of the year?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, let me take a look at that on fourth quarter. I know in the first quarter of '13, we've got rejection planned for the entire period. But if you can hang on just a second here. The fourth quarter, yes, looks like we had about 2 to 3 weeks in December of ethane rejection.","Donald R. Chappel","This is Don Chappel, just related to that, I'd just refer you to Slide #8 in our deck that illustrates the declining ethane margin with lower frac spreads but the widening crack margin at Geismar. And I'd note there that at our assumed about $0.06 of margin there, that equates to about -- I think, it's $27 million of remaining ethane margins. So we have very little ethane exposure left. And in fact, as ethane prices go lower, that $27 million does not include the benefit of Geismar's margins expanding. So if you look at the sensitivities in our data book, you can get some sense of the combined effect. But again, there is only $27 million of total ethane margin assumed in 2013. In our data book, we have the same slide for 2014, and you'll see with the Geismar expansion, while the ethane margin is assumed to be a bit wider, the Geismar expansion completely mitigates that. And I think I've mentioned to some investors before, if ethane prices go to the point that we are in full rejection and go even lower, then, we've taken all the pain on the ethane margin and then, Geismar starts to see even greater gains as its costs go down.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. And then, the last question for me. This is more of an accounting question. But how are you calculating the adjusted segment profit for Access Midstream Partners? Is that just net income that you expect at ACMP and multiply it by your ownership? It just seems a little light. I'm just trying to figure out, do the Class C units participate in earnings but not the Class B, is that how that works?","Donald R. Chappel","Our proportionate share of their equity earnings and then, again, our purchase price was allocated, in part, to intangibles. Some of the intangibles are contracts and we have depreciation or amortization of that. That totaled about $65 million in both '13 and '14. So  [indiscernible] earnings are reduced by that amortization expense and you can see from a cash flow standpoint if you add that back, you get to a segment profit plus DD&A or an EBITDA number. Our pro rata share, it's $65 million higher than the earnings. So I think we are on, in terms of our share from more of a cash flow perspective, segment profit plus DD&A, so that's not actually the distribution, but is $103 million in '13, $160 million in '14.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. First, maybe, start with the macro. Can you just give us a little color on what you're seeing right now in the ethane and propane markets? And anything maybe nearer term that could drive pricing? You probably know better than most that most of the E&Ps right now are forecasting ethane rejection for most of 2013.","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, I think the market on the ethane side continues to struggle to balance itself with a lot of new projects coming on, continuing to come on, major NGL pipelines, major fractionators continuing to come on that will continue to provide plenty of supply into a market that is going to be slow to grow. I think, obviously, with our expansion and other expansions, we'll see a little bit of growth this year. But in -- it's probably a couple years out before we really see the market try to catch up with all that supply on the ethane side. So we really don't see a lot of upside. For us, the best thing that can happen for us is probably volatility here in '13. And then, a weak -- a very weak ethane price in '14. And if that happens, then, we'll have some upside to what we have forecasted here for '13 and '14. On the propane side, I would say the fundamentals are a little more positive there. Certainly, a lot of cracking going on right now. Propane is at a price that is encouraging. A lot of cracking of propane and our crackers running rich and probably any other light-end crackers running rich and running propane in it right now as much as they can because propylene prices are so high that, that's making that a favored feedstock. So that, combined with hopefully some larger export facilities coming on later this year, I think that will start to balance the fundamentals a little better on propane. So I would say a little bit of upside to propane, but still that market has a lot of supply still available in it. I would say this, that there is a lot of propane that is on the market that can be trucked and railed and so forth, that is already in the market supply versus ethane that is being rejected and not on the supply scene. Said another way, when a lot of these big NGL pipelines come online, they're going to have the capacity for ethane but a lot of that propane is already getting captured in local fractionators and being trucked and railed. So it won't be as large of an incremental supply into the market when that infrastructure comes online.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, maybe just sticking with propane. What's the latest on the PDH project?","Alan S. Armstrong","We're very excited about that project. A lot of things coming together quickly on it. And we've been -- we've contracted with an engineering firm to do a feed study on it. And I would say, we look forward to accelerating the decision on that project with continued strong fundamentals for low propane prices in Canada, with very little outlet for the propane out of Canada and as well, a lot of interest in the propylene supplies that we already have. As you recall, from our Redwater fractionator and splitter, we already have a pretty large propylene supply there, this would add to that and starts to get to a level that it could attract derivative investment downstream, which would really be a homerun for us because it would take that rail -- some of that rail cost out that we're investing in today into the Gulf Coast.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","So maybe a decision by year-end?","Alan S. Armstrong","Oh, I would say, it would be quite a bit sooner than that.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then, I appreciate the additional Marcellus-related detail on your systems and expansion plans. I guess, bigger picture, what are the production bottlenecks today?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. I would say that for the most part, it is around liquids, particularly, for instance, in the wet Marcellus and in the West Virginia area. That production has a lot more condensate and is a lot richer than really anybody, I think, expected -- certainly, we expected it, anyway, speaking for ourselves and I think for the producers as well. And so a lot of the facilities there really haven't been designed to be able to handle all those liquids. So there's a lot of redo work going on up there and there is a lot of production that is sitting, waiting behind infrastructure, on both our facilities and other people's facilities as well. And so we're working hard to overcome that. But I can tell you that we have a lot of frustrated producers sitting behind our production. And obviously, we're anxious to get things remedied and bring it online as well. But there is a significant amount of production that is curtailed, either by a lack of connection or in some cases, just unreliable operations where the pipelines continue to fill up with liquids and shut in the gas production.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","And is there more volume on a particular system of yours that's backed up?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. The Ohio Valley Midstream is really the one that's curtailed, the other systems are running fairly well. We have had a few struggles in getting the Laser pipeline up and running. And so we've had a little bit of curtailed volume in the Northeast. But as you can see, it's not curtailing it a lot because you can see how fast the volumes have come up, 80% year-on-year there. So hard to say it's heavily curtailed, but there is some curtailment there on the north end of the Laser system.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then, one last one, I promise. Just a cleanup. What was your 4Q ethylene cracker spread? And then, the full year as well, that you realized?","Alan S. Armstrong","Randy, you want to take that?","Randall L. Barnard","Just a moment, I'll look that up so we can come back with a...","Alan S. Armstrong","Holly, was the question, what our ethylene crack spread was at Geismar?","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, for 4Q and then full year, if you have got it. And that's it for me, so you can pass it on.","Randall L. Barnard","Full year was $0.40. I don't know what -- just the quarter was, but I think the full year spread was $0.40.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I understand all the issues surrounding lower commodity prices and I appreciate the comments last night in your podcast on the constraints you're having in the Marcellus. I was wondering if you could quantify some of those constraints. It seems like if I -- if we look at your presentations in the past versus the presentation you put out last night, that your volume assumptions for 2013 out of the Marcellus and Utica, are lower than what you guys had anticipated previously when you looked at these assets last year. Can you quantify for us exactly what's going on? And then, I have a follow-up question to that.","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. I'll ask Frank Billings to take that question.","Francis E. Billings","Yes, this is Frank Billings. I'd say, if we were going to quantify today the volume, kind of, curtailment issues that we're having in the Ohio Valley, I could put that at about 100 million to 150 million a day of volume that we have, that the producers could be producing into our gathering systems. For the forecast period, we're moving our volumes back to address kind of both the operating issues that were experienced in OVM and then, certain producers drilling investment to better align their drilling dollars with getting the best net backs for commodities produced. So I think that's the things driving our volume forecast today in that part of the Northeast.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","If I'm looking at your own '13 and '14 guidance for volumes, you'd say that those numbers have been curtailed by about 150 a day?","Francis E. Billings","Well, I think that's what's hitting us today. Our expectation is that we would be getting those volumes back online. But we have some operational things we need to solve and some asset modifications that we have to make at some of the central receipt points in the field so that we can get that volume flowing. But that volume's available to us today, we just have to get some of our assets better situated to handle the condensate volumes and get the -- so that we can get the production flowing consistently.","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. I would say in general there, we are very encouraged with the resource and the value it can deliver to the producers. But there are a lot of infrastructure constraints, including both the upstream side and as well, the downstream market side. So us continuing to develop infrastructure for the NGL market outlets and the condensate outlets, is critical to the success of the producers. And so I think, even though there's already this amount of production sitting and waiting, I don't think they'll continue to drill so robustly if we don't start to provide the market outlets up there in an unconstrained way, and we're certainly working very rapidly on that. So a lot of great opportunity. The good news is, it's a great resource. And I would just say, it's even better than most people thought and therefore, it is requiring some -- pretty rapid expansions on the market outlets and the upstream infrastructure.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And Alan, do you worry about basis kind of narrowing in the Marcellus and Columbia pool area? It seems like we've basically gotten close to parity to Hub and in some situations, it looks like we actually moved into a negative basis in that region? Do you worry about that and that kind of crimping production volume growth?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I think what you'll see -- I think it will be hard to see what the actual basis differential. But the answer to your question is yes, we've got to continue to open up market outlets for both the gas and the liquids. But I would tell you right now probably, the liquids is the bigger driver on that. But I think what you really are going to see are kind of inter-regional spikes. And so it's not just what you could see as a East Dominion price or a Columbia price. It's really going to boil down to inter-regional prices and what pipes people are actually getting paid. Now if they have firm transport out of the area and they get into Zone 6 on Transco, that's a beautiful thing right now for somebody, but obviously, that capacity is limited. And so I would just say, I think it's very, very spotty up there. And I don't think those basis differentials really tell us the whole story for what producers are getting for their gas right now.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, on the Western volumes. Is anything changed in your guidance or expectations in the West for this year versus what you had expected previously?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, pretty limited change on that, I believe, and continued -- I would say the one thing that I'm aware of that's changed is -- and certainly embedded in our guidance at this point though -- is we did have a lot of production froze off in the first quarter, not from our facilities, for the most part, but certainly producer freeze off in the San Juan Basin and some in the Wamsutter area and so we certainly saw some impact here in the first quarter on fee-based volumes there.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, last question for me. On the quarterly comments that you have in your press release, you talked about earnings being impacted by increased cost and lower NGL margins. Can you just give us an idea of what you're talking about, what you mean by increased costs?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, certainly, getting all these businesses started up is a heavy load, developing a lot of these projects is a heavy load. So for instance, you'll see a little spike in cost in Canada, for instance, and a lot of that of course, is in developing a project like a PDH project. And so we've got a lot of upfront development expenses. You'll notice that we're pretty conservative how we book that. You'll notice in the fourth quarter, in the gas pipeline segment, we took a $19 million reduction in expense that basically was expenses that we had on capital projects earlier that we don't capitalize until we know that project's going to come through. And so in other words, we expensed those and hold them in an account until we're sure the project's approved and permitted. And so that's where some of that kind of expense is from. So when we've got a big, heavy capital budget like we have right now, a lot of the expenses in developing those projects weigh heavy against our expense line until those projects are capitalized.","Gary Stromberg - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And would you say that those higher expenses are running through your numbers right now are higher than what you guys had previously envisioned in your last guidance?","Alan S. Armstrong","I don't think there's too much more than what was in the last guidance, maybe, on the PDH project. But again, if we approve that this year, then that expense gets capitalized moving forward, so...","Donald R. Chappel","Just to be clear, the phenomenon that Alan mentioned in the fourth quarter is unique to our regulated gas pipeline business where, in that business, you expense it until you have a probable asset. And then, once it becomes probable, you can actually capitalize previously expensed projects. In the nonregulated business, you expense it and then, when you have a probable project, you expense going forward. But you can't go back and, call it, reclaim what you previously expensed.","Operator","We'll go next to Bradley Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Quick question on -- and I realize that it's a similar question to one that's been asked already. But when you talk about the volume impacts, the limited volume impacts between the guidance provided on the third quarter call and the guidance provided for the fourth quarter. Can you quantify, in terms of either segment profit or EBITDA, the expected impact from volumetric declines, either in the Western or the Eastern portions of the Midstream business on segment profit or EBITDA in '13 and '14?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. I think in the -- I think the 150 or so that Frank talked about along with some other small things, I think it's about $85 million, maybe $80 million to $120 million in total there is about what's in there.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And one of the, I guess, notes in the presentation when you announced the Access transaction and mentioned again in your fourth quarter materials is the potential NGL pipeline project out of the Marcellus. And I guess, I'd be interested in your thoughts about how a heavy NGL pipeline out of the Northeast might potentially impact demand for local fractionation? And to the extent that a pipeline might reduce the demand for local, kind of, Northeast-sided fractionation, how a potential pipeline project maybe underwritten by Chesapeake volumes, would impact your plans for the development of the Caiman or the Ohio Valley Midstream assets?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, that is an excellent question. And I'll tell you, we have a very good vantage point, as you can imagine, given our investment in ACMP and our investment in Blue Racer. We have a very good vantage point up there right now around the degree of fractionation and the degree of liquids that's available from this area. And I would just tell you, I don't think that local fractionation is the answer up here. It is certainly going to overwhelm these markets and something large-scale is going to need to be built. And even, frankly, as it supports an ethylene cracker that Shell has announced and others have talked about, that also -- having a big Raw Make line provides a lot of flexibility in terms of ethane access back and forth between those markets. And so we think that something definitely needs to be done there, and we're working very hard on that. You heard Don mention earlier when asked about what we were going to do with all the extra cash at WMB, and based on both continued cash distributions as well as -- I think, when you do the math on it, you'll see there's quite a bit of extra cash distribution there, particularly in '13 and '14 given the tax rate and the performance in Canada. And so that is a very interesting place for us right now and I'll tell you, we have teams working that very hard and it's not as simple as just building a Raw Make pipeline into the Gulf Coast. There's a tremendous amount of issues about where you land that product and having the distribution network to distribute that product into the market and into big market outlets as we go forward. And so I think, if it was just as simple as just a Raw Make pipeline, we'd probably be past that at this point. But there's quite a bit of work we're doing on the distribution and storage end.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And given your comments that fractionation will likely overwhelm local demand in the Northeast, does that make your Ohio Valley development more biased to focusing on just de-ethanization opportunities or maybe less focused on the fractionation and more focused on the gathering and processing side of things?","Francis E. Billings","This is Frank Billings. I'd say, it's a very good question. I think what we see relative to your fractionation investment is that Williams will still have the opportunity to make those fractionation investments. I think what we're really evaluating is the market location for those fractionation investments. The producers that we have behind our OVM assets are going to be looking for a portfolio of markets to get into. And I think we are well-positioned to provide local market opportunities for those producers that want to have access to those markets but then, I think we're also going to be able to provide Gulf Coast markets and Gulf Coast access. So we're trying to position the producers such that they can maximize the value of their net back, and we feel like we'll still be able to make those investments, it may just be in different markets. We are looking at -- behind OVM, and we think in this market place in the Northeast, we think there's opportunities to have some customized solutions or customized infrastructure investments that allow Shell and others that are looking at chemical expansions to have the ethane that they need and give them ethane supplies certainty so they can make their investments. And then we're looking at producers in Canada that want to have the condensates. So we're looking at ways to consolidate our commodities such that they can have access to those. And then, obviously, the local market, we'll look at -- to propanize our investments to the extent that the propanization option makes sense. But with access to the Gulf Coast, you're going to see -- you're going to start to see those different commodities being sold into those markets based on the best net back at that time. And I think what we're doing with the NGL infrastructure is providing the best opportunities for our producers. And we think that's advantageous for them long-term, but it also, I think, it allows for us to place some pretty strategic investments in that area, as well as the Gulf Coast.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one last question for me. Given the fact that you guys have made moves in, say, Western Canada to take an area that's long propane and create your own solution to that with the PDH facility. When you look at the Northeast, really, Williams is pretty uniquely positioned in the sense that you are probably the only operator, either midstream or upstream up there, who's got the know-how, who's got the access to liquids volumes on the upstream side, as well as the know-how to execute an olefins or petrochemical project. Given the fact that, I'd say, the noises out of Shell, it sounds like they're probably a little bit more slow-moving and conservative than folks who are long ethane producers, who are long ethane in the Northeast would like. Isn't there an opportunity for Williams to get involved on the petrochemical side, and maybe preempt a third-party petrochemical project by building your own or JV-ing with one of those companies?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. I would just say, first of all, our focus on the petchem side is to continue to provide market outlet for both our product and for our producers' product and not to go headlong into the petrochemical business. And so I think it's always important to remember that, that we see that as a great hedge to our business, and we think it's important -- an important part of a midstream company's role today with all the independent producers that we have, to develop the infrastructure and the market outlets. And so while 20 years ago, you would've seen the majors developing all of that infrastructure and all of that market outlet ahead -- or in concert with developing a big resource, we think it's the role today of the major midstream players to do that. And so it's not out of the question, but I would just tell you that we have looked at it and looked at it, and we think all of the investment required in storage, particularly underground storage -- which as you can imagine, is a challenge in the Northeast -- and all of the derivative market for all the product that's already interconnected in the Gulf Coast, is quite a bit to overcome. And so we certainly aren't the chemical players that Shell Chemical is and certainly, wouldn't doubt their understanding of that market. But from our standpoint, we'd have to get way into a lot of other derivative markets and so forth to overcome that. And so for us, we think the simplest way is to get some of that product into markets that are expanding. And frankly, we look forward to working with Shell to help provide supplies -- as that is another market outlet as well, and we certainly intend to be connected with that if they go forward with that project.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I want to come back to this question on the use of cash at WMB. And if you look at, I guess, Page 83 of the data book, you've got about $2.32 of cash flow you're going to generate even before the Canadian operations, but paying out $1.75. If I just kind of play back what I've heard, it sounds like your preference is to reinvest that excess cash flow into infrastructure rather than paying it out, maybe even, say, a special dividend or whatnot? Maybe you can just walk us through how you're thinking about that excess cash flow?","Donald R. Chappel","Ted, this is Don. Yes, I think we would prefer to reinvest it. We think that it's certainly, in terms of a dividend -- to increase the dividend on the back of accelerated depreciation with knowledge that the rate's going to go up in a couple of years, is really not that sustainable. Obviously, we expect to have much higher cash flows in a couple of years but nonetheless, just with the opportunity set that we see in front of us, I think we've talked a lot about -- Alan just put a voice to the opportunities we see around the NGL side of the business. We think that, that capital is -- could be strategically invested at very attractive rates of return. And we think that will really provide greater value for investors long-term.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Next question was just on the WPZ and the cash distribution. I mean, we are forecasting sort of just over 1x in 2014 and you made, I think, a comment in the press release about getting back to normal levels. I mean, how are you seeing where you want normal levels for coverage to be, understanding that we've got sort of weaker propane prices and NGL margins and whatnot, but I'm just trying to figure out where we ought to think about as a normalized coverage ratio target?","Donald R. Chappel","I would comment that we would like to see the coverage at or above 1 over an extended period of time. I'll remind you over 2010, 2011, we were operating at kind of 1.3x, 1.4x coverage. So if you take the 2 very strong years and then, if you take '12 and our current guidance on '13, you still end way above 1. So again, I think there will be ups and downs in coverage. As you'll recall, when we had coverage up in the 1.3x, 1.4x range, a lot of investors and analysts were suggesting that we should raise the distribution and we said it's high because margins are high and we want to be in a position that when margins roll back -- and they will, because they always do and then they'll go back up -- that we're not under too much stress or strain. So we really look at it on a longer-term basis. So I think longer-term, we'd like to be 1 or better. And if we are better than 1, we're pretty happy about that.","Alan S. Armstrong","And I would add to that. It's certainly -- if we saw this as a business that wasn't growing and we had that kind of coverage, that would be one thing. But we certainly see it transitory in nature, and we certainly put a lot of equity into this business and funding a lot of this cash flow that's very -- that's yet to come on in terms of driving our distribution. And so I think we feel very good about where we are and as Don said, we're -- we really look to the long-term. But I think to answer your question, we certainly, if we were in a steady state kind of environment, we would want to be in the 1x to 1.10x range if we were in a steady state environment.","Donald R. Chappel","And certainly, our business mix will be a factor of that. As you know, we are moving more and more to a fee-based portfolio and as well, access is entirely fee-based, and as the cash distributions back to Williams grow off Access, that will further shift us toward fee. And then it's a question of what kind of margins we enjoy. If we're in a low-margin cycle, the coverage will be tighter and if we're in a high-margin cycle, it'll be more robust. But I think the business mix and you have to think about Access as a contributor to that as well.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, last one, just small one for me. You talked about the attractive economics of running propane versus ethane. Just how much can you run through Geismar, sort of, an ethane-propane mix, if we think about that?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. We can run about 30% on a inlet volume basis in propane.","Operator","We'll go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","At this point, I just have a few clarifying questions, if I could. And maybe the first is just on Ohio Valley and the 150 million a day that was referenced of delay. I didn't catch -- is that something that we'll sort of see kind of a consistent delay through 2013 and 2014? Or by 2014, for instance, should the challenges of getting the right equipment in place be surpassed where we don't have any of those curtailments in that $80 million to $120 million of EBITDA, Alan, I believe you referenced, won't be dragging anymore. Can I just get a little bit of clarification on that?","Francis E. Billings","Sure, this is Frank again. That 100 -- that volume that I referenced, that's volume that we know is available to us today. It's actually produced volume that's just behind our system and we feel we're going to get the majority of those operational issues resolved in the second quarter. So we're hoping that we have that volume flowing freely to our Fort Beeler facility and through our fractionation assets in 2013. So really, it's really on us to make certain that we get through the operating and asset issues that we've been dealing with over the last few months and we get the assets stabilized and when we do that, we'll have a nice base business for 2013 and we will be able to grow forward from there, per the guidance.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. So we actually have the -- or in the guidance, the volume is actually coming back, call it, by midyear then?","Francis E. Billings","Midyear to the end of the year. And I think the challenge is, all the time we're doing that, of course, there's new volumes being drilled. And so we constantly will be in a catch-up mode for some time. I think it's important to note, though, if you look at Laurel Mountain, we've been at that for a while now and we are now ahead of Chevron, finally, out there in terms of capacity. We're getting close to being there while, I would say, we're going to be on a treadmill for a long time in the Northeast with Cabot and some of the other produces there. I would say, we're pretty well at pace with those producers right now and we just -- things have moved faster in OVM particularly, again, from a liquids production standpoint, both in terms of richer gas and higher degrees of condensates. So I think we're very confident in our ability to catch up, but I would just say, given the productivity of those reserves, we're going to be on a treadmill there for a long, long time to come. And likely, we'll be having some lagging excess capacity or excess production held behind our infrastructure for quite a while.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And Alan, if I could, just as a follow-up on that -- I guess, the producer frustration, is all of this, in effect, call it, industry rich gas related? Has there been any execution-type of issues where Williams has stubbed its toe? I just want to make sure there's no risk of brand franchise bruising for instance?","Alan S. Armstrong","I'll let Frank take that, but I'll just tell you, we're not the only one struggling up there. I think about anybody, if they're honest with you, would tell you that what's going on up there is a lot of this. And as well, the producers are having their own issues, upstream of our facilities as well. And Frank, I don't know if you want to add some color to that?","Francis E. Billings","Sure. I would say, the issues that we've had have been mostly around our field receipt points and obviously, those are vital to getting the production into our gathering systems and ultimately, into our processing assets. We've not completed those installations as timely as we would've liked and then, we have experienced inconsistent operations and reliability as production has come back up to those facilities. Again for 2013, I think our key operating issue for us is going to be to optimize and stabilize the current assets that we have in place and have the facilities better matched to the gas quality of the production. No one really knows with certainty the composition until it's actually produced and I think we've experienced some mismatched facilities to the production and the -- and what we're seeing out there. So the reserves are there, obviously, I think the producers would be producing more. But we have to reliably handle the production and move the production for these producers.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Understood. And maybe just last question, Don, just a clarification on the cash tax guidance, and understanding what's happened has been a benefit both of ACMP, as well as legislation on bonus depreciation. Is it possible to attribute that in any way, 90% to ACMP, 10% to the legislation? I mean, if we were trying to basically ascribe a benefit, if you will, even prior to legislation from the purchase price, for instance, of ACMP -- this is real value you guys are getting. Is there any way to do that?","Donald R. Chappel","I'd say both are significant. I couldn't give you the number -- the exact number off hand, but if you're interested in trying to learn more about that I encourage you to call John and Sharna and they can try to help you estimate the number. But they're both pretty significant.","Operator","And we'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I had a couple of questions. If we could kind of dig a little deeper into the Petchem Services at the MB level, it's got the distinction of being kind of a growth opportunity that if you had 7x investments EBITDA, maybe having $100 million of EBITDA in a couple of years and can be dropped down because it's in the States. Can you discuss kind of the long-term vision of that, and at what point in parts or in whole, a drop-down might make sense?","Alan S. Armstrong","Certainly, that would make a lot of sense, I don't think there would be really any prohibition to the majority of the investments that we're making there from being qualified income. And certainly, we feel like WPZ is pretty full on capital opportunity right now. And so WPZ is well-positioned to do a lot of that development. And certainly, it centers around the kind of things we've talked about in the past, tremendous amount of liquids coming into the area and a lot of changes going on in the petchem space there where parties are trying to crack lighter products. And that changes a lot of things, it changed butane movements, changes propylene movements. A lot of things that change as a result of the feedstock coming into those plants changing. And we have been thinking for some time, there'll be quite a shift in logistics requirements for the business and that you can't build all this new cracking capacity in the Gulf Coast and not have a lot of new logistics issues. And so we've been working to get ahead of that, both in terms of getting our supplies and our producers' supplies access to better markets, but as well, helping serve the petchem market in an open access manner, which heretofore has been pretty much not the way business has been done in the Gulf Coast in terms of having open access pipelines for all these products in between the facilities. And so we think there has been a huge opportunity left to us there to be that open access provider for services. And so we continue to see a lot of opportunities. We've picked up pipelines from BP that were underutilized, we picked up pipelines from Exxon that were underutilized and we picked up a pipeline from Explorer that were underutilized and we have quite a bit of similar activity going on to continue to have distribution networks that move with an expanding market there.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Alan, do I understand what you're saying, is that there's not just obvious opportunities for the organic CapEx that you already laid out on the acquired pipes, but that there's incremental M&A opportunities in that segment?","Alan S. Armstrong","I would say it's pretty -- they're pretty modest relative to what we normally -- what you'd normally hear from us in terms of M&A. And so those acquisitions that we've made over the last couple of years, in total are, I think, $400 million or somewhere in that ballpark. And so I would say -- those combined. And so, I would say, it's those kind of pickups that we'll continue to assemble smaller investments like that and piece them together into a smart network.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Understood. A couple of other quick follow-ups. I noticed the CapEx cost on the Canadian offgas ethane project were up from 3Q guidance. Is this just incremental accretive CapEx on an expanding offtake or is it simply inflation?","Randy M. Newcomer","This is Randy Newcomer. The Canadian ethane project -- recovery project at Redwater is currently in construction and slated to be completed in May of this year. And so what that represents is additional or better cost estimation basically for completion of the project. So it's inflation in the cost of the project.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And last question for me. I noticed that the ethylene price deck had some changes. We went up a little in '13, which is benefiting Geismar margins there. But then, we kind of flatlined into '14 versus what was previously assumed to be a steep contango into the following year. Can you discuss kind of what's driving the long term expectations there?","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. We continue to really follow CMAI's forecast there and so you'll say that's right in line with CMAI's forecast. And that earlier, I think, $0.62 that we had in there was also right in line with CMAI. So a lot of moving parts in that space, and we think those guys did a pretty good job of providing that guidance. And so we take a look and certainly, are influenced heavily by their perspective, and that's actually what drove that.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I got you. So this can easily jump around quarter to quarter in terms of long term guidance. It's not something you're trying to kind of neutralize by flatlining it?","Alan S. Armstrong","That's correct. And I would say, certainly this year, right now that forecast is conservative relative to what we're seeing on the ethylene and certainly, conservative -- our forecast is conservative compared to what we're seeing right now on propylene. But certainly, it'll be some volumes continuing, new ethylene production coming on as some of these new facilities get back online. So I don't think it's going to be really big, frankly, in '13 and maybe, not even in '14, but beyond that we'll probably see ethylene production pick up.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Looking at, I guess, your guidance for the Geismar volumes? Is the difference really just related to the timing of the expansion?","Randy M. Newcomer","This is Randy Newcomer. You're referring to the volume estimate of 125 million?","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Yes.","Randy M. Newcomer","Basically, it's several different factors, but the primary factors are related to the timing of the -- timing of the turnaround where we were running longer, moving the turnaround from the spring to the fall between turnaround cycles. And at the end of -- at the tail-end of the turnaround, you end up having a little bit of natural degradation in your production capacity over the course of the run. So that's impacting it a little bit. The second thing is, as we're planning this turnaround, obviously, it's a combination of both maintenance activities and tie-ins related to the expansion. And so as you might expect, there's a lot of complexity to that and the need for a lot of good planning effort. We're not quite finished with the final plan for the activity during that time frame, but we've injected a little bit of additional -- as Alan spoke to before -- a little bit more conservatism into the volume forecast, understanding that there will probably be a few bobbles as we come up from the expansion -- we're going to come up after the turnaround in full expansion mode. Whereas before, we were going to come up at the current rate and then bring expansion on later in the year. With moving the timing of the turnaround to the fall, we will be coming up off the turnaround in full expansion mode. So a combination of factors there. Additionally, when you crack heavy with propane versus ethylene, you make a little bit less ethylene and more propylene, and so we really have to look at total olefins production rather than just ethylene and 125 million pounds per year is related just to ethylene. If you'd net it with the other olefins that you produce, that certainly are valuable as well, like propylene, it's about 100 million pounds a year.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And do you anticipate, I guess, cracking propane at that 30% max or close to it this year?","Randy M. Newcomer","It just depends on the relative price at any given point in time. We tune that up each month.","Alan S. Armstrong","So basically, if you took our assumptions on the ethane to ethylene spread, anytime we are cracking propane to propylene, it's an upgrade to those economics. That's the only reason we would be doing that, is that if we see better economics. And obviously, right now we're seeing better economics cracking the propane. And so that's always kind of an upside to the basic ethane to ethylene spread.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, okay. And then, maybe if you could talk about Williams' competitive position in bidding for the new pipeline project in Florida?","Frank J. Ferazzi","This is Frank Ferazzi. We, like much of the rest of the market, have received the documents for FP&L's RFP and so -- it's complicated set -- it's a complicated RFP, it's 200 pages or more. And so we're in the process of evaluating both the commercial aspects of the RFP, as well as our financial planning people looking at the route and coming up with an estimate of capital. And so we have a lot of work to do between now and early April when responses to the RFP are due, and have not yet decided whether we're going to bid or not. I would say that I think Gulfstream is in a good position, currently, in the marketplace -- strong assets, strong relationships with the market. And so I think that will give us an advantage in the end.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess, if you do decide to bid, would this be a project you're pursuing with Spectra, like a JV, 50-50 JV?","Randall L. Barnard","It would be a project that -- a bid that would come from Gulfstream, which of course, is owned by Williams and Spectra jointly.","Operator","We'll take our next question from TJ Schultz with RBC Capital Markets.","TJ Schultz - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Just following up on the NGL projects in the Marcellus and Utica, I guess, as the liquid takeaway options evolve and options for ethane take-away come along, what is the status or interest level of your proposed Confluence rich gas project there?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I would say Confluence has merged into a lot of different things, but we are in really good shape there. I would say, and have made good progress on contracting with parties in the area. A little different than what we've originally laid out, but in terms of investment opportunity, it'll look very much the same. And so we are excited about that and it's helping -- as well, it's helping to support our confidence in a large Raw Make system being built in the Gulf Coast as well. And so things are coming together there very nicely.","Operator","We'll go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Back to the question on the use of cash at WMB. The coverage ratio at PZ was 0.95x in '12 and we have talked about where it is for '13 and '14, it's 1x with some nice increases in ethane and propane. I guess, I'm looking for more on -- at what point does MB support PZ given that need to do equity and forego some RDRs [ph] with some of that use of cash given that it's a fairly weak outlook for the next couple of years?","Donald R. Chappel","Becca, this is Don. I'd say, it's a fairly hypothetical question right now. I mean, I appreciate the question but I would say, it would depend on the facts and circumstances that develop. I would say if, again, the plan that we laid out, we execute on the plan, we don't believe there is a need for support. And we'll see how things play out. And if the situation were to be more difficult, that'd be something we'd have to consider. But I think it's hard to be formulaic about it. Again, we look at -- and in terms of coverage, we looked at '10, '11, '12, '13, '14, so if you really look at kind of the 5-year average -- again, the 5 years is well above 1. Yes, we expect 2013 to be below 1 but again, we are also investing a tremendous amount of capital in fee-based growth projects that we expect to come into service in '14 and '15 and really boost the fee based cash flows and boost the coverage at the same time that we're raising distributions. And 2013 is burdened by the carrying costs of those projects, both in terms of equity and debt that have been issued to fund that growth. So it's not just about the commodity price but it's about the tremendous growth that's occurring in the carrying cost of that. So again, we think this is still just a near-term challenge. And again, with the business plan that we've laid out and assuming effective execution, we think we'll be through this in relatively short order.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Selman Akyol with Stifel.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just going back to Geismar for a minute or 2. First of all, can you just remind us of the contract structure, or are you just selling all into the spot market?","Randy M. Newcomer","Well -- this is Randy Newcomer. We have a number of contracts and our contract mix, as Alan alluded to earlier, is changing. A lot of our ethane plus kind of contracts and collared ethylene sales have rolled off. And in fact, as of now, we really only have one that is on -- sale on ethane plus basis. The rest of them are all contracts that are priced at market, basically. Some of them are spot, some of them are yearly contracts. But the pricing is based on more spot kind of pricing. And we purposely have done that because we believe in the fundamentals of that, that ethylene is going to continue to be in good demand and we'll have a great ethylene crack going forward. So we've positioned ourselves to be exposed to the full crack for the present and including our expanded volumes as they come on later in the year.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, given your ability to, I guess, to crack propane into propylene, given margins have been extremely robust for propylene this first quarter, we could expect high margins, then, going into Q1?","Randy M. Newcomer","Yes, we do.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then, if you look out into 2014, it looks like your capacity utilization assumptions are pretty high then going into that as well, and you're seeing that, I guess, reflected by your customers too?","Alan S. Armstrong","Are you talking about on the volumes at Geismar?","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, yes, that's obviously a full year of the expansion coming up and naturally what's driving that. Even in the fourth quarter of this year, because of what we said, we've built in some conservatism. We normally -- you normally see us putting in a, depending on how many -- how much downtime we expect for the year, but normally, you'd see us running around 98% to 99% uptime on a facility like that. And I think we've got somewhere in the 92% range built in just following the startup there in the fourth quarter. Again, just trying to be conservative relative to the kind of bobbles we might experience as we bring that new facility up. So it's a combination of those 2 things that is driving -- but obviously, the big driver is the new expansion that will be online full year in 2014.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great. And then, just going back to your guidance. You have about $2 billion forecasted for distributions in 2013. Can you say how many units that's based on?","Alan S. Armstrong","Asking how many units.","Donald R. Chappel","That's a good question. We haven't disclosed the number of units, but it would be -- obviously, the current units outstanding in some plan for -- or some assumption on new units and we're not prepared to provide guidance on that at this point.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right. And one very small last question for me. The Mid-Atlantic Connector, when do you have that coming online in 2013?","Donald R. Chappel","Hold on just 1 second. Yes, Mid-Atlantic Connector actually went in service last week. So it was originally scheduled to be in service in November, but we had a 2-month delay.","Operator","And there are no other questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong","Okay, great. Well, thank you very much.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Porter","Thank you, Lisa. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners.","Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; a presentation discussing these results; guidance updates and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. This morning, Alan will make a few comments and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A.","We also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas present with us: Frank Billings leads our Northeastern G&P operating area, Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area, Rory Miller leads our Atlantic-Gulf area and Randy Newcomer is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to any questions.","In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Good morning. Thank you, John. Well, first of all, our cash flow metrics for the first quarter remained strong and in line with our expectations despite a continued decline in NGLs. Earnings at WMB, however, for the quarter were impacted by higher DD&A, including an additional $17 million of noncash amortization related to the ACMP acquisition. But we were pleased with the 1.05 coverage at WPZ despite another 21% step down in NGL margins from the fourth quarter of '12 and now a 50% decline from the first quarter of 2012.","Looking forward, we see some short-term painful but long-term healthy cross-currents as both the NGL markets and the natural gas markets continue to expand on the backs of low-cost supplies relative to global alternatives. The natural gas market right now is ahead as the demand decisions have already been made in response to an extended low gas price period. But the NGL demand side will also begin to respond but perhaps not as quickly and certainly to more limited options for market expansions. As a result, we see a couple of years where NGLs will be oversupplied and producer's response to natural gas price signals will be more -- or will be met by most people -- be slower than most people's expectations just because of the time it takes to set the flywheel rolling in these large-scale operations. Areas like the Marcellus and the Utica will be advantaged by the benefits of large-scale development because those major programs are already in place. For Williams, this results in great infrastructure investment alternatives to expand in the market, access for these large-scale NGL and natural gas values that still will be ready to deliver quickly against the positive market signals. So in the short term, the higher natural gas prices will be negatively impact -- will negatively impact our margins. But longer term, this will drive even more investment alternatives.","So while our 62% growth in DCF from 2013 to 2015 is certainly impressive, we could see this improve even more if the forecasted pricing environment holds up long enough to spur more supplies and more demand because after all, our strategy is built around the volume throughput that will come with expanded markets with these great low-cost resources being developed here in North America.","We're excited this quarter to announce the continuation of our 20% dividend growth at WMB through the 2015 guidance, and we look forward to sharing more about our large platform of growth capital projects that supports this continued growth in 2015 and beyond with our Analyst Day coming up here on May 21.","And with that, we'll turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Brad Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Could you provide maybe some kind of breakdown of what is driving the CapEx growth in the Northeast segment particularly? Is that the result of regulatory hurdles, labor, materials or another factor?","Francis E. Billings","Yes, this is Frank Billings. The majority of the capital increase in the Northeast that we're seeing and forecasting for really '13 and '14 and a little bit of '15 is really targeted for additional capacity requirements to support the drilling programs for our customers in Northeast Pennsylvania. We're actually expanding market outlets to support those drilling programs and increasing our takeaway capacity to the current pipeline connections that we have, as well as setting up for Constitution coming on as well. The other thing we have is -- the other piece of that is we do have our Three Rivers investment in that time period as well.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And when you talk about increasing takeaway alternatives, is that focused more on gathering? Or is that -- is there a specific long-haul pipeline that you're delivering into more than you expected or where you're building more capacity?","Francis E. Billings","It's spread out across the current delivery points that we have today. So we have our deliveries into Transco, Tennessee, Millennium, we'll have Constitution, and those are the primary ones we're going to continue to focus on. And that's the -- and those are the outlets that our producer customers are wanting us to focus on as well.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And is there an update at this point on Bluegrass, how the contracting of the pipeline is coming along? And if Bluegrass does proceed, do you believe that it reduces the demand for local market fractionation in the Northeast?","James E. Scheel","This is Jim Scheel. Bluegrass negotiations are going very well right now. We have operations, legal and commercial folks working to finalize the agreements. It's my hope that we'll be finalizing those some time during this month so that we can go out to customers with tariff proposals early next month. Going to the next part of the question, yes, I do believe that Bluegrass will provide a great opportunity for wide-grade [ph] product to move to the Gulf Coast in order to meet the customer demand for NGLs in the large-scale fractionation facilities in that area of the country","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one last question from me. In 2014, there was a revision to the Atlantic and Gulf segment EBITDA. It looked a little bit larger than just commodity impacts alone, and I was wondering if you could comment on that? And that's all for me.","Rory Lee Miller","Alan, do you want me to take that.","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, please, Rory.","Rory Lee Miller","Yes. Just a couple of things going on there. Effective March 1, 2013, we have set new reserve rates and rates subject to refund. And the main driver there was we wound up with a little lower rate base to work against than we were forecasting in earlier periods. We had a little lower maintenance capital spending and so that drove the rate base down, which brought that kind of forward-looking base down a bit. And then there is an impact on Gulfstar. We're probably looking at a couple of months, potentially, delay there, and that effect is kind of amplified because of the accounting treatment that we're using with the Marubeni buy end of the project. As you recall, we sold half of that project to Marubeni and due to the accounting treatment, it shows the full impact to segment profit, but the impact on DCF is only about half of that. And Don, if you -- you may have a little more clear accounting explanation of that, but that's it in a nutshell.","Donald R. Chappel","Just to follow up on Rory's comment, again, we consolidate the Gulfstar project, so we show 100% of it despite the fact that our ownership is 51%. And our partner, Marubeni's interest, shows up as non-controlling interest, so you see segment profit move down as we've pushed the startup of that project back by a quarter. But the net effect of that is about half of what shows up in the segment profit change because of the non-controlling interest change that offsets it.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Faisel at Citi. I appreciate the additional guidance on the dividend for 2015, but I just wanted to ask a few questions on those assumptions in order to get to that number for dividend growth for '15. I guess if I look at the analyst package and look at your coverage ratio for the dividend payout for '13 and '14, it seems like you have enough coverage. But it looks like that assumption is based on a very low cash tax rate. It's also based on ethylene prices kind of holding up where they are, and I guess it also assumes that ethane rejection kind of continues for the foreseeable future. I'm just wondering, what gets you comfortable that you have enough wiggle room through the -- over the next few years to increase that dividend all the way to 2015 by 20%? I mean, the cash tax rate looks a little bit aggressive, and the ethylene assumption also seems -- it seems decent now, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of wiggle room.","Donald R. Chappel","Faisel, this is Don. I'll just take the first part of the question on the cash tax rate and then I'll turn it over to Alan. But you're correct, our cash tax rate through '14 is fairly low. And even into '15, it's less than probably the long-term rates. However, we have a forecast that goes out well beyond '15, and we do account for the fact that our cash tax rate will be moving up over time. And despite that, we're comfortable that we have the coverage, the capacity and the underlying growth projects to sustain that dividend growth through 2015. And again, I think we feel comfortable that we have strong growth beyond. Despite it, we're not providing guidance out in that beyond-'15 period.","Alan S. Armstrong","Faisel, I'll take the question on the pricing, particularly on the ethane and ethylene. At the WMB level, which I assume your question is pointed to relative to the dividend, don't forget that we do have ethane exposure, positive ethane exposure, in Canada that is not captured in a lot of that PZ analysis that we've shown in terms of our sensitivity of ethane to ethylene such that if you add back in that exposure -- now remember, that -- the way that contract is structured, we have a floor that's a cost of service basis for negative ethane. But when ethane goes positive, then that's long barrels that would offset that otherwise short position that we have against ethane. So at the WMB level, we're actually fairly neutral there. In addition to that, we also have the impact, and it actually showed up pretty significantly in these numbers as we went to full ethane rejection from our Overland Pass business, where we're showing full ethane rejection throughout this period. So even though that doesn't show up as direct commodity exposure, it's pretty significant in terms of its impact over this 2-year period. So if you really look at the full balance of our exposure there, I would tell you we're -- from a cash flow standpoint, we're pretty well neutral relative to that ethane assumption at the WMB level. And so -- and as to the ethylene and propylene margin, we're certainly showing that reducing by about 10% from what we saw here in the first quarter of 2013. So certainly wouldn't suggest that that's not without risk. But frankly, we're seeing a lot of pull through on the ethylene side right now, on the demand side for ethylene. So at this point in time, we think that's a sound assumption on our part.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And, Alan, just to make sure I understand the guidance going forward for '13, '14 and '15, the ethane equity sales that we saw in the first quarter and the ethane production numbers we saw in this first quarter, are we to assume that those numbers kind of continue with the same first quarter numbers kind of going forward, which would be a drastic short of reduction in volumes over the fourth quarter of last year and all of last year for that matter. So I just want to make sure I understand that number in the guidance.","Alan S. Armstrong","That is an -- I will tell you no -- even though we've said we will expect our pricing is done on a -- in terms of what we put out, is done on an annual average basis, and I will tell you, it won't be that smooth. And there will be periods where we have recovery and there will be a short period in there as prices inch up, and then we'll see rejection turn around. So when we say full rejection, we mean that in the sense that the pricing signal on an annual average basis will keep that. But we'll see spotting. In fact, I think we had some periods of recovery here recently here in the second quarter as well. So we'll see periods where we go in and out of recovery and rejection. But we think there's plenty of supply to hit that bid very quickly out there in the market, and I think one of the things that's kind of reset that market a little bit from what we would have seen maybe 5 or 10 years ago is there's a lot of ship-or-pay kind of contracts out there such that the variable expense to a producer is higher than what it used to have been. So they're making a decision against the ship-or-pay contract, which is kind of lowering the point at which people will go into rejection. And we as Williams really don't have that. And so we're right on the edge there and really looking at variable expense with the exception of the little bit of impact, the benefit we get from the Overland Pass transportation. So I think that's keeping that pricing level down below where you normally would see it for -- to encourage ethane recovery.","Operator","Our next question comes from Stephen Maresca from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","My first question is just on the IDR waivers. Alan and Don, you had 1.05 coverage in the first quarter. What made you feel like you needed to do the IDR waivers through the year? And how much of this was just a reduction in price assumptions? Or how much of it was kind of your view that volumes are not picking up quite as fast as previously thought?","Alan S. Armstrong","Steve, I'll take that. I would just tell you very clearly, the pricing is, by far, the primary driver for us on this. I'm actually encouraged, and I think there's a good chance that we'll see volumes respond even more positively than we have in our forecast. But I would say we're at a little bit of a cross-current here in the market where gas prices picked up. And yet, the producers -- we're not seeing that response from the producers quite quick enough. I think they're kind of looking at this pricing and wondering if it's for real or not in terms of this price pickup on natural gas, and they're not quite ready to put the capital back behind what might be a blip in price. So I think if that continues, that we'll see that. Nevertheless, I would tell you that, partially because of that response, we're showing higher gas price throughout this period, which is a big driver of that lower margin. And as we've said here in the second quarter, we watched butanes drop by $0.01 a day for almost 30 days in a row. And so I would just tell you, its hard to build a lot of optimism in that market, in that pricing looking forward, and we certainly don't have a good answer other than exports picking up some of that. We don't have a good answer because we continue to see the incredible amount of NGLs that are available in places like the Utica and the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford. And we just see those supplies continuing to roll in. And so yes, we've got expanding markets in the way of exports, but there's a tremendous amount of supply continuing to build here for the next couple of years. And we're going to need to see very large-scale solutions developed like the Bluegrass project to really provide big enough market access for these products.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then I believe you mentioned, Alan, also on the podcast, just some of the lower segment profit guidance in '14, including some changes in in-service dates for projects. Can you elaborate what is driving a little bit of that?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. I think the primary driver there for '14 was the Gulfstar project that got mentioned. And again, that just hit segment profit by the larger number, and you cut that in half when you get down to DCF. That's probably the largest impact project that we have for 2014, and I think that's really the primary driver.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then final one from me, another thing you mentioned was being a little bit disappointed with the Ohio Valley cost environment, higher cost than had thought. Can you talk a little bit also about what is driving that? How you see that playing out over the next 6, 12 months?","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. I'll take that and Frank can fill in where I miss here. But I would just say, we have really poured into that. But I think one of the things that might -- some of the way that language came off, a lot of the cost increases we're talking about, just from an accounting perspective, is much higher depreciation expense. And so that's really one of the primary drivers of expense on that. But I would tell you that we are working very, very hard to get our operations in line up there, and we're really trying to not spare a whole lot of expense on that. We're certainly mindful to it. But there's so much value in getting that system up and running and getting it up and reliable that we are -- we are bringing in a lot of resources from other parts of the country and really working hard. That's a very high-margin business for us, as you can imagine, on one hand. And in addition to that, it's certainly a reputational issue for us as well in terms of serving the customers out there. And so we're working hard. There's a lot of issues to overcome out there as a lot of that system really wasn't built in a robust enough way to handle the variability that we've seen in production out there. And so we're working hard to overcome that. And so I would just say we're going to get there, and we're having to pour the coals to it on the expense side right now to overcome some of them.","Operator","And we'll move on to our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to come back to the 2015 dividend. What is the coverage, by the way that you defined it, that you're looking for in 2015? I think you're at sort of 1.3 or 1.34 on '13 and '14, but what's your coverage on '15 that you're seeing?","Donald R. Chappel","Ted, we have not put that out yet. We'll put it out on Analyst Day. But we're comfortable we have more than adequate coverage in light of the assumptions that are embedded in our forecast. And again, we didn't put out all of our '15 detail and keep you interested and coming to our Analyst Day in a couple of weeks.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. I will be there. Just on Bluegrass again. I'm trying to understand the mechanics of kind of how -- the contribution that we'll get from Boardwalk. As I understand it, they'll contribute the pipeline, you'll contribute the cash. Is there any kind of crossover where, on capital or whatnot, they need to participate? Maybe walk us through that. And then also, this idea that ATEX, the enterprise line, might run more than just ethane, how do you see that impacting the Bluegrass pipeline?","James E. Scheel","Well, I'll start with the first question. Again, this is Jim Scheel. The anticipation right now is that Williams and Boardwalk will be 50-50 partners in the Bluegrass pipeline. Boardwalk will contribute part of Texas Gas that will have a value in the joint venture. Williams will true up through capital contributions for new construction. We'll be equal owners throughout the pipeline, as well as fractionation and storage facilities. To the extent there's customer demand for a export facility, we'd also anticipate sharing ownership in that on a 50-50 basis. That's the expectation today, and that's what we're working towards currently with them in those negotiations. As far ATEX going into additional products, actually, we would support seeing some of those opportunities to provide clearing for near-term liquids out of the Marcellus to meet customer demand. So I won't speak for enterprise, but that would be something that I think would help the market in the Northeast in the near term.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe just a big-picture one. It sounds like you have a lot of great growth projects, a lot of capital going in. Is there any sense that you feel capital constrained at all? I'm just wondering if there's projects anywhere that you might be turning down, maybe the pipeline into Florida that folks are working on? Just kind of how you're thinking about how much capital you have available relative to the opportunity set?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, we certainly are in a position to allocate capital, and we consistently do. And I would just tell you, we're very wary of risk as we do that. And so I would say we're allocating on a risk-adjusted return basis, and that's -- it's a good situation to be in. But we certainly are in a regular process of allocating capital and turning down alternatives that are put in front of us today, which are above our current cost of capital on one hand, but on the other hand, we've certainly loaded into our equity pretty heavily last year, and we've got such a great set of projects that provide so much value if we execute on those, that anything that can get in the way of that kind of value being realized is something that we're going to guard against pretty heavily.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sharon Lui from Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just wondering if you could talk about, I guess, the decision to undertake Bluegrass at the WMB level and whether you envision this project to, I guess, generate primarily fee-based cash flows that would be appropriate of the drop down to WPZ some point in time?","Donald R. Chappel","Sharon, this is a Don. I'd just say that we felt that WPZ had a pretty full plate in terms of projects to develop and finance and that Williams had some excess cash flow, and the Bluegrass development was a good place to put it. So clearly, it's a perfect drop-down candidate, or it could even be jointly developed in time. But that was really the thinking around the decision to at least initially fund that at Williams.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just looking at the cash balance that you guys have and the projected -- the excess cash flow at WMB, do you envision, I guess, any equity requirements to fund CapEx at that -- the WMB level right now?","Donald R. Chappel","Sharon, there's no equity requirements contemplated in this plan that we put forth, but we wouldn't speculate as to what could occur. But again, I think as Alan mentioned, we're -- we have a vast array of opportunities. We're allocating capital very carefully, looking at risk as well as strategic value and near-term value as well in deciding what to fund. So it'll be based on the facts and circumstances and what comes forward.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then if you could just provide some color on the operational issues experienced at Ohio Valley and how that's being resolved?","Francis E. Billings","Sure. This is Frank again. Right now, we're really working to debottleneck the system with some near-term projects to kind of get some -- take some quick wins. Really, we're beginning to implement our long-term operating philosophy for the area that really focuses on removing the fraction of gas stream that wants to be liquid under the conditions we're realizing in the gathering system. We're still going to move those hydrocarbons to Fort Beeler and Oak Grove, but we're going to pull them out of the gas -- gathering line and put them into our liquids line and then handle the separation and product upgrading at those central facilities at either Oak Grove and Moundsville. The primary benefit that we're attempting to do is remove those liquids that are pooling in the line and driving up the operating pressures of the system, to the point that the liquids are curtailing the volumes. Another significant benefit of the change in philosophy is really a significant reduction in our pigging activity, which has been impacting our reliability but also creates a lot of operational complexity. As an example, we're going to get operating expense improvement as well out of that because today, we probably pig that -- pig those systems 3x a day, and with these changes we'll be able to do that potentially once a month. So we'll have significant reduction in those things that could impact our pressure. But what we find is when we pig the system today, we don't get very lasting benefit given the operating conditions. And the other thing that we're really setting up for. And you've got to remember, that system has only really been out there 12 months or a little over 12 months, but we have a wide variety of temperature and pressure that we see over a calendar year. And what we want to do is set up a system that we feel we can operate safely, consistently and reliably 365 days a year. So we feel like we've got the right path forward, and we're going to begin to implement some of those significant changes throughout the summer months.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with the Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","A couple of quick ones. Don, did I see correctly that you all are guiding to slightly higher cash tax rate expectations versus the fourth quarter guidance? And what's driving that? And then, Alan, I had a quick question about the IDR forgiveness after that.","Donald R. Chappel","Yes, Craig, I think there was a very minor change in cash tax rate, and that's usually just a function of CapEx and taxable income. So I wouldn't read anything more into it than that. So it's just a tweak based on all of the other changes we made in our forecast.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And, Alan, on the IDR forgiveness -- I mean, frankly, as a onetime event, as you fill in for commodity margin with your huge fee-based growth CapEx pipeline, a couple of hundred million dollars as an NPV is irrelevant on a pretax basis. The question though, would be is, is this really a onetime event as you are guiding to just over 1x, 1.03x, I think, in 2015 PZ coverage? Or could you envision a circumstance where this might have to be repeated?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I think you could certainly describe the time where we might repeat it if we saw conditions occur, but that's certainly not what our plans suggest right now. And I think we have a fairly conservative plan out there. I think it's really just the result of the amount of heavy investment that we're going through right now on the capital side to take advantage of all these great opportunities. And so we are very much investing into what we think is a great strategy and -- but that obviously has required a lot of equity issuance at WPZ to fund all that, and that certainly put a lot of pressure on that coverage. And you couple that, of course, with a rising gas price and drastically lowering NGL prices, and that's the circumstances we find ourselves in for 2013. None of that, from my perspective, overshadows the great growth prospects that we've got going on in the fee-based business, and I think our effort here is just to bridge into that more fee-based model that we're moving to. And so I think in the future, there will be less variables as we become less and less reliant on the NGL margin. I think there'll be less variables that would drive us or require us to do that. So I think that's the way I would answer that.","Donald R. Chappel","Craig, I -- this is Don. I'd just remind you and the others on the call that, again, Williams owns 68% of the LP units and the IDRs. If you look at our guidance, we enjoy 73% -- and I think of the cash flows out at WPZ in '13. And I think it goes up to about 76% by 2015. So the amount of IDR reduction that's given back to others is, call it, 25% of the total 200. So really, the lion's share of that is really staying, and to the benefit of Williams, it's just putting it in a different pocket.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brett Reilly with Credit Suisse.","Brett Reilly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Can you just add a little bit more color on the OBM lower volume assumptions more in the '14, '15 time frame, recognizing the issues you face today?","Francis E. Billings","Sure. When we look at what's going on in '13, I think if you look back at some of the producers behind our system, they've openly said that they're scaling back 2013 drilling behind OBM as a result there, in response to the current operating capacities that we have there. There's still probably $100 million a day of volume that we're going to unlock over the next 4 to 6 months that we feel like we can bring to bear. But we really feel that the producers are really focused on the drilling programs for 2014 and '15. And given the things that we're doing up there, I think we're going to allow the producers and Williams to get to the levels that we've previously forecasted. I think in '14, our volume projection's not off that far. And I know we have a little bit of a step down in '15, but I really think that's less -- that's probably less a response to known information. I think it's really just when we try to just project what we think the producers can actually do out of that area and given their volume profiles, we're really just trying to forecast more of what we see the activity being. But really, we're going to get out of -- we know we're going to have reduced volumes in '13 for the known things we have, but we feel like we'll have the system capable of moving the volumes that we've had in our previous forecast, and I think we've stayed pretty close to that level in '14.","Brett Reilly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And with the additional capital being spent in that area to resolve some of the bottlenecks today, is there an opportunity at all to recover some of that cost? Or is this all incremental capital just to get or satisfy the current contracts?","Francis E. Billings","That's a good question. And actually, what we're doing is we want to make -- we do have to do some of these things to make certain that we stay in compliance with some of our current contractual obligations for pressures at some of our field receipt points. But we have had some discussions with producers to looking at a value trade that could either be some -- maybe some acreage that is currently not dedicated or some other ways to get some improvements in revenues as a result of the improved level of services that we're going to see out there.","Brett Reilly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Got you. And then maybe looking to the Western part of the portfolio, any update on recontracting some of those commitments you have out there so that it's more fee-based versus commodity-based?","Allison G. Bridges","This is Allison Bridges. Certainly, we are proactively negotiating contracts with producers as they are coming due. And I think that they are interested in moving away from pure keep-whole deals. So we are looking at different ways of contracting, whether it be fee-based or based on price of gas or other items.","Brett Reilly - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me, the $2 billion bump in your growth capital opportunity set at the MB level, is that really just a function of Bluegrass? Or is there a few other moving pieces within there?","Donald R. Chappel","Brett, this is Don. I think there's quite a few moving pieces. I think the biggest change is the expansion of the scope of the Bluegrass system to include, I think as Jim described, fractionation storage and export.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Back on the cash on Page 79, the 2014 ending cash balance of $308 million at WMB level. How much of that is Canadian and how much of it is domestic? And then just along with that, with the Bluegrass project expected to come online in '15, I would expect a significant amount of CapEx in '14. So how do you kind of bridge that gap at the MB level?","Donald R. Chappel","Becca, the bulk of that cash is Canadian cash. How do we bridge that gap? Well, it'll certainly be from capital raising. And it could be debt, could be equity. We'll determine that when we finalize our joint venture agreement and officially sanction the project.","Alan S. Armstrong","Becca, a couple of things on that capital I don't think we've disclosed. I think Jim took a question earlier around Boardwalk contributing to the pipeline and us contributing capital, that's not an accurate representation at all of the funding situation there. And I think the question was that -- Jim didn't say that, but that was what the question implied. And so there is a contribution of pipeline, but there's -- and there's some recognition of that in value. But the sharing of the capital obviously is a lot more easily split on the pipeline. As well, I would just say a big chunk of that -- we'd love to be in the field constructing in '14, but I'll tell you, more likely, most the construction dollars will actually be in '15. And the project is scheduled to come on very late in '15.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then on the Northeast, the segment data shows I think a loss of $9 million in segment profit, and the guidance is $100 million for the year. Can you talk to us about how that ramps up? Is it ratable to get to the $100 million? Or is it more back-end loaded?","Francis E. Billings","I guess I'm not -- I need to see -- I'm not quite certain of the information. Are you looking at...","Donald R. Chappel","Just looking at the first quarter versus your annual guidance.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","I'm looking at the adjusted segment guidance within the PZ first quarter data book that's on Page 5. It shows guidance for Northeast G&P of $100 million for the year versus -- sorry, I've got so many pieces of paper around here. I think the first quarter was a loss of $9 million.","Frank Billings","Okay. Let me see if I can get that in front of me. Why don't we take the...","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then while you guys are looking then, Geismar. In your call, your podcast, you talked about cost overruns at Geismar. Can you quantify how big those are?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I don't think we have disclosed that. I would tell you it's still a little bit of a moving target at this point. But the -- what we do know is that some of the estimations of the amount of steel and amount of wiring and so forth came in at a higher level. So you can see on Page 61 there, you can see kind of the new range for that. But I would tell you, we are pretty far along on it in terms of the project itself and have a very good idea of the required additional materials and labor on that. And so that's reflected in there. But I don't think we've disclosed the actual amount on that. But again, you can get a very good feel for that on Page 61 in terms of the range there.","Francis E. Billings","Sure. And to your question on the first quarter versus the year guidance, this is Frank again. I think what you're seeing in the first quarter is we had some slip issues, and we also had the rupture in the -- on the pipeline system in the Ohio Valley that hit some of the first Q guidance. But if you look at our businesses up there, other than the kind of the -- what we're experiencing in OBM, our businesses in Northeast Pennsylvania around our Susquehanna County Supply Hub assets as well our LMM businesses are performing pretty well. And we should be seeing good cash flow and segment profit coming out of those areas. So it's not back-end loaded. We should see it start to come back quarter-to-quarter over the rest of the year.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then the last one is on IDR support. You talked about up to $200 million. That's really going to fluctuate depending on how much WPZ needs. So as we model that, do we look to you guys wanting to target throughout the quarters a 0.9x coverage? Or what kind of coverage would you give support to? Or what kind of -- how much cash to get to what kind of support level on the IDRs?","Donald R. Chappel","Becca, I think we've maintained some discretion over that. But we have 1.05 coverage in the first quarter. We'll look at what the second quarter results are on a year-to-date basis, as well as our outlook for the balance of the year and we'll make a determination. I wouldn't expect that necessarily we'll -- we won't try to put each quarter exactly where we would expect the full year to be, but we'll look at kind of year-to-date actuals, as well as the outlook for the year in determining how much to waive each quarter to get to the full year effect that we are looking for.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","The $200 million only applies to '13, not to '14. Is that correct?","Alan S. Armstrong","It is for the next 4 quarters. So it does -- it would be available. As you can see right now, we're not forecasting that we would need that in '14, but it is available.","Donald R. Chappel","Yes. Our guidance includes a waiver for each -- well, for the next 3 quarters. So if you look at Q2 through Q4 and the -- the actual payment for Q4 would extend into early '14. That's what's in our guidance model. However, the commitment is up to $200 million over the next 4 quarters, and we're targeting a 0.90 coverage ratio for 2013. And again, we didn't model any direct waiver beyond the next 3 quarters, even though we mentioned 4 quarters potentially.","Operator","Our next question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I think most of the questions here have been asked, but maybe just a couple of cleanups. And first, just to clarify, the projected spending on Bluegrass, that anticipates the 50-50 structure? Or is that being showed more 100% at this point?","Donald R. Chappel","It's in the 50%, Carl, but it's not in our guidance. It's only in the disclosure of projects that are beyond the guidance set of projects.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. And then lastly, if I could just clarify, and appreciate the extra information on Gulfstar. This is with respect to 2014 WPZ guidance. Is it possible to clarify -- maybe Gulfstar is the only major project of note, but is it possible to clarify of the reduction in 2014 segment guidance and -- so understanding this is segment, not the DCF, how much of that came from the collective shift of in-service dates?","Rory Lee Miller","I'm not sure I have that. This is Rory, I'm not sure I've got that. If I had to guess, I'd say it's around half of it. And then the other biggest driver would be the other item that I mentioned about going through a rate case and our reserve rate and just dealing with a little lower rate base. But the Gulfstar project is going extremely well. I was down there last week and looking at the hull. The project looks fantastic. It's, like a lot of these projects, very complex and we think it could be a couple of months' delay on there. So that's about half of that change for 2014.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","For 2014? Right.","Rory Lee Miller","Right. And then after that, of course there's no effect. There's no impact to any of the revenue streams coming off then.","Operator","Our next question comes from Selman Akyol with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Most of the questions have been asked. In terms of Geismar, do you have a turnaround scheduled for this quarter?","Alan S. Armstrong","Take that, Randy.","Randy M. Newcomer","This is Randy Newcomer. We are -- right now, we're planning -- we're finishing up the detailed planning around the turnaround and the integration of the expansion. That will happen -- the tie-in of the expansion will happen during the turnaround. Right now we're anticipating bringing the plant down for maintenance and for the tie-in of expansion latter part of August. So it'll be a third quarter kind of event.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And how long would you anticipate being down at that time?","Randy M. Newcomer","We're planning -- right now, it's looking like -- and we have it in our forecast at about 50 days down.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then also in the quarter, in terms of production given the strength of margins, I think you were at 246 million pounds this quarter compared to the prior quarter of 261 million pounds. I was -- I would have thought you'd be a little higher than that given the strength in the market. Any comment there?","Randy M. Newcomer","Yes, a couple of things. One is that if you'll recall, the price of propane was down very considerably in the first quarter, and propane was actually the preferred feedstock during that time. And so we ran heavy on feed, which makes less ethylene, makes more propylene and actually higher profitability. So that's part of the reduction in the volumes in the first quarter. The other one was we had some furnace issues that kind of kept us one-furnace short for most of the quarter. And those have since been resolved.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just more of an industry question, I guess we've been hearing that ethane rejection has been running at about 175,000 barrels per day. Does that seem like the correct number? Could it be higher than that from what you see?","Alan S. Armstrong","I would say from the vantage point that we have, the areas that we have, I would say that's probably fair of the ethane that's positioned to be recovered today. Obviously, if you included all the ethane that's being rejected up in the Northeast, it'd be considerably larger than that. But I don't think anybody is really counting that because it hasn't been in the market previously. But I do think that looking -- if you track propane volumes and then track those relative to ethane volume, a pretty good idea even though -- as people reject ethane, as I'm sure you're aware, it does lower propane recoveries a little bit. And so I think that's a good indicator. But I would say from our vantage point that 175 is probably in the ballpark. It might be a little north of that, but that's probably a pretty close estimation.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","All right. And then finally, just for clarification purposes, you guys talked about your forecasting based on ethane rejection. Is that at the same level going forward for the next several years? Or do you have that declining in your forecast?","Alan S. Armstrong","No, we have the same -- really, when we estimate that for us, we're basically just looking at our plant economics and our variable cost economics and determining what we're going to do, obviously not determining what the whole market will do. And as I mentioned earlier, I think there's a lot of contract structures out there where there might be a percent of liquids contracts where the producer might be -\u2013 or sorry, the processor might be driven economically to continue to recover because they don't have the shrink risk, or there are take-or-pay or ship-or-pay obligations where the variable decision, if you will, is lower. And so they'll take a lower \u2013- because they're going to have to pay the transportation and fractionation anyway. Therefore, they'll take a loss on the ethane. So I think those are driving some of those decisions. But for our decisions, we basically are forecasting that we'll be in full rejection at all of our plants throughout the period. Now as I said earlier, I can assure you that will not be the case, that there will be periods where we're up a little bit as margins pop up and we'll take advantage of those. But as it's modeled in our plan right now, it is in full rejection.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Helen Ryoo with Barclays.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Actually most of my questions are answered. But just on accept and rejection, is any of your keep-whole contracts on your processing plants have \u2013- on those contracts, is there any must-recover ethane volume? Or could you just sell them at methane price when you have that negative spread?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. Well, really, the way that works from a contract standpoint is we just replace any Btus that we take out. So if we don't -- didn't take the ethane out, we just leave the ethane in and we don't have anything to keep a producer whole on. So we're not really exposed on that provided that we reject it. It's just \u2013 we only have to replace any Btus that we take out.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then -- so I guess the full ethane rejection you saw in the quarter it's mainly affecting just the Overland and Conway fractionators?","Alan S. Armstrong","That's correct. Now the Overland Pass line, of course, collects the ethane from our Piceance and our Wyoming plants. So that's Opal, Echo and the Willow Creek facility, and those are a large producer of our equity ethane barrels. That's a very large portion of our equity ethane barrels. And so those are in rejection. But remember that those go into Overland Pass, they're not actually fractionated at Overland Pass \u2013- sorry, they're not actually fractionated at Conway. They're fractionated by One Oak at their fractionation facility in the Mid-Continent typically. So those are 2 unrelated issues. I would just say Conway is seeing the impact of rejection in the Mid-Continent. Most of its barrels and its NGLs come in from barrels that are produced in the Mid-Continent area.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Got it. And do you have any take-or-pay type contracts on the Overland pipeline?","Alan S. Armstrong","No, we do not.","Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just a follow-up or it could be clarification, but I guess did you change your Marcellus gathering throughput expectations for 2015 compared to the previous quarter data book? And if so, how much of that is driven by I guess the spending reduction in the Laurel Mountain that was mentioned?","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. Give me just a second to pull-up my notes.","Operator","And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong","Let me get the answer -\u2013 finish the answer to that question. There's a few things that went on in the data book to data book. To your specific question, the largest volume reduction was probably around Laurel Mountain Midstream. And what we did there is we have basically forecasted, given that's a dry gas system at this point and really in anticipation of Chevron switching their drilling program into the wetter areas over the next few years, pulled out volume out of that area. But we also pulled back some capital as well. So it was a decision to reduce the capital that was associated with some of that volume growth. In ABA, what we did is we used to -- prior reporting, we actually had some volumes that were coming out of the William zone system and then flowing into the Laser system. Even though it was the same Mcf, we were showing those as being 2 volumes. So in the current data book, we've made a change to pull that out. And we're also doing some recontracting on that business. So it was being accounted for because we were getting a fee from Williams and then we were having a fee from Laser. So to make the -- we made that change. So that was probably the 2 largest ones. And then obviously, we did a little bit of a modification in Ohio Valley, which I mentioned earlier.","Okay. This is Alan Armstrong. I'll go ahead and close out the call. Thank you very much for your continued interest in the company. We remain very excited about the environment we're in as we see the infrastructure requirements to build out for these very low cost resources here in North America. And we are still very lucky to be so well positioned in the locations we are to be a major player in providing this infrastructure and excited to see the kind of very long-term growth trajectory we have, not just a flash in the pan kind of growth but very long-term growth trajectory that's going to come off of these major investments that we're making here both last year, this year and into '15. So again, thank you for joining us, and we look forward to seeing you on May 21.","Operator","And that concludes today's teleconference.

Kania - Wolfe Research LLC","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams and Williams Partners Third Quarter 2017 Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Chris. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn; and our CFO, John Chandler.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.","And so with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you, John, and welcome everyone. I want to begin by introducing John Chandler to this call as our new CFO. He joined Williams in September and he's no stranger to many of you obviously. John enjoyed a long tenure at Magellan as CFO and he actually went to Magellan whom we spun it out from Williams. We're very pleased to be welcoming John back to Williams and you'll hear more from John later this morning. Of course, John is replacing Don Chappel who's retired from Williams, and I want to thank Don for all of his contributions to the company and we certainly wish him well in his retirement.","As for the quarter, I'd like to start by thanking the team for another strong quarter of fee-based revenue growth driven by the project execution front as we continue to bring projects into service, on-time, and within our budgets. Importantly, we also continue to win meaningful new business which will keep our project execution teams busy for many years to come. The large scale advantage positions we've established continue to generate growth as evidenced by our strong results, with the year-to-date adjusted EBITDA up versus year-to-date 2016 despite the sale of over $3 billion of assets that generated $110 million of EBITDA in the nine months ended September 30, 2016, and the impact of two hurricanes that shut-in volumes from offshore producers. We substantially reduced our direct exposure to commodities. And as a result, our current business' steady growth is both predictable and transparent as it is being driven by consistent fee-based revenue growth under long-term contracts.","Our strategic focus on natural gas volumes continues to deliver results. So far in 2017, we placed four of our Big 5 Transco expansion projects into service, including Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase 1, the Dalton Expansion, and the New York Bay Expansion; with the fifth of the Big 5, the Virginia Southside II project, expected to be placed in service during the fourth quarter of this year. The incremental capacity from our fully contracted Transco expansion projects going in service so far this year reflects a 25% increase in Transco's design capacity. And year-to-date, Transco's transportation revenues have increased $74 million, a 7% increase over last year, and this is even though most of those 17 projects are being placed into service in the last half of this year.","So along with our successful project execution, I'm also pleased with how we've strengthened our balance sheet and credit profile, significantly reducing our debt and lowering our overhead expenses. In fact, year-to-date, in 2017 Williams Partners has reduced long-term debt by $2 billion and increased cash by over $1 billion. This reduced debt level and increased cash balance has positioned us to self-fund our attractive slate of growth projects using cash on hand, retained operating cash flow and debt without the need to issue public equity all while maintaining solid investment grade credit metrics and coverage. At the corporate level, WMB has paid down $372 million in debt, and total adjusted overhead expenses have been reduced by about $40 million when compared to the same period in 2016 as we were able to realize overhead reduction in several ways, including moving from five operating areas to three and closing the Oklahoma City office in June of this year.","So let's look at the results for the third quarter of 2017, and looking at the GAAP results first. WPZ delivered $259 million in net income in the third quarter of 2017, and WPZ's adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion. Our current business segments, the Atlantic-Gulf, the West, and the Northeast G&P \u2013 so those assets that we've retained, the businesses we've retained \u2013 combined to increase our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter by about $13 million. However, the full WPZ comparison shows a decrease in our third quarter adjusted EBITDA results versus third quarter of 2016 of $88 million. Of course, this was driven primarily by the absence of over $100 million in adjusted EBITDA contributed from the NGL and Petchem segments earlier, and of course these were sold by the partnership and this included the Geismar Olefins plant which we sold in July of this year, the associated RGP Splitter that we sold in June of this year, and our former Canadian businesses that were sold in September 2016.","I would add here that our third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increase from our current businesses includes an unfavorable impact of approximately $8 million from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma and contract restructures that lowered the West area results. So those are both contract restructures that we did in the Barnett as well as in the Niobrara area. So we're about to roll out of those or the periods of comparison of those, but those certainly had impacts on the West.","Looking to DCF for the third quarter of 2017, Williams Partners generated $669 million in DCF compared with $795 million in DCF for the third quarter of 2016. In addition to the unfavorable change related to the big asset sales, the DCF for third quarter of 2017 has been reduced by $59 million for the removal of non-cash deferred revenue amortizations that were associated with the fourth quarter of 2016 contract restructuring in the Barnett Shale in the Mid-Continent region. So we mentioned this reduction in last quarter's call as well, partially offsetting the unfavorable changes with a $37 million decrease in interest expense. Importantly, WPZ coverage for the quarter came in at 1.17 and puts us at 1.24 year-to-date. The cash retained due to this healthy coverage supports further investment in our high-return growth CapEx portfolio.","So now we'll take a look at each of our segments, starting here with the Atlantic-Gulf. The adjusted EBITDA for the Atlantic-Gulf came in at $431 million, a $3 million decrease from the third quarter of 2017. The year-over-year comparisons were impacted by the short-term benefit we had in Q3 of last year where we were gathering and processing gas for a competitor's Pascagoula plant, and so that we had a big lift in the third quarter of last year as you all remember where we pointed out. And in addition to that, in the third quarter we had impact from both Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.","Transco's growth projects contributed $46 million in fee-based revenues incremental, so a very good top line quarter here for Transco, partially offsetting the increased fee-based revenues with increased O&M expenses associated with Transco's required integrity and pipeline maintenance programs. These increased expenses are something we've been expecting and planning for. But I would say, due to timing of work and invoices, the expenses were slightly more concentrated here in the third quarter as usual. So overall, for the year, we're on plan and certainly within our expectations as we provided guidance there, but we did have it pretty lumpy here in the third quarter. A lot of that is just because we have the ability during this part of the year, right before we've got lines tied up for winter service, we've got a period that we can get in and go and get a lot of that work done, and we certainly got a lot of that done here in the third quarter.","So now turning to the West. For the quarter, adjusted EBITDA came in at $426 million, down by $7 million versus third quarter of 2016. Fee-based revenues were down on an adjusted basis primarily due to contract restructures. And also, EBITDA from JV's was lower due to the Delaware Basin joint venture sale from the first quarter. So recall, in the first quarter of this year we sold our interest in a Delaware Basin JV to Western Gas. The structural impacts were partially offset by continued tight O&M and SG&A expenses, and so really proud of the team continuing to put a lot of pressure on our overhead costs and our own direct O&M costs in the West.","Some good news I would tell you for the West, we did see increased volume sequentially. So when we look at the West, gathered volumes up 5% versus 2Q of 2017. You'll recall in 2Q we said we expected to see things turning that way as we were starting to see volumes come back mostly due to the strong volume growth we saw in basins like the Haynesville system, and we are seeing the big volumes in the Haynesville coming on out there and we're seeing this continue in the fourth quarter. I'll provide a little more on that just a moment.","Now looking to the Northeast. Overall, for the third quarter, our Northeast adjusted EBITDA increased $26 million compared to the same period last year. The current year benefited from higher proportional EBITDA from our Bradford County JV. Our Northeast volumes were up over 0.5 Bcf a day, a growth rate of over 8% in looking at 3Q of 2017 to 3Q of 2016 on all these operated systems. So this overall gathering growth was driven by both the Bradford Supply Hub and the Susquehanna Supply Hub growth. This growth was partially offset by lower Utica volumes. But again, just like we've talked about a little bit in the West, we were pleased to see the Utica volumes begin to turnaround, with sequential growth from 2Q of this year. And I would just note on that. Most of that turnaround in the Utica is actually on our Flint system which serves the dry Utica.","So now, let's look at year-to-date and take a look at what happened in our year-to-date results. In spite of the hurricanes and the removal of $110 million from our NGL-Petchem EBITDA, Williams Partners still delivered year-to-date GAAP net income of $1.21 billion and we delivered adjusted EBITDA year-to-date of $3.32 billion, an $8 million improvement from the corresponding period in 2016, primarily due to increased fee-based revenues, increased commodity margins, and an increase in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures and lower overhead expenses. Adjusted EBITDA from the retained businesses was up $118 million versus the same nine months in 2016 for our retained businesses, and so that is from the Atlantic-Gulf, West and Northeast G&P. So noisy as we got some of these asset sales coming out here on the year-to-date numbers, but overall really pleased to see the way our retained businesses are performing. Year-to-date coverage of WPZ is now 1.24, on the back of $2.1 billion in DCF. And this very solid coverage excludes the $175 million of EBITDA that is revenue amortization associated with the Barnett and Mid-Continent restructuring. So just to remind you on that, we include that earnings in the \u2013 obviously, in the EBITDA calculation, we included it in earnings but we pull that out of DCF.","So now let's look at some of our recent achievements as we continue to build long-term sustainable growth in the business. Several of our recent achievements contributed directly to our performance this quarter, including two more of our five planned 2017 Transco expansions placed in service during the quarter; those would be Hillabee and Dalton. And on Atlantic Sunrise, we started construction and have already placed a portion of Atlantic Sunrise into early service on September 1 of this year, providing about 400,000 dekatherms a day of firm transportation service on Transco's existing mainline facilities, and of course that serve delivery points as far south as Choctaw County, Alabama. So we're really excited to be starting to see the Transco system turn around and be able to deliver volumes to the south. And I can tell you, that's very much needed as we're seeing a lot of demand growth occur in the southeast on our system.","We are seeing exciting spurt of growth in the Haynesville. In August, we placed into service additional CO2 treating capacity. And as a result of customer activity and our increased treating capacity, volumes on the Haynesville system grew to 1.45 Bcf a day here in late October, and we now expect to see volume growth of over 30% this year in the Haynesville, making it our fastest growing basin this year across the Williams assets.","Also, as many of you know, we also recently won new acreage dedications from Southwestern in West Virginia, and we agreed to provide up to 660 MMcf a day of processing capacity. And by the end of the third quarter, we were already processing an incremental 100 MMcf a day of Marcellus wet gas from this new dedication. And with the addition of this 100 MMcf a day, the exit rate for our 3Q 2017 OVM processing was approximately 540 MMcf a day, and Southwestern is rapidly growing their wet Marcellus volumes on this dedicated acreage, and we're really thrilled to have the opportunity to help them maximize the value of this prolific acreage. We've got a great relationship with Southwestern and the teams are working very well to maximize the value of that acreage.","We also enjoyed significant achievements that we expect to contribute adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter. The Transco New York Bay Expansion project was placed in service here on October 9, and this was the fourth of our five Transco planned expansion projects. Transco continue to push new expansion opportunities forward as well, receiving a favorable environmental assessment on the Gulf Connector Project and applying for a FERC certificate for Rivervale South to Market, a new fully contracted 190 MMcf a day Transco expansion to New York and New Jersey markets. It's just another project that is supplying both power demand and replacing fuel oil with cleaner and more affordable natural gas in that region.","And now let's look at what's coming soon. Our commitment to continued growth is highlighted on this slide. Again, Virginia Southside II is our fifth Transco expansion project this year, and so we're really excited to see that conclude and looking forward to that coming on some time here in the fourth quarter. We placed Phase 1 of the Garden State Project in service in September as well. That's kind of a little bit of a bonus project on top of the five, and we will be placing that full project into service in the second quarter of next year. So that project is going well too.","We briefly touched on our Southeastern Trail Project last quarter. We were pleased with the results of a successful binding open season. However, we are pursuing an even more strategic opportunity that will serve those open season customers and provide a strategic expansion that will serve the broader industry with direct connection of low-cost reserves to these growing demand centers. So we certainly heard from the market that they needed the additional supplies, and we're trying to utilize that demand to make even more strategic expansions. So certainly not going to step over the top of the great opportunity we have there, but we are taking our time here to make sure that we make the very most we can out of that very valuable southbound expansion capacity on Transco.","In the Northeast, our big Susquehanna Supply Hub expansion remains on schedule, with an expected in-service date in late 2017. This expansion done for Cabot should drive higher volumes in Susquehanna, even ahead of the Atlantic Sunrise project. And this area just keeps on delivering growth, and we are already planning the next big expansion for this area.","In Wyoming, we were able to bring more volumes on to our Wamsutter system after placing our Chain Lake compressor station into service in October. And this is another project that was done on-time, and actually this one under budget to meet the growing demand of a key customer there in the Washakie Basin. And we're already exploring additional expansion opportunities for Chain Lake with two other customers in the region, and this is really an interesting area where we're seeing an emerging new play be developed in an old field in that area that was originally completed with vertical completions and a real opportunity up there now for horizontal application to that area.","With regard to guidance, our guidance for 2017 EBITDA and DCF remains firm, as does our previous distribution and dividend growth rate. We plan to announce our 2018 financial guidance with our fourth quarter 2017 financial results, and of course that will be in the first part of 2018. So as I wrap up, I'd emphasize we're pleased with the execution and our clear line of sight on long-term steady growth. After substantially reducing our direct exposure to commodities, our current business' steady growth is being driven by consistent fee-based revenue growth via long-term contracts, and we expect 2018 and 2019 to be exciting years as we finally see the bottlenecks in the Northeast clear to let the value of our long-term strategy be realized both in the Northeast and on our Atlantic-Gulf systems. So really pleased with the way things are looking right now in that area. And then finally I want to, again, thank Don Chappel for his great work at Williams and I wish him well in retirement, and I welcome John Chandler to this call as our CFO.","And with that, I thank you very much and we'll turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question comes from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. The deal with Southwestern was much more incremental volume in that area than what I had originally modeled. Without getting into too much customer details, can you speak to whether you expect tariffs on that contract to be generally in the range of your existing tariffs there or if you had to take a material reduction to get the deal done?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good question, Jean. I would tell you that the pricing on that was pretty similar to our earlier pricing. I think the area that we did provide some incentive on was for the Utica volumes. But we do have a great service offer up there and we certainly offered that because we have existing capacity there with OVM. So I would just tell you we're very pleased with the pricing on that and provides us a very high incremental return in that area. Having said that, of course we've invested a lot of money in the first place up there so you would expect those higher returns. So overall, I think we priced it about like we expected. It's just that we've got so much latent capacity to use there, that we've got a big incremental initial cash flows that come off of that business as a result of the available capacity we have in the area.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","That makes sense. So in terms of the EBITDA per Mcf range, it's sort of similar to what you had said at the Analyst Day?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yes. No change. That is a positive impact of what we showed there at Analyst Day.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Great, and that makes sense. And then as a follow-up. I know you probably can't comment too much more on Southeastern Trail. But is the way to think about it, that you have enough commitments for the low end of your volume options on the project and in what you're working on, is incremental volumes that maybe would go further on the system as well?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Maybe another way to think about it, I would just say we have a very attractive project that just utilizes the capacity on the system, and one that certainly rivals any other project that we have on the system from a return standpoint. But we really want to make sure, because there's very limited amount of that very precious capacity coming south, and the more capacity we do the more expensive it gets, and so it's kind of a reverse economies of scale on that just because it requires more and more capital investment as we expand that capacity. And so we want to make sure that we're getting everything we can out of that investment, including strategic benefits that would include connections to low-cost reserves. And so a great work by the team. We're really working well with a number of players on that. I would tell you I'm pretty optimistic, but the good news is we have the Southeastern Trail project if we choose to go forward with that. That is in hand and we're prepared to do that if we can't get the other deals done on a timely enough basis.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. That makes sense. So if you choose to do a larger volume project that would have higher costs, that you need to charge the same tariff to everyone, is that the balance that you're working on?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No. It's a little more complex than that, but that's probably about as far as I want to go with it.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. No, it's fair. Thanks a lot. That's all for me.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Don, good luck in retirement. John, welcome aboard.","John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I wanted to start off with the O&M. It seems like there was a bit of an uptick this quarter in the Northeast and in the Atlantic. And I just wanted to see if there was anything to this, if this is one-time in nature or seasonal or is this kind of a new run rate. Any color you can share there?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Let me turn that to our COO, Michael Dunn.","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. First in the Northeast, a part of that was the true-up of a tax issue, and so I wouldn't say that that was obviously a run rate issue. But the majority of that Northeast was a portion of that as well as some additional work that we were doing for landslide mitigation that's not typical, and that's pretty lumpy work depending on when we see something we need to go out there and fix. So that's really what drove the issues in the Northeast.","On the Atlantic-Gulf, and specifically on Transco, Alan touched on that earlier in his comment in regard to our integrity work that's underway there, and typically we see those costs every year rise in the third quarter because that's our opportunity to get the work done. And like a lot of our peers in the industry as well as our customer companies, there's a lot of integrity work underway across the U.S. on the natural gas infrastructure, and a lot of that's driven by either the regulations or the records reviews that a lot of companies are doing. And once you find issues within your records, and a lot of these pipes are quite old, and when you research those records you find that maybe you need to go out and do some hydro tests at some areas where you're not certain of the records covering the entire area where it was originally hydro tested.","And so we've taken on a lot of that work this year and we would expect to see more of that work next year as we continue to go through those records as well as just our ongoing integrity management programs that we're undertaking across the assets. And that's really what we're seeing on the Transco system. I would say that quarter three is typically our higher quarter for spend, and you certainly can't extrapolate that across four quarters of a year to come up with an annualized number. It's pretty difficult if you look at our history, higher than third quarter.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thanks for that. And I just wanted to touch base on the Central Penn Line a little bit more. And any more thoughts or details you can provide around timing and if that could be something that comes online sooner or later or just any other details as far as that kind of mid-2018 in service I think you've talked about.","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. We're really pleased right now that we've started construction on the Central Penn Line, which is the key greenfield infrastructure for Atlantic Sunrise, and we are targeting at mid-2018 for completion of the work on that pipeline as well as our compressor stations. And I will tell you that obviously weather is a big factor there with the winter construction for the pipeline and compressor station, but we're off to a good start so far and we're still targeting, as far as our project teams are concerned, a mid-2018 in service date for the completion of the work. And then we'll be commissioning activities that occur after the mechanical completion of pipelines as well as the compressor stations. So as you are probably well aware, we typically risk-adjust the revenues that you would see coming through in our forecast. But right now, we're marching forward for a mid-2018 in service date for the facilities that we have underway right now.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thanks. And then just one last one. I was curious on your thoughts in what you're seeing with Northeast basis differentials and specifically some of the commentary we've been hearing from some of the producers regarding a potential volume curtailment given these tough differentials. Any thoughts you could share there?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. We certainly did see some degree of curtailment like we often do during the shoulder months, and prices certainly were very depressed because there was very little local load. So if you think about what drives the volumes inside the circle, if you will, or within that region, the weather pattern was very mild there, and so very little local load there this third quarter which will obviously put a lot of pressure on basis. I think in addition to that, we had a lot of people building up reserve and expecting Rover to be on schedule, on-time, and that's hard to plan for when it moved as dramatically back as it did. So you probably had a lot of capital investment ahead of that that was too late to turn it back. So we probably had a little more production, a little more gas-on-gas competition, without any real exit from the area, just kind of moved the circle out a little bit but not really in each market.","And so I think that it's going to take some of the projects that Colombia has and then ultimately Atlantic Sunrise, and of course finally when Rover gets in the first quarter, gets out into some new markets, to really see that ease. However, we always see here in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, if we get some normalized weather, we will see the basis differential flatten out just because the local load will be coming on. And in addition to that, I would say we are seeing some new power plant load that'll be coming on next year. And so those are all positive things that are moving us forward towards better basis differential, but certainly the third quarter is pretty painful and we did see some volume shut-ins on our systems.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's all very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks. First question is just coming back to the Atlantic Sunrise and the Central Penn Line now that you've gotten into construction a bit. I wonder if you can fine-tune your CapEx assumptions. We've thought of this as around $2.6 billion I think on a gross basis. Is that a good number for the project?","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. We still are holding at that number. We obviously keep some contingency within our project forecast to remedy any situations or issues that arise during construction. But we believe that's still a pretty good number.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then I know you're just starting to get this in service. But as you think about the 42-inch line I believe, is there an ability to increase the capacity beyond the 1.7 Bcf a day that you've put in there, and what are your thoughts on doing that as you see the demand to get out of the basin?","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","You know, as usual, we'll wait and see if there are enough demand for projects. We do have some other projects we're looking at as well, expanding out of the basin, and so I think it is a little bit to be determined. So if you think about other projects like Constitution, probably be determined, that'll probably be the next expansion. And so I think people would kind of wait and see on that. We also have another couple of other projects that we haven't provided any announcement on that we're working on, that could serve to get volumes out of the basin as well. So I'd say those probably go first and, as you know, we get the existing project we're working on built before we talk about expansions on another one, and so that's where we stand today. But in terms of its expandability, certainly physically there is expansion opportunity on the system.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. So that's helpful. And then I'd love a little bit more color please on the West. You mentioned the Haynesville really picking up and sounds like momentum into the fourth quarter. Is that the main driver of that 5% increase in volumes? And then how do we think about, call it, unit economics I guess if the Haynesville is where you're going to see an uptick as we move into 2018. Would that be positive or negative to your overall unit margins there?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Great question. I would say in the West that the Haynesville is probably just slightly above our average on unit margins against all of our other West gathering business. And so it's a very attractive basin for us to see growth, especially at the level it's been growing, so that's very positive. The other part of your question was other areas. I think we had five of our western areas that we saw sequential growth in, and so we are seeing some turnaround in some of those areas. I would say the areas that probably we would expect to see growth \u2013 have the most impact would probably be the Haynesville, the Eagle Ford, and the Wamsutter area, particularly as we get into 2018 on Wamsutter because there's a lot of activity going on in that basin that will turn that around as well. So but I think that's probably about the best explanation I can give you on that. So overall though, I think as we mentioned last quarter, we were seeing some of those areas bottom out and start to turn around, and that's exactly what happened.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Very helpful. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please go ahead.","Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning. I just wanted to check on the Geismar supply contracts. It's a little bit tough to parse out through the financials. Should we look for that to start up kind of on July 6 with the commencement or the closing of the sale? And if so, can you guys quantify what the impact was there?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I do not have that number for you. I think you can call Brett or John to get a little more detail on that. But you are correct, that that actual contract would've started there upon the sale of that asset. So, but bottom line, that plant is running well and we're serving with ethane volumes. Obviously a choppy quarter because of the hurricane, and we did have some impact on a couple of our pump stations on that system due to the hurricane. But overall, the relationship with NOVA is going very well and we're providing them a lot of ethane.","Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And I think you just alluded to kind of the 2018-plus outlook. But just in terms of the quarter-over-quarter step up on the processing side of things, was there a particular basin that really resulted in that, whether it's Niobrara, Piceance or was that more of a general uplift across the systems?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Well, yeah. You named two of the areas that saw some of that uplift. And as well as I mentioned, looking broader, OVM obviously saw a pretty good step up as well as the Southwestern volumes got added during the third quarter.","Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. So for the Western segment processing volumes, mostly those two in terms of Piceance...?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah, Piceance. We also saw WPX volumes in the San Juan Basin lift up a little bit as well. So we also saw some positive processing business from WPX as volumes raising in the San Juan Basin as well, so pretty well across the board. We saw a pretty good movement. Probably the one area that we didn't see much increase was in the Southwest Wyoming area, which is at our Opal facility.","Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. All right. Thanks for that. I think I'll leave it there.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","I was just wondering if we can sort of talk \u2013 I realize you haven't put out a 2018 guidance and so forth. But I was wondering if you can sort of talk about the board discussions with respect to returning capital to shareholders? You get to a point where your leverage gets in line to be able to do so. And I was wondering if you're looking at dividend increases at WMB or are you also considering potentially buybacks of WMB or even WPZ?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Let me have John Chandler take that, Shneur.","John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I think the answer is, yes. I mean, we obviously are generating today around $100 million of excess cash at WMB above our dividend. And as we look forward, we have about $300 million, I think, or $400 million on a revolver, so we'll continue to pay that down over the next several quarters. And then as we look towards our dividend growth in the future and the excess cash we'll have at the WMB level, I think our guidance is the same that we've given in the past that, yeah, we'll look towards buying in WPZ units, even perhaps co-investing in projects if those opportunities existed or buying in WMB or a dividend increase. With all of those things, I think are on the table. We haven't carved any of those out. We, of course, are watching tax code changes too, and we don't expect that to happen until quite a distance in the future as we think about dividend increases. So that would kind of, I think, control what we did on the dividend front, but I don't think we've ruled out any of those options that you mentioned.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Cool. And then just as a quick follow-up question. Do you guys see an opportunity to expand Overland Pass either on a small scale with pumps or something much larger in scale?","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. There's a lot of new production coming on both in our Wamsutter area, in the Niobrara, both the Wyoming and DJ portion of the Niobrara, and of course the Bakken volumes that ONEOK gathers as well. So a lot of incremental demand for NGL capacity out of the area. And if you add to that an expectation of the ethane market and demand market growing, and expecting them to have to pull on ethane from these regions that today, while they have ethane recovery capability, there's not ethane takeaway capacity out of the area because the NGL lines are full. I think all of that leads to some expansion in the area, and certainly Overland Pass is very well-positioned to capture that expansion. So yes, a lot of activity going on on that front, and I think a lot of people are a bit surprised by the amount of volumes that are showing up coming out of these areas.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And the next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, everyone. I actually just want to start with some clarification questions. In the West, all of the wet areas, with the exception of Opal, contributed to the increase in processing volumes?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Well, I think we were talking earlier \u2013 Christine, we were talking sequentially.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right, sequentially.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Let us provide some detail for you on that, Christine. I think the bottom line, we did see the Piceance pick up, we have seen the Niobrara picking up. And looking at kind of beginning of the quarter and to end of the quarter, the pretty dramatic increase in the Northeast as we mentioned. I realize your question is just to the West. But, really, I think the majority of the increases in the West were pretty moderate in terms of processing volume, and that's with the exception of the Southwest Wyoming area.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then with the compressor station coming on in Wyoming and the opportunities to work with two other producers as you mentioned during prepared remarks, should we think that the G&P volumes here, like in the Rockies area, is going to continue to increase or is it just going to maybe stabilize decline so that it's flat? How should we think about that?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Well if you're talking about overall West volumes, so maybe just narrowing it to the Wamsutter area, we certainly expect some increase going into 2018 there and, importantly, a lot of liquids volumes on both the condensate side, which we gather, as well as the gas and NGL side; there'll be quite a bit of growth there. If you broaden that question to the overall West, then I do think that we'll continue to see volume growth in the Haynesville even though we're going to get up on limitations of our capacity there pretty quickly in the Haynesville. We'll be looking for expansion opportunities on top of that. We're going to see the Eagle Ford continue to grow, and we are seeing growth in the Piceance as well and the Niobrara. Of course, that is offset by places like the Barnett and the Mid-Continent and, to a lesser degree, probably continued decline in the San Juan Basin as well. So I think that's the picture I would offer you there. But overall I mean, the Haynesville volume growth is very impressive. I wouldn't expect to see another 30% growth next year just because we're going to be so tapped out on capacity on our side, but we would expect growth from 2017 to 2018.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. And then I don't know if there's much more you could provide. But on the Southwestern deal, can you just give some background on how did that came together? Was that a little bit of a competitive process or did one of you approach the other? And can you give us an idea of how many more opportunities like that are still available?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Well we already have a very extensive relationship with Southwestern there because recall that was \u2013 a lot of that acreage was former Chesapeake acreage, and so we were already gathering a lot of that acreage but we weren't processing it. And so because recall Access didn't have a processing arm, and so that gas was gathered into competitors' processing systems. And so our relationship with Southwestern that we've been working on, where we reform contracts out there and made them much more attractive contracts than what they had under the former Access-Chesapeake arrangement that we announced earlier in the year, I would say started that relationship off on the right foot. We also provide services to Southwestern up in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and we've been very successful there helping them find excess capacity in that area as well. So I would tell you, our teams have worked really hard. They have a very dependable and reliable relationship with Southwestern, and I would say they form some contracts that are very aligned to both parties' interest. But it really spurred off of the fact that we had the opportunity to serve them and serve them well on the gathering side already is really what enabled that relationship to expand.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks for that. And then just last question. Overland Pass. Can you remind us what the contract structure is there? Is that just based on a nomination basis?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","You mean in terms of who gets curtailed and who doesn't?","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Right. I just couldn't remember, like, when you guys started up that pipeline, if it was underpinned by some, like, level of MVCs or is it...?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No. It's a tariff contract, and so it has FERC tariffs on it. And it has discounted rates from the original dedications that both ONEOK and Williams enjoy. In terms of the way the capacity is allocated, it looks back to prior periods to establish your allocation. So basically build allocation capacity with your flow rates, and so whoever's been in it the longest with the most volumes and the longest has the capacity allocation.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks and good morning, everyone. Just a few follow-up questions to what has already been asked. First on Overland Pass, my recollection was that to expand that system you wouldn't really need pumps. It would be a loop of the pipeline because of how the pipeline is geographically located. Is that correct?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Generally, that is correct, Danilo. That's right. There's a little bit but there's very little available. It's running pretty full already.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Do you have a sense, Alan, for what the investment opportunities could be for an expansion?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","We haven't put that out there. And I would tell you, there's a variety of options that our teams are pursuing right now. But it's a sizable investment but we haven't put a number out there on that.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And to the extent that that would go forward here, you would still be able to self fund your pro rata share with that growth?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yes.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. And as a follow-up, I guess an extension of that question. Financially, you seem to have a lot of optionality here. Shneur I think asked a question with respect to capital allocation. Beyond considering a dividend increase or buybacks, what are you guys thinking with respect to M&A?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I would just say we've got such a great portfolio right now of high-return investment opportunities, that anything we do has got to compete with that. And so I think we've got our heads down very focused on developing the business that we do have. I would say that in areas like the Northeast, there is a lot of value in the consolidation of some of the joint ventures in the Northeast and we continue to look at that as we have for quite some time, I would say. And we continue to have a bid-ask spread between us and the various partners up there. But ultimately, I think that's something that we would certainly like to see happen but we're going to be very disciplined in what that CapEx investment is. But I'd say that that is very right in terms of that happening. You've got motivated sellers and certainly a lot of value in consolidation on our side, particularly in terms of the reduction of capital investment required to serve the growing volumes in the area.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you so much. Those are my questions.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Danilo.","Operator","And the next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi. Please go ahead.","Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good morning. Just as a clarification. You talk about the buybacks and such, and you mentioned during your comments that you're generating enough cash, you don't see yourself needing to access the equity markets. I know that's been the case for 2017. Is that something you foresee continuing into 2018 and beyond or is that too much of a stretch for right now?","Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, that is exactly \u2013 and previously we've said for the next several years. But I can tell you, and looking at our long range planning, we don't see a need for that. So we think we've got a growth rate that's very sustainable with the combination of both retained capital and debt capacity while maintaining some strong credit mix. So feeling very good about the capitalization right now and continuing to fund the growth that we have in front of us.","Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Great. And if I think about spending in terms of next year, and I recognize you may not want to give too much detail, but we've got basically the remainder of Atlantic Sunrise, we may see a start up of some of the Northeast supply enhancement CapEx I would guess \u2013 that's another big project \u2013 and then you had talked in the Analyst Day slides about a potential $500 million of annual growth capital in the Northeast. With the agreement with Southwestern Energy, is that something in the $500 million range next year do you think? And how does that fall out? Is there a sense that you can give us as far as maybe a dip in CapEx or how that looks going into 2018?","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","We're not providing guidance on that. But I would just tell you what we provided at Analyst Day, both in terms of those continued opportunities as well as the opportunities in the Northeast, continue to be pretty in line with what we're seeing in terms of growth opportunities for the future, so kind of steady as she goes and no big surprises there. I will tell you that we're in a very nice position to be allocating to the very best capital opportunities, and we're maintaining very high returns as a result of that. And so we do have a whole lot of opportunities, but we're being pretty disciplined about what we're investing in.","Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","And then I guess lastly, I guess in the timeline, and maybe this is just sort of a theoretical question, but you mentioned about next year and how you're thinking about tax reform and how that could impact some of your decisions. At some point, do you reach a point where you say okay, we can wait on Washington and see how they come out with tax reform or are there options at some point in terms of a timeline where you say we might want to take an action and we don't necessarily want to wait for full clarification from Washington on tax reform?","John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No. I think in all cases, using tax code today and the amount of capital spend that we've got, we've got a fairly long window still, a period that we don't view that we'll have cash taxes at WMB. So I think we've got a long period that we can kind of wait to see this unfold. So hopefully that answers \u2013 we're not motivated to do anything quickly on that front.","Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And the next question comes from Shere Craig (sic) [Craig Shere] with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning, Craig.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Alan, you've talked about a number of incremental growth opportunities kind of in line with Analyst Day. Are you still saying in total with what's already disclosed and what is kind of out there on the horizon and the aggregates of 7 times EBITDA multiple on all the pending projects out, say, through the end of the decade?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yes. I would say the returns that we've talked about on Transco, in that range, and as well the very high incremental return I'm always quick to point out in the Northeast because we can't forget about the capital we had to invest to get those opportunities. But that is continuing to be the case in these regions where we have very strong competitive advantages. So I don't really see that changing at all right now.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And can you comment on the potential size and timing of additional West segment Wamsutter system expansion?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I would say the Chain Lake expansion that we did was relatively small; I think it was right around $50 million. And so I would tell you the plans are getting bigger out there for some of the players out there. Their appetites are getting pretty big, and so we're watching that very closely and we're beginning to plan alternatives with the producers out there in the area. So I do think there's going to be continued investments of probably that size and larger as we expand the facility. But remember, we have a very large condensate handling business there already that can handle a lot of that, but we also have a lot of latent capacity at our Wamsutter processing plant. So just like in the Northeast where we've got these higher incremental returns, we're enjoying the same kind of thing in the Northeast because we have that latent capacity sitting there at our Echo Springs processing complex.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I know you all asked the FERC to kind of take some proactive steps on Constitution. Any updates there?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Continued great work by our team. Chad Zamarin, who has been heading up our efforts there with the federal agencies, has had some very productive meetings and continuing to push the ball forward on that. And so I would just say stay tuned. It's a pure upside to our plan, but we're encouraged by some of the commentary that we've got coming out of there. But still a relatively long put when you're having to fight a state as hard as we're going to have to fight that state to win that battle. So plenty of fight left in this dog and I think we're well-positioned for what we've got. We will have a fight I suspect.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","In terms of timing to see how some of these steps kind of unfold, are you thinking that by first quarter we could have more substantive detail?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yes, I think that's a realistic timing if not before to know kind of the next step there anyway.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And last question. Can you speak to the impact across your system from the recognizing of extremely nominal direct commodity exposures? But there's been much stronger propane pricing and we're hearing word of ethane recovery just starting to kick in in the fourth quarter here. Can you speak to the impacts of those across your system?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. On the propane pricing, I would say that we do have some pretty attractive hedges in place here for the fourth quarter, and we've got a little bit going into the first quarter, propanes and some of our heavies. So I think we've got pretty good margins coming through on that. But as you know, it's just gotten to be such a relatively small piece of our overall business, that's not all that big. On the ethane front, I think we have about 50,000 barrels a day that we could be recovering that is not unrecovered. But as I mentioned earlier, some of that is back behind pipelines that are constrained like Overland Pass. Some of it is not, however, in the Gulf Coast, and so we could see some pull through. In fact we are seeing some ethane recovery but I think the margin will just be as high as it needs to get to pull the ethane in until we see ethane get really short, which I think we could see, and then it's going to have to drive a margin high enough to pull in and build capacity on things like Overland Pass for those barrels.","So I suspect that's going to take a little bit for the market to really realize it's going to have to pay up for that ethane before it comes on. So we'd expect some to and fro in the ethane market as it tries to grab more capacity or more productive capacity. So some exposure but I would say we've got hedges on kind of in the mid-80 range on propanes here in the fourth quarter that will dampen some of that dollar of propane that you've seen it spike up to here and there.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And just a final follow-on to that. More fundamentally from a volumetric standpoint, subject of course to the debottlenecking process in the Northeast, are you starting to see increasing interest from producer customers in the wet gas Utica and Marcellus areas that could kind of feed that very long-term opportunity discussed at Analyst Day?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yes. I think the areas that we're seeing right now that's most focused on is the dry Marcellus, the dry Utica, and the wet Marcellus. But probably I would say in order of economics right now because of the NGL whip that you mentioned just a while ago, we're seeing a lot of push into the wet Marcellus right now. And of course, the dry Marcellus is just such a terrific resource up in the Northeast, that we're going to continue to see that area grab any kind of capacity it can just because the margins are so high on that. I would say the one area that we've seen pull back a little bit is the rich Utica or the wet Utica is the one area we've seen pull back a little bit relative to the other opportunities.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. Appreciate the color.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Just a follow-up on I guess the Southwestern contract. It sounds like you're using existing infrastructure to meet that contract right now. But do you think there is a potential to add, I guess, additional processing or frac capacity to meet that contract as volumes ramp?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I'm going have Michael Dunn take that one, Sharon.","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning. At our Oak Grove facility, we currently have one TXP unit there and a portion of a second one that was built a while back, so we have latent capacity in the first one that will be filled and we do think that TXP-2 will be under construction sometime next year as well to handle that capacity. So there is some incremental CapEx there but a portion of that's already been spent with the portion that was already built, so I would see certainly some capital expenditures contributed to that effort. There's still capacity in some of our frac there, so I think we're okay for now on that in that regard, but certainly would expect to see some processing capacity expansion at Oak Grove next year.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And TXP-2, is that another 200 MMcf?","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Volume? Yes.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And just for the quarter, it looks like Northeast's CapEx ramped up pretty significantly sequentially. Was there a specific project tied to that spending?","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. That's primarily some of the work we're doing for Southwestern with the agreement we had earlier this year. But the majority of it is for the Genesis expansion up in Northeast Pennsylvania to support Cabot in regard to their production coming online next year. So we would expect that that ramps up obviously in the fourth quarter this year as well. Just finishing up that work. We've got a couple of compressor stations under construction there as well as some pipeline interconnects and pipeline systems being built to support that expansion.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Sharon.","Operator","And our next question comes from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Alex S. Kania - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi. Good morning. I guess this question is in regard to the West and related to the asset impairment I guess for the 10-Q. There is some discussion on a potential sale of some kind of assets in that segment. I was just wondering if you could give a little bit more color on that?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","John, would you take that one?","John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. I don't think we'd contemplate selling anything right now. We were approached I guess I should say on some assets in that market that made us look at some type curves again and re-evaluate the value of those Mid-Con assets. One comment I do want to make in that the write-down was a $1 billion write-down, but our estimate of fair value has not changed materially quarter-to-quarter for those assets. Those assets were actually written up, the book value of those assets were written up back in the 2014 to 2015 timeframe when we acquired the Access assets. Got it at a very different pricing environment, and of course that's materially changed today. So actually, during the quarter our fair value estimates for these assets have changed very insignificantly. What has changed is the overall view of undiscounted cash flows, and they fell a little bit below our carrying value that the assets carried on for our books, which made us write them down to fair value. So I just want to make it clear. We don't have a change of view relative to the assets for the quarter that they changed by $1 billion.","Alex S. Kania - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.","At the end (01:04:30) cash flow. It's just happen to fall below that book value during the quarter.","Alex S. Kania - Wolfe Research LLC","Great. That makes sense. Thanks.","John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we have no more questions at this time. I would like to turn the program back over to Alan.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks everybody for the great questions. Really excited to see the kind of top line growth we saw this quarter from our retained businesses and very excited about the growth opportunities that are in front of us right now, and look forward to a strong fourth quarter here as well as we continue to see the projects that we've been putting online continue to contribute.

(Operator Instructions). At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir","John Porter","Thank you, Tina. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams, Williams Partners, and Access Midstream Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on each of these three company's websites. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong will speak to you momentarily.","Our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to questions and we also have the four leaders of Williams operating areas with us. Jim Scheel leads our Northeast area, Allison Bridges leads our west area, Rory Miller leads our Atlantic Gulf area, and John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem services. We also have Mike Stice, Dave Shields and Bob Ferguson joining us from Access Midstream Partners.","In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we\u2019ve have reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan Armstrong","Great. Good morning and thank you, John. Thanks everybody\u00a0for joining us today. As usual, we have got a lot going on as we continue to pursue this tremendous growth that our strategy continues to deliver. We\u2019re coming off a quarter here that was in-line with our expectations, but much lower at WPZ due to Geismar's extended outage and a continued heavy capital investing period all as was expected.","But certainly, we\u2019re looking forward to a much better quarter coming here in the fourth quarter, as some of our major projects start to come online and we see some dramatic improvements in volumes in the Northeast.","A major change is afoot as we combine both WPZ and Access into the large scale natural gas infrastructure MLP. And the team here at WPZ is very energized right now as we\u2019re on the verge of a major $1 billion boost in our annual cash flows that we expect to come from three major projects Geismar, Gulfstar and the Keathley Canyon Connector all of which have reached the commissioning stage here in the fourth quarter.","We also are very excited to see volumes and profits beginning to rapidly escalate in the northeast operating area as many projects have been commissioned here in October and provide a little more detail on that later. The Access team continues its great performance as we have all come to appreciate this team's ability to steadily grow its volumes and cash flows as it connects gas supplies in some of the most prolific basins in the U.S. And we also are continuing to see major potential Transco projects coming our way as a result of Transco's competitive advantages.","These new prospective projects include the Appalachian Connector and the Diamond East projects, both are major new projects that connect the burgeoning supplies from the Marcellus and Utica directly to growing demand on Transco that is anxious to see the supplies coming their way as those markets strive to grow as well.","And of course we continue to have a long stream of projects that are under construction that will keep this well identified fee based cash flows continuing to grow throughout our guidance period and beyond. The major changes that will be occurring within the new merged partnership are exciting in many ways. First, we will have the highest forecast distribution growth rate of any of the major MLPs. Second, our coverage will be above average for the same peer group with expected $1.1 billion of excess cash flow coverage through 2017 and the Access cash flows, along with our major new fee based projects continue to dramatically reduce exposure to commodity prices.","The Access LP holders are about to see a 50% step up in distributions to $3.65 in 2015 versus the forecasted $2.42 per LP in 2014. So truly a very exciting time here as we merge these MLPs and really turn this into the MLP in the major integrated group and particularly one that is well-positioned as we have talked about before with its strategy that is so focused on natural gas.","So there are many changes occurring as these major tailwinds form and this first big tranche of capital finally begins to bear fruit in a very game changing manner against the traditional WPZ assets. But what has not changed is our commitment to a strategy that we strongly believe will be the most enduring growth model amongst the infrastructure MLPs.","We have worked in a very disciplined manner to have this strategy of connecting the very best natural gas supplies to the very best natural gas markets at the center of all of our portfolio and capital allocation decisions. So we continue to stick with the strategy that we are very proud of and we think has positioned us for great long-term growth.","The strong and undeniable fundamentals of low-cost clean energy and the cheapest petrochemical feed-stocks in the world will prevail we believe and we\u2019re seeing the demand pool beginning. We have continued to position ourselves in a way that will catch this very sustainable and fundamentally supported wave of volume growth and at the same time, help our customer base achieve their lofty goals of growth as well. We appreciate all the support and patience from our investor base as we\u2019ve had some bumps and bruises along the way getting to this as we have pursued this very ambitious plan. And we\u2019re thrilled that many of you are well-positioned to catch this next big wave of valuation growth at both WMB and at the partnership level.","So now let me quickly point out a few things in the prepared slide deck here beginning on page 2. You can see here just an overview of what we will hit on today most of which I have touched on already, so let's move on to slide 3.","On slide 3, as I\u2019ve mentioned in the opening WPZ's DCF was low, but was in-line with our expectations. Major drivers of the lower DCF was a missed opportunity on Geismar of over $200 million. So that's the number if we would have been up and running that we predict here in the third quarter, and higher maintenance capital as expected and was forecasted for the quarter.","So this is really the time of year that a lot of our maintenance capital gets done. As you know, we had lower than expected maintenance capital for the first half of the year and we started to catch up with that as we usually do during the third quarter. Also we had some outages in Canada, particularly from some Suncor outages and we also had a planned turnaround at our Redwater facility where we made a lot of the significant tie-ins for our CNRL Horizon project which lowered volumes there in our Canadian assets as well.","Also we had slightly lower than last year adjusted segment profit plus DD&A was just off of last year. This was driven by lower NGL margins and this was really driven as the result of a loss of the keep-whole processing contract up at our Opal facility. And thankfully though, this was largely offset by about $36 million in higher fee based revenues in the quarter on our consolidated assets and operated assets.","And at the same -- we got the same kind of very positive move in our equity investments in both Discovery and Laurel Mountain Midstream. You should really continue to expect a lot of great things coming from these equity investments across the board really here in the fourth quarter; Blue Racer Midstream is continuing to see great Utica volume growth. Our Discovery system gets the Keathley Canyon Connector started up and the Laurel Mountain Midstream benefits from our increased ownership which has now moved up to 69% versus 51% in the third quarter.","Also as you can see on this slide, ACMP's adjusted DCF was up by an impressive 42%, driven by 20% higher fee based revenues and so this all combined for WMB, these Partnership holdings now produced a segment profit plus DD&A of $838 million which was 36% higher than the third quarter of 2013. So, really starting to see some great distributions out of PZ as always and now an increasing amount coming from Access.","Moving on to slide 4, you can see some of the operational highlights here for ACMP and starting with a big milestone of 6 Bcf a day of gross gathering volumes which the team hit in September and also ACMP's 49% interest ownership in UEO continues to increase in importance.","And this really well-placed infrastructure that\u2019s referred to as UEO is serving the rich Utica volumes and the volumes continue to expand rapidly up there and now two new trains planned. One planned to start up later this year and one planned to start up at the end of next year. And also great work by our Access teams, getting the Bucking Horse plant started up in Niobrara. That\u2019s planned for later this year and I'm really proud to see the way our Williams and Access teams are working together. As you know, we\u2019ve very substantial processing operations at Williams in Wyoming and then very thankful to see our teams working so well together to help bring up the Bucking Horse plant up there to serve the Niobrara.","So overall net volumes on ACMP are up 9%, and as you can see where the high performers are in this list that drove that growth with of course the Utica being the star of that.","Moving on to slide 5, looking forward a little more now, and we expect to see the fruits of Williams' major capital projects really starting to kick in here in the fourth quarter of 2014 and in a very powerful way in 2015. In fact, these three projects alone are expected to produce nearly $1 billion in 2015 cash flows and to put this in perspective, these three projects should drive a 33% improvement over WPZ's expected segment profit plus DD&A for 2014 and during 2015. So huge driver coming from these three big projects, and we will also have an even larger impact on DCF because a lot of the financing of course the financing costs have been carried for a large portion of 2014 on these projects, as these have been very long dated capital projects. And these assets have had really very little -- they have had very little planned maintenance capital for 2015. So a huge driver of DCF in 2015 as well.","We also have several other recent milestones and achievements listed. All of these would normally be big deals, but we have so many developments, it really is getting hard to give them all their due bandwidth, but just to provide some details on a few of these items.","The Geismar rebuild and expansion project is complete, and we have begun to bring hydrocarbons into the plant this week, and start-up operations including the final dry-outs of the primary systems. And then once those dry-outs are completed, the actual cracking processes will be initiated later. I certainly want to just take a moment, and thank our team there at Geismar for their intense focus on doing this project safely.","It has been a very large and complex project, and they have remained very focused on no matter how much the pressure is to remain safe, and keep that first and foremost and I'm thankful for both their leadership and management there at Geismar for keeping that front and center. On Gulfstar, we are complete with our work, and Hess is now running the spar. They announced yesterday that they plan to have first oil within the week, and this project team also achieved first quartile safety performance on that project.","Tremendous effort, to bring so many different skill sets and capabilities together to get that project delivered, and we are very thankful to be getting to work with Hess and Chevron on delivery of this major asset as well. And then the Keathley Canyon connector has been fully hydro-tested, and is now in the dewatering mode. Anadarko will control the timing of this first production which they and we still expect later this quarter.","Our Constitution project reached a major milestone last week, and this was the receipt of the final environmental impact statement for this project from the FERC and this gives the Commission the green light to approve the project as designed, and we are pushing for a November order from the Commission. And of course, they certainly understand how important it is to get this project up and moving, so that we can reduce some of the bottlenecks and constraints of getting gas supplies up into the New England states for the winter of 2015 and 2016.","Our Transco team has just continued to knock it out of the park in the areas of business development and we had two very successful open seasons in the period, and we continue to string together both important base hits which we just continue to have a number of laterals and expansions off the systems and the occasional grand slam like the Atlantic Connector project that is significantly larger than even the massive Atlantic Sunrise project. And I will hit on that a little bit more in a minute.","On slide 6, you can see the continuing list of projects that we continue to click off on the left. And on the right, potential projects are being added so quickly, it is really getting hard to keep this slide up to date. You will note that we had to move the Rockaway lateral into the first quarter of 2015 due to some construction environment difficulties that we face there.","However, even more offsetting this, we expect to place portions of the Leidy Southeast and the Virginia Southside project into service earlier than planned. So, great job there of the team, continuing to be innovative in ways to bring some of those projects on earlier where the environment allows us to do so.","We also expect to be able to move our Canadian PDH project into the firm category later this month. We will still have a few contingencies related to third parties on that, but we will have our feed study completed for PDH-1 and we will be going for final Board approval here in November. So, great progress being made on moving those projects along as well.","On slide 7, we\u2019re going to provide some detail now here on the really exciting Appalachian Connector project\u00a0and we\u2019re not disclosing the actual capital on this project at this point, but we do expect this to be at least 50% larger than our Atlantic Sunrise project, so very large scale project.","It involves a major greenfield line that you can see coming out of the panhandle of West Virginia, the northern panhandle of West Virginia down into a connection there in Virginia and then a major expansion along the system to be able to move those supplies into the various markets both to the north and to the south. Actually all the way to station 65 which is zone 3 on Transco and of course, from station 65 you\u2019ve access to both growing industrial markets as well as access to many of the expanding LNG facilities in the area.","So really that is coming together. And that really helps us be the supplier for the LNG projects that are being developed along the coast as well on Transco. So the support from these shippers has really been tremendous, as this is one of the few projects that delivers gas to the actual markets.","And so, this really gives an ability to a producer or supplier to really go get the highest price because they have so many options of where they can sell their gas and they can really go to the highest bidder for their gas by having so many multiple market options along the Transco system.","Really this is a tremendous value proposition to have all these -- the direct access to all these growing markets on Transco, not just existing, but really growing markets and we also are excited to see the confidence that the producers behind our Ohio Valley Midstream system. And our investment in Blue Racer, the great confidence we are seeing from producers there in growing their volumes out on the system as well.","And so that connection that we like to really stress about being able to connect the very best supplies, to the very best market outlets, this is just another great example of that. Of course, you saw that with Atlantic Sunrise coming out of the Susquehanna County area and now we\u2019re able to basically do that in the same way, coming out of the southwestern Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and southeastern Ohio areas.","So our gathering business really benefits from this because it would have the best market outlets out of the area. And of course, our market end customers get access to these great prolific upstream supplies. So really a win-win-win and really shows the strength of our strategy.","Moving on to slide 8 here, really exciting drivers for getting the merged MLP into the very, very strong and offensive posture and getting our 2015 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $5 billion. As I mentioned earlier, a 50% move-up in the distribution for ACMP unit holders from the 2014 guidance and a 30% increase over the 2015 distribution guidance.","So we will have the best-in-class distribution growth at 10% to 12% through 2017 and with a very strong coverage ratio at or above 1.1 and about $1.1 billion of excess cash flow through 2017 that we expect to generate off of this strong business growth.","We also will enjoy strong investment grade credit ratings and very limited equity needs up against this current business plan, because our cash flows continue to grow, continue to expand our debt capacity very rapidly.","So really excited about how we have got this merged MLP positioned. It is strong from a strategy standpoint. It is very strong from a capability standpoint, and now financially extremely well-positioned for the environment that we are in.","Just to talk very quickly about a few of the synergies that we are seeing. One of the things we are really excited about is really looking for the very best capabilities exist between the two companies. One of the areas that we are really seizing on very quickly is Access' well-honed, modular compression design.","And so we\u2019re looking at that to be a major savings for Williams here, as we look to see the cost and the scale frankly, that we gain by having all of the compression installation that both parties do, and being able to really be the low-cost provider of getting in that the field, in a very quick way that serves our customers. So great capabilities there by Access, that Williams is very rapidly adopting.","Likewise, up at the Bucking Horse plant as I mentioned earlier Williams of course has great strength in the operations of processing facilities and we\u2019re very rapidly bringing those alongside Access and helping them get that plant up in a safe and reliable manner and then one other area that I think is really impressive for us is the Access North Victory system that lies just to the north and east of our OVM system is going to be the beneficiary of -- provided that the transaction goes through, of Southwestern Energy's acquisition of Marcellus acreage in that area.","And we think that bodes very well in terms of having a new buyer in the area that is very excited about that acreage and who has got the capital to bring to that. And of course, that system ties into our OVM system, and ultimately then would have access into the great Appalachian Connector project. So great example of how we are stringing together the synergies of our assets up there.","Moving on to slide 9, this is really impressive picture of valuation here at the new merged MLP. And so, what you have here is regression analysis between the distribution growth rate and so, we have got the merged MLP here marked at 11%, and then on the Y axis you see the current yield. And of course, this shows that on a regression analysis basis that the merged MLP should ultimately trade out at a sub 4% yield, even at that yield, on this line you would see a $94 unit price for the merged MLP.","And frankly, we think given the coverage ratio which is just above the average for this group, the strong credit rating that we have and the tremendous strategy and clear line of growth. We think we actually ought to be trading below this line on the regression analysis. So really excited to see this valuation coming through and we think the market is waiting to see some of these things like Geismar and Gulfstar get done and those start to cash flow, and so we think we are just on the verge of realizing this kind of value at our MLP.","Moving on to slide 10, a tremendous opportunity with Williams, we just couldn't be better positioned right now, very excited to have delivered a 32% raise in our WMB dividend and following that with a 15% dividend growth rate through 2017. So tremendous value that we\u2019re able to deliver for our shareholders and I don't think anybody doubts the amount of growth that we have out in front of us.","And I do think obviously, there has been concerns over our ability to execute and bring some of these major projects on-line and we\u2019re just on the verge of passing that stage. And then we continue to have a number of very large scale projects going forward.","Also very excited to see the very strong capabilities of Access and Williams coming together from a leadership perspective and from an operating capability standpoint, very solid alignment, I would tell you, between the values of both of these companies.","And I want to take a moment, and thank Mike Stice for his tremendous leadership at building such a great organization with great values. And we\u2019re just very thrilled to be able to working up alongside Access and taking some of the best ideas that they have to offer and bringing those in to Williams and as well, excited to have the new team there at Access all pulling on the same rope. So with that, we will turn it over to questions. Thank you.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). We will go to our first question with Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS","Good to see the progress that you have made with respect to coming to an end and putting forward the Geismar project and in closing up the merger. I was wondering if we can sort of transition on some questions more on a go forward basis, with the merged ACMP\/WPZ combination, you\u2019ve sort of mentioned in the past a high percentage coming from revenue.","When you think about the 2015 guidance can you share with us some of the sensitivities around NGLs and that margin you have baked in -- in terms of the low and the high-end of guidance in terms of how we should be thinking about the commodity environment?","Don Chappel","The combined MLP will be more than 80% fee based since all of the Access business is in fact fee based and much of it under cost to service or MVCs. There is really no direct commodity exposure there. So I think you can look solely at the Williams -- and if you look in our data back on slide 85 you can see the sensitivity of the price changes on commodities. Again I think we\u2019re fairly diversified on the commodity front. It will represent less than 20% in 2015 and that percentage will likely continue to decrease as we grow the fee based business much more rapidly than the commodity side of the business.","Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS","And as a follow-up, I recognize the fact that you're expecting about a beds of cash flow coming in with some of the new projects slated to come on-line late this year. How do you think of your leverage funding for the next several years as you sort of think about the big capital projects and so forth? The expectation to fund it kind of on a 50:50 basis? Just wondering if you could give us a little color and how you think of your current leverage.","Alan Armstrong","We would expect the merged partnership to maintain its kind of mid-BBB investment. Somewhere around four times debt to EBITDA on an adjusted basis so I think that will be the guide post. We think the business plan that we put forth with the $5 billion of EBITDA and the 10% to 12% growth rate through our guidance period that ends in 2017 can be financed with a very modest amount of equity.","Obviously we\u2019ve many more opportunities in front of us. Alan highlighted a couple of major ones. I would point out that those are fairly long lead time items so something like the pipelines that Alan mentioned would kind of service dates the financing for those is really out principally in 2017 and 2018.","Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS","Finally on the Constitution Pipeline, if I saw correctly you have requested to get the final sign-off within the next 30 days or so. If it takes longer than 30 days, does that delay the project due to weather issues and so forth? And also I was wondering if you can comment about whether you think the length of pipeline will deviate much from the current plan.","Rory Miller","Well, the timeline right now as it sits is very tight. We\u2019re hoping to get the FERC certificate on for Constitution Pipeline in November. If that happens, then we will be looking for notice of completion from the New York in December [ph] -- along that same timeline. It is a very tight schedule, but if we get the kind of responses that we are hoping for, and we think are possible, then we can still make the heating season of 2015-2016.","We do have some major delays. If we have mullet tie month delays, then that heating season won't be possible. So there is a chance that we could get pushed beyond that but we are trying to be very clear with everyone involved I think the need for the gas is definitely there. We saw that with the polar vortex last heating season. And I think we\u2019re just trying to get the message out to let people know what's at stake. It is going to take some cooperation but we think we've got a good shot at it.","Operator","And we will now go to Christine Cho with Barclays Capital.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Regarding the Southwestern purchase of Chesapeake with Southwestern it is going to 11 rigs compared to Chesapeake's one. I know it's early days and the deal is not even done yet and we don't know where the rigs are going to go, but can you give us an idea of how much undedicated acreage is -- that subpoena for grabs overlaps your footprint? Then you kind of mentioned this in your prepared remarks, but given ACMP at one point was Chesapeake's MLP are there opportunities for you guys to process the gas that ACMP has the dedication for on the gathering side or is that already committed to other players? Can you just give some more color on your synergies there?","Alan Armstrong","Sure, Christine. We can provide you the detail you're looking for there today. I would just tell you that there is a very substantial amount of gas that is available for processing from Chesapeake and potentially now Southwestern. So, I would just tell you there is a lot of acreage there that needs processing, some gathering and processing services and I would just say that we are very well positioned for both of those 0.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, with the recent correction in the mark, we saw a number of deals get announced and obviously Access to capital markets is pretty key in this space. And just add a brief (indiscernible) that maybe non-investment grade MLPs might have trouble raising capital, and if we see some more of these big companies spinning out with mull till billion dollar backlogs with drop-downs. I would think some of these private equity players hoping to monetize their investment maybe the IPO might have trouble competing with something like that. Has sentiment of potential sellers changed from where you sit? Can you kind of give us an idea of what you\u2019re seeing on the M&A front?","Alan Armstrong","I would say that it has varied. Obviously some of the smart money I would call it decided to take some risk off the table of that early and get out while the getting was good and I would say that sentiment is probably becoming more pronounced.","I agree with the concern you raise and I do think that we will see some movement in that direction, because I don't think anybody wants to be left being the guy that was too greedy waiting for any more increase. I think people appreciate the market is pretty hot and so I do think we will continue to see a lot of assets coming out of the private equity sector into the market. And I think they will start to appreciate how much quality IPO there is that has some pretty major advantages over less substantial offerings.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, and then I guess kind of piggybacking off your response to that, I think you guys are now sitting on an option to enter into the Permian. Deal size isn't too big, multiple looks attractive, although you probably have to spend a couple hundred million to get there. You\u2019ve the parent of a potential partner behind this system. However, you\u2019ve previously said that you would like to be number one or number two in a basin. Are there any initial thoughts you can provide us, and is this an area that you would be interested in growing into?","Alan Armstrong","We\u2019re not going to respond on exactly our position on that. We\u2019re just not at liberty right now to discuss that. However, I would say that we have been looking at the Permian from a business development standpoint, particularly the Delaware basin for quite some time.","From a Williams side, we've had a lot of producing customers that are customers elsewhere that have been interested in us providing services in the area where there is not much infrastructure and certainly we\u2019re not interested in going into areas that are already well served, but I would tell you there is a lot of that basin that is not well served\u00a0and we\u2019ve been looking at it that and I would say we would like to enter it in a way that.","One, it is well supported from a financial perspective and two that ultimately we get to a scale position that has competitive advantages and provided that we can accomplish both of those tasks, then yes we would be interested in entering the basin. But those are two pretty lofty goals in terms of making sure that the cash flows are well supported and that we\u2019ve a clear line of sight on gaining scale and competitive advantage the way we usually enjoy in a basin.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, last question for me, appreciate all the color. One of the competing pipes for your Appalachian Connector project, you know recently announced it was moving forward at least to station 165. Is there room for both projects? Or do you think yours is different and off because it provides a clear route to station 65? And then when you also say it's 50% more than Atlantic sunrise, you mean 50% of what the CapEx is for the 100% interest or just your interest?","Don Chappel","On a gross basis, it's 50% more as well. So you can use either number because we said more than but even more than a gross amount. In terms of the advantages of that project, I think it is almost two different projects frankly because I will tell you the strength of the Appalachian Connector project is that it does not just get you to station 65, it allows you to go directly to those LBC interconnects, directly to the town borders, directly to those markets.","And so rather than sitting at a pooling point and being stuck with gas that you have already paid a rate to get there. You don't really have any options but to sell it at that point, you can go to multiple marks and you can go cut deals with people who want to have growing supplies on their system.","So I would just tell that you is the distinction. It is very major distinction and as to whether there is room for both, I would just say that I think our shippers are speaking for themselves -- can't really speak for the other project, but I would just say given the way the response we have gotten from the shippers that are interested in our project, that would tell me there is room for two, I guess if the other project has economic support as well.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Is the shippers for you guys mostly producers?","Alan Armstrong","It's a mix, pretty substantial mix just like we have seen in our other big projects like this.","Operator","And we will now go to Abhi Rajnandan with Credit Suisse.","Abhi Rajnandan \u2013 Credit Suisse","Couple quick questions, in the northeast segment EBITDA was actually down sequentially in the third quarter. I believe there were some one-offs included in the results, but could you help us think about some of the factors preventing maybe a quicker ramp-up in the profits in the segment and how we should think about that trajectory looking ahead from 4Q and then into next year?","Jim Scheel","As we look at the third quarter this year, let's take a step back and talk a little bit about volumes. During the last earnings call we talked about the number of wells coming on line. We actually had eight wells delayed during the third quarter coming into the OVM system. That was obviously a disappointing issue for us, some producer issues.","But we see those coming on-line pretty quickly, and we have won a site to 35 more wells coming on line over the course of this quarter, two of which are dry Utica wells. So as we look at our exit rate for the year for OVM, we are very excited about the opportunity to continue to see a very robust fourth quarter. That would be combined with some additional fee based revenue coming from all of the new assets that have come on-line. Obviously I have been disappointed by and the delay in bringing on the stabilization facilities as well as CXP 1, but we've had a lot of assets coming on-line, and just getting that all put together has been a pretty big issue, keeping that as safe and as efficient as possible has been our high priority. So those are coming on line as we speak.","We've got commissioning activities coming on today that will also improve earnings coming into the fourth quarter. We've also seen pretty much the completion of a major expansion around the Susquehanna supply hub so volumes there have increased since the close of the third quarter by about 200 million a day and we are excited about the continued increase there. So we've got a great trajectory for future growth. Then when you combine that, one of the things you wanted to reconcile to was the third quarter.","As we think about that, we had some kind of -- I won't call them extraordinary but we had some income from Cayman associated with the fire, and then one of the other changes that we have to be aware is with Laurel Mountain Midstream, we have a percentage of gas. Gas prices have been down for the third quarter and so we've seen a hit from that as well. So if we really look at earnings growth going forward, taking out those two things, we still see a nice improvement as we look forward to the fourth quarter and into 2015.","Abhi Rajnandan \u2013 Credit Suisse","Shifting gears to Geismar, could you give us some color on the ramp-up there over the next couple of months? When do you guys expect to kind of get up to commercial levels of production, and then when could we potentially see operating rates up in the 90s like the rest of the industry?","Don Chappel","From where we stand today, as you saw in our announcement, we've announced that construction is complete and we\u2019re fully into the commissioning and start-up activities. These activities are largely focused on getting the plant dried out and oxygen freed and leak tested and rotating our major equipment in the plant in preparation for the startup.","Sitting here today I would say November 15th, plus or minus a few days is where we should be for making first ethylene as is signaled by our announcement. Then as we look forward beyond that we are expecting a ramp-up, first, I would say what was the base plant rates in order to make certain that we get the entire machine lined out and make certain that we've got a good stable operating system at that point of operation and then shortly after that ramping it on up to the expanded capacity.","The overall timeframe for getting that done from the day we start making first ethylene is going to be notionally around a month. It is going to be about four weeks but again we\u2019re going to want to do this in a very disciplined way. We've brought some unbelievable operational discipline to the plant there in Geismar and the team is going about this startup in a very deliberate way and a very deliberate disciplined way. But I think that brings all the color you need to give a sense of how we are going to bring the plant back into operation.","Abhi Rajnandan \u2013 Credit Suisse","Last one from me coming back to the merger between the MLPs. So based on the previous iteration of the terms I think you guys have put out figures expecting about a 1.2 times dividend coverage for MB in 2015 and 2016. And then on the revised terms I think cash available after dividends comes in slightly lower. So could you just give us some color on how to think about the maybe new Access coverage over the next couple of years and any other puts and takes there?","Don Chappel","In terms of the 1.2 times we boosted the initial distribution I think before we said at least 349, we decided to go with 365, so quite a higher initial distribution there, that reduced the coverage a bit but the coverage is still well north of 1.1 times.","And in terms of the transaction, we shifted coverage from Williams to the merged partnership. We thought that was the right thing to do to create the kind of valuation and the partnership to make it the lead entity to move Williams to a pure play GP HoldCo. So we shifted the coverage to WPZ again over that three year period, took the coverage down at Williams but nonetheless we still have over $300 million of cash coverage just in 2015 and 2016 really with no real need for that capital.","It is nice to have, and I'm sure we will find a value adding use for it, but nonetheless rather than run 1.2 times coverage at Williams without a clear need for the excess coverage or having double coverage, in fact, with the partnership having coverage and Williams having coverage, we didn't see that adding value. So really shifted coverage to be very substantial at the partnership with again the industry leading growth rate for large cap MLPs and taking the coverage down at Williams to a level that we think is appropriate.","Operator","And now we will go to Brad Olsen with TPH.","Brad Olsen \u2013 TPH","I would like to focus on the macro and maybe follow on some of the questions that Christine had about the pipe project out of the Northeast. Obviously you guys are in a pretty unique position having multiple large scale projects currently out in the mark for producers in the northeast and when you look at all of the different markets that Transco searches do you have a feel -- is there a specific market where either producers feel that they don't have enough access to or the consumers in that market don't feel as though they have enough access to northeast production growth? Just trying to get a feel for as you fill the pipe with all this gas where is it actually going to head and where is there economically the most pull for that gas?","Alan Armstrong","I would just tell you that the amount of new gas-fired power generation obviously in the southeast is a major issue as that area converts off of coal, if you follow some of the commentary from folks like Southern Company. I think one of their big concerns has been whether there would be adequate infrastructure built out in time, and reliable infrastructure to serve their power generation loads.","And so I think this project helps answer some of that frankly. As well, we\u2019re continuing to see obviously a lot it of folks wanting to get to spots where they can deliver to LNG contracts, and by getting all the way to station 65 with this gas, that option becomes available as well.","And then, of course, we also have like the large methanol project that Transco has contracted to serve just south of station 65 as well. And as well, all of the southeast from just a general load standpoint continues to grow and so we see that continuing in those regions as well. So many projects like the Dalton Lateral for instance, are projects that need supply.","And demonstrate the growing markets, the (indiscernible) expansion to serve Sabal Trail. I will just tell you Transco is winding up being the big high-pressure header that's right in the middle of all the market growth, and people realize that, and they want to be there, not just to serve any one particular market but to have the options of going to where that market growth is.","And so it is really a network value, if you will, where you have all the best supplies in the country trying to get in to places where the best marks are and that mutually attracts each other to being connected to that big header.","Brad Olsen \u2013 TPH","Even further south of 65 I know you guys have talked about potentially working with Pemex on the deep water projects that they're starting to pursue, but is there an opportunity maybe for Transco even in south Texas, where you have some existing infrastructure to participate in any of the tenders that either Pemex or CFE have out to import Eagle Ford and other gas supplies into northern Mexico?","Alan Armstrong","We have a relatively unique project. I would tell you that we have been working on and we\u2019re not positioned to describe that just yet but we are pretty excited about it. And we think it's a very low-risk way of serving that growth in the market and we\u2019re continuing on a nice trajectory to develop that project. But, yes we do have opportunities and yes we\u2019re pursuing those.","Brad Olsen \u2013 TPH","And if we could flip to the ethane side of things, we've recently seen received (indiscernible) for their world-scale cracker and I think that rounds out six or seven crackers which are set to proceed. Interestingly we've seen ethane exports come out of is nowhere and gain quite a bit of steam as well. In light of these recent announcements, how does your view of ethane as feedstock change? I guess more directly, does potential tightening in the ethane market later this decade cause to you rethink what you might use for a feedstock on a second Geismar project, or does it give you pause about a second Geismar world-scale cracker in general?","Alan Armstrong","I would just say that we think there's a lot of ethane available with these growing gas supplies. However, what's not getting invested in actually right now is the infrastructure to be able to recover all that ethane and get it into all these points of consumption and obviously that's a business that we like, and one that we continue to have an eye towards in terms of how we play a critical role in distributing -- recovering and distributing all of that ethane.","So I think, it's a very good question\u00a0and it's at a time like this when the market seems to be awash in ethane, people are unwilling to invest in the infrastructure that it takes to get it recovered and into those markets, but we believe that just like what we are seeing on the gas side now where the demand is on the verge of really starting to grow pretty rapidly.","We think the same thing will happen on the ethane side, but it is going to take quite a bit of infrastructure, and we are certainly working hard to plan that. We\u2019re in the process of commissioning our Bayou Ethane project which extends ethane from Mont Belvieu over into Lake Charles area in Louisiana and ultimately connects into our system that gets ethane all the way over to the river, and so that's just an example of how we are positioning ourselves to be a solution to the problem that you describe which is going to eventually catch up with us.","Brad Olsen \u2013 TPH","And you mention the ethane pollution. Are there opportunities as we see the ethylene market potentially growing 30% or 40% with all these new crackers and Brownfield projects? Do you see opportunities on the Olefin transportation and storage side as well as on the ethane transportation and store?","John Dearborn","Absolutely we do in that we continue to promote our projects on the Gulf Coast around the transport of both propylene which today will be made from new sources like propane de hydro units, what is now Flynn Hills and down [ph] to new markets as well as some additional propylene splitters that will put new supplies on to that system. So that's one pipeline system that we are promoting.","And then the second is what we call our project which is an ethylene pipeline which is intended to connect some of the major players on the ethylene side in order to bring some of the really more about reliability there. But as well give the opportunity to get ethylene into the hub where ethylene will be able to be traded well in that hub in order to be able to do some good price discovery of ethylene which is a service that Williams brought to the market in the last couple of years.","Operator","I will now go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Some clean-up stuff here, the Canadian PDH sounds like you're close to FID there. Any sort of zip code on the capital involved there? Can you confirm that will be 100% fee based and then the kind of return you would be looking for?","Alan Armstrong","You know, until we take that to the board, Ted, and we've got an outside party involved in there as the customer and so I think until we get all that wrapped up we\u2019re are not -- don't really want to be announcing any of those details just yet. But as you know we've continued to try to work that project in a way that it reduces our commodity exposure in that space is and we think we've found a nice way and a nice partner to accomplish that with.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. I wonder if you can just talk a little bit, looking out west here the implications of buying the 50% interest in Ruby. Do you think that helps at all your Pacific Connector project or should we really just look to sort of Jordan Coke [ph] going to FID?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I just think it non straits their confidence in the project and certainly they're the ones that have the very best seat at the table there. We certainly have worked alongside them and have our own internal perspective, but I would say anybody that's putting their money where their mouth is something you ought to pay attention to and they certainly have stepped up and done that.","Ted Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then last one from me is just as you look at the deep water, any thoughts? We have seen some of the majors continue with the activity out there of another Gulfstar, more like the Keathley Canyon project. How is the outlook there?","Rory Miller","The timeline on making deep water infrastructure investments and I guess development of deepwater prospects is pretty long, usually it's a four to six-year cycle to get that started. So current price is not really too instructive about those decisions. There is a lot of what I would call pent up discoveries in the mill, if you will. A lot of discoveries have been made and they're slow going to sanctioning right now and that's predominantly, I think, because producers are waiting on that 20-K technology to be made available.","I think the target is maybe sometime in the 2019, 2020 timeframe that the technology and the equipment will be ready. That's slowing things down a little bit more than the price of oil but we do think we\u2019re going to have an opportunity in the next 12 to 24 months to deploy another Gulfstar, and as those project get broken loose we think we will be well-positioned. We haven't lost any interest in that. It's kind of 10 and the flow of the deepwater but most producers are looking out I think six years or so in terms of what the price is going to be at that time.","Operator","And our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Picking up on Ted's question about Geismar 2, have you all given any more thought with Geismar 1 ramping up over the next couple of months possibly neutralizing the commodity risk there over the next year or two?","Alan Armstrong","Craig, we continue to look at that, and obviously what we\u2019re trading off there is the high margin and the benefit we get from that versus the stability of fee based structure, and as well I would tell you we really would like to do a transaction that pulls all the way through our infrastructure.","In other words, takes advantage of the ethane supplies and death that I know length that we\u2019ve, our upstream business, and pulls that all the way to our own infrastructure. And so that would be our preference on how we would do that and provided we could make enough margin in the fee based side to help offset a large portion of that commodity margin. We would do that and so I would just tell you we are always weighing that balance internally, but it is a hard margin, especially given how strong the fundamentals are right now.","It is a hard margin to give up, but we do continue to look at that and I would say it would probably come in the way of a fairly large structured transaction for us to get that because it would, as I have mentioned, would it involve trying to get the value chain all the way back through our access.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Sounds like that's not anything imminent, maybe more like 2016 or beyond?","Alan Armstrong","It might come with contracting on Geismar 2 perhaps -- and perhaps a portion of that so it could come ahead of that.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","And picking up on Christine's questioning, with the MLP set to finalize the merger in just the next couple of months, have you had any formal discussions with customers about amending ACMP's cost of service arrangements to dove tail with WPZ's infrastructure in kind of a win-win manner?","Alan Armstrong","I would just say -- to answer your question directly is no, but I would say that we see a lot of opportunity. We've had some very encouraging meetings with the Chesapeake team and really honestly, pretty impressed, frankly, by the attitude that Doug Lawler is bringing to that and kind of a high trust relationship that we\u2019re used to working in and one that we can really drive win-win solutions for each other in. And so while we don't have anything specific there, I would tell you I see a lot of opportunity between our companies to continue to expand our relationship in a way that's beneficial for both parties.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","And there has been some kind of strange trading between WPZ and ACMP since is you announced your finalized merger agreement. Can you discuss anything that would logically push this past the fourth quarter distribution record date, so that PZ would get the higher February payment versus the combined one?","Alan Armstrong","It's just a typical SEC process so we will file the S-4 within the next couple of weeks, then it's just a question of how quickly we get through the SEC. It could move very quickly or it could be a bit longer. So that's really the wild card. It's just really the SEC process for the S-4. As we indicated in our documents Williams has sufficient votes to ensure that the vote is in favor of the merger and in fact, we have already committed to vote in favor of the merger. So there is no doubt as to the outcome. So it is really just the SEC's S-4 clearance process.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Last question, I think you have $275 million of outstanding unpaid insurance claims. Can you kind of give some more color about what the primary questioning is around this and to the degree you don't recover, what you had anticipated? Does the MLP just kind of chock that up to history, or does MB help out in any way?","Alan Armstrong","Craig, we\u2019re vigorously pursuing the claim and we think we\u2019ve a very strong claim. Obviously the insurers would like to pay less, so there's some level of debate. I don't think we want to go into the details, but certainly we\u2019re actively engaged in the process. We and our insurers have now agreed to non-binding mediation in an effort to resolve differences and we\u2019re going to begin that later in the month of November.","As to what happens if WPZ falls short, it will just be a shortfall in the collection. It will be kind of a onetime item that I think and that's the way we look at it, really no other action that would be related to that. But again, we\u2019re vigorously pursuing the claim\u00a0and we will begin the mediation process in late November.","Operator","And now we will go to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital","Just maybe two quick areas of cleanup, Alan, if I first go back to Appalachian Connector, I'm just sort of curious with some of the competition that you\u2019re seeing there, do you see any potential for either this project to move into -- or to have partners in the structure and similarly, do you expect any erosion or change perhaps in the economics from what you saw in Atlantic Sunrise as far as return on capital?","Alan Armstrong","I would answer the second one first. I think very similar kind of the targets of course a larger portion of this project is Greenfield in terms of the capital amount so we had a less leverage if you will off the existing system. So potentially, depending on the ultimate size potentially could be a little bit lower than what we enjoyed on Atlantic Sunrise just because that was pretty extraordinary, but still very attractive returns on the project. Secondly, I would say that the -- as to the partnership and arrangements there, we think we've got a good project going ahead and while there may be some partners that bring some strategic value to it that we would entertain right now. We would tell you we have a project that we think stands pretty well on its own at this point.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital","I had just one quick follow-up on that, and I guess I ask this in the sense that all large infrastructure seems to be taking longer than expected to kind of get done these days. And so I'm just curious when you all work backwards from a potential late 2018 (indiscernible), when do you feel like you need to basically have shippers locked up I mean as far as whether you\u2019re getting to the present agreements or following it with a binding open season? When do you kind of have to have that in hand do you think?","Alan Armstrong","I would just tell you we\u2019re in the stage of negotiating those agreements and making great progress on that and obviously the quicker we get them done, the less risk we\u2019ve on the timing. But I would tell you we've got a very sober viewpoint out there these days on what it takes to get these projects built and we've got that built into our perspective. But having said that, we can't spend six months getting the agreements negotiated, so I would say it's more -- a couple months to get this done within our expectations. Again, I think the appetite that we\u2019re seeing, I think that's very doable at this point.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital","And then last quick question, just maybe turning to Canada, and this is really more on the base off gas and the processing and I think you actually mentioned some of the coker outages at Suncor and it looked like there was maybe been maintenance at Redwater, I think you said (indiscernible). I guess maybe my question is that do you\u2019ve a sense of what the missed opportunity cost was in the quarter from those outages from the lower equity NGLs? I think you mentioned Geismar for instance being $200 million. I didn't know if you had a similar analog for the Canadian side.","John Dearborn","If I could just make a few comments though about how things are going up in Canada. First of all we have invested mightily over the last year in reliability up in Canada so we\u2019re poised to take as much gas as our partner is ready to deliver to us at that facility. In fact, we've made some improvement projects that perhaps might allow it to be higher than our earlier expectations.","Secondly, in terms of operational discipline in this last turnaround, we actually got through this turnaround slightly less time than we originally planned. We accomplished a 100% of the tie-ins that we wanted to accomplish during the turnaround and came in slightly under budget. So now that the answer to your question is probably about $20 million in missed opportunity in Canada this quarter. Against what would be operations at full capacity receiving all the gas that we could from our partner.","Operator","Our next question is from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo","Just following up on your previous comments, have you tried to quantify some of the commercial opportunities you expect to realize and what type of upside that represents to maybe 2015 guidance for the merged MLP?","Alan Armstrong","The only thing that we've put out there, Sharon obviously, is that the merged MLP of $50 million savings and I would tell you we think that's very achievable at this point. And we really haven't though put a number to the commercial side and I would tell you some of it will be pretty hard to characterize. For instance, if we\u2019re able to pick up volumes and develop a project like Atlantic Connector based on some of those synergies, that's a longer term value proposition but nevertheless valuable. And so we haven't really put any kind of numbers to the commercial side of that yet and as I said it's such a fluid situation in terms of customer responses and so forth, that's going to be pretty hard for us to quantify. But we\u2019re certainly excited what we\u2019re seeing, and Jim Scheel and John Seldenrust, John runs that area for ACMP, are working closely together to capture a lot of those and I think both of them are pretty impressed with the amount of opportunities that we\u2019re seeing.","Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo","And just one last one from me, for the drop down of the remaining Canadian assets is there a specific reason why the drop would occur to WPZ versus the merged entity in 2015?","Don Chappel","Sharon, this could go either way, it's our expectation. We'll likely drop it to WPZ. It will likely happen just prior to the merger but it could happen concurrent with the merger, but it's something that we've got some flexibility on, but it's likely going to be first of the year.","Operator","And we will go to Timm Schneider with ISI Group.","Timm Schneider \u2013 ISI Group","Quick one from me, so I think it was two weeks ago or so Sunday night, a report hits Bloomberg, Williams amongst bidders for a competitors Rockies, gathering processing system. Obviously not expecting you guys to comment on that transaction, what I'm interested in is what's your appetite for acquisitions at this point? What are you guys kind of seeing? And then specifically how do you balance that with kind of working through what you already have on your plate and then follow-up on that is how do you guys look at your securities as currency in this environment?","Alan Armstrong","I would just tell you, Timm, as we've said all along, we\u2019re always interested in acquisitions that are write-down or ally in terms of being strategic and in areas that further strengthen our hand, but we\u2019re not interested in just doing (indiscernible) acquisitions that aren't additive to our strategy. And so I would just say we\u2019re going to be very selective, but given the large footprint that we have there is a number of project that would add a lot of synergies.","I would even suggest something like QEP. Not surprising to me that somebody assumed we would be the buyer because I would tell you we would be a pretty good buyer for those assets just given the synergies that we\u2019ve in the area.","And so we will certainly be keeping our eyes open as to the equity value. I would tell you obviously we've demonstrated we think we\u2019re really undervalued substantially right now, but we think that will correct itself in the not too distant future. So we\u2019re going to be pretty stingy with our equity obviously when it's valued like it is right now but we do have our eyes open and we do have other financing means given the strong step-up in cash flows that we've got coming our way.","Operator","And we will go to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Chris Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies","Just want to follow-up on some of Carl's questions on Canada. John, curious if you talked about or Alan talked about the Redwater outage, Suncor downtime you gave some color on the impacts of the quarter. Just wondering where we stand right now? Are there any outages of that nature we ought to be thinking about on a go forward that would be sort of profiling over the next 4 or 5 quarters and then as you sort of assessed the operations up there given some of these disruptions do you still feel comfortable about the segment profit target that you had previously given for next year? I think it was kind of 170 to 210 range?","Alan Armstrong","You've asked a lot in that question, so let's take it piece by piece. Looking forward into next year in the fourth quarter, late third quarter \u2013 fourth quarter, obviously we've got to finish up the tie-ins for the horizon project which will be coming on-line. So we can expect there will be some outage during that time. We try and minimize the impact of these outages by continuing -- we keep our wells as dry as possible ahead of the outages so that we keep the gas, or the liquids flowing out of the LEP unit up at Fort McMurray for as long as practical. We minimize the impact. So that's I think where we\u2019re there.","And then to the second point as to how do we increase, and perhaps I would ask the question a little differently, how do we increase the reliability of the gas flow. We\u2019re spending an enormous amount of effort and time in collaboration with Suncor to help both solve some of their problems which they have some real problems that need to be solved at their plant as well as to obviously assist them in getting more gas to our plant.","Until we have multiple sources of gas getting to our plants, multiple sources of liquids, I think we are always going to be beholden to the reliability of our single supplier there. So I guess -- I don't want to give the excuse it's out of our control, because we want to work with Suncor in maximizing our opportunities at this stage but until we have the multiple sources I think we\u2019re going to have the risk of the single source of supply in front of us.","Chris Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies","I think sticking with Canada for a moment, but shifting to Don, wondering about the pending drop-down of the projects up there given I guess, the fact that they're in-progress opportunities largely. Wondering if you could sort of help us think about the potential multiple we might expect there. Obviously nothing specific but we've seen in-progress opportunities be dropped at book value, some companies talk about sort of flywheel effects that are generated from those in-progress opportunities and sort of expand them. So I'm just wondering your thinking now, the Board's thinking about the Canadian opportunities in light of some of the challenges we've seen up there as of late.","Don Chappel","Chris, what we\u2019re thinking is that the aggregate portfolio of assets, both the project we mentioned as well as a variety of other prospective projects would include includes the Syncrude prospect, the Canadian PDH, Geismar 2 and the Gulf Coast pipelines, they're all held by Williams NGL & Petchem Services, it would be dropped together and we would drop those at about invested capital, so book value if you will and that was part of our I will say negotiations as part of our merger.","Chris Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies","One more question from me real quickly. You've had some questions obviously in this call and I think, Timm hit on it with acquisitions and what not but, Alan just curious, how do you think about the IG rating, the surplus cash your projecting over the next couple of years? It does appear you have retained a lot of financial flexibility if the execution matches the plan. You know you're slides indicated, you\u2019ve stated on the call. You don\u2019t think you\u2019re being paid for the distribution and growth that you're projecting right now. So I'm just wondering given that, are you likely to accelerate any of those growth projections or is there -- if more head room comes available or would you rather sort of add coverage, keep optionality on the table as you think about potential acquisitions that might come, additional project that might come, any color on that would be helpful in regarding your priorities.","Alan Armstrong","I would just say that we do think we\u2019re not being valued for the growth at either the MLP or at the parent level right now and frankly, I think that's to be understood given the outage at Geismar and some of the risks around that and some of these major projects that we\u2019re bringing on-line.","And so I think now as those issues are cured, I think we could see a pretty big step-up on that. So I would just tell you, we\u2019re pretty energized about how our strategy is playing out. We think there is a lot of acquisition opportunities that would be dead in-line with our strategy and continuing to strengthen that. And certainly with the major footprint that we have now with the combination of Access and WPZ, there is just more opportunities out in front of us that we are the right buyer for.","So I would tell you, I think we\u2019re in a pretty offensive posture, but I would say two things, tamp that a little bit. One, of course, is that we do need to see our equities valued properly and two, when you've got such a tremendous growth in your cash flows built into your model and you're running accretion analysis, You\u2019ve got a big step to climb there to be accretive against such a terrific growth pattern that we already have. So it's great problem to have when your base business is growing so strong to look at these acquisitions.","But at the end of the day we\u2019re very focused on our vision of being the player in this natural gas space on the infrastructure side and we\u2019re going to stay committed to that vision but do it in a financially prudent manner.","Operator","And now we will take our last question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet \u2013 JPMorgan","Just one small question follow-up here at the end, I was just wondering if you look back towards the end of the data back and you have segment profit guidance reported to adjusted on slide 103, just looking at the 2015 guidance it seems like there is an item in the northeast GMP of $136 million. And I apologize if I missed it, but could you just provide some color on what the item is?","John Porter","Yes that was an item that we had in the fourth quarter of 2014 that we discussed on our second quarter call that has now been moved into 2015. We haven't given specific details around that but it was an item that we were expecting to come through our GAAP earnings and felt like it should be adjusted out. It's contingent type item.","Operator","This concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Alan Armstrong at this time I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan Armstrong","Great. Thank you very much. Well, as you can see, this growth is right on the verge of here at WPZ. ACMP continues to perform extremely well and the combination of these two great organizations is something to be very excited about.","However, as we think about all of this growth, I think one thing I want to recognize to our investor base here is the tremendous amount of toil and effort that goes on by these teams that are bringing these big projects in. It is not an easy job these days to work these projects and do it in a safe manner and there is all kinds of hurdles that are constantly facing these big projects and these teams have stayed with it and done their work in a safe and reliable manner and I just want to say a big thanks because of all these great rewards that we\u2019re able to offer back to our shareholders are really coming through the efforts of our great operating teams and our project management teams. So I want to recognize the great effort that's going on there.","So with that, thank you all very much for joining. Appreciate, as always, the great questions and we\u2019re really looking forward to really seeing this major powerhouse really starting to take off. Thank you very much.","Operator","This does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation."],"22997":["The Williams Cos., Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","And at this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John D. Porter - Director-Investor Relations, Enterprise & Planning","Thank you, Angel. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners.","Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And also we have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","Over the past many months, we've taken many questions related to the merger between Williams and Energy Transfer. The focus of our call today is our fourth quarter results and business outlook. So we're not going to take questions on the pending merger or other related matters. However, before we discuss our fourth quarter and year-end 2015 results, I can provide a brief update on the transaction.","Williams' Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer Equity per the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015, as expeditiously as possible and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams' stockholders. Completion of the pending transaction remains subject to the approval of Williams' stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Integration planning is underway.","As previously discussed in Energy Transfer Corp. registration statement on S-4 filed November 24, 2015 with the SEC, ETE and Williams received a request for additional information and material from the FTC pursuant to the HSR Act review.","On February 1, 2016, Energy Transfer Corporation received additional comments from the SEC related to the first amendment of the S-4. Certain requests made by the SEC relate to information that will be included in ETE and Williams' 10-Ks, which the companies expect to file the final week of February 2016, so next week. Therefore, the companies now expect to file a second amendment of the S-4 shortly after filing those 10-Ks.","With that update, I want to reiterate that we won't be taking questions regarding the pending merger or other related matters. As always, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations teams for questions you may have. Thank you all in advance for your cooperation.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This is going to be a fairly brief presentation, we do want to \u2013 we will take a look at the fourth quarter results and also drivers for the full year. We'll offer our perspective this morning on one of our very important customers, Chesapeake, and a lot of concerns have been raised there. And we'll look at upcoming drivers that'll drive 2016 along with our 2016 capital plan.","And then, finally some thoughts on the strength of our strategy in this difficult commodity price environment. We're very pleased with the way our business is holding up and as well, the kind of opportunities that continue to come at us in our effort to continue to connect these low price natural gas supplies into growing demand markets.","So with that, let's look on slide two here. We recorded another strong quarter demonstrating our continued project execution, reliable operating performance and the resilience of our business to grow despite sharply lower commodity prices and what turned out to be a very mild start to the winter here in the fourth quarter.","Even with the reduced producer activities in the supply areas, we enjoyed continued growth in fee-based revenues, primarily from demand-driven projects and expansions that were brought into service during the year. Our continued focused on a clear strategy, project execution and cost management are evident in our results.","And very importantly, despite the pressures impacting the industry, we once again saw the dramatic growth in our fee-based revenues offset the impact of continued lower commodity prices. In fact, our adjusted EBITDA was up 25% over 4Q 2014, and our full year adjusted EBITDA was up a total of 26% despite very low NGL and olefins margins. In fact, I think impressive status across all of our system. Just on our gas gathered volumes, we were up off a very big number in terms of our total gathered volumes. We were up 6% on total gathered volumes for the year despite a lower producers activities and a lot of very significant curtailments that continue to exist.","Looking directly at the fourth quarter, the WPZ DCF of $718 million produced a coverage ratio of 0.99x and, of course, this is before we would \u2013 if you were to include the substantial impact of the $209 million IDR waiver. This would lift our coverage up to 1.39x. And of course, this is not insignificant and certainly provides support for funding our 2016 growth capital program.","Highlights for the fourth quarter of 2015 to the fourth quarter of 2014 comparison, I'll just give you the highlights here. First of all, fee-based revenues were up $139 million or 12% and that was driven primarily by Atlantic-Gulf and with a lot of fee-based assets that came online during the year and as well as growth at Access.","Our olefins margins were up $43 million to $71 million, and this was strong operating performance at our Geismar plant with low per-unit margins due to low olefins prices. So, great results on the operating side at Geismar and actually across all of our NGL & Petchem Services during the quarter, but relatively low olefins margins there in the fourth quarter.","The proportional EBITDA of equity method investments were up $37 million or 22% and most of that was coming off of our Discovery asset where the Keathley Canyon Connector continues to perform very well. There was a little bit of maintenance during the period, but those volumes remain very strong out there on that system.","NGL margins were down $45 million or 52% and NGL prices now in the fourth quarter were 13-year low. And the full year 2015 NGL margin was only $160 million, which represents less than 4% of our consolidated EBITDA during 2015.","And I did want to make a note have here on the impairment. We took some very large impairments in the fourth quarter, and these were largely a result of dramatic decline in the market value of WPZ and some tests required there up against the full market value and in the fourth quarter. So that was the value of WPZ in the fourth quarter and then the implied market values of the investments and associated goodwill. So looking at the total market value of WPZ up against the implied market values of our investments and associated goodwill.","Of course, as you'll recall, the impaired equity method investments and certain of the impaired goodwill relate primarily to the acquisition of Access Midstream Partners, which we were required to book a significant $2.5 billion gain in 2014 and this reflected our purchase price allocation to these assets in 2014. So, as you'll recall, we had a big gain in 2014 associated with that acquisition and a lot of that goodwill then was taken out with this new test against the market value.","And so, now, just a few thoughts on the result by segment. Atlantic-Gulf had another great quarter, up $122 million all on fee-based revenues and so very impressive growth continued there in the Atlantic-Gulf. And for the full year, Atlantic-Gulf was actually up $453 million and a lot of this is coming off of projects like Gulfstar One as well as the Transco expansion projects, and again the Keathley Canyon Connector on our Discovery system, so tremendous growth there in our fee-based revenues. This was offset a little bit by lower NGL margins, of course, but overall really very impressive performance.","You might have noticed as well that Atlantic-Gulf had a little bit of higher cost in the fourth quarter and most of this was just related to \u2013 we had some repairs on the Leidy Line, as well as some additional testing required by the regulators there. And so, we continue to work on the Leidy Line there where we had a rupture on that line earlier in the year. And so a lot of continued work there that shows up in our O&M expense.","On the Access or what will now be the Central OA, we reported fourth quarter of 2015 adjusted EBITDA of $351 million and that was compared to $325 million, and a lot of this was just driven by a continued growth in the business. But we did as well have an increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream joint venture that helps drive some of that as well.","On the Northeast G&P, flat fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter of 2014, but a 30% growth year-over-year. So, we were at in 2014 full year was $276 million and we were up $80 million to $356 million here in 2015 and for the full year. So, really driven by continued increased service fees at Ohio Valley Midstream, higher overall volumes and those were offset by some higher operating expenses, including some line repairs that were required earlier in the year as well there.","Really important note here, we did sign a new gathering agreement with an existing customer during \u2013 here very recently and we were really excited about this that it's going \u2013 we do \u2013 it does produce a lower rate for the customer, but we've got some incremental volumes that are coming on associated with that agreement as well as some much larger acreage dedications that came with that. So, really excited about this new agreement.","And we're not counting on any new drilling anticipated here for 2016 on that. And even without that new drilling, we expect our revenues to be held flat for 2016 despite the lower rate just because there are some new volumes that come to us as a result of transaction and some new wells \u2013 or some new production that's being tied in. So a lot of similar story in the Northeast where we continue to tie in production that's already been drilled.","We're really not relying in the Northeast. We're really not relying on new drilling rigs out there. We're really just relying on tying in, continued tie in of production. But the real key force there will be when we start to see some of the takeaway projects take hold because that clearly is the constraint out here. It's not a matter of rigs running in the area; it's simply a matter of seeing some these big bottlenecks open up and then us tying in a lot of this already completed production and seeing that flow for us.","In the fourth quarter \u2013 sorry, on the NGL & Petchem side, really great operating results for NGL & Petchem from an operating standpoint, but we did have lower unit margins during the period. So really pretty good operating stint, both in Canada and Geismar in terms of volumes, but again very low unit margins. Just to remind you there, for the year, we were $216 million lower, but this was due to the lack of the insurance proceeds and about $89 million lower commodity margins. So a big step down, but again most of that was just due to the loss of some assumed business interruption proceeds that we booked in 2014.","In the West, great continued focus on cost management in the area. We were off about $15 million versus fourth quarter of 2014, and that was really driven by $27 million lower NGL margins as compared to the fourth quarter of 2014. And again, I'll remind you, NGL margins are now at a 13-year low. But really proud of the team out there and their continued focus on cost management and able to continue to generate very significant EBITDA despite low prices.","Moving on to slide three, this is a really important slide here we wanted to show you. We certainly had a lot of questions about Chesapeake and our relationship and a lot of focus by investors on the credit risk related to Chesapeake. And so we really wanted to just take this opportunity to walk everyone through some facts and some of our perspective as a midstream service provider that plays a critical role in getting the natural gas production from a wellhead to marketable condition and location.","So, first, I note that we have a very strong relationship with Chesapeake. We appreciate them as a great operator in the nation's very best shale resources. They have some of the very best acreage in large contiguous blocks, and we are very pleased to have the opportunity to serve them as a key customer and one of the best large scale operators from our perspective. So, I tell you, we are constantly impressed with the way this team continued to be able to lower their cost and work out creative solutions with us and other parties, and really thankful for the relationship.","They are paying their bills in a timely manner as usual and including, we just recently got paid for the minimum volume commitment related to the Haynesville, and we fully expect them to pay the MVC invoice on the Barnett when it's due. It's not due yet. But we're excited about continue to work with them on that and fully expect that to come through as well, just as they paid the Haynesville on time. So, from our view, they continue to reduce their costs and operate efficiently and effectively to maintain liquidity. And nevertheless, though, we are mindful of the credit risk that these continued low prices pose for many producers, including Chesapeake.","And so here's how we think about the risk. First of all, we have long-term dedications with strong contractual conveyances of interest in unproduced gas. We like our argument that we hold a current real estate interest in unproduced gas and that our covenant running with the land not subject to the rejection and bankruptcy. We certainly are following current bankruptcy cases like Sabine where the general question is at issue, but people should understand that the ultimate outcome in individual cases will turn on specific facts and circumstances.","Regardless, even if the court were to rule we don't have such legal rights, our gathering lines are physically connected to Chesapeake's wellheads and pads and we provide a very critical service, conditioning and connecting Chesapeake's production to points where they can then choose the best markets for the long-haul transportation alternatives.","In exchange for the dedication of production, we invested capital to build gathering lines that are uniquely positioned to serve Chesapeake's well. So all these systems were built out specifically for their needs and generally at their direction and to the size and scale that they needed to be able to produce volumes on a projected basis.","In most cases, there are not other gathering lines nearby because these are big contiguous areas and these systems were built specifically for their production. And in many cases, our pipelines have been built on populated places such as beneath the city of Fort Worth and it would be very costly for others to replicate our gathering lines. And the rates of return that we generate from these investments and assets are very typical for a midstream provider.","Likewise, our gathering lines have been in place for some time and thus the reserves behind them are now partially produced. To continue to produce such gas, Chesapeake and its creditors, if it ever came to that, would want and need to utilize our gathering lines to deliver gas to the markets. So, such gathering lines are very distinguishable from long-haul transportation service because the intra- and interstate pipeline initiate service after the gas has already pooled at marketable points. Producers then have many options to receive cash for their products other than transportation on any one particular interstate pipeline.","If it did come to a bankruptcy, a producer can argue that it can reject certain types of contracts and we believe gathering contracts such as ours are not the type of contracts that would be rejected. But even if a gathering contract were allowed to be rejected, a producer and its creditors would continue to need the gathering service to be able to produce gas and create revenue. If a producer rejects the gathering contract in a bankruptcy, the gatherer will no longer be obligated to provide the gathering service.","Furthermore, rejection of a contract is all or nothing. Therefore, the analysis of the risk of any producer's bankruptcy is best analyzed contract by contract and really understanding that the particulars of the services being provided and how unique those services are that are being provided.","As any prudent midstream service provider would do, we have studied each of our Chesapeake contracts and considered the value of Chesapeake's reserves, our physical connection to their wells and their alternative options for delivering gas to market, and we believe that we understand much better than anyone the real value of our assets if it ever came to a bankruptcy process.","But let me be very clear on this matter, we have great confidence in Chesapeake in their assets and more importantly, in their tremendous operating capabilities and management team. Thus far, they have continued to do all the right things in very difficult circumstances and we look forward to helping them be very successful for years and years to come and we have great confidence in their ability to do that. We will continue to find win-win solutions that align our interest and to support them where we can in their asset sales.","And as you can see in the table on this slide, Williams' scope and scale of gathering in all of the key natural gas basins is significant. And there are significant non-Chesapeake working interests in basins as well that also give us confidence and the continued cash flows from these assets.","So, overall, we'd just tell you we are very proud of our relationship with Chesapeake. We're very impressed with them and \u2013 but we also don't have our head in the sand and we are looking very closely to these alternatives. And we feel very strong about our position if it ever were to come to a bankruptcy.","Moving on to slide four, this is just an overview here of some of the recent developments and what we see coming soon. First of all, I want to reiterate that the demand side of the natural gas market is really driving our capital investments and you can just see that as you look at some of these projects, the Transco Leidy expansion just came in and that \u2013 first part of that started up on December 8. And then we continue to bring segments on in-service through the month of December and now here in January, we are fully completed with all segments in service now for the Leidy Southeast expansion. Great work by the team under some difficult circumstances, but really great performance by the team that manage that project.","The Transco Gulf Trace project, this is a project to serve the Cheniere's Sabine Pass LNG facility. Construction is underway with a target in-service of first quarter. 2017. We'd just tell you it's nice to be able to be doing construction in more friendly environments like Louisiana and the teams did a great job of bringing that project board as well.","The Transco Gulf Connector project, which is the new long-term contract we just announced for 475 million a day of new expansion service that will also serve Cheniere's Corpus Christi and Freeport LNG facilities, that would be in 2019.","And then just a note here quickly on the Marcellus and Utica volumes. The real story going on in the Marcellus and Utica is that we are seeing both growth in available production. So, what do we mean by available production? We mean the production if there were markets available that could actually be flowing. We continue to see that grow behind our systems and we also saw significant price-related shut-ins in the quarter. So this bottleneck, if you will, continues to grow in size with available production growing up behind a very constrained outlet and lower-than-usual regional demand in the areas.","But I think it's important to know that we now have over 33% of the gathered volumes in the area and this really leaves us with great exposure once the bottlenecks are cleared. And I think what's really important to note there is that we're not relying on drilling capital for those volumes. All we need is some of those bottlenecks to open up and we'll have volumes flowing without the need for a lot of additional drilling capital. And so, this is very different in most areas of the country where there's a lot of concerns about producers not having the capital to drill. In this area, it's just a matter of the infrastructure being built out in front of it.","And then, finally, our Geismar plant. Really proud of the way the team operated the plant and we exceeded our production expectations for the quarter there and are off to a good start here in 1Q of 2015 as well there \u2013 or, sorry, 1Q of 2016 as well.","Just looking forward some things that are going to drive us looking forward. The Canadian Offgas Processing business, the Horizon project that you've heard us talk about quite a bit. That plant is now the Fort McMurray plant, so that's the plant that actually extracts the liquids out of the offgas is now rolling and it has began extracting liquids, but that will be a process here over the next three weeks or so to get that up to full production.","And then, finally, we've got to some remaining work at Redwater to be able to fractionate all those liquids and we expect that to be coming on in March. So a lot of new revenues that will show up there on WPZ as those volumes hit both the pipeline and the Redwater fractionators. And then I'll remind you that the margin side of that business is left at WMB at the Horizon facility upstream.","As well our Kodiak tieback, this is a tieback for Devil's Tower platform, and that project is being brought online and has been in the testing phase here for the last couple of weeks and is just about to begin to really add some very significant cash flow here in the first quarter.","And then, the Gunflint tieback, which we expect to come on now in the second quarter, which will be our first big tieback to the Gulfstar One project and this is \u2013 will also be contributing very substantial cash flow growth with very minimal additional capital investment on our part. We do expect the Gulfstar production to be a little bit higher in the first quarter than we saw in the fourth quarter due to some well workover work that was going on out there, and so we're excited to see some of the benefits of that work that will start to improve things here into the first quarter and beyond.","Last year, we announced plans to increase the capacity on our Eastern interstate pipeline from 10.8 Bcf to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of 2017. And in fact, by 2017, we expect to double the capacity of the Transco system from its 2010 level. So once again, these projects just keep coming and we've got great transparency into our predictable growth and it provides clear evidence that Williams has a truly unique position in terms of our asset footprint, especially in challenging market times.","Our backlog of project remains robust and the demand side project just keeps coming at us with amazing pace and consistency and, in particular, along the Transco system. These are fully contracted demand pull projects and we will continue to high-grade these opportunities as we balance constrained funding sources up against continued robust backlog. So, our issue is not a matter of backlog, we have plenty of great investment opportunity; it's really a matter of getting lower \u2013 better funding sources and low cost funding sources to supply all these opportunities. So, we're in a envious position of having plenty of opportunity and again just a matter of getting those funded appropriately.","Moving on to slide five. So as we said before, much of the attention in the industry is focused on producer shut-ins and commodity prices. We remain focused on serving and capturing the growing demand for natural gas. This focus is especially important in the Northeast where we're working to unlock the tremendous value of the Marcellus and Utica areas by providing market access via the Constitution and Atlantic-Gulf projects. Our strategic remains intact and the underlying fundamentals of our business are strong despite reduced producer activities in the supply areas.","And just a few weeks ago, we announced our revised business plan to address the realities of our current market environment while continuing to invest in our business. In addition to significantly lower operating expenses in 2016, the revised 2016 plan includes growth capital funding needs of around $2.1 billion, which is about $1 billion or 32% less than our previous plans.","The plan includes $1.3 billion for Transco expansions and other interstate pipeline projects. And the non-interstate pipeline growth that's embedded here totals about $700 million, and this is primarily reflecting additional investments across our gathering and processing systems where capital spending for gathering and processing in 2016 will be limited to really new producer volumes, including mostly wells that are already drilled and completed, but that are waiting connecting infrastructure. So, as I said earlier, we're really not depending on a whole lot of drilling here in 2016; we're really just focused on connecting and getting volumes that are already connected flowing.","Moving on to slide six here just to close out. First of all, the fourth quarter results certainly demonstrate the resilience of our fee-based assets. Approximately 93% of PZ's gross margin were from fee-based revenues. The continued growth in Atlantic-Gulf segment continue to be driven by great expansions on our Transco system, as well as our deepwater volumes.","And sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes really was impressive; in fact, total operated volumes in this key region were up 8% as you compare the fourth quarter to the third quarter. While the total volumes in the regions, so not just ours, but looking at the total industry production, actually declined a little less than 1%. So again, total region declined a little less than 1%, but our volumes were actually up by 8%. So really continue to grow our market share in this very important region.","Our 2016, WPZ business plan really did address the realities of our current market environment and continues our investments in growing the demand side of our business. Certainly, we continue to high-grade our opportunities and a lot of that capital is going towards really important demand-driven infrastructure projects that serve long-term natural gas needs of local distribution companies, electric power generation, LNG and industrial sources.","And so, just to reiterate, this quarter's results and our continued strong backlog of projects are a direct reflection of our strategy to uniquely position Williams to connect the best natural gas supplies to the best markets regardless of significant market swings and cycles.","And so, as we move to questions, I'd like to highlight what John mentioned in the opening. The Williams' Board of Directors is unanimously committed to completing the transaction with Energy Transfer for the merger agreement executed on September 28, 2015 and delivering the benefits of the transaction to Williams' stockholders.","Beyond that, though, we're only discussing our fourth quarter and year-end results and we ask that you keep your questions focused on our results. We will not take questions related to the pending transaction between Williams and ETE or related matters, and we thank you in advance for your cooperation for that request.","And so now, operator, let's please move on to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question will come from the line of Christine Cho of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if we could start with any insights that you guys have from your talks with the rating agencies and your commitment to the investment grades rating at WPZ, given all the agencies had taken action before your press release detailing reduced CapEx. Any color on how they feel about your CapEx cut, deferrals, your Chesapeake exposure, your asset sales, et cetera? Also, if you could talk about where they would like to see your debt\/EBITDA ratio to get to? I mean, are they still okay with that 5 times?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Christine, this is Don. Good morning. Great question. We've been in regular dialogue with S&P and the other agencies. And I really can't speak for the agencies, but I think we've had a very constructive conversation and I think they appreciate the strength of our business, as well as some of the challenges ahead, and we're continuing to work with them and look forward to their decision. And again, we're very much focused on maintaining that investment grade rating, but obviously it's their call.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. I guess in that context, you stated at least $1 billion of asset sales in the first half of 2016 in the original press release. What kind of asset sales are you assuming? And I'm curious to know if you started the process for this and what type of parties you're talking to. Is it utility, midstream guys, financial guys? And should we expect to see any announcements before the deal closes or do we need to see the deal closed first?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I would say that we're preparing for the asset sales. We've not launched anything as of this date, yet we're confident that we can sell the assets and generate the liquidity that we previously outlined kind of in the second quarter. But at the same time, we're not identifying the assets at this point. We don't think it's in our interest to do so. We have quite a few assets that we could in fact monetize, so we're going to keep our options open, but we remain confident in our ability to do so.","The merger does not need to close. So we'll execute on that either before or after the merger, depending on the exact merger timing.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, I just wanted to touch upon the bankruptcy comments that you guys had. Alan, you talked about with respect to a rejection, it's all or nothing. And so, I'm curious to know, let's say, the bankruptcy court says that these contracts cannot be rejected, does that mean legally, you guys aren't required to mark to market the rate at all or let go of the MVCs or is that debatable?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No, that is right. It is everything. Those contracts are all-in-one and it's all the terms of the contract, so there isn't ability to cherry pick the terms the contract.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you so much.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please go ahead.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Good morning.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Alan, I'll start off on a bright note. Transco expansion projects, some puts and takes in the backlog, but it looks like, by and large, that looks like on track for a multi-year period. Would you care to contrast Transco's projects with others that are on the project list across the board and the peers in terms of likelihood of going ahead and maybe benefit on an incremental basis to Transco as some of those more heavily producer-backed projects that don't show up in 2016 and 2017?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I think we really don't have those risks in our projects right now. They're fully contracted and they're very secured credit standing behind those contracts. So we really don't have that kind of risk in the projects that we are utilizing with Transco. And so there are a lot of producer-pushed projects out there with very different kind of credit rating standing behind them, but in our case, we feel very strong about the credit and the term standing behind our projects. And there's certainly great push to move ahead with those and a lot of volumes packed up behind those systems ready to flow if and when we get those projects completed.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And this is looking into a crystal ball, but do you think there's any possibility of some incremental counterparties that are on projects that may not go forward that would eventually accrue to the Transco system?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, perhaps. The only thing I would say to that is there would have to be expansions likely because we have a really clear idea where all those volumes are going to come from that are supporting those projects that we have and they're completely sold out. So it would have to be in the form of expansions beyond what we have today.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. On the gathering and processing CapEx more than cut in half, is there any incremental risk to or possibility to that $700 million getting cut further for 2016?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, to a certain degree. For instance, some of that capital is out in the Permian, and in that case, we're going off of the operators' indication on how much capital will be spent out there; operator being the operator of the midstream assets. Most of that's non-operator investment for us and so we're depending on both the producers and the midstream operator forecast of that and that continues to be a moving target in many basins.","So I would say in those areas, those more oil-driven basins could be some movement down. I would say in the areas like in the Marcellus or the Utica, we're managing that very closely and trying to optimize the timing of the capital right in line with the opening of new projects coming out of the area. And so there's probably some room to optimize, if you will, and the way some of that capital until the projects are specifically coming on time. So, we could see a little bit of that slip, but a lot of that is already underway and the work is ongoing.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. Actually, that's helpful color. And then just finally from me on that last point, Marcellus and Utica volumes. You said you saw some shut-ins fourth quarter. Any indication that those are coming back online with winter demand in the first quarter?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. We saw a little bit pickup and we certainly saw interest from producers who shut in and were bringing back online. So we actually have seen some people taking advantage. We've seen some these cold weather surges.","What you have to really remember about the demand in the Northeast there is it's driven by two things. First of all, its capacity to get out of the region and that's pretty fixed. In other words, those pipelines are completely full getting out of the region and so that doesn't move a whole lot. But what does move in a regional demand based on weather loads in the area where gas is consumed in the region. And so that'll be either driven by cold weather, which we've seen a little bit here in the first quarter, or it'll be driven by very hot weather in the summertime and those are the two things that will drive the variable. Until some of these projects \u2013 new projects come online, that will be what drives the volumes in the Northeast. There's plenty of gas ready to meet that demand as it opens up.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","All right. Thank you, Alan. Appreciate it.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Appreciate all the color on the Chesapeake contract. I guess I'm just wondering about \u2013 it seems like I'm sensing a tone change from you around your willingness to renegotiate the contract. I think you'd already done the one in the Haynesville. Does that now change your view there? And there's an argument out there that such as commodity prices that's pressuring Chesapeake it's also the above-market gathering contracts. I just love your thoughts there.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No, our \u2013 I'm sorry if I gave you that impression. We continue to work with Chesapeake in areas to help in negotiating and I would say nothing has changed on that. Our relationship with them is very strong.","And the concept of the rate \u2013 we keep hearing this above-market rate and I think what people need to remember there is that the rates get set based on the capital that we spent and the returns that are very normal returns in the market. And so, we hear this term above-market rates a lot of the time, but in fact, really the returns that we're generating are very normal. What's occurred that caused the rates to go higher in some areas is where the volumes haven't shown up, but we're still the asked return on our invested capital is very normal for the space.","But certainly no indication \u2013 or no, I didn't mean to indicate that our tone with Chesapeake has changed. We're simply \u2013 and I want to make really clear on this, all we're trying to address is all the concerns that have been expressed by the investors and media, not necessarily our own. We've always kept an eye on the issue as we do with any big customer, but our relationship with Chesapeake and our confidence in them remains very high.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Appreciate that. Maybe just a couple of other ones from me on Chesapeake issue. What is the returns revenue or EBITDA you're earning right now in the Barnett, in the Haynesville and then can you give us a sense of the overall contribution from Chesapeake to your EBITDA?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'd take on that first part in terms of our return. Yeah, those returns were set kind of in the mid-teen range on all of those assets and that's what we continue to try to seek out like in our renegotiations in the Haynesville and so forth. We continue to seek out that type of return there. So, that really hasn't changed.","The overall contribution of Chesapeake to our EBITDA, I'll have Don maybe take that one.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I think it's around 20% plus or minus. It depends on the period, but somewhere in that zipcode. I think 18% was the most recent.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. And then lastly from me on the financing side, you did the Transco bond recently. Is that another tool that you think like you can use more, I hate to call it a stand-alone leverage at Transco, relative to other financing sources that are out there?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. I think our plan is to keep Transco in the sweet spot for its rate-making purpose. So we are not inclined to put more leverage on Transco.","Now, Transco has a lot of growth so, certainly, it'll naturally absorb some additional debt as it continues to build out its projects. But in terms of just adding leverage to Transco, that's not our plan.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. That's it from me. Thank you.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Becca Followill of the U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Good morning. Few questions for you. One, can you quantify the lower OpEx that you're looking for the reduction in terms of dollars for 2016? And then the second one is on the contract that you recently renegotiated with a customer for lower rates in exchange for higher volumes. Are you looking at doing other of the \u2013 more of those with customers that are not Chesapeake?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Becca, I will take the second half of that and I'll let John take the first part of that. As to the contracts in any negotiation, that was a situation where the rate from a legacy cost of service contract was so high that there was no way the reserves in the area would ever be produced and so it was a matter of rate being even in excess of the price of gas. And so, this was a matter of actually getting the gas flowing and assuring ourselves that the gas would continue to flow in exchange for some additional volumes and additional dedication in the area.","So, whenever we have opportunities like that that we can bring increment to our gas \u2013 or, sorry, our cash flows as we look on a long-term basis, we certainly will try to take advantage. And there are plenty of win-win opportunities out there to increase our cash flows to get gas flowing that's not flowing today. Obviously, we have to be cognizant of the fact because I mentioned earlier that there is only so much gas that's going to get out of the region. And so we want to maximize those revenues on our system because we realized that when Mcf starts flowing in one place, it likely means that it didn't come off a competitor system; it would come off of our own system. So we certainly are cognizant of that issue and the strength getting out of the basin.","John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC","On the cost question, Becca, we've not put an exact number out there, I guess, for significant cost production that we're committed to. We're already implementing some of those cost reductions. We'll continue to implement additional cost reductions prior to the merger date. And then, we would expect even more significant cost reductions to follow the merger.","So the merger date is a variable in that, as well as our joint planning with the ETE team in terms of such cost reduction. So we're not prepared to put a number out there at this point, but we will as we get further along in the year.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Understand. Thank you. And then just to go back to the question on the rate reduction, are there producers \u2013 because we get these questions constantly, are the producers actively requesting rate reductions from you guys in order to help them out through this period?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Certainly that's the case, Becca, and I think what our decision is, is what benefit do we get out of that. Again, we have to look at it knowing that there's only a certain amount of gas that's going to get out of the region. And so, we have to determine what the benefit that they're willing to offer in exchange for us lowering the rate up against current prices in a way that provides the cash margin.","So, we understand people's cash margins very well. Truly no secret in terms of what that looks like to producers because we get it from so many different people. And it really just boils down to who's got the best offer in terms of exchange for us in terms of us being incented to see their gas flows over somebody else's.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Got you. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of Selman Akyol of Stifel. Please go ahead.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Thank you. Good morning.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Good morning.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","First question I guess for Don. Going back to sort of the credit rating agencies discussion, you said you look forward to a decision. Can you say when you expect to get a decision from them?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I can't give you their timing. I think, again, you'll have to speak to the agencies on that. But again, we've been working collaboratively with them to provide the information that they need to make their rating decisions.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. And then just in terms of the related shut-ins, just wondering if you could just put a quantity to that in terms of how much has been shut in on your system?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. I'm going to ask Jim Scheel to chime in and give some specifics on that if he could, please.","James E. Scheel - Senior VP-Northeast Gathering & Processing","Sure, Selman. As we began the fourth quarter, we had just under 1 Bcf a day shut-in primarily, as we've already talked about, due to lower pricing coming out of the summer and some lack of takeaway capacity. As we begin the year, we probably have right at about 1.1 Bcf a day or perhaps a little bit more shut-in behind the system as we've seen producers continue to complete wells but throttle the production due to price. So it's kind of hard to know until we see a full flow, but we're estimating right at the 1.1 Bcf.","And really just to put that in perspective, if that was all flowing, the Northeast would go from about 6 Bcf a day to 7 Bcf a day and our incremental EBITDA would probably increase by about $180 million to $900 million, overall.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","All right. Thank you. That does it for me.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question will come from the line of Sharon Lui of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. You indicated, I guess, there are several projects slated for in-service during the first half of 2016. Can you just remind us what's the potential cash program for projects like the tie-ins?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I don't think we've provided \u2013 I'm looking at John here.","John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC","Yeah.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I think, Sharon, we provided specifics on those, but I do think we've said that those are significant. And so you can look to the kind of revenues that we get off of facilities like Devil's Tower and Gulfstar One. And you can think about that from a volumetric standpoint as both the Kodiak tie-in that comes into Devil's Tower and the Gunflint tieback comes on to Gulfstar, but they're certainly very significant. Of course, just like any deepwater wells, they come on gangbusters and decline over time, but they will be fairly significant in terms of cash flow additions when they start up.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, I guess just following up on Christine's question about discussions with the rating agencies and the distribution policy, just your latest thoughts on whether a distribution reduction would be an option you would take to defend the investment grade rating?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sharon, this is Don. We have a number of options. Obviously, we pointed at cost reductions, asset sales, potential partners on some of our projects to reduce capital needs and a variety of other tools. We certainly are mindful of the fact we've got significant cash flow that goes out in the form of distributions, but again we don't have any further guidance on that but that's always an option.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And maybe this question is for John. In terms of looking at Geismar, I mean ethylene prices still remain pretty depressed. Just wondering what's your outlook for the balance of the year in terms of ethylene and propylene prices.","John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC","Yeah. Thanks, Sharon, for the question. As we take a look forward, I think it's rather well-known in the industry that there's a rather large turnaround season ahead of us here in the second quarter. And so, on the ethylene side, we think that's going to be up favorable to margins during the second quarter.","But then as we look at the ethylene industry overall, in North America this past year, we set an all-time new record for ethylene production. And of course, our ability to export ethylene and ethylene derivatives is somewhat yet limited by bagging and terminalling particularly in the polyethylene case. And so we would expect that the second half of the year on ethylene reverts back to margins more akin to what we're experiencing today.","On the propylene side, likewise propylene refinery turnarounds are happening right around now. They get those done in expectation of gasoline production for the summer season basically. And so, we have a rather stable outlook on propylene at the moment through the rest of the year.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question will come from the line of John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Yeah. Hi. Just wanted to clarify \u2013 going back to Chesapeake and how things work in a bankruptcy scenario. We're just curious with the MVCs then, would those stay or would those go? Or are they separate from some of the contracts? I mean, any color you can provide on that would be helpful.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. Just to be clear, those MVCs are part and parcel to the agreement. There's no separate agreement; it's all one agreement. And in a proceeding \u2013 any proceeding, the final decision there would be for the creditors to decide if they wanted to accept or reject the contract. And so that's how that would go. And it's all or none in terms of they don't get to again decide anything.","So I know there's been a lot of talk about the MVCs being at risk, but that's somewhat \u2013 I'm not sure what's driven that assumption by the investor base, but that's not the way it works. And as well, the market-based rate issue, while that might occur during a short-term period, during the proceedings, there might be an ability to take something to market rates if all the other protections that we talked about were to fail. Then it would just be during the interim period prior to the settlement of the proceedings.","John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. So, I mean as a practical matter, would there be the possibility to renegotiate those and then submit it to the court for approval? Or is it just literally simply it's all or none, take it or leave it?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No, John. I think if there was a reason for us to negotiate, then, yes, that could be part of a settlement. But the decision really is to accept or reject. And really, our point is if the contract is rejected, then we no longer have an obligation to provide service. And because these assets are built uniquely for these reserves, the ability to duplicate these assets would be, from our vantage point anyway, in most of these cases just would not be feasible to build or duplicate all these facilities in these very heavily \u2013 particularly places like the Barnett where it's very heavily populated and very expensive to build in, especially when you've got less reserves than you started with to build the assets in the first place.","So, anyway, it could come down to a negotiation if there was value to be shared between the parties in a better contract, but our point is just that there isn't any ability to just separate. If somebody accepts the contract, they accept the contract in its whole. And if they reject it, then they take the risk of not being able to get their product moved out of the basin.","John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's helpful. And then just following on the contracts that are up for renewal or renegotiation. So following an earlier question, I think it was Selman that was asking it and the answer was \u2013 $180 million to $900 million is the amount that I guess would be \u2013 I mean, is that a renegotiation or was that just the amount that's due to shut-in? So just for you to clarify on that.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Oh, sorry, this is on Jim Scheel's. No, I think I can clean that up. All that is \u2013 Jim was saying, if the existing shut-in gas that's already contracted that's sitting behind our systems today, because it doesn't have anywhere to go, it's constrained in terms of bottleneck. It's already connected to our systems and ready to flow, so there's no additional capital required by anybody, but what has to happen is the markets in the downstream long-haul have to open up. And if that were to open up, that's the amount of \u2013 that $180 million is the amount of incremental income that we would see, or EBITDA.","John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. That's helpful. And then just last question along those lines. In terms of contracts that are in current discussion or renegotiation, is there any kind of EBITDA-at-risk figure you can provide to us or how should we be thinking about that?","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. No, we really \u2013 so far in our negotiations, we've been able to hold our EBITDA steady under these contracts. And, of course, that's extremely important to us so we haven't backed up in these negotiations. We haven't backed up our EBITDA that we're getting in the current environment. So that hasn't occurred and we wouldn't expect it to.","John Edwards - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. That's super helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And gentlemen, there are no further questions. At this time, I'd like to hand it back over to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Very good. Again, thank you all very much for joining us. Really pleased with the way the business continues to operate in this difficult commodity environment, and very excited about the amount of growth projects that are out in front of us that are consistent with our strategy of taking advantage of seeing these low price natural gas really develop a lot demand.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Porter","Thanks, Patrick. Good morning, and thank you for your interest in The Williams Company. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin.","In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today\u2019s presentation materials.","And so with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan Armstrong","Great. Well, good morning, everyone. Thanks, John and thanks for everybody joining us. I know it\u2019s a busy time right now. As we discussed the second quarter financial performance and the key investor focus areas we\u2019re going to hit, as we have in the past, some of the areas that we\u2019ve questioned, we\u2019ve been hearing from our investor base. So let\u2019s move right into the presentation and take a look at our second quarter of 2019 results.","Here on Slide 2, we provided a clear view of our year-over-year financial performance. As you can see, we continue to enjoy very healthy growth in all of our key measures. In general, all the metrics we want to go up, we went up by double digits and those we\u2019ve been working to reduce, it went down. So this growth continues to reflect very little direct commodity exposure, so we remind you. And in fact, year to date our 2019 gross margin is 98% fee-based versus only 2% coming from direct commodity margin. And I\u2019ll remind you with that is a very predictable set of cash flows making this be 14th quarter in a row that we have been in line or been at least in line with Street consensus and our own guidance.","So let\u2019s take it from the top with our GAAP cash flow from operations, which increased 20% for the quarter and 16% year to date. Our business continues to demonstrate significant free cash flow and as you can see our CFFO exceeded CapEx by over $360 million and $625 million for the quarter and year to date periods. On the next line we show 12% and 9% growth for adjusted EBITDA, which is impressive in the face of significant asset sales affecting the period. And I\u2019ll have more to say about what drove the adjusted EBITDA performance here in the next couple of slides.","And you can see our continued strong growth and adjusted EPS metrics posting excellent 53% and 33% increases. Our EPS continues to be burdened with substantial non-cash charges. And I encourage you to take a look at Slide 12 and the appendix to appreciate the true power of our cash flows underlying these earnings.","Our DCF was up about 36% and 21% with strong growth in the per share calculation and the related dividend coverage ratio moving up above 1.8x with the second quarter being boosted by a cash tax item that we disclosed. We\u2019re making great progress on bringing leverage down. Our original guidance was to finish the year at less than 4.75x and we currently sit at 4.43x, and we\u2019ll discuss our revised leverage guidance in a moment. And finally, crisp execution on our projects continues keeping our capital spending in line with our expectations. So really nice improvement in our various earnings and cash flow metrics despite the impact of significant asset sales.","As we move on here to Slide 3, for the quarter adjusted EBITDA increased just over 12% or 14%, if you adjust for the bigger transactions that affect the year-over-year comparison. On the left side of the slide in gray, you can see an unfavorable $37 million comparability adjustment, which includes removing the adjusted EBITDA from the various asset sale transactions completed during the last 12 months and then taking out the $11 million favorable item reflecting the addition of the incremental 38% UEOM ownership interest. The normalizing for those items you see adjusted EBITDA growing about 14%.","Now moving over to look at the financial performance at the continuing business. Similar to the first quarter of this year, Atlantic-Gulf led the increase with a 23% increase in adjusted EBITDA driven by top line Transco revenue growth from new expansion projects, including Atlantic Sunrise and the Gulf Connector.","Next up, looking at the Northeast G&P area, we had a 20% increase in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA, driven by 17% higher gathering volumes and higher gathering fees associated with expansion projects. Volume increases were led by the Susquehanna Supply Hub area, which grew about 23%. But we also saw double digit growth rates in all of our other operated Northeast franchise except the smaller Laurel Mountain JV that we have with Chevron. Probably one of the more impactful changes that we had there was the Utica volumes up about 15%.","And so as we mentioned in the past, the Encino transaction out there has really been important to us, to see the volumes in the Utica really start to turn around from what previously had been declined to now a very healthy incline. So overall we continued a very nice start to the year in the Northeast. And finally, we have the West, which is pretty flat to the prior year where a sharp drop in NGL margins was offset by nice growth and fee-based service revenues.","And we\u2019re excited to see as well a new plant at Fort Lupton quickly fill up this quarter in the DJ Basin. As we \u2013 we\u2019ve now exceeded about 200 million a day of new inlet volumes coming into that plant. So as we told you, that just started up right around the end of the first quarter and into the second quarter and that new train there has already filled up. So great growth going on there in the DJ Basin.","Moving on to Slide 4 and looking at the year-over-year results. Pretty similar story year to date as you heard for the second quarter. Once again on the left side of the slide in grey, you can see the unfavorable of $78 million comparability adjustment from the various asset sell transactions and then a $13 million favorable item reflecting the pickup of an incremental 38% UEOM interest again. And so normalizing for those items you see adjusted EBITDA growing about 13% for the first six month comparison.","Year to date, we see Atlantic-Gulf up 21% and the Northeast up 20% driven by the same factors that we just discussed on the previous slide, namely Transco revenue growth and strong broad-based volume growth across Northeast. The West is down about 3% on this comparison, reflecting much lower NGL margins and the effect of severe winter weather this year on volumes in 1Q of 2019. All in all, very happy with our second quarter performance, which tracks well with our overall business plan from last fall despite the decline we\u2019ve seen in natural gas and NGL pricing. And we are very well positioned to continue this growth here in the last half of the year.","Next let\u2019s revisit a few of the key investor focus areas. And before I dig into the items on this slide, I just want to remind you a few things. First of all, we just recently announced the reorganization and some other cost reduction initiatives that we have going on at the company right now. As you may have noted from our recent 8-K after more than 30 years of service, Jim Scheel will be leaving the company in December of this year. And we\u2019re taking the opportunity to further reduce our operating areas to two, one focus primarily on our FERC regulated gas pipeline business led by Scott Hallam and the other focused on our non-regulated business being led by Walt Bennett, who leads our West Gathering business today.","I have more to say in recognition of the fine work Jim has done for Williams on the third quarter call. But for now, I\u2019ll just say the reorganization to two operating areas represents another step toward becoming further simplified and centralized as we seek to be the very best operator in the natural gas infrastructure business. So these moves are basically taking advantage of the scale that we have in these very similar businesses and continuing to drive common processes and common systems across our operations.","But we will continue to provide supplemental disclosures to assist in the modeling of our non-regulated business, but don\u2019t worry about losing any of the transparency that we provide today. Our supplemental disclosures will provide at least as much visibility as you have today and will continue to highlight the Northeast volume and EBITDA growth that continues to occur.","Beyond the consolidation, the operating areas we have also initiated a voluntary separation program and are looking at other cost reduction opportunities given the $5-plus billion of asset sales that we\u2019ve had over the last three years. And really narrowing our focus down to the natural gas infrastructure space is allowing us to take full advantage of the scale. And I can tell you the entire management team is very focused on us being \u2013 having the very best operating margin ratio in the business. And so we continue to push hard on that as a team and we really believe given the scale that we have \u2013 we ought to be the very best in the industry on this measure. And these efforts are taking us closer and closer to that point.","So let\u2019s look now at the first item we\u2019ll be discussing, which is our financial guidance and progress on deleveraging. First off, we are reaffirming our current financial guidance for 2019 and now guiding to a further improvement in our year end 2019 leverage target. You can find the various elements of our 2019 financial guidance in the appendix of this presentation. Additionally, we are also affirming our longer-term EBITDA growth rate of 5% to 7% per year.","Turning now to our leverage. We achieved the debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 4.43x at the end of the second quarter and we announced that our year end 2019 debt to adjusted EBITDA to be less than 4.5x, as you\u2019ll recall, our original guidance was to be less than 4.75x for the same period. The effects of our transactions along with our recently lower capital expenditure forecast has allowed us to significantly improve our 2019 debt to adjusted EBITDA expectations for 2019.","There is no change to our long-term target of 4.2x that we plan to hit by the end of 2021 and we continue to evaluate transactions that could potentially allow us to reach the 4.2x at a faster rate. As an affirmation that we are making the right moves on the leverage front, we recently saw some favorable rating agency actions, where S&P improved its outlook to a BBB flat stable rating and Fitch put us on Rating Watch Positive.","Shifting now to discuss the expected growth in our Northeast G&P business, we\u2019d like to first emphasize that we still believe in the strong natural gas demand growth fundamentals that underpin our strategy. We\u2019ve seen continued delays in the startup of nearly all of the LNG terminals that were planned to come online in the first half of 2019, but that just means we\u2019re going to see an even stronger pool on natural gas in the back half of this year.","It really is easy to see that the natural gas demand growth outlook remains very strong driven by LNG export growth, continued power generation and major industrial investments that continue to come online, trying to take advantage of low cost of U.S. natural gas and U.S. low cost NGL prices.","Components in low cost U.S. natural gas reserves will continue to drive strong natural gas demand growth over the long term. And as a result, we believe that there will have to be a call on natural gas focused supply areas given the continuous growth in natural gas demand and the stronger than ever capital discipline being demonstrated by the producer community.","Our near term, we continue to see commodity price headwinds for our producer customers in the area and we believe that producers are responding appropriately to the current market conditions, continuing to plan around or hope for higher prices would only exacerbate the length and supply. And we are also very focused on closely matching our capital programs with these latest forecasts.","Our Northeast growth capital for 2020 probably ends up being about half of what it was in 2019 due to this reduce to us going back capital as well as the synergies that we\u2019re realizing from the UEOM transaction, while also making significant near term reductions in 2019, as we continue to respond to the producers disciplined approach.","So with that being said, let\u2019s take a closer look at our current expectations for the Northeast G&P business through 2020, built on the backs of our most producer customer feedback. Starting with 2019, you can see that we are currently forecasting gathering volume growth of about 13%, which should result in adjusted EBITDA growth of 19% for a total of about $1.3 billion.","Year-to-date, we\u2019ve generated about 16% gathering volume growth, but we do expect that overall annual growth to moderate in the fourth quarter, mostly just since because our fourth quarter comparison will be up against volumes that grew rapidly after Atlantic Sunrise came on in the fourth quarter of 2018.","Looking forward our 2020, very latest forecast shows about 5.5% gathering volume growth over 2019, generating about 11% adjusted EBITDA growth to get to about $1.45 billion. I might just note that we had always expected a slowing in the growth rate for 2020 versus 2019 with respect to our prior 10% to 15% gathering volumes CAGR. It seems that folks maybe missed the frontend impact that was present in the CAGR and instead thought we were assuming more of an annual or equal annual growth rates.","That was never the case and the unequal growth rates across the 2018 to 2021 timeframe were indicated given the strong growth that we have been expecting and we are seeing in 2019. Beyond 2020, we do see an opportunity for stronger growth rates resume in 2021, but that of course, will be dependent on it better balance in the natural gas market.","I\u2019d also just mentioned that as we think about the Northeast pricing environment, it is important to remember that even if today\u2019s pricing environment reduce our net backs are still better than they were in the 2015 and 2016 timeframe, when production was constraining and commodity prices were more a function of the basis differential than the Henry Hub prices, since then incremental gas takeaway capacity has come online improving realized prices in the region and the producers have become significantly more efficient and disciplined with our capital during this timeframe.","So overall, we are encouraged to see the level of EBITDA growth. Our Northeast G&P business can continue to generate even in the weak natural gas price environment we\u2019re currently experiencing and we remain very focused on cost reduction and capital discipline as we await long term fundamentals to balance.","Now let\u2019s move onto our \u2013 discuss our Transco growth projects. First, let me give a quick update on the Transco rate case, although not a lot of new information to pass along here. As our competence will set them up and our process continues. We\u2019ve now had five conferences and we continue to work the issues like ROE with our customers. Last quarter, we stated that the settlement negotiations were likely to continue for many months, they have done that and resolution could extend in the next year.","We are cautiously optimistic that a settlement can ultimately be reached without the need for litigation and the settlement would include the $1.2 billion emissions reduction tracker that will allow Transco to significantly reduce emissions from our existing compression fleet along the Eastern Seaboard.","And as always, I\u2019ll remind you that we don\u2019t have any upside from the rate case reflected in our financial guidance. So let\u2019s touch on the status of Transco\u2019s major growth projects starting with the Northeast Supply Enhancement project. This quarter, we quickly reapplied for the 401 water quality certification in New York and New Jersey and promptly received notice of complete application from New York and New Jersey has indicated that our application is administratively complete. These are very important milestones in the re-filing of this and taking on some of the technical issues that were raised by both of those states.","Obtaining both of these 401 certifications is essential to begin construction this fall in order to meet the project and service date. The enhancement of the existing infrastructure is critical and connecting much needed natural gas supplies to folks in New York and while improving the Airshed and system reliability in New York and New Jersey.","In May, our customer National Grid had to announce that they will not be able to process new gas service requests and it\u2019s service carry in Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island. This means they will not provide any additional connections from service until there certainty that the NESE project can move ahead. Local, commercial, residential and political support for the project is strong as the need for gas on in both in economic and environmental improvement basis is clear and compelling. We fully expect a positive decision will come in time for us to maintain our end service date just ahead of the 2020\/2021 winter peaks.","Next, I want to touch on a couple of key milestones that were met recently for a couple of our Transco projects. We recently applied for a FERC certificate for our Leidy South project. As a reminder, Leidy South is a proposed 580 million cubic feet per day expansion of Williams existing Pennsylvania infrastructure that will further connect Appalachian gas with growing demand centers along the Atlantic Seaboard in time for the 2021\/2022 heating season.","Also our FERC certificate per Southeastern Trail project is pending approval and the Southeastern Trail project is a 295 million cubic feet day expansion of the Transco pipeline, system designed to provide additional pipeline capacity to serve growing markets in the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states by November of 2020.","And additionally, we received permission in June to place a portion of the Rivervale South to Market project into early service. This project is Transco expansion of 190 million cubic feet per day to service additional customers in New Jersey and New York City. The facility is required to provide 140 million cubic feet per day have already been completed and the remaining facilities are ahead of schedule targeting the September in-service date, two months ahead of schedule.","Also, our most recently announced Transco project Regional Energy Access concluded its open season and our team is finalizing negotiations with this customer base. So all-in-all, continued tremendous amount of activity on Transco, both in terms of completing existing projects that we\u2019ve got underway like Hillabee Phase 2, which is also ahead of schedule, and a long list of projects that we have in the permitting phase, so lots of great effort going on by our engineering and construction teams with both the permitting and the construction and continued great performance on the capital execution efforts here.","And lastly, let\u2019s move onto the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, where we\u2019re seeing a pickup in activity and significant new discoveries in and around our assets that has us position for significant free cash flow growth for years to come. Beginning in the third quarter of 2019, you\u2019ll start seeing contributions from our Norphlet deepwater gathering system investment.","Norphlet delivers gas into Williams Transco system located on one of our Gulf of Mexico platforms and from there the gas will be transported to our recently expanded Mobile Bay processing facility. First gas production on the system began in late June and we acquired the $200 million Norphlet pipeline in early July. The Norphlet deepwater gas gathering system is extremely well positioned for even more growth than the existing Appomattox system with approximately 50% of the pipeline contractual capacity remaining available for future produced times of existing discoveries in that area today.","So our discovery system is also seeing new volumes from the Hadrian North and Buckskin tiebacks, which achieved first productions on our systems in during the second quarter. The Hadrian North and Buckskin liquids rich production flows to our discovery system via the Keathley Canyon Connector and ultimately to our Larose processing plant in our Paradis fractionator. These tieback opportunities are high return projects and our example of many more to come in the deepwater.","Looking forward, we are very active right now discussing multiple tieback prospects around Devils Tower, our deepwater platform where production could begin as early as 2021 and on the near Blind Faith, we continue to be excited about Chevron and Total value more dedication to us where first production could be seen as early as 2023, and in the very active Western Golf facility planning for Shell\u2019s well prospect is on a fast track and we could see FID for our system expansion here in the fourth quarter of this year.","So we continue to see opportunities for significant incremental cash flow in the 2020 to 2023 timeframe from our deepwater operations. And we are really excited about the very substantial growth that we\u2019re seeing both on acreage that\u2019s already dedicated to it and as well new acres that we\u2019re very confident that we\u2019re going to be able to pick up given our expenses network.","So with that, we will transition to our Q&A session. Thank you, again for your time today. We\u2019re pleased to share with you our very strong second quarter performance and continued focus on deleveraging and the progress we\u2019ve made on our many growth opportunities. And so with that operator, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Perfect. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Spiro Dounis","Good morning, everyone. First question just around the financial guidance and being able to reiterate the 5% to 7% long term growth, I think, we were a little surprised there, just given the slight haircut on the Northeast volume outlook. And Alan, I totally understand your point on the expected slowdown and embedded in the 10% to 15% CAGR. But just still seems like something is in there, maybe offsetting some of that. So maybe just walk us through some of the drivers and how you\u2019re able to maintain the 5% to 7%, and if you\u2019re able to maybe even pull forward some demand driven projects as an offset.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Thanks, Spiro. Well, I would just say, obviously when we laid that out, we were that 5% to 7% \u2013 we were counting on a certain level of returns from our projects. And I would just say that some of those things have gone better than that. So in other words, we\u2019ve had quite a bit of improvement if you think about it, since we laid out that 5% to 7%. We\u2019ve had quite a bit of improvements in areas like the Utica within see now and the UEOM transaction. That gives us some synergies and ability to keep our costs even more under control there in the Northeast. So we\u2019ve actually, we said that 5% to 7% some time ago. And just like in any big company like Williams, there\u2019s been some things they go down a little bit, but there\u2019s also things that go up and of course, and we\u2019re continuing to put pressure on our costs as we talked about.","So I would say, we are being agile and responsive to those changes. And we\u2019re also picking up advantages like Bluestem, like \u2013 you might\u2019ve noticed our Conway NGL and frac business was up pretty significantly this quarter, which was on the backs of us building up for some of those Bluestem volumes. And so we\u2019re continuing to take advantage where the opportunities exist and those tend to offset things where things change a little bit to the negative, just the benefit of having a big portfolio.","Spiro Dounis","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on the faster than expected deleveraging, obviously the asset monetization played a big part in that. And it sounds like you expect that to continue. But I guess you\u2019d just look at somebody announcements made by some of your E&P customers in the Northeast recently. Just curious if you\u2019ve seen any shifts or reduction in appetite there from potential buyers and JV partners? Are they still looking like they want to invest more?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, I would just say, well, that has not slowed down a bit. I think that \u2013 the distinction out there, this becoming more clear to us is that, there the interest rates are so low out there and so much available to that money up against these very certain cash flows and very predictable cash flows that we have. And so as long as, you have that predictability of those cash flows, that kind of low cost money is going to be available. And we continue to be impressed by that in terms of various transactions that we\u2019re involved in. But it\u2019s clear to us that that\u2019s people just are being out these very low interest rates against these very predictable cash flows. And I think we\u2019re going to continue to see that with lower interest rates.","Spiro Dounis","Got it. That\u2019s also helpful. Last, quick housekeeping one, we\u2019ve got a few inbounds on this lately, but just with respect to Chesapeake and Haynesville contracts you\u2019ve got there, could you just remind us again when those contracts roll and what your appetite is at all to renegotiate anything here?","Micheal Dunn","As far as \u2013 this is Micheal Dunn, those contracts are dedicated to us and we \u2013 I don\u2019t have the exact time frame on when you\u2019re a language about when they might roll, but all that acreage is dedicated to us and we are continuing to work with Chesapeake there. And they\u2019ve been active in there and we\u2019ve been bringing on additional production from them, but we\u2019ve also been very successful in capturing other business in the Haynesville besides Chesapeake that is coming into our systems there. So volume in the Haynesville is up for us. And we\u2019re pretty pleased with what we\u2019re seeing there right now.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I would just say, they\u2019re in the Haynesville when we renegotiated that several years ago there we did extend the life of that contract and I believe that contract extends out into the 2030s, so that was one of the benefits we got out of that transaction when we renegotiated that a couple of years ago. So the Eagle Ford is as similar long term timeframe, so there\u2019s not any re-ups coming in either of those areas.","Spiro Dounis","Got it. I appreciate all that color. Thanks guys.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Gabe Moreen","Good morning, everyone. I was wondering if you can talk a little bit overall about the ability to reflex CapEx higher or lower in response to the natural gas pricing environment. You gave a preliminary outlook for CapEx guidance for 2020. To the extent gas prices go maybe sub $2. Is there even more ability to reflex that downward? Maybe you can speak to that? Or is that kind of 50% reduction sort of where it goes regardless of the environment?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, Gabe, good question. Yes, I would just say, there are the capital that we have out there today is backed by rate increases or MVCs. And so if there was a further pullback that occurred today I would just say that a lot of that capital that we\u2019re talking about really wouldn\u2019t move all that much unless there was some kind of renegotiation because most of its underpinned by obligations on the other side. So really wouldn\u2019t expect it to move too much. I would tell you that the outside of the Northeast, obviously, these demand pool projects, which will be the bulk of our capital in 2020, of course \u2013 just further improved by low gas prices. So we don\u2019t really see any change there. And then we still got capital going into DJ Basin, and the Wamsutter area and those who mostly getting driven off of oil prices. So we don\u2019t see much change going on there. And of course, the deepwater is such a long term play. It didn\u2019t really get driven by the shifts \u2013 short term shifts in commodity prices.","Gabe Moreen","Thanks Alan. And I guess as a related follow-up. I was wondering, if you can comment a little bit on the headlines that are crossed on the Blue Racer system over the last couple of weeks. And I think related to that, there was a fairly substantial Marcellus gathering transaction that happened about a month ago and I think Williams had ownership in a couple of those systems. Was there an opportunity to maybe piggyback on that transaction and community speak to that as well?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. No. The answer is \u2013 I\u2019ll just answer the simple part of that first and then I\u2019ll turn it over to our General Counsel to answer the more complex question you started with. On the pinot investment that we have with Rivers \u2013 midstream up there, that is a really small interest and there is not really any opportunity there for us. So there\u2019s really nothing on that front. We do think there\u2019s some good consolidation opportunity up there that we think will like some our way, even with that asset, we think there\u2019s some good opportunity around the liquids that come off of that plant that do come over to UEOM. But again, I\u2019d just say, we were impressed with another high multiple being paid in the space out there. And I think we continue to see that. And so we continue to see our businesses mark well below that, those kind of multiples that are being paid. So we were impressed by it and we are obviously we\u2019re paying close attention to that.","I\u2019m going to have Lane Wilson, our General Council responds to you on the Blue Racer question.","Lane Wilson","Hey, Gabe, as you\u2019re talking about the news lately regarding the litigation in Delaware. I will think about it. All we want to say there is, that we are cooperating and supportive of the efforts to IPO the Blue Racer business. That said, there are a number of rights around the structure and scope of certain filings that we have related to that IPO efforts. And the litigation is really just effort on our part to protect those rights. Beyond that, I think we just want to wait for the court to rule probably it occurs on time in August.","Gabe Moreen","Thanks, Lane. I\u2019ll let that rest. And last one for me is, it seems like a little bit of pushing out to the right on timing on some of the Rocky\u2019s processing expansions. I think Alan, you mentioned oil \u2013 being a function of oil prices, it seems like the processing picture is pretty dynamic out there in the DJ. Can you maybe speak to that and the timing going on there?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, we\u2019re really pretty encouraged by the continued steady growth rate that we\u2019re working with on producers out there. We did push out Keansburg II plant and our Milton Train. We did push those out in our schedule. But we are really impressed with the growth that we\u2019re seeing out there and the fact that we\u2019ve already filled up just here in one quarter. We filled up that one new train we placed in service first part of April. And so we were really pleased with the way that\u2019s going. Actually, I would tell you one of the risks I didn\u2019t like about that basin was the peaky nature of the production growth. And so that flattening out a little bit with the same amount of reserves back. We actually picked up a very large dedication in East Greeley from extractions since we did that deal earlier.","And so we continue to build dedicated acreage behind the system and a little slower growth rate with less capital going in wouldn\u2019t hurt my feelings at all in terms of the long term return on capital that we would see out of that area. So overall, despite all the regulatory concerns, which is not to be dismissed, we actually think the basins doing very well, and the producers are doing a nice job of following through on the permits. And a lot of which were already grandfathered in the area. So I would be contrarian perhaps, but I am pretty \u2013 have a pretty positive perspective about the DJ and the actions going on out there right now.","Gabe Moreen","Great. Thanks, Alan.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","Chris Sighinolfi","Good morning, Alan. Thanks for all the announcements, really helpful. I did want to follow-up on a couple of areas. The leverage guidance change last night, I noticed obviously it came down at touch without any subsequent change in the EBITDA or CapEx ranges. So I\u2019m just wondering, is that sort of a feeling that you\u2019re going to be at the higher end of the EBITDA range or the lower end of the CapEx range or both? Or is it some other cash flow item, like a working capital change or something like that we should pay attention to it?","Alan Armstrong","Well, yes, great question and very fair one. I would just say that on the CapEx side, we\u2019re probably coming in towards the lower end of that range on CapEx guidance. So that\u2019s a piece of it. And as well, I would just say we\u2019ve got more confidence around the way that quarter has gone. And one thing is pretty interesting if you think about it, we always show our CapEx and that\u2019s like gross CapEx number. And so when we \u2013 for instance, the JV we have now with CPP, that\u2019s our gross CapEx that\u2019s embedded there as that is our gross. But our capital burden obviously, is less with CPP picking up some of that capital load from us. And so that actually helps that as well a little bit.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. No, I think maybe I had a not quite paid attention to that latter part, so I appreciate that. I\u2019m also pivoting a little bit wanting to follow up on Spiro\u2019s earlier question, right? You\u2019re gathering contracts perhaps frame it more broadly than he did. As you had referenced, you renegotiated some agreements in select areas and with select counterparties in the 2015, 2016 timeframe, I think an often instances you received an upfront cash payment and then subsequently lowered the rate as per activity and preserve, I think in total your NPV. I\u2019m just wondering, given the pullback now and the intense focus on producer activities, if you\u2019re having similar conversations with anybody anywhere?","Alan Armstrong","No. Not that I\u2019m aware of, Chris, I\u2019m not \u2013 I don\u2019t see anything out there right now. There\u2019s certainly a lot of desire as we always have. There\u2019s always desires with our producers to further streamline and align our interest out there. And so they\u2019re certainly on that, but I don\u2019t know of anything where there\u2019d be an upfront payment kind of situation out there. And really the only thing, as we had that really was the Barnett that Total now the operator on. And so we\u2019re constantly working with Total and alignment and especially in a low gas price environment. We work closely with them on reducing costs between the two of us out there, very healthy relationship and very positive one with Total there in the Barnett.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay, great. And then a final question for me, Alan is, we\u2019ve obviously paid attention to, what you guys are seeking in Texas with the Exco situation, it feels like the RRC is going to make a decision here next week and I\u2019m just curious if I could get a little bit more color from you on maybe the background there and if that\u2019s a situation that might be replicated elsewhere if you have a producer that\u2019s flaring on a system that already exists and how that may be dovetails into some of your ESG efforts.","Alan Armstrong","Yes, great question. When it truly is one of those things where it just doesn\u2019t, frankly, from our perspective make a lot of sense. But it is very complex background that was originally that acreage was dedicated under the Chesapeake agreement. Chesapeake sold their mineral interest to Exco but didn\u2019t move the dedication. And so though the cost of that \u2013 those assets remains in that cost of service calculation under the Chesapeake agreement. And so just because they sold it didn\u2019t mean it, it changed the nature of that. The gas was physically connected to our system and had previously flowed. And so this isn\u2019t a situation where we\u2019re saying, hey, our pipelines sitting out there and we could connect it to you. It literally is connected. And so given that this is our gas and therefore puts off a lot of H2S \u2013 has a lot of H2S component in it. And we would put off as SO2. We think, there is lot of good reasons to be making sure that\u2019s going on.","I will say that our team has worked in a very positive manner out there with Exco, despite the conflict. We\u2019ve been working with them in a positive way to try to contain the gas and be buying the gas from them. And so we are working on continuing to improve that relationship and be constructive as we always would. So I do think, we\u2019re going to wind up at a constructive place on that, but it is a complex issue because that actually was \u2013 is under an old Chesapeake agreement and the cost of those facilities that we installed were under that cost of service agreements.","So but as far as I\u2019m going to take that one but we are \u2013 I would say, our move out there was just one of protecting our rights. And the contract for the Chesapeake acreage out there prohibits flaring. So you shouldn\u2019t assume that this gets extended to further actions in the area, because it\u2019s specifically prohibits that. So don\u2019t really see any follow on from this.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. Well, thanks again for the time and congrats on a steady execution. It\u2019s certainly not been lost on us.","Alan Armstrong","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Tonet","Hi, good morning. Wanted to pick up on the balance sheet situation here, it seems like you guys been quite busy has been noted on the call with asset sales and strategic JVs, really accelerating that deleveraging process here. I was just wondering, if you could expand a bit more on how you see leverage kind of progressing here. I mean, if you\u2019re bringing in 2020 CapEx coming down, as you noted, I want to see, the potential to continue to maybe divest assets in the West that don\u2019t have \u2013 that are not contiguous and can\u2019t have value chain integration? And possibly the ability of moving forward, hitting that 4.2 leverage target, if things come together there.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Jeremy, good question. I would just say, we\u2019re always looking at that and I would say another driver for that, which is more value than just deleveraging because I think we\u2019re on a very clear path in our mind to get there anyway. And so we feel pretty confident just on the natural path we\u2019re on to getting there. However, given the value spread between what the private space is willing to pay for these cash flows, very certain cash flows versus what the public equity is valuing that. It just continues to provide an opportunity for us to gain value for our shareholders. And so I would say, even if it wasn\u2019t for that for the deleveraging benefit that comes from that, we would be looking at those kinds of opportunities anyway. Just because we don\u2019t feel like our gathering and processing assets are valued appropriately. In fact, I would question where we are today. I would question, if our pipeline assets are being valued appropriately. So we\u2019ll continue to take advantage of that spread. And of course, it does have the benefits of continuing to do collaborate pretty rapidly as well.","Jeremy Tonet","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just turning over to Regional Energy here, I appreciate that you\u2019re at a kind of commercially sensitive point in the development, but just wondering if you could expand a bit more as far as kind of a shipper interest and how you see that progressing?","Micheal Dunn","Yes. Micheal Dunn here. We had a lot of interest in that project. We are working through the scenarios of delivery points and supply points and we\u2019re optimistic that will ultimately have a very nice project there. There were several paths that were available there to shippers submitting under the open season and we\u2019re just evaluating the submissions that we receive and configuring, various scenarios to ultimately make a great project for a Transco and our customers there.","Jeremy Tonet","That\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi. Good morning, guys. Maybe just start off on the Northeast guidance just to come back to it a little bit here. There\u2019s sort of a delta in the CAGR between the volume metric growth rate versus EBITDA growth rate. And my understanding is that it\u2019s a function of timing with respect to the contracts and the contract structure and so forth. In a hypothetical scenario where 2021, let\u2019s say, was zero percent growth, would there still be some EBITDA carryover that would roll into 2021 in a scenario of zero growth?","John Chandler","I don\u2019t know that we have evaluated that. I would tell you we run a pretty precise model that gets us to that. But I don\u2019t know per certain, so I don\u2019t want to speak out of school on that. We have competence in model we have, but I don\u2019t want to get out on a limb without the benefit of the detailed model behind that answer. I\u2019m not saying it doesn\u2019t, I\u2019m just telling you I\u2019m not certain as we sit here.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. That makes sense. And then secondly on the Northeast, if I read your tone correctly, it sort of sounds like you\u2019re trying to shift towards a harvest cash flows from the Northeast and kind of adjusting time kind of CapEx approach. Is that in fact correct? And as you sort of think about projects you\u2019re noodling, where do you expect to spend the majority of your CapEx kind of on a go forward basis?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I would say, I think we\u2019ve always been on adjusting time mode there in the Northeast for many years now and making sure that we\u2019re staying aligned with the customers and producers up there that are coming to us wanting additional capacity. And we\u2019ll still continue to do that. We\u2019re finishing up some pretty significant projects this year with the TXP-2 installation at Oak Grove that\u2019s now online as well as their checkmark pipeline. Our Monarch pipeline, which is an NGL pipeline that goes to our Harrison fractionation complex.","So we\u2019ve got a lot of capital that, we are deploying this year that will be rapidly filling. So I guess in future years, I would say we\u2019re going to be very responsive to the customers there. We are still talking to them about expansions. And so we\u2019re not just in harvest mode, but we are still continuing in each one of those franchises. We talk to the customers about expansions and things they want to do up there, and seeing who has been very active on the cardinal influence systems and evaluating. There are new acres that they bought from Chesapeake and we\u2019re excited to work with them on that as well. So I think we\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities there to continue to look for expansions and it\u2019s certainly going to be depended upon price with many of those producers, they\u2019re very keen on watching the price and what they can achieve there with their net backs.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. And maybe one final question. And I\u2019m really not sure how much you can say about the pending rate case. Sort of think about the landscape out there, it\u2019s increasingly getting extremely difficult to build greenfield projects. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of everything that\u2019s going on and so forth. And so I\u2019m sort of thinking about it, an outcome where your customers are interveners are pushing for \u2013 let\u2019s say, a lower ROE authorization. Wouldn\u2019t that disincentivize you to build any further? I mean they can\u2019t force you to actually expand Transco. And does that factor into the process of the negotiations about coming to a win-win scenario? Because it\u2019s difficult to build and at the same time you have a system in place. But if they enforce a little return on you, then you have no incentive to actually build. Just wondering if you can sort of comment about that and whether that\u2019s something that comes into the discussion process.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I would just say it\u2019s pretty complex issue, but maybe to bring it home to something pretty simple. The emissions reduction program that we have, which is a $1.2 billion program that benefits everybody and including directly our customers in those areas, because we reduce emissions in the areas which allows for further expansions, businesses in the area by reducing emissions, and so for their power plants, for instance. So there\u2019s a lot of positives that come out of emissions reduction project and obviously a lot of those customers have been making those similar investments in methane, leak prevention and so forth.","So they spent a lot of money on their systems under their PUCs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. And I think everybody is in favor of us doing that. Getting a low return up against our portfolio of other opportunities, doesn\u2019t really get us very far on that because we need to have economic incentive to make those investments. And so \u2013 and to your point, we have these other items and really where that nexus comes together is up against project expansions. And so if we have high return opportunities for expansion projects because things are so difficult to build, that is going to get the money up against a lower ROE.","And so said another way, because somebody can\u2019t force us to build those lower ROEs, we will have negotiated rates that generally get us to a higher rate. But that of course then just puts pressure on the capital allocation process on opportunities for those kinds of investments. And as well, things like cybersecurity and everything else that we need to invest on. So we\u2019ve got to make sure for the health of this industry, we\u2019ve got to make sure that those ROEs are in line with the investment opportunities across the space. And if we don\u2019t, we\u2019re not really \u2013 the FERC really is veering away from its responsibility to make sure that those returns are attractive enough to incentive investment in the space. And so that\u2019s certainly a key issue as we go into those negotiations.","Micheal Dunn","I think it\u2019s clear to say as part of that discussion and negotiation, the difficulty with building new pipe, risks that companies, pipeline companies bear, they\u2019ll build these new assets, certainly goes into the reality that this isn\u2019t a super low return environment. I mean, we need an appropriate return to go along with the risk, some of the timing delays and other things that go into constructing pipelines today. So, that\u2019s certainly part of the argument.","Shneur Gershuni","Perfect, guys. Really appreciate the color. Thank you very much.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christine Cho","Good morning. So the lower Northeast guidance isn\u2019t that surprising, just given recent commentary out of Northeast producers? But can you talk about how you came to the lowering of your guidance? Some of your producers have publicly talked down numbers, but others less though. So can you just help me reconcile how much of it is your own estimates on what you think producers are going to do and how much of it is what producers told you that they\u2019re going to do?","Alan Armstrong","There\u2019s certainly small pieces in there, but I would tell you the vast majority of our information is directly in line with detailed work that we do with our producers. They can\u2019t surprise us and want production brought online. We have to plan well in advance with them. And so while there maybe little pieces here and there, it\u2019s pretty detailed and we keep that model up to date with the very latest work that we\u2019re doing with producers. So Mike, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019d add anything to that.","Micheal Dunn","Yes. Christine, we do detailed analysis with each one of our producers. Some of the producers we meet with weekly to plan our projects and plan activities associated with either they\u2019re well-connects that are coming online or their future expansion opportunities. So we have a very robust planning process with nearly every one of our producers up there. And that\u2019s what we desire with every one of them and we strive for.","So we do a lot of work with them in order to make sure that we\u2019re not getting out in front of them, but we\u2019re also meeting their needs. And we worked really hard to scale back a lot of our capital investment immediately with the producers when they told us that they were scaling back some of their turn in lines for their wells. And so we were able to very quickly take a lot of capital out of our Northeast investments that we had planned for. Therefore, that\u2019s why we\u2019re edging toward the lower end of our growth capital guidance just because of that activity downturn.","Christine Cho","Okay, helpful. Thank you. And then given the changes at EQT and their customer, can you just remind us how your contracts with them work, if they\u2019re volume commitments or acreage dedication. And if you could confirm the tenure left on that contract and whether or not you expect the changes that customer to be an opportunity or a more neutral?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I would just say, the contracts are long-term in nature and they do come with an MBC, and it\u2019s a MBC that ramps up over time. So we do have that. I\u2019m not going to get into a whole lot more detailed beyond that. And I would also just add that a lot of the acreage that they are \u2013 that the new management group is very focused on is in the West Virginia area where we have a lot of the existing infrastructure in the area. So we\u2019re encouraged to be working with them. We\u2019ve got a lot to offer them, but our existing contracts are MBC based and they are long-term.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then last one for me. Can you just walk us through, when do you need all your approvals by for the Northeast Supply Enhancement project in order to hit the winter 2020, 2021 in service date?","Micheal Dunn","Yes, Christine, thanks for the question. We are working through the 401 with both New York and New Jersey right now. We would hope to have those in hand this summer and order for us to be able to then achieve the 404 permit from the Corps of Engineers. And then we intend to start construction this fall on the project. Primarily the compressor station construction would occur first. That is the really the long lead pacing item here and with all the environmental windows that are associated with the offshore construction, we slotted that construction in for next summer.","So the real pacing item here is the compressor station that would be on the critical path because it\u2019s a longer duration construction. So we would expect to have in hand a 401 certifications the summer and then certainly after that, the 404 permit would have a very small public comment period that would open up and we would have that 404 permit so that we could go to the FERC and then ask for a notice to proceed and then began construction in the fall.","Christine Cho","Great. Thank you so much for the color.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Caller, your line is open.","Danilo Juvane","Good morning. Thank you for squeezing me in. I wanted to start with the Northeast and thank you for providing guidance for the second financial year. To the extent that you have provided this information, beyond 2020, how should we think about volumetric sensitivity as it relates to EBITDA? For instance, for a percent change in the growth rate, what does that translate to from an EBITDA standpoint going forward?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I think obviously it\u2019s dependent on what the growth is. It\u2019s not perfectly linear obviously. But I would just say, the ability to continue two have a higher EBITDA growth rate than volume growth rate will continue just because our cost structure is more and more efficient. Our unit cost continues to lower over time, and so as volumes go up. So that relationship, there\u2019s not really any reason that that would stop for us. Some of the pretty significant increase that we\u2019ve got here in the front end is based on some higher rates associated with the capital we placed. And so, you wouldn\u2019t see a continuing increase to that rate, but the basic fundamental piece of lower unit costs with higher volume will continue to benefit that relationship.","Danilo Juvane","Thanks for that, Alan. Second one for me. The long-term 5% to 7% target growth rate, to the extent that there may be ongoing issues with NESE I mean, how \u2013 and we still sort of hit that growth rate going forward. How should we think about that?","Alan Armstrong","I\u2019m sorry, Danilo, I didn\u2019t quite understand which growth rate. Are you talking about 5% to 7%?","Danilo Juvane","Correct, the 5% to 7%. If there are any additional delays with NESE for instance, from a timing standpoint, is that something that\u2019s still kind of is intact going forward?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. We\u2019ve got \u2013 I would just say, a lot of other variables to consider other than just NESE. NESE is a very attractive project for us. But there are a number of other things, but I would certainly say that we are confident right now and that\u2019s the occurring and that is included as we think about that 5% to 7% growth rate out there right now that is included in that. But as we mentioned, we have a lot of other things that are variables in that as well. And we tend to find a way to offset, if we did have a negative surprise on that if some time. But I would just tell you, we as a team are very confident right now in that going ahead just because we know how critical it is to that area that it does go ahead.","Danilo Juvane","Thank you. Those are my questions.","Alan Armstrong","Thanks.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Good morning. Over the past year you gained gathering market share in the Northeast, driven by Atlantic Sunrise. In your 2020 5.5% growth number, can you \u2013 do you know if you\u2019re kind of expecting to gain market share or is that the same rate that you would expect the basin to grow and you\u2019re just in line with that?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, we\u2019re not counting on any new customers out there in that number. So that just off our existing base of customers, if that\u2019s your question. Obviously, different producers have different motives and different activities that go on out there. So it\u2019s not perfectly rate-able across the space obviously. So I don\u2019t really know what the broad base estimation is, but I can tell you that\u2019s just from our existing customer base that we have out there in terms of our growth rate.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay. That makes sense. And then just as a quick follow-up, I think in 2020 there are some Gulf of Mexico MBC rollout related to Gunflint. Can you just give any range that you have of the EBITDA decline that might be associated with that?","Alan Armstrong","We don\u2019t have any MBCs out there.","John Chandler","We do have some deferred revenue step downs that occur and we had some fixed payments that actually declined. So call that in the tune of $75 million roughly in that range of step down between 2019 and 2020.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. That\u2019s all for me.","Alan Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.","Becca Followill","Good morning, guys. Following up on the Northeast gathering. So if I\u2019m looking at Page 10 with your growth projects, is it fair to say that when you referenced the MBC that you have on this gathering that the Susquehanna Gathering for 2019 and 2020, and then the Bradford Gathering, those are going forward regardless that those have MBCs associated with them?","Alan Armstrong","Well, just to be clear, the most of the Susquehanna Gathering doesn\u2019t have MBCs, it has higher gathering rates. So the gathering rates are applied across all of the volumes, not across \u2013 there\u2019s not in MBCs to be clear in Susquehanna. Bradford on the other hand is a cost of service agreement. So that is dependent on the capital being placed. And once the capital is requested, then that goes into the rate of return calculations. So I\u2019d say another way, it\u2019s not volume sensitive once the capital has been put in place.","Becca Followill","So would the payback reduce your activity, these projects are still going forward?","Alan Armstrong","Yes.","Becca Followill","Okay. No change at this point. And then on the Gulf of Mexico. Can you quantify on the Norphlet pipeline that you acquired and then the incremental discovery volumes from Hadrian north and Buckskin tie backs. What kind of EBITDA those contribute?","Alan Armstrong","I don\u2019t believe we\u2019ve provided that detail. I think we have said that the Norphlet was a five to six multiple project for us. So you can do the math on that $200 million. And that is just against the base field out there. So there are some other nice discoveries in the area that we are very well served \u2013 very well positioned to serve, but that isn\u2019t going to come on for the next \u2013 in the next couple of years. That\u2019ll be beyond that period.","Becca Followill","And then finally you talked about we\u2019ll possibly be in FID at the end of this year. But on the Page 10, it shows that as a 2022 plus. So is that \u2013 is it\u2019s fid this years, is it still 2022 plus.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Just to be clear, my comment was our infrastructure. So our system, not speaking for the producers on that, but given our work with the producer, we would be looking to FID our work and our expansion associated the dedication\u2019s already there. And so we would be taking action on our part based on the dedication, so just to be clear on that. So we\u2019re not going to get ahead of Shell and Chevron on their timing on the project out there. But I would tell you it is on a very fast track within both shops.","Becca Followill","So it would still be 2022 plus per Page 10.","Alan Armstrong","Yes.","John Chandler","That page is intended to represent when we believe the project really will come into full service.","Becca Followill","Okay. Got you.","Alan Armstrong","So we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do out there and so our FID is necessary to make sure that we\u2019re not on the critical path.","Becca Followill","Got you.

Welcome to today's Williams and Williams Partners First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. And at this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Porter","Thanks, Melanie. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages, the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. In addition to Alan this morning, we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas with us: Jim Scheel leads our Northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area, Rory Miller leads the Atlantic Gulf area; and John Dearborn leads our NGL & Petchem Services operating area; Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to any questions.","In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Thanks, John, and good morning to everybody. Thank you for joining us. Certainly excited to be reporting another great quarter and really on all key measures, but before we dig in to the quarterly results, I want to remind you that we remain very committed to our natural gas focus strategy and we continue to have -- and the strategy really continues to have us right in the middle of some great opportunities, and really, we couldn't be more excited about the way we're seeing the tailwinds build for the opportunities that we've positioned ourselves for. This has certainly been a wave that we've been seeing building for quite some time, and we think we've got ourselves in the perfect position to catch this wave. And certainly, as we see a lot of our major projects start to come on here in the last half of this year and really, for many years to come, we just got a tremendous wave of great projects that we've been working so hard on to get out in front of. So we certainly see it -- the wave building here in the first quarter and through our guidance period and then well beyond, and we look forward to talking about that well beyond certainly at our upcoming Analyst Day.","So we are also well positioned to return this value to our shareholders for many years to come with our industry-leading dividend at WMB and as well, our solid and very visible distribution growth at WPZ. So today, we'll talk about the key measures for our first quarter results. We'll talk about the continued project execution and development that we've got ongoing, discuss the drivers for our '14 and '15 -- 2014 and 2015 guidance range. And I'll provide a little bit of color on Bluegrass, the current situation, which has improved for us dramatically at Opal, and then I'll briefly touch on our future growth. So as I did say, though, a lot of that future growth and a lot of opportunity to really dig into at our upcoming Analyst Day.","So getting in here to the first quarter and looking at our very strong first quarter operating results. I think the real big keys for this quarter from my perspective is, one, first of all we're continuing to see our fee-based revenues drive. And so we saw a 9% increase over the prior year's quarter, and we continue see strength on that. We certainly had a tough winter, but I will tell you that our teams did a great job of driving reliable services and certainly, we had some production outages upstream of our systems, but for the most part, our teams were able to keep our systems up and running through -- and available through some very difficult winter time. So I want to commend our teams who really had some great focus on that this year and did an extraordinary job on that.","Also, our 17% growth in DCF, which is really driven by the $63 million increase in the fee-based revenue growth and as well, the $8 million lower maintenance CapEx. And of course, that lower maintenance CapEx was really driven as well by a pretty harsh winter that made it hard for us to get out and get some of the work that we would have expected to get done in the first quarter done. You will see -- obviously, you'll see that those costs continue to build -- on the maintenance capital side will build here in the second quarter as things thaw out and we're able to get in to get a lot of that work done. So bottom line, great quarter, great start to the year with many large catalysts for growth ahead of us in the last half of '14 and certainly beyond '14.","Moving on to the growth that we expect through our guidance period. This is something we're really excited about, greater than 50% growth in our DCF from 2013 to 2015. And of course, that really is on the backs of all of these big projects that we've been working so hard on and investing so much capital into. And you'll see a lot of that growth is going to be driven by about a $900 million increase in our fee-based revenues, comparing '13 to '15. And as well, though, I think something that's really impressive on this front. As we look at our cost structure, really, a pretty small increase in our cash operating expenses relative to the size of this growth because a lot of this growth is already built out in terms of our assets being well positioned in the Northeast and as well they're along a lot of our existing right of ways and just additive to our existing lines of business. So our increased cash cost is really not that high. So we see a nice increase in our margin over the period as well.","For 2014, some of the drivers, they certainly remain the same. Certainly, we're very focused on the June restart at Geismar and also the successful recovery of our BI insurance proceeds, and those 2 things obviously go together, and so we continue to be very focused on that -- getting that done. And I would say on that front, John Dearborn is here to address more of that, but we're certainly still within the window that we've been describing and we'll be looking forward to starting probably in the last half of June. And I'll remind you, a startup isn't a simple push of the button, and we are starting to return systems, various auxiliary systems to -- into service as we speak. But again, a lot of work left to be able to get hydrocarbons into the facility and cracked.","We're seeing a planned ramp-up in the drilling in the Northeast G&P area. We've got great tailwinds building behind this area, and certainly, the strong gas prices are a boost to that. And so we're pretty excited about how we're positioned there, but we do have a lot of growth in the plan, and Jim Scheel is here to address that.","Finally, our commodity prices. We certainly have got a clear explanation of what we're at risk to there on our commodity prices. And I would tell you, the thing I've probably got my eye on the most, relative to our plan today, is higher gas prices, which, of course, would impact our processing margins in the short term. I think in the long term, that's a very strong positive force because it's going to continue to drive volumes, not just in the Northeast, but it'll drive volumes in the West as well. So I think that while we may see some short-term impact against our processing margin if we get above that average that we've got stated, I think we're pretty excited to see that because it's really going to drive the kind of growth in our basins and drive our volumes higher.","Finally, ethylene prices are certainly an obvious driver, but nice to see the very significant improvement we've seen here in the last couple of weeks. And I'll tell you that John Dearborn and his team have done a pretty good job of calling that. And so we're excited to bring Geismar back up, right into running when there's a great need for those ethylene -- particularly around the Mississippi River front.","In 2015, we get a big boost from all of the big 2014 projects being on for a full year. So you'll note, many of our big projects are coming on in the last half of year. So in '15, we get a full year of that. And then another round of fully contracted projects that come online in 2015, as Transco continues to connect these tremendous demands for the Marcellus supply into these markets that are rapidly expanding as well. So the great capital investment opportunities continue to be a big opportunity and certainly are going to drive a great cash flow growth.","But I think looking to the next slide, an even more important change to WPZ really is the fact that because we've been investing using -- been funding so much of this growth on the equity side, now, we're going to be able to rebalance to the debt side as these big projects come online. And so as you can see here on this slide, titled growth plans, required minimum of WPZ equity and no WMB equity, that is really powerful for the whole story because, again, very limited needs for capital in the foreseeable future on WPZ because of all the equity we've issued, positioning ourselves over the last couple of years. And so for '14, all we're seeing is a little bit of entrance into the ATM space on the equity side and then no equity planned for 2015 at WPZ. So a great reward coming back to our equity side of our balance sheet.","Moving onto the next slide here. Relatively modest growth in the WPZ CapEx. This is driven by the recently announced 1.2 Bcf a day contract to serve Cheniere Sabine Pass LNG facility. We're very excited to capture that business, and a very nice piece of business for us because a pretty limited capital for the size of the market that we're capturing there. And that's a very long term, well-secured contract, so we're very excited about that. And then as you can see in WMB, a fairly significant reduction in capital driven by us pulling Bluegrass from our capital plans at this point.","So we certainly continue to believe the Bluegrass pipeline is a great project. We certainly think it's the best long-term solution in the marketplace for getting all these growing NGLs from the Northeast, from both the Utica and the Marcellus, into the Gulf Coast. But however, we're not going to stick our necks out for the sake of the industry on that. We've got great projects in our wheelhouse and a lot of tremendous opportunity. They just put us in a very envious position of not having to stretch for that project. And so we certainly hope that Bluegrass or something like it gets built for the sake of the space, but that's really going to be up to the shippers and producers to determine if they want to support a project like that. So we remain ready and able to push ahead on that project but are plenty happy with all the great long-term contracted business we're getting in the other sectors of our business.","Moving on to looking at few of the milestones that -- and the challenges here among executing large-scale, value-creating projects here on Slide 6. And really, this is really just a highlight, a few of the milestones and challenges that we are tackling this year. And this slide really is just the top of the wave of all the growth that we're executing on this year. On the next slide, you'll see some of the bigger projects moving forward.","So a few things I want to highlight, though, here. First of all, on Transco, boy, what a great position we continue to enjoy on Transco. And it's not just moving the Marcellus and the Utica supplies out of the Northeast. It's really being driven, even in a larger scale, by market growth on our system. And so just here in the past last couple of weeks, we've announced major progress on 1.9 Bcf a day of new markets just in the Southeast. So that doesn't include a lot of the market expansions we're seeing that go with Atlantic Sunrise, and with Rockaway and Virginia Southside. This is just the Southeast markets proper, so 1.9 Bcf a day. And in fact, we really are going to be working to make sure we keep the supplies delivering to these projects, like the Dalton Lateral, the Gulf Trace project that we've mentioned a while ago and as well, the Mobile Bay South III, which adds about $325 million a day to meeting some critical gas generation loads in the Southeast.","On Gulfstar, I just want to really give a big shout-out to our team on the E&C side on this one. They really pulled it together with some great designs, some great plannings on the Gulfstar operations to get that spar set. We got that spar set in an offshore window of about 4 weeks and that is, according to the experts we deal with out there that are in the business of setting a lot of this, a record for getting in and out of the major offshore campaign there. So that does not come with luck. That comes with great planning, and I'm just very proud of our team and the way they executed on that. We're also very excited because we think this is going to be a huge success for Hess and Chevron on their Tubular Bells prospect, and we think with that kind of success comes more. And we think is going to be a great project for them as they look back and look at the project returns they're going to gain out of this. But it also helps other customers in the area, like Nobel, and we're helping them deliver Gunflint, an extremely attractive schedule and returns for that project for them as well. And so this is exactly what we're hoping to do is to help create great value for both our customers and for our shareholders at the same time, and Gulfstar is a great example for that.","Regarding several of the incidents that we've had lately. So first of all, our Opal gas processing facility. And as you'll notice, we did bring back 2 of those trains back overnight and we are -- that we -- we'd shut those down last week following the fire at the facility. Those facilities weren't damaged in any way, but just as an abundance of caution, we had shut that down, make sure we inspected everything and make sure we were safe before we came back into service out there. We have 2 other trains that also were not damaged in the fire and that is trains 4 and trains 5. And with those 4 trains on, we have adequate capacity to serve all of our existing business out there. So we'll be working hard to get Trains 4 and 5 back on, but we're going to make sure that we do it safe first, and that's what we're focused on right now.","So I think regarding these incidents, Williams, we've always been very focused on being safe and being reliable. And certainly, this has come as a big surprise to our organization. I can tell you this has my full attention and the attention of our board as well. We're conducting very thorough investigations into each incident and see -- determine if there's any common or root cause that's common to these incidents. And I'll tell you one thing that is common, which is a bit surprising perhaps is that these historically have been some of our safest facilities when you look at typical industry standards for safety. And certainly have been -- had gotten high marks from regulators previously, kind of across-the-board. So anyway, that's the one thing that's common, but we're looking hard to determine what other contributing factors may be out there and to make sure what we're doing as an enterprise, to make sure that we're doing our business in as safe a manner as possible. Not just for our own benefit, but -- and our employees' benefit, but to the industry's benefit as well.","So you'll expect that -- you should expect to hear a little more on that on our safety performance at the upcoming Analyst Day as well. And then one final note on this slide, I just like to commend the team at ACMP and Access Midstream, continue to drive great performance for us, and that is certainly continuing to drive our growth in '14 and beyond.","Looking to slide -- to the next slide here, certainly a very large increase in our projects and just tremendous backlog that we're building here.","A couple of things you can pull off of this slide. First of all, you'll see a line drawn in between our WMB projects -- or sorry, at the top, our WPZ projects, and then we draw line toward the WMB projects. And you can see, we continue to develop a pretty significant backlog of drop-down opportunities for WPZ at the WMB level. And so that should -- certainly should not be missed. And as well, I will tell you, this is really just a result. This long backlog of great contracted projects is really the fruits of sticking to our strategy and being very focused around catching this wave of natural gas market growth, both on the supply and the demand side.","Our -- we think by far, we have the best visible contracted growth and it's certainly well beyond any of the other large-cap midstream players, including Kinder, Enterprise or Energy Transfer. And much of this growth is driven off of our very well-positioned assets and the kind of investments we've made over the last several years, gaining our position that we have today.","Our strategy, we think, is very much in line with our customers and the -- their access to markets, and that's driving a lot of our benefit as well. And then we remain very, very focused on connecting the very best supplies in North America to the very best markets, both for natural gas and for the natural gas derivatives that are coming, because those are obviously low cost into the markets they serve as well. So a very attractive set of backlog here. And I'll tell you, this continues to grow and it really just continues to present opportunities for us to allocate capital to the very best projects.","Moving to the final slide here. Certainly going to continue right along our strategy, and this great line of sight that we have to the major growth. We continue to contribute beyond guidance in terms of new projects and new growth. And we really look forward to talking to you about that at our Analyst Day. And finally, I'll just say, we're focused on the business that's going to be there for the long haul. We're not just focused on the opportunity du jour. We're really focused on where we can gain a competitive advantage and reward our shareholders not just in the short term, but a great focus on sustainable investments that are supported by long-term market trends and competitive advantages. And so we think that will continue to generate opportunity for not just years but decades, given the kind of position that we're staking out in the space, and we're very excited about what that means for our shareholders, long-term. And so with that, I'll turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to Abhi Rajendran with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. First, on Northeast G&P. So your segment profit in 1Q was $12 million, but you also maintained your full year guidance of $195 million, which suggests a pretty meaningful ramp up. So could you maybe just talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes driving this? And also what some of the main risks may be to this ramp?","James E. Scheel","Hi, this is Jim Scheel. Thanks for the question, Abhi. As we looked at this winter, this has been one of the worst winters we've had in the Northeast, and I know over the course of the last few meetings about the reliability of the OVM system in particular, there have been some challenges with that. Those, we didn't face this year. And so volume challenges that we had were more on the producer side versus the asset side that we're operating. So we're very excited about having a reliable system ready to move gas, especially in this market of ever-increasing prices for our customers. We see a rather rapid ramp-up of volume over the course of this year. Obviously, we saw a 2% growth between the fourth quarter and the first quarter. But I want to remind you, Abhi, that during the fourth quarter of last year, we had some incremental volumes coming into OVM due to the Natrium fire. Those did not materialize or weren't in there during the first quarter of this year and we still saw an increase. As we move through the course of the year, I would expect our volumes to be slightly under perhaps what we've shown on our spreadsheets as the $335 million average, but I want to emphasize, we'll probably end the year with a much -- with above the $400 million that we're showing. So I'm excited about the assets' ability to move the volumes, to reach those goals. One of the key risks that we may need to look at is related to the Chevron well pad fire and how they react to that with bringing volumes online later in the year.","Donald R. Chappel","This is Don Chappel. Just to add to Jim's comments, I'd also just remind you that, again, we're bringing a number of processing and frac facilities online during the year. And even on the volumes -- on the growing volumes, those will provide additional fees. So we'll not just get the volume growth, but we'll get additional fees for additional servicing.","James E. Scheel","To add to that, that's a great point, Don, is we'll be bringing on a number of facilities around the OVM very quickly. We've -- we're already starting the pre-commissioning of these assets that include the stabilizer. That'll provide a much larger netback for our producers around their -- around their stabilized condensates. The deethanizer, I want to add, that's going to be a great asset for our customers. Again, we've had some restrictions in the ability to get product into the interstate pipelines because of ethane content over the course of the last couple of months. With the deethanizer online, that will no longer be an issue. It will allow basically unfettered flow out of the assets into the interstates. And then as we bring on additional capacity on the West Side of the system with the 24-inch line coming in, we're excited about the ability to fill up our cryos and continue the execution of building more cryos at the Oak Grove facilities as we move forward.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just shifting gears a little bit, just a broader question on maintenance spending. So this appears to be trending lower over the coming years despite kind of more projects being put into place, but we've also seen some of the operational problems that you referenced. So I guess, how should we think about all of this? Do you need to spend more going forward? Or efficiencies making up for it? Any color here would be very helpful.","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, sure, Abhi. I would just tell you that if you look over time, we've been at the -- I'm not sure if it's good or bad, but we've been in the lead in having more maintenance capital as a percentage of our EBITDA if you look back over the last 4 years or so, and that is really just driven by our focus on making absolutely sure that we're spending dollars wherever we can to improve safety and reliability on our systems. We'll continue to do that. I would just tell you that we got a lot of work out of the way, a lot of big, expensive work done out of the way in terms of -- in 2012, and that's for a number of reasons, some regulatory required, but as we inspected our lines, we went to the areas where we thought we would have the worst conditions on our systems, and as we've moved off of that group, obviously, we get to the newer and newer systems and the systems with less potential anomalies in it. And so our cost per mile of inspected pipe is coming down dramatically on us because we're getting into the better and better pipes. So we saw kind of a big run up there in '11 to '12, driven by things like the Clean Air Act and some pipeline inspection rules. And that was really kind of driving that. So not telling you that you should expect that to continue to go lower because we don't have that built into our plan. But so far, just the things that we've been hitting lately as we inspect our pipes, we've had less repairs required. So we basically have to forecast what we do expect to find with our in-line inspection tools. And our pipeline inspections, we basically have to estimate how much of that we'll have to repair, and that's been coming down over time, just again, because we're into the better -- some of our better-conditioned pipe.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, got it. And then one last quick one, if I may. So I guess one of the emerging debates in the industry is the viability of the export market for ethane, and you guys are in a unique position to kind of evaluate this. So could you maybe just your thoughts on this in terms of where the supply-demand balance is headed longer term in your view? How do you know -- how big of a market you think this could be? Any color there would be great.","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, Abhi. I'm going to ask John Dearborn. He is quite the student of that issue. And I'm going to ask him to offer his thoughts on that.","John R. Dearborn","Yes. Hi, Abhi. Thanks very much. It is an interesting idea. It think I'm a bit schizophrenic on the idea of this, so let's talk about both sides. From one perspective, you'd really like to see some better price signals out there on ethane so the necessary infrastructure gets built and you get supply reliability to the industry, to the petrochemical industry, which, of course, we're a participant of, but of course, that could mean ethane prices going up. So moving some ethane offshore I think begins to increase some of the demand, which perhaps begins to create a better balance there so that we do get the infrastructure that provides the supply reliability, which then assures on the demand side that people continue to invest capital. On a very positive note, though, that -- and I can't speak to the project that was recently announced. But on a very positive note to projects like this, I think there's also an opportunity because there are some shortages out there in the world for ethylene that we could export some ethylene from some of these ethane facilities. And I think that bodes well for the ethylene balance in North America, which would be a very positive dynamic for us with our investment at Geismar today. So I see a fair bit of positive there. Exactly how big the market is going to be for ethane export, that's a difficult challenge, a difficult question to answer right now. But I do see positive dynamics on the -- potentially on the ethylene site.","Operator","We'll go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a maybe a micro and a macro question. First, on the micro side with respect to Geismar. And Don, perhaps this is for you. With -- if you could just give us an update on when you see the next tranche of insurance recoveries coming? And I guess, perhaps an associated question is to the extent that what was in the first quarter adjusted EPS was a relatively large healthy number for Geismar, given that amount, do you see business interruption actually being sustained through the outage period? Or are we going to see a little bit of a gap between that ending and the plant coming back online?","Donald R. Chappel","Good morning, Carl. In terms of the next tranche of cash, I would expect we'll see some cash in the second quarter. We've made an application with the insurers for the next period of loss and it's going through their process. So I would expect we'll see some cash in the second quarter. I think we've disclosed that our business interruption insurance combined with our property damage insurance would substantially offset the down time. We think that's still the case. Exactly what that is will be dependent on the Geismar -- I'll call them pro forma margins, had Geismar has been up and running, and as well as our negotiations with the insurance companies. But I don't think anything has really changed. I think we're about where we were the last time we talked.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Fair enough. And then maybe macro question for Alan. And this might perhaps start getting into 2016 thoughts, but I just wanted to get a little bit more color on the ramifications perhaps of not doing Bluegrass. In the sense of do you think that for instance what had happened with Atlantic Sunrise, where you had to see that train hitting the market before people were willing to sign onto long-term contracts. Without Bluegrass, do see perhaps the industry needing to get hit first before we will see longer-term contracts? But ultimately, I'm trying to kind of get to are you more nervous than before perhaps of 2016 drilling activity? I know that's kind of an open-ended question, but any additional color there would help.","Alan S. Armstrong","Carl, great questions, as always. I would just tell you that, certainly, I think that there's a lot of people kind of counting on somebody else solving the problem as it relates to Bluegrass. And frankly, we're not going to be the ones to do that for the whole industry without adequate contractual support. And -- but yet, we still believe that something needs to get done. We're very interested in seeing the very best project available to the market come forward and get subscribed, and whether it's Bluegrass or whether it's a combination of other projects, we're not all that jealous of the opportunity, frankly, just because we have so many other great investment opportunities, and very well contracted opportunities. But we certainly think that something -- a solution does need to get resolved. Used an interesting term there to say that the train that we would have to hit out here. And I would just tell you that, that is going to be issue is people are going to understand in the not-too-distant future that railing all of this product out of the area is just not going to be a sustainable solution. But I think that's kind of what's got the market thinking it can continue to ignore the longer-term issue at this point.","So we're going to remain very engaged in the subject for both our own project and for other potential projects that might come along. And we'll certainly stand by, ready with Bluegrass for the industry, if it becomes adequately supported by contract.","You are correct. I do see this a little bit like Atlantic Access, where the market just wasn't quite ready for it and just didn't feel the pain quite enough yet. And I do think that as we get into this summer and into next winter, when a lot of this new production and these -- starts to ramp up. As for our forecast, our forecast that we see through Access and our forecast that we see through Blue Racer, we see a lot of liquids coming into the market and we're certainly hopeful that we can get a project supported that will not deter drilling in 2016 because this is some tremendous resource out here. And we're going to have to work as an industry to come up with the right market access, and we certainly look forward to being a part of that.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. And then just to sort of paraphrase back, though. You're thinking that with the supply models that you all are seeing, that we could in fact see that pain as early as next winter?","Alan S. Armstrong","I'd -- yes, if you look at the ramp-up in volumes that we're expecting, I think we will see some pretty big improvement in volumes.","Operator","We'll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I noticed last quarter that your ownership in Caiman Energy II had moved higher, and this quarter's data book confirmed an incremental 11%, it looked. Can you talk about who sold and was management included? Also, can you discuss how the exit plans of the private equity guys work? Do you have the right of first refusal and then it goes to Dominion and then any third parties?","Donald R. Chappel","Christine, this is Don Chappel. We had an option in our Caiman II deal to increase our ownership by funding a proportion of the amount of the capital investments. So we chose to act. We had a good look at the -- how the business was developing. We liked what we saw, so we exercised our option to invest a greater amount than our partners and increase our ownership accordingly. So we did that. In terms of the exit, we have a right of first offer on the sale, so we'll see what the sellers choose to do.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. We noticed some of the majors receiving permits in Marshall and Wetzel Counties in first quarter, the very end of fourth quarter. But I was unable to tell if they was Utica or Marcellus. Can you provide any insight into any updates on their plans to develop the acreage? Also, one of the majors also had an impressive well in Utica in Marshall County. Can you talk about what that may mean for you on a near-term and longer-term basis if the play is as great as IP rates could suggest?","James E. Scheel","Sure. This is Jim Scheel. I'll let the majors speak for themselves as far as any specifics related to their forecasts. But I will say, generically, we've had a number of folks in our offices talking about the additional drilling specifically around the Utica dry. I would say there's an upside opportunity for us at OVM to be gathering some of that Utica dry gas into our system, gathering that for them. We have some extra capacity at the plants today, so that wouldn't impact our liquids volumes to provide us with some near-term additional opportunity. Right now that's not baked into our plans, but I think what you'll see is, as folks are delineating that dry side, you'll see more and more permits issued, so they get a better feel for what they have in that particular area.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then I noticed you've started to kind of put Pacific Connector in your slides. It's looking like the probability of Jordan Cove, its moving forward, is getting higher. And something that I thought was interesting was that we've seen some pipeline projects for other LNG facilities contingent on the LNG projects receiving FERC approval and not necessarily FID. For you, can you discuss a little bit what has to happen for you guys for it to move out from under the potential project umbrella and into development?","Allison G. Bridges","Yes, certainly. This is Allison Bridges. Yes, we are very excited for all of the progress that we are seeing on Jordan Cove and Pacific Connector. We have nonbinding agreements with shippers, so that would really exceed the total capacity. Before we would be ready to, I guess, move to approval for that project, we will be looking to turn those nonbinding agreements into binding agreements. We are hopeful that we will get the FERC certificate, perhaps by the end of this year or early next year. So that is another major milestone. I will say, with respect to the FERC certificate, the route that we have on Pacific Connector was actually previously approved by FERC, so we think it's just a matter of timing on that.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, I wasn't actually talking about FERC approval for the pipeline. I was talking about the FERC approval for the LNG project. But it sounds like, for you, it's just -- it has nothing to do with the LNG projects you're seeing, FERC or FID. It's, the customers just have to contract with you.","Allison G. Bridges","No. I mean, we certainly are working jointly and expect the same FERC approval timing and customer commitments for both Jordan Cove and Pacific Connector.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then last question for me, the Gulf Trace project, is that like just Zone 3 max rates? Is that how we should think about that?","Alan S. Armstrong","Rory, you want to take that please?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes. This is -- Christine, this is Rory Miller. That project is a -- it's a negotiated rate. It will eventually be rolled in, and so it's a little bit lower than what the postage stamp rate would be, and therefore, it's required to be rolled in.","Operator","We'll hear next from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to talk about use of cash a bit at WMB now that you've canceled Bluegrass. How should we think about the disposition there, whether it's the path of the dividends? Maybe it's M&A or obviously, you do have a big backlog of projects that you're developing potentially up at WMB. Can you talk us through that?","Donald R. Chappel","Ted, this is Don. Yes, one, we do have -- obviously, we have dividend, but in terms of the excess cash flow at Williams, beyond the 20% annual dividend increase that we've guided to, we do have some projects that are in development that we've highlighted here. And that cash is earmarked for those projects. Beyond that, we'll have a high-class problem of choosing whether or not we have any additional projects or if we just roll that cash into an even greater dividend. So we're moving more and more to a, call it, pure-play HoldCo model. And as WPZ financial capacity grows, we would expect more of the organic growth to be funded at WPZ and less so at Williams. And again, so moving more and more the a GP HoldCo, where Williams can put all -- substantially all of our excess cash flow into the business.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then if I can ask about Geismar 2, can you just give us some more color about what that exactly is? Is it an expansion? Is it a greenfield? How big is it? What's the capital? Just maybe some rough numbers there.","John R. Dearborn","Yes. Thanks for the question. Geismar 2 is we're out in the market right now trying to assess the market's interest in participating in an investment there. Our concept, and we're going to be talking more about this at the analyst meeting coming up or analyst day coming up in New York, but our concept there is to build a cost advantage, large cracker. It would be greenfield. We have expanded Geismar, if I could call it Geismar 1 for the moment, about as big as Geismar 1 could be expanded. I think we're about done with expansion save for perhaps some incrementals there. So that's a concept between -- about what we're thinking on this -- another investment on the river in ethylene.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But you would do it as a JV? Or you would do it, a standalone by yourself?","John R. Dearborn","Yes, the current concept is we're considering a JV with perhaps 1, at most 2, other partners that would build derivative capacity alongside it, so creating new demand. And then we would take our volumes and sell them into the market on a fee-for-service basis.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I see, okay. And then if I can just ask one more. As we're thinking about Transco and the ultimate -- and the growth in the Marcellus, even in the Northeast, as you look out 3 to 5 years here and the ability to do backhauls down to the Southeast, what do you think is the ultimate capacity that Transco could move in that direction? And then maybe can you talk about the incremental capital you might need to spend to achieve that throughput?","Alan S. Armstrong","Rory, could you take that please?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes, I'd be happy to take that. With -- if you think over the last couple of years, we've had a series of projects that were primarily designed to move Marcellus supply into the traditional market areas on Transco. The first ones are Northeast Supply Link. The second one was Leidy Southeast. The third was Constitution. Now that's not impacting the Transco system at all, but it's certainly pulling reserves out of that area. And then the fourth project is Atlantic Sunrise. And all of those projects -- or at least the 3 Transco projects, had the feature of taking advantage of some of the latent capacity or latent capabilities that existed on the system to be backhauled or to be designed to change the flow from north to south. As we start moving beyond the volumes that we currently have contracted, the costs do start to go up. And so I think the big question there is where's the market for service for producers in that area to get to an end user that they can contract with, take their gas. And the market's going to have to be higher than, say, the market that was established for Atlantic Access for us to do more. However, if you start looking at new greenfield projects out of the area, you'll be looking at rates far in excess of the rates that we contracted for in Atlantic Sunrise. So I know that's a little bit unclear on -- as to the question you asked, but on a per-unit basis, the capital required is going to be higher on future projects than it has been on the projects in the past.","Operator","We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","With regards to Bluegrass, do you anticipate that this could be a project you would revisit within a year or 2? And I guess, do you have the contracts set up with Boardwalk to enable you to do this. Especially on, I guess, their ability to, I guess repurpose part of their pipeline?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, certainly, we have a great relationship with Boardwalk, and I would tell you that we're working to make sure that if there is a project there that makes sense, we're -- we got the ability to move forward with the project. And at the same time, Boardwalk's got the rights -- under certain conditions, has the rights to utilize that capacity for gas if they see a demand or a higher value in that direction after a certain period of time here. And so I think we've struck the right balance between us in terms of how to move forward on the project. And so I think it's really kind of a matter of time. I think for the meantime, I think there is plenty of alternative uses or alternative ways to move gas south and quite a bit of capacity to do that on various lines, including the existing -- 2 other existing Texas gas lines that would still be in gas service. So -- or on Boardwalk's system. So I would leave that to Boardwalk to answer a little more -- in a little more fine manner. But from our vantage point, we've struck the right balance that allows us to keep Bluegrass on the table and also, under certain conditions, allows them to move forward with something that makes sense for Boardwalk.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess, any estimate on the potential financial impact of the Opal incident?","Donald R. Chappel","Sharon, this is Don. We expect a $10 million impact on property damage with the excess property damage covered by insurance. We expect the -- I'll call it the business interruption loss to be very modest, particularly given that we already have 2 of the plants back up in operation, and we're hopeful that we can bring the other 2 undamaged plants into operation in the not-too-distant future. So expect $10 million in property damage and a very modest loss related to the downtime.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And any update on the regulatory front for Constitution and perhaps the timing of that project?","Alan S. Armstrong","Rory, you want to take that?","Rory Lee Miller","Sure. Yes, on Constitution, we have started getting into some of the typical project milestones. The FERC issued a favorable draft environmental impact statement back on February 12, and they'd asked for comments by April 7. A lot of parties were asking to get that date extended. The FERC did not do that and held fast with their schedule, and we appreciated that. I would say, in general, that the FERC has been very workmanlike in terms of laying out a plan and sticking to it. So we're very satisfied with what the FERC has been doing so far. They've been trying to, I think, do their part in terms of helping us get the projects built. Right now we're working with FERC and the New York DEC in a coordinated fashion to try to get any of the remaining questions answered and the details checked off with the hope that we're going to get a final decision sometime later this year. But it is part of a process, and I'd say it's moving well. But at the end of the day, there's probably more things that are uncontrollable in terms of going through the regulatory process than there are in terms of doing just the actual physical construction. In terms of in-service date, I think right now I'd say that what we've guided so far is -- those are still good assumptions.","Operator","We'll hear next from ISI Group, Timm Schneider.","Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I just had a follow-up question on the maintenance CapEx. Obviously, it was $36 million. In Q1, you addressed so many weather issues. But if I go off your full year guidance of $340 million, does that kind of imply -- I just want to get the arithmetic right, that this actually jumps to $100 million over the next 3 quarters?","Alan S. Armstrong","It actually -- if you look at our pattern of spending on that, Timm, you'd see that second quarter is always kind of our highest because we've got a lot of work going on, kind of winding up, waiting for a thaw out. And so I would say, generally, you'll see our heaviest spending on maintenance capital in the second quarter followed by fairly high third quarter, and then it tends to taper off in the fourth quarter because winter starts to impact our ability to get work done there again. So I think if you look back to our historical patterns, that's what you should expect.","Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","But there's no change at this point to that $340 million?","Alan S. Armstrong","That's -- that is correct.","Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then next question, on OVM, can you just kind of give us a sense of what utilization rate these assets were running at in the first quarter and what is kind of implied to get to your 2014 guidance?","James E. Scheel","Well, OVM was running, during the first quarter of this year. We -- let me look at this real quick. We were running at about 271 a day. We obviously have a lot more capacity coming online than that. I'm really not focused on the capacity issue right now. We can take everything that customers can bring to us. We're anticipating having that growing to over 400 by the end of the year. What I'm the most focused on as it relates to capacity really are those issues related to the new assets coming online this year. That will help us both from increasing our fee-based revenue to also maximizing our customer netbacks. And so as you can see the second and third quarter come online with those incremental assets, that's what we'll be really focusing on. And then we'll be taking all the gas that the customers can produce out of OVM.","Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And last question for me is on Atlantic Sunrise, is there any read-through on the regulatory front that you guys have picked up from Constitution versus that? Or is it just a completely different ballgame because it's more looping and just compression?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, Timm, I'll take that. First of all, I think one of the major differences is we're dealing primarily with a big chunk of that, will be through the state of Pennsylvania. And I would tell you the state of Pennsylvania has been very businesslike and approached things in a fashion that's very cooperative. And so I think that's probably one of the biggest differences frankly. It is not all along existing right of way, though, just to be clear. There is some greenfield route coming south of the Leidy diamond, if you will, or the Leidy lateral. Where it ties back into our main line is a greenfield. And so we certainly will have routing issues to deal with there that we don't get to enjoy along with looping our existing lines. So there is some existing looping on there, but there's also some greenfield expansion there. But I would just say the area that we're going through does not deal with some of the New York DEC permitting issues that we're facing on Constitution.","Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","And actually, I have one more quick one. In the slide deck, you moved the opportunity set you outlined with PEMEX in the Atlantic-Gulf segment from 2019 to kind of 2017. And I was just wondering if you could talk about those opportunities in a bit more detail.","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. That is gaining some steam I would say. I think PEMEX is very focused on developing those deepwater reserves in a very timely manner for a number of reasons I think. I think their elections are in 2018, and I think they certainly want to show that. But I would remind you there that, that 2017 is actually 2017 plus, so not as big a change that we were intending to indicate there. But I would say, at the same time while you ask the question, that they are going to try the accelerate that as much as possible, and that's why a project like or system like Gulfstar, with our existing pipelines in the area and our capabilities, is really important to that in terms of speed to the market. So we're very excited to be positioned well for that opportunity.","Operator","We'll hear next from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","On WPZ and your discussion of not issuing any equity in 2015 and minimal equity in 2014, can you talk about how far you're willing to lever up at WPZ in terms of debt to EBITDA?","Donald R. Chappel","Now Becca, this is Don. That implies, call that, up to a 4x debt-to-equity -- excuse me, debt-to-EBITDA ratio, so again, well within the BBB investment-grade band that WPZ enjoys. So really nothing in terms of levering up. It's just really the cash flows are growing at such a rapid rate that it creates substantial additional debt capacity.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And does that -- can we translate that over to WMB? And can you discuss your willingness to go non-investment grades there?","Donald R. Chappel","I think our position is that this management team and the board chosen to maintain investment grade at Williams, and that's where we're at. But having said that, we'll certainly always be open to looking at what kind of value we can create and balance that with risk. But again, the management team and the board have chosen investment grade at both WPZ and Williams. So it mitigates some risk during more challenging financial times, and puts Williams in a more opportunistic position during challenging financial times. And while things are rolling pretty nicely in the capital markets, we know that, on a pretty regular basis, the high-yield market does shut down. So that's the advantage that having both WPZ and Williams at investment grade provides us.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then last question is on -- once again on the Northeast volumes and your guidance for the year. The $195 million of EBIT for the year, it's -- should we start to see a material ramp-up in the second quarter? Or is this going to be very much a back-end loaded kind of thing?","James E. Scheel","Again, this is Jim Scheel. As we look at the second and third quarters, just again to reemphasize, we'll be bringing on substantial new assets during the end of the second quarter. That would be driving additional fee-based revenue. We do see a pretty significant ramp-up during the second -- or during the third and fourth quarter. I've mentioned earlier, I think, in our package that we've provided, we're showing an average of about $335 million a day for OVM. I think that will be a little bit short of that as far as the yearly average goes. Right now we're anticipating about $327 million but ending the year at a much higher rate. So in excess of the $400 million that we're showing there is our current thoughts around that. So yes, we do have a pretty significant ramp-up. And I think that's in line with what you see from others, whether that be ACMP or Blue Racer also showing pretty significant volume growth, as producers take advantage of this gas environment we're in today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bradley Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just want to stay on the Northeast and maybe push a little bit harder on Timm's question, which was related to the utilization rate. Just trying to tie together the kind of disparate commentary that you hear from the upstream and your midstream peers in the Marcellus. We're hearing some midstream guys talk about utilization rates for processing assets in the Marcellus that are kind of in the 60% to 70% range. But at the same time, we're hearing upstream guys continue to mention that they do have wells that are waiting on pipe or stuck behind infrastructure constraints. And so maybe just to kind of go back to that question of utilization rate and just to make sure I understand Jim's comments, talking about the $327 million a day average moving to above $400 million by the end of the year. Am I right in thinking that that's -- you've got the $500 million at Fort Beeler, another $200 million at Oak Grove by the end of this year and I should kind of think of utilization in excess of $400 million across that asset base?","James E. Scheel","That's right. Not to -- again, I haven't really focused on the ultimate capacity of the system. We're working to fill up what we've got today. But as we look at Oak Grove coming online with TXP-1, we've got the ability to add significantly more cryo capacity at that facility. We can have up to 10 cryos at that facility. We have a great piece of flat land. We'll talk to you a little bit more about this at analyst day. But when I think of the total capacity for the OVM system, were really in excess of 2 Bcf a day. So it's really -- we will be able now, with these foundational assets, to stay ahead of our customers. And so as we see their drilling profiles coming online, we'll be adding additional infrastructure if necessary. It's not going to be near as much pipe. We'll be connecting to the CRPs, making sure that we have the processing and the compression in place in order to meet their needs. And what is so nice now is where we have struggled in the past around some of those challenges, as we've come into 2014, we're well positioned to do that. Customers have recognized the increased reliability and our ability to get their gas to market. So we will build to meet our customers' needs, and we can meet all of the needs that they have today through our assets as we bring on the stabilization, the deethanizer. The ethane line, the additional 24-inch line on the West side and then TXP-1 at Oak Grove, we've got a great story of growth to tell and the ability to meet the customer needs.","Alan S. Armstrong","So Brad, just to add a little color. That's a great job by Jim kind of describing the situation out there. But it is not as simple as just do I have processing capacity out there. It depends on do you have the trunk line laterals to be able to reach out and get the gas. Do you have the air permit requirements to set compression to pick up the gas? Do you have ethane, deethanization capacity to be able to not get constrained into the interstates and backup gas that way? And so it's a tremendous amount of planning required between the producers and the midstream companies to not have underutilized capacity but to be able to be drilling where the capacity is. And I would highlight a perfect example of that great planning that goes on between us and Cabot in the Northeast. And if you looked at the utilization of our facilities there, you would see it very high, and you'd also see a limited constrain limited to their activity, limited constrained production on Cabot's part, again, relative to their tremendous growth profile that they're on. And so that's a great example of the kind of planning that can be done and that we'd certainly try to encourage with customers. And as Jim mentioned earlier, he's had -- that's starting to be recognized because he's had customers coming into his office wanting to sit down and make sure that they've got capacity for things like some of this burgeoning Utica drilling that is really starting to gain some attention right there in the footprint of OVM.","James E. Scheel","Yes. And I guess, and even a follow-up to Alan, as we talk about the Susquehanna Supply Hub or formerly ABA market area, up in the Northeast, our capacity will be going up towards the top end of that as we go through the course of 2014 into '15. And we're already thinking ahead of how do we continue to expand that capacity through compression in order to meet our customer needs across the board. Those investments in that incremental volume isn't in guidance but those discussions have already started taking place as working with our customers in order to facilitate all of their needs. And it is a complex issue. As Alan was pointing out, it's one that, I think, across the Northeast, we're getting much better at.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's great color. I appreciate those comments and the one -- I guess, the one final question, which kind of relates to the comments about the development of the dryer gas portion of the Utica. Do you think -- you mentioned that you have more of a 2 Bcf a day system in OVM, which I assume refers more to the aggregate gathering capacity. Do you think that you'll be more focused on gathering -- high-pressure gathering services as opposed to incremental processing once you're done with the Oak Grove build-out just due to the fact that the drill bit does seem to be moving towards the dryer areas around that kind of northern West Virginia area? And then just one final one, which is it looks like the kind of per Mcf margin implied by your guidance in Northeast G&P is significantly higher in the latter half of the year than it is currently. And is that just kind of the resulting higher fees that you're able to collect with stabilization, ethane and the addition of the trunk line that you've got laid out here in your presentation? And that's all.","James E. Scheel","Okay. Well, there are a lot of questions there. Let me start out and let's make sure I don't miss one. Starting out as it relates to the opportunities around the dry Utica, I would say we still continue to be very excited about the wet Marcellus, obviously. We've built a wet system at OVM. It's one where we have the ability to continue to expand our cryo facilities in order to meet that need and maximize netbacks for our customers. Yes, the incremental improvement in fee-based revenue will come through both increased gathering, as well as the additional services provided to our customers. So that will improve our overall revenue position for OVM. As it relates to the dry gas area, I think we're perfectly positioned to go, in the near term, put some of that dry gas into our existing system. Obviously, we won't -- we'll be running that through the plant where we won't be getting any liquids, but with surplus plant capacity right now, we have the ability to do that. And let -- and work with our customers in order to help them identify what they've got. And as far as the resource potential in the dry area, we're all very excited about that potential to the extent we need to have a duplicate dry gas system built because I believe, again, I believe a lot in the wet area. And to the extent where we continue to build out that, it would really be a separate dry gas system. As we think about putting in some of the 24-inch lines, well, there is the potential, I guess, to repurpose some of our lines. Those will be -- that would be on our planning horizon as we talk to the customers. Again, this all really comes back to making sure we're planning with our customers about what they need and when they need it. I think that dialogue is beginning to open up as they learn more about this. And because of our great competitive position in that marketplace, I think we're well positioned to meet any of those requirements as they evolve. Again, a big dry gas build-out though is not contemplated in any of the numbers that you're seeing here today. I don't know if that was every one of the questions, but I think it was.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","No, that's great. And the only other one was just am I right in thinking that margin per Mcf is set to increase in latter portion of the year in the Northeast?","James E. Scheel","Yes. Yes, it is because the margin will increase because of the additional services we're providing through OVM. In addition to that, we have some higher revenues coming from the recontracting around ABA.","Operator","We'll hear next from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Just one quick cleanup for me, and actually, it's probably for Don. And this is really just tied to NGL and pet chem. Lots of moving parts in the quarter with BI and the drop-down. But just wondering if you guys could quantify the DCF impact from the dropped assets for the period owned, and sort of how that compares to the guidance you gave us earlier in the year. I think you were looking for 130 to 160 on the full year and so just wondering how sort of initial 1 month of owned DCF sort of stacks up against that.","Donald R. Chappel","I think our initial guidance, Chris, contemplated 3 months of ownership of PZ. And as it turned out, there was 1 full month of ownership because the drop-down happened a couple of months later than what we expected when we put out that guidance in the first place. The good news, Williams enjoyed those earnings for January and February instead, and the -- yes, the 1 month was about $15 million to $20 million.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then you guys -- just quick follow-up on that. You guys had flagged some tie-in issues and third-party disruptions in 4Q up there. Just wondering if all that's resolved at this point.","John R. Dearborn","Yes. That is a great question now. And yes, we did through the first quarter, but we're tight-lined to Suncor up there. They did have some operating issues at the upgrader, which reduced our volumes approximately by about 20%. At the end of the quarter, all of those issues were resolved, and we're back to full volume. So looking forward, we can expect Canada to deliver at its full potential.","Operator","With no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong","Okay, well, great. Thank you, everybody, for joining us this morning. As you can tell, a lot of excitement about the quarter and the growth prospects that we have in front of us. And we'd just say we look forward to seeing you at analyst day and sharing a little more of that with you and particularly as we look further in beyond '15. So thanks again for joining us, and we're excited -- we very much look forward to seeing you at the upcoming analyst day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's call.

Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners.","Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And also, we have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Central; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","Over the past many months, we've taken many questions related to the merger between Williams and Energy Transfer. The focus of our call today is our first quarter results and business outlook, so we're not going to take questions on the pending merger or other related matters.","With respect to the pending merger, I will mention that the Williams' board is unanimously committed to enforcing its rights under the merger agreement entered into with ETE on September 28, 2015, and to delivering the benefits of the merger agreement to Williams' stockholders. Williams is committed to mailing the proxy statement, holding the stockholder vote and closing the transaction as soon as possible. As always, please feel free to contact our Investor Relations team for questions you may have, and thank you in advance for your cooperation on that.","There are lots of calls today, so we're planning on keeping our call to about an hour. If we miss any of your questions, feel free to follow-up with Investor Relations later on today. And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us. We do appreciate what a busy morning it is and so let's move right on to slide two here.","First of all, our first quarter 2016 results certainly underscore the strong fundamentals of our fee-based business model, and we're excited as Williams to play a critical role in getting abundant low-cost North American natural gas into the growing markets and delivering volume-driven growth to our stock and unit holders.","In fact, we're pleased to say that on an adjusted EBITDA at Williams for the first quarter was up 15% over last year and up 16% at WPZ. And this was despite a number of smaller non-cash expense items that totaled approximately $17 million that we did not adjust out of this calculation.","The WPZ DCF performance was up 14% to $739 million in the first quarter, giving us a coverage ratio of 1.02x at PZ, excluding the benefits of the IDR waiver.","This quarter is especially noteworthy as it marks the 10th consecutive quarter that we've delivered year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA, or its predecessor description, segment profit plus DD&A.","Throughout the business we've continued to aggressively manage our costs and align our work force with the realities of low commodity prices and reduced producer activity in the supply basins. And we made additional tough decisions at the end of the first quarter, which included reducing our overall work force by 10%.","But even with market headwinds, our focus on fee-based revenue has allowed us to product strong cash flow despite a 16-year low in NGL prices. And as we look forward, it is exciting to see all of the natural gas demand-based projects ramping up as they will be a major part of our growth going forward.","We expect continued growth from our portfolio of large-scale demand-driven projects and our fully contracted natural gas transmission business coming on in the balance of 2016, 2017 and 2018. And in this period towards then, we'll begin to pool on the supply basins that we are already so well-positioned in today.","Now, we've talked a lot at Williams about the unique position between prolific supply basins and the tremendous demand pool markets that we serve, especially along the Transco system, but we're not the only ones talking about it. In fact, SNL Financial published a story just this week and encapsulates the great position we're in. The headline is the Southeast's growing appetite for natural gas will change market structure. And that probably sounds familiar if you've been following Williams for a while.","And as this article points out, more than 50% of the supply in the Southeast currently comes from the Gulf, but that the Southeast will experience significant demand increases here in the near future and all the way through 2030 when a whopping 60% of the power generation will be fueled by natural gas. And if you look at the geography of this demand pool, it's hard to miss the fact that our Transco system runs through the heart of this area.","And to bring this tremendous market demand growth story back to the nearer term, we said at our Analyst Day presentation last year that we've already captured more than a third of the 22 Bcf per day of demand increases along the Transco corridor, forecasted between 2015 and 2025 by Wood Mac. And to continue meeting this demand, we've announced plans last year to increase the capacity on our Eastern interstate from 10.8 Bcf per day to more than 17 Bcf per day by the end of 2017, and that by 2017, we expect to double the capacity of the Transco system from its 2010 level.","So as you'll see when we discuss our projects in this presentation, Williams is strategically positioned like no other company in the natural gas sector to meet this tremendous demand pool and experience significant fee-based growth.","As we move on to discuss the quarterly performance in our operating areas, I want to remind everyone that this is the first quarter in which we've consolidated our legacy Access operations in the Marcellus and Utica into our overall reporting for the Northeast gathering and processing, and we've moved the remaining legacy Access areas into what we now call the Central Operating Area.","With that, let me highlight some of the drivers of our solid performance in each of the operating areas this quarter. First of all, once again, the Atlantic-Gulf is delivering strong results as we capture more and more demand fees for providing natural gas transmission capacity on the Atlantic-Gulf systems.","Adjusted EBITDA was up $64 million to $399 million over the first quarter of 2015. And this came from \u2013 really from two primary areas. First of all, we saw $28 million higher fee-based revenues from higher transportation revenues on Transco. And these were associated with various expansion projects that came on during 2015. And then, in another $28 million higher proportional EBITDA from our Discovery system and our Discovery system continues to benefit from the great successes that producers like Anadarko and Exxon have had in the Keathley Canyon area. And of course, that feeds into our large Keathley Canyon Connector system that we brought online in 2015 as well.","We'll touch on this a bit later, but you'll see that the hits keep coming for the Atlantic-Gulf in terms of successful permitting activity and bringing growth projects online. Additionally, the bulk of our growth for the balance of 2016 will come from the Atlantic-Gulf, with three new projects coming online over the next three months.","Our Central Operating Area, which I mentioned now includes legacy Access operations outside of the Northeast, reported adjusted EBITDA of $226 million for the first quarter of 2016. And this was compared with a $218 million for the first quarter of 2015 as we repositioned those assets. Revenues were virtually flat year-over-year, while lower expenses drove the improvements. The $226 million represents 100% fee-based businesses with essential infrastructure in large scale natural gas basins in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma.","In the NGL & Petchem Services area, we reported an adjusted EBITDA of $57 million for the first quarter compared with $7 million for the first quarter of 2015. Although olefin margins started off very low in January and February, they really rebounded in the month of March, and as crude oil prices improved and many ethylene crackers began going offline for maintenance in late March and in April. So we continue to enjoy nice margins here in the second quarter.","The increase in the first quarter of 2015 adjusted EBITDA was due primarily to $60 million higher olefins margins at Geismar, with a full quarter of production compared to very intermittent production that we experienced in the first quarter of 2015. I would also note that the adjusted EBITDA in this segment for PZ included $16 million unfavorable foreign exchange activity in the period as well.","In the Northeast G&P, we reported an adjusted EBITDA of $219 million for the first quarter of 2016 and this compared with an adjusted EBITDA of $196 million in 2015. And these results improved primarily due to a $16 million increase in fee-based revenues driven by gathering volumes, primarily in the Utica, and $13 million higher proportional EBITDA from our equity method investments. And this was mostly due to our increased ownership in the Utica East Ohio system.","Price-related shut-ins averaged 900 MMcf a day for the quarter. This is always something people have a strong interest in, so we estimate we had about 900 MMcf a day. That was not 900 MMcf a day every day, but on average. We saw some worse days and some better days in that as producers turned production on and off responding to both load and prices. These shut-ins were seen across the Bradford County areas, the Susquehanna area and a significant revenue impact felt in the OVM area.","But I would like to speak to the fact that this really does represent a great growth opportunity for us without any additional capital spending, so the gas is there, the infrastructure is there. And as debottlenecking continues in this area, we'll see that cash flow come back on.","One thing to note is just recently we completed our New York loop that feeds into the Millennium Pipeline. So this was our segment previously referred to as the Laser Pipeline that we acquired and we did complete a loop. And, this, along with the compressor addition at our Dunbar Station, should add about 140 MMcf a day of incremental capacity this year that will provide for takeaway. There's a number of other small improvements like that going on as people debottleneck their takeaway opportunities out of this area.","In the West, our performance this quarter was stable by any measure as we've been focusing on cost control to offset the significant decline in unit NGL margins that fell from $0.34 per gallon in the first quarter of 2015 to $0.22 per gallon in the first quarter of 2016. Margins did improve dramatically at the very end of the quarter and we continue to enjoy much better margins here in the second quarter.","To be clear, our West group continues to post remarkably steady EBITDA despite a challenging environment for our producing customers in the Rockies and 16-year low NGL prices in the West. Overall, we think our commodity exposure represents significant upside as prices rebound. And the Rockies are very well positioned to respond to growing natural gas and ethane demand as well.","So let me move over to slide three now and talk about our growth projects. And certainly I'll start this off by noting there's been quite a bit of media coverage around the State of New York's denial of our 401 Water Quality Permit with the Constitution Pipeline. We obviously don't agree with the decision and believe that there was significant amount of politics involved that went into that decision. Some of the resulting media coverage certainly echoes that sentiment.","We work hard to do things right by the environment and we work hard to cooperate with regulators and land owners. And so we're always disappointed when those efforts where we really do try to do the right thing seem to be ignored. The Constitution partners are assessing the path forward and we're committed to building this critical piece of infrastructure.","It's certainly important to economic development and jobs in Upstate New York, and a reliable supply of natural gas is critical if New York is going to continue its transition from coal-fired power generation to the natural gas use. It's also critical if the entire New England region is to benefit from U.S. natural gas as it also transitions away from retired nuclear plants and coal-fired generation.","However, while the recent headline may have been about Constitution and the state permitting process in New York, we've been making significant progress on a number of projects during the period. First of all, the Transco Garden State project, we did get FERC approval for this 180 MMcf a day expansion that'll serve a local distribution group in New Jersey. Also, the New York Bay Project, FERC issued an environmental assessment for this 115 MMcf a day expansion. And that is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of 2017 as its in-service date.","Moving to the South then for a minute, the Transco Dalton project, which is a major expansion into some natural gas-fired power generation in Northern Georgia, the FERC issued an environmental assessment for 448 MMcf a day expansion, and that is also a 2017 in-service date.","On Northwest Pipeline, our Kalama Lateral, we did receive a FERC approval for a 320 MMcf a day project to serve a proposed methanol production facility in that area. And moving back to the South on Transco, the Hillabee Expansion, which is an expansion on our system that will serve the Sabal Trail pipeline to the south. That project was also approved and construction will begin on that soon.","In the Gulf East, we reached agreement with Shell and Nexen to provide deepwater gas gathering services to the Appomattox development. Really excited about that project and the team's done a great job of keeping that project very low risk to us and taking advantage of our rather expansive infrastructure in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. So great work by the team there and a great piece of business we'll pick up there that is very low risk, given the existing investments we already have there.","On the Canadian offgas processing, the Horizon offgas project was fully placed in service in March of 2016. And that project has continued to run very well and so congrats to the team on there for bringing that up online. I would note that despite the fires in the Fort McMurray area, and I'll just say we are doing everything we can as Williams to help out the community and our employees in that area from that tragedy, but I would say that the CNRL-Horizon plant remains online in that area.","Williams has a strong proven track record of permitting approvals and we continue to make significant progress across our entire portfolio of projects. One of the reasons we've been successful is that we've been able to work alongside governmental agencies and community partners to support environmental mitigation and cultural preservation where we have operations and are building projects.","And in fact, New York is no exception, where just last week Williams was awarded the Lucy G. Moses Preservation Award for our work to restore historic hangars at the Floyd Bennett Field on Long Island, which now houses metering and regulating facilities that are part of our Rockaway Lateral project. In fact, this award is the highest honor given for historic preservation in New York and provided a win-win solution for both Williams and the National Park Service, which has been trying for years to fund this restoration. So all-in-all, I think the list we've just reviewed demonstrates our continued strong execution on putting growth projects into service and let me touch on a few that are coming soon beyond that.","First of all, on Atlantic Sunrise, we're excited that Atlantic Sunrise is targeted to receive its draft EIS from the FERC this month. It's a project that's going to help unlock tremendous value in the Marcellus like never before to serve growing demand markets. And it's on track for receiving its state and federal permit and clearances. And in fact, really important note here, it has already received its 401 Water Quality Permit in Pennsylvania. So this project is \u2013 really, the pipeline part of this project is all in Pennsylvania and we have received the Water Quality Permit, same permit that has us held up on Constitution we've already received in Pennsylvania. So appreciate the great work by both our permitting teams on that as well as the cooperation we get with the State of Pennsylvania.","In a project we call Rock Springs, which is a new power plant that we're serving, that construction is going to be complete late this month and commissioning will happen very soon after that. This will be in service \u2013 placed into service because of the customers' needs being on August 1 of 2016. So our construction on this project is actually significantly ahead of schedule of the planned ISD. So congrats to our team on that project and that is another significant power plant load that we've picked up there in the Maryland area.","Kodiak tieback, this is the fourth third-party tieback to the Devil's Tower platform and it did achieve its first oil on schedule in the first quarter of 2016. However, due to some higher pressures in the reservoir, they've currently \u2013 the producer has shut that in to accommodate putting in some more robust production facilities to handle this impressive reservoir, and we expect that to restart \u2013 or that restart to expect here in late May.","On the Gunflint tieback, a really large important project for us, and we expect first Gulfstar One \u2013 this first Gulfstar One tieback to commission in June. The work is actually going on as we speak there during the month of May and so we'll be turning that back over to the producers here in June for commissioning. This is going to contribute significant cash flow growth as this big tieback for Gulfstar comes online.","So with that, let's move on to slide four. Our pathway to growth in our fee-based cash flows is very clear as it is dependent upon a large number of already contracted large-scale projects serving the growing market for natural gas. For 2016, the major projects are already largely constructed, with final commissioning activities occurring here in the second quarter, as I just mentioned.","And so, just looking at the changes here from 2015 to 2016, first of all, we're going to get the benefit of the full year contribution for projects that came on during 2015. You see that list on this slide. We also then have the Rock Springs project that I just mentioned, Gunflint, Kodiak and the CNRL-Horizon project, which is already online, contributing here into 2016 as well.","In comparing 2016 to 2017, further growth's going to come from all these projects being on for a full year, plus the Dalton Project, which is the very large expansion in the Northern Georgia; the Hillabee Project that serves Sabal Trail; the Gulf Trace Project, which is under construction right now; and as well as various G&P expansions, particularly in the Northeast.","As we look into 2018 versus 2017, you would see the full year contribution of those projects we just mentioned as well as partial contribution from the projects listed here. And probably in 2018, we would expect as the pool comes from some of these large projects that would come on in 2017 like Atlantic Sunrise, we would then expect large pool to start to occur in our supply basin. So really excited to see that area that we've worked so hard to position ourselves really come alive into 2018, as the natural gas demand starts to affect those areas.","Beyond 2018, we certainly would have a long number of projects that we're continuing to develop. And you can see some of these here that are already fully contracted; the Gulf Connector, a project to increase \u2013 sorry, the Gulf Connector, which is an LNG project, and then another project to increase reliable service in the New York City area that we're really excited about and we'll have more news on that in the not-too-distant future, and then our Hillabee phase two.","Moving on to slide five, going to sum things up today. Our first quarter results really demonstrate the resilience of our strategic focus on natural gas. Approximately 93% of the WPZ's gross margin year to date is coming from fee-based revenues and we expect that number to continue to increase. Significant new assets are supporting strong cash flow growth.","And while investments in our growth continue across all these areas that we've mentioned today, we certainly are continuing to see growth in the Atlantic-Gulf segment via the Transco expansion and sequential growth in the Marcellus and Utica volumes, which are constrained by market access, but again, we're ready to drive huge growth there because we've already invested in all the major infrastructure in that area. So you should expect to see less and less capital investment in that area, but poised for growth as the demand projects begin to unlock the power of that basin.","So once again I'd like to make a specific point about the connections between Transco and the Northeast. Everyone familiar with natural gas knows that Transco has always delivered gas from the South to the North, but that to really unlock the vast supplies in the Northeast, its flow will have to be reversed in many areas.","And this is a point made in the SNL article that I mentioned earlier. Reversing this flow is exactly what we did in 2015 with the Leidy Southeast expansion and particularly at our Transco Station 180. It's exactly what we're doing today and it's exactly what our growth projects will continue to exploit over the next few years. And as these projects unlock the tremendous value of America's natural gas resources, they're going to continue to drive volume-driven growth for Williams and our investors.","So let me wrap up here by saying that Williams is the best-positioned natural gas focused company in terms of our strategic balance. Our strategic position between the demand pool business and our significantly advantaged presence in key supply basins will drive continued growth and deliver solid returns despite swings in markets and commodity prices.","We've seen the success of our strategy reflected quarter after quarter. And with the significant growth projects we have coming down the pike, we expect to stay on this very positive trajectory as this clean and abundant resource continues to grow our market share both here at home and abroad.","So as we move to questions now, I just like to ask you to keep your questions focused on our first quarter 2016 results. We know there's a lot of interest in other topics, but that's what we're prepared to talk about today, so we'd appreciate if you'd keep your questions focused on that.","And so, operator, if we could move on to questions, please?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Just keeping my questions focused on Williams as it stands, your leverage reduction plans you've talked about in the past, asset sales was something that's mentioned. I was wondering if you can talk about what other options are on the table. Some of your peers executed a dividend cut. Has the board considered a temporary cut in WMB's dividend policy to accelerate deleveraging? I was just sort of wondering what paths you're considering in terms of moving forward with that.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Shneur, this is Don Chappel. Good morning. Great question. I think our comments are consistent with our comments from last quarter. Again, we're very much focused on asset monetizations to fill the gap. The boards will continue to look at dividend policy. We certainly understand all the levers. But at this point in terms of the financing needs, it's really primarily related to asset monetizations. And as well, I'll just comment that we remain committed to seek to maintain our investment grade ratings.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","And does the recent improvement in Chesapeake's credit outlook, or I guess the way the bonds have traded, does that ease some of the pressure on the leverage reduction?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","We don't see it that way. Again, I think we're focused on getting our leverage metrics or keeping our leverage metrics at investment grade levels.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then a follow-up, ethane has been a big question as of late. I was wondering if you can comment on how your Northeastern assets will benefit from, I guess, what's been emerging but nascent recovery in ethane? And I guess if you can also comment on the other side of your business about Geismar margins, could that potentially be a drag if it recovers, or would you expect ethylene to go up faster as well too?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great questions, Shneur. Let me hit the Northeast part of that question first. Our exposure in the Northeast is really as a service provider there for the most part and we are recovering ethane in there as a service to our customers there. So we enjoy throughput through both our processing and our ethane transportation systems up there and those came online I think in the end of the second quarter last year. So we continue to see improvement from that, but we really don't see too much in the way of margin exposure there, if you will. So most of our revenues there come from just the transport.","The area that we're obviously more exposed to is in the Rockies and where we do have rights to the ethane there. And I'll couple that now with the question on Geismar, which is, what if ethane goes up? That's the really nice thing about our portfolio is that we're rarely exposed from natural gas through to ethylene because we're actually long ethane in our portfolio. So if ethane prices go up, we're actually going to see more margin because our length in ethane is bigger if we're in full production and, of course, we would be if ethane prices went up. Our length in ethane is bigger than our short on the Geismar side, so it'd actually be a net positive to us if we were to see that occur.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Is it fair to conclude that if ethylene went up faster, then it would be a double benefit?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's right. So really, the spread that you should think about us really is natural gas to ethylene when you think about our full exposure.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then finally on Constitution, start date's been pushed out. It certainly sounds pretty political and so forth. What's your confidence in the new start date that was put forward? Do you really think that there's some options on the table that you can reroute or do something to address some of the concerns and get this project back on track?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm very proud of our team. I think we did everything right there. I think we took great measures to address all the issues that were raised with us and I think we have extremely strong evidence in that regard. And so I am hopeful that science and the facts will win out in that process. And that's certainly what we're counting on.","And so I think this is a little bit unprecedented from our perspective where we felt like we've dealt with all of the issues in a very meaningful manner and took very extreme measures to meet all the conditions that were requested of us. There are times when you get things requested of you and you just can't live with them because they might be too expensive or something, but that isn't the case here and we felt like we met all the conditions that were raised to us. So I think as the facts unfold on this, I think they're going to weigh in our favor. And so I think that's how we feel about it.","Now, it's early in the process and we're still weighing those odds certainly. But I would just tell you as a partnership and as the operator, I've really been very closely involved in watching what we've done and our team has worked extremely hard to do the right thing. We've re-routed and re-routed and we've made changes after changes after changes to meet the conditions. And as far as we were concerned, we had asked and asked and asked and been told over and over that we had met all the things that had been requested of us. So that sat with the Governor for right at a year after we had been told that we had met the conditions. And so, we'll see. I certainly wouldn't tell you that we know for certain what that looks like, but we do think the facts are very much in our camp on this.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","So there's a way to formally appeal and it not get so political? Or does it involve you having to make another change and then go through the same process again?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think the facts as we've laid them out, certainly if whatever the issues were raised to us such that we could address it, we'd be happy to. But I think at this point, it's really a matter of dealing with the facts that are in the permit application and taking that forward through the legal process. So that's the way we see it as we sit here today.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Shneur.","Operator","And we'll go next to Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Please go ahead.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, gentlemen.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Don, realizing that there's still a lot of moving pieces here, but with Constitution pushed out, presumably you have a decent line of sight on what 2016 growth capital looks like. Is the financing of 2016 and maybe even 2017 fully contingent on the outcome of the asset sales? And so is that a sequencing event, or is there any incremental color you can provide on debt versus equity needs incremental to those asset sales?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Right now, again, we're focused on asset monetization as the financing source above cash flows. And really, no plan at this time to issue equity in light of the still relatively weak equity prices and no plan to really issue debt other than revolver borrowings.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And any color on timing around those monetizations?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","We're proceeding to explore the opportunities and I would expect we'd have something to talk about this summer.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay, fair enough. Thank you. And then, Alan, on the head count trim, the 10% reduction, is there color available on the strategic impetus there? Clearly commodity prices are bad. But on the other side of the equation, demand actually is quite good. Your growth projects are still out there and arguably to be added to over the midterm. How does that workforce reduction play into the need to have folks on the ground in terms of incremental projects and that sort of...","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, thank you. That's an excellent question. And I would tell you that really the changes that came about \u2013 and I agree with your point that, despite commodity prices, that's not really necessarily that driver. But what we did see was we saw a dramatic slowdown in the growth in the Northeast. And so all of the efforts that we had around expanding our systems in the Northeast and to a lesser degree some in the Central area have slowed down because the number of rigs that have pulled back.","And if you know, we dramatically reduced our capital budget. And so, as we reduce that capital budget, it takes a whole lot less administrative effort to support all of those growth projects. And so that's really the areas that we trimmed, the growth in the supply basins. And frankly, we have been growing the company at a pretty big clip just with all of the activity going on, and $4 billion to $5 billion in growth capital a year. We have been growing the company very quickly.","So it was a good opportunity for us to sit back and reset our staffing appropriately to both the slower capital investment rate and less producer activity in those supply basins. And so that's what we've accomplished. But that's a great question. Thank you.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And thanks for that color. And then just somewhat related, more micro question, Atlantic Sunrise, the wording in the data book changed a little bit quarter-over-quarter, but it sounds like the permitting process is going at least as planned, if not slightly better. Anything to read into that?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, I don't think there's anything really to read into that. I think that we are excited about the way the permitting process is going and we just want to make sure that we remain conservative enough in that effort. And we certainly are encouraged by some things that we've very recently been able to work out in some of the permitting activities. And so we're encouraged by that, but want to make sure that we're being realistic about how the permitting activities go. But as we sit here today, I mean, at this very moment, feel very good about the way the permitting activities are proceeding right now.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","That's all for me.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. I just wanted to touch upon the asset sales again. Can you guys \u2013 have you guys determined if Gulfstream would have to be sold if the deal were to close due to FTC issues?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Christine, there's no settlement at this time with the FTC, so I really can't comment on that. So \u2013 but we are exploring multiple asset sales to determine the path forward. So we have a couple of options or a few options.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then just \u2013 you guys touched upon this, but it's been a while since I've focused on the West operations. So can you remind me how the G&P contracts are structured there? Is it essentially all POP or is there some keep-whole still there?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Let me have Walt Bennett answer that for you. Walt?","Walter J. Bennett - SVP-West & Management Committee, Northwest Pipeline LLC","Sure. There's a combination of contracts and the majority are definitely fee-based, but there are some keep-whole contracts and percent-of-liquids as well. And so I think the way to think about it would be about \u2013 there is some commodity exposure at about 30% of the contracts.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then the ethane rejection that's going on in that region, is it about 25,000 barrels per day? Am I in the ball park?","Walter J. Bennett - SVP-West & Management Committee, Northwest Pipeline LLC","Well, we are now actually \u2013 we are recovering small amounts of ethane, just doing a partial recovery. And the way to think about the \u2013 if we were in full recovery would be to essentially just double the non-ethane production.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So if you look at the operating data for the quarter, I mean we had somewhere around 245 million gallons of non-ethane production. And that's effectively about the same amount of ethane if we were in full ethane recovery, that's about the amount. So that can give you a pretty good picture on what our ethane rejection is.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, and then just another question on kind of Geismar. When I kind of think about the Petchem backdrop with the new crackers coming on and the feedstock cost of ethane rising, isn't it possible that ethylene prices won't rise and maybe not keep its historical correlation to crude? I mean have you guys thought about whether or not maybe this asset belongs better inside a more integrated Petchem with downstream capabilities?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Certainly, we think that the offsetting exposure we have on the ethane is valuable to the assets, but we have made some progress back in this quarter. We made some progress on going into some fee-based business, so some ethane plus agreements for that and we continue to work on that. So I was excited to see our team pull out across the line strategically. That's where we've been trying to get that asset to and the team made some good progress on that in this quarter.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. But nothing else to kind of give us? It's still early stages.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Yeah. I think \u2013 again, I think we're working hard to that. It seems reasonable from our perspective that if somebody's willing to go build one, a cracker, that we can sell them the capacity at a much lower cost. And so that's the basis of that marketing effort and we are having some success on that front.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","And we'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Morning, Craig.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Can you elaborate on the size or relative size thus far of the ethane plus contracting for Geismar 1 and maybe the timeframe you envision for this becoming more material to derisk that asset?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","John Dearborn, you want to take that question, please?","John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC","Sure. Thanks, Craig. At this point, we have a part of one of our contracts with a \u2013 one of our larger contracts with a customer that is now fee-based. And I would expect that you should see us moving in the market further toward the third quarter of this year. We might have some more to be able to tell you about perhaps some further progress on our initiative to sell more fee-based ethylene at Geismar.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. That'd be wonderful to hear progress on.","John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC","Yes.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And some updates on the latest in Northeast shut-ins and curtailed gas and expectations that maybe the FERC may finally step up and exercise some authority to get Constitution over the finish line?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Craig, I would just say that I suspect there will be a lot of people involved in trying to help resolve that. I think certainly, the Federal Government understands how critical that is. And I would even tell you the State of New York, the New York ISO and the power generators in New York and the businesses there understand how incredibly important that project is. So I think we'll have a lot of people weighing in on our side of that argument for obvious reasons.","And so I think that'll happen. But I would say despite that, there's a number of projects that are continuing to expand and bring incremental volumes out of the area. And as you heard us mention, our New York loop on the old Laser Pipeline, which is now complete, as well as some compressor addition that we're doing to increase the capacity on that, that'll add about 140 MMcf a day. And there's a couple of power plants in the region that will also work to add incremental load in the area. And so we think that kind of debottlenecking will continue to go on. And meanwhile, we're ready to really express strongly the facts on the Constitution piece, and hopefully, that'll win the day.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And last question, I understood that WPZ's a bit depressed and you've got asset sales that will fill any needs in 2016. Heading into 2017, do you see a longer line of potential monetizations? And any thoughts on the opening up of the capital markets recently for some of your stronger Midstream MLP peers, albeit at somewhat hefty issuance costs?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Craig, it's Don. Thanks for the question. I think it's a bit early to comment on 2017. Again, we have a lot of options and we'll continue to evaluate what the market offers us as the best possible option and act accordingly. So, again, we'll continue to focus on growing the business and keeping our credit metrics in line and, again, look for the best opportunities as we go through this 2016 period.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. You talked about the 10% head count reduction. Just wondering if you can maybe quantify the potential savings from your cost reduction efforts and when you expect to realize the full benefit?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Sharon. First of all, as we mentioned, we made that cut right at the very end of the first quarter. And that's about \u2013 our head count prior to that was around 6,900 in terms of our head count, so that's about 690 in terms of reduction. And that was heavily weighted towards some of our E&C space as well as in our areas of overhead with a lighter reduction in our field operating force.","And so that is \u2013 you can think about that as \u2013 if you do the math on that, you can think about that as a little under $100 million of reduction, but we still are working to take that down further through some other activities and particularly on our supply chain side. And our team there's doing a fantastic job of continuing to bring in lower cost as we take advantage of a reduction in that space.","So, overall, we're excited about the ability to reduce, particularly in that supply chain area. And we certainly never like to go through any kind of work force reduction around here, but I would tell you that the team did a very nice job administering that and proud of the way the organization held its head high through a difficult time there.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","That's helpful. I guess looking at the gathering volumes in the Central segment, it looks like the volumes were relatively level sequentially after declining for most of 2015. Can you maybe provide some color on the relative performance of some of the regions in the segment?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry, is your question specifically on the Central?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Yes.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Yeah, on Central volumes.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Sure. Bob, you want to take that question?","Robert S. Purgason - Director","Yeah, Sharon. As you pointed out, we've had a good, stable first quarter. And we're still seeing some declines in the Barnett and the Mid-Continent, as you would expect and consistent with other activities. It's offset by Haynesville predominantly, but Eagle Ford's kind of holding in there strong, too.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. And any update in terms of negotiations with Chesapeake on the rates?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sharon, I'll take that. I would just tell you that we continue to work hard with them to look for win-win opportunities. And, again, we're pleased to get to do that with Chesapeake and consider them a very big and important customer. So we're always looking to find win-wins. We don't have anything specific to report on this quarter however.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just a last question on the 2016 CapEx guidance. Any change I guess in that level, given the progress of some of your key projects and maybe the delay in Constitution?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Sharon, really no change in our overall capital plan for 2016.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. This is more of just a modeling question. But in the NGL segment, looks like your operating costs jumped up a bit this quarter relative to the last two quarters, $94 million versus running around $71 million. I'm just wondering if that's the new run rate or were there anything sort of one-off items this quarter?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","John, can you take that, please?","John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC","There should not be any very unusual ongoing matters here in the first quarter. I guess the only thing I think of and I'm not sure the numbers you're referring to, I haven't looked back at the charts here, is whether this FX impact is in those numbers. That would be non-recurring into future periods.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would just add to that that we did have quite a bit of cost in our startup of our Horizon facility and the new Redwater facility that goes with that in the quarter. So, some of that step-up is from the startup of that new facility in Canada, the CNRL Horizon facility.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks. And then I guess for Don, can you just give us a number around the leverage metric you're really looking at post the asset sale? Is 4.5 times the bogey, or 5 times or 4 times, just where you're trying to get to? And then are the agencies going to give you any forward credit for some of maybe the bigger projects that you're working towards?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","I would say that we're working on ensuring that our leverage metrics, rating agency adjusted metrics are below 5 times and trending lower. And we do point out the sizeable investments we're making in projects will go into service in the future. And I think that's more a qualitative point with the agencies versus the primary metric that they look at.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then it was somewhat answered already, but any thought from the WMB side of things of providing support, whether it's IDR waivers or other things as you're in the higher capital spending portion here?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Yeah, I'll just comment that we're in the middle of a planned merger. And in light of that, we're not going to comment on those kinds of issues.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Good morning. Most of my questions have been hit, but I just wanted to expand on the Geismar question. So with the incremental cracking capacity coming online, don't you see pressure to ethylene margins going forward even though you have the gas to ethylene spread?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would just say there is a number of derivative projects coming on as well and there's been some major outages recently from a couple of big international plants where there were some unfortunate events at some large plants overseas. And so we do think that there is a lot of ethylene capacity coming on. We also think there's a lot of derivative capacity coming on with that as well. And the U.S. really is positioned to continue to grow in its market share on a worldwide basis.","And as well, something we're keeping our eyes on very closely is the ethylene export as the world continues to take advantage of the U.S.'s very low-cost natural gas-based olefins. And so we're keeping our eye on that and I think it's a reasonable question.","John, I don't know if you would add any color to what I just stated there?","John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC","Yeah, the only thing I would add there is I think it's important to recognize that we're in a turnaround season now that's going to be prolonged through the remainder of this year, which certainly is going to I think keep supply constricted a bit. The U.S. ethylene industry continues to produce at record levels each quarter and so we see it growing, but it's growing at a relatively slow rate.","And I guess I would also be expecting that, as we contemplate these plants coming on in the future, the world market for ethylene continues to grow at a reasonable pace. And so long as the U.S. remains able to export, which I think Alan just indicated it would be and we believe it would be, that these plants will likely feather-in more reasonably than you might expect. Big bumps of ethylene coming on, that could have deleterious effects on the market.","It will have some impact, but I do believe the plants will come on in a more feathered fashion over this next couple of year period.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would just follow that just to say that remember as you run that math, remember to look at our length of ethane because if you're correct that we have that much new ethylene coming on in the U.S., the ethane margin and our assets that handle ethane are going to enjoy that as well. So, as you look in your model and try to look at that model, you need to make sure you appreciate the length that we would have if ethane were to get soaked up by all that ethylene cracking.","John R. Dearborn - Senior VP-Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, Williams Partners GP LLC","And then add to that, Alan, some incremental pipeline of revenues we'd enjoy as well.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Got you. Got you. Thank you. My second question, if I could. With the emerging NGL fundamentals, how do you think about getting to downstream business? Before a couple years back you had the Blue Grass initiatives. As you see these fundamentals strengthen, is that something that you're thinking about potentially getting to again, say, a year from now?","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would just say we have so much on our plate right now taking care of the natural gas demand side of the situation that when we think we have such huge competitive advantages on that front that that's really where our focus is going to be for the time being. Now having said that, we do continue to build out some of our purity systems in the Gulf Coast where the Gulf Coast continues to take advantage of very low cost NGLs and the Petchem expansion going on in the Gulf Coast. And of course, that's been a long-term strategy of ours to be taking advantage of the need for logistics movement around the Petchem industry, and so we will enjoy that. But I don't see us looking at any very large scale investment opportunities in the space that you reference.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Great. That's it for me. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And we have ran out of time for today. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Well, thank you all very much. Appreciate all the great questions. As always, I know it's a busy day and so we're just very excited to be in the space we are on the natural gas front right now and are really seeing our strategy really starting to pay off for us. And appreciate your continued commitment to the company. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day."],"22658":["Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) 2013 Earnings Call February 20, 2014  9:30 AM ET","Executives","John Porter","Alan S.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Porter","Thank you, Dana. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.","In addition to Alan, we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas with us. Jim Scheel leads our Northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western area, Rory Miller leads the Atlantic Gulf area; and John Dearborn is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to any questions.","In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Thank you, John, and good morning. Let me welcome all of you who joined us today for our fourth quarter results. We'll also talk about our major developments and our outlook today. We do have a lot to cover today concerning items like Geismar, Gulfstar, Bluegrass, our Northeast volume growth and now our big exciting project, Atlantic Sunrise.","But before I turn to our fourth quarter results and our full year, let me provide a brief update on where we are with Corvex and Soroban. As you know, in December, Corvex and Soroban disclosed their interest and each having representation on the Williams' board. Since that time, we've been engaged in discussions with both Corvex and Soroban related to the company's strategic plan to drive continued value creation and, of course, we look forward to continuing those discussions with those parties. We do have a long track record here at Williams and, in fact, in recent years, have been a leader in taking advantage of transformational and structural opportunities that create value for our shareholders, and we continue to welcome input towards our goal of enhancing shareholder value for this great company. And so with that, let's turn to our fourth quarter results.","Before we get into the details of fourth quarter performance for WPZ, I'd like to remind you of our strategic focus to grow our exposure to fee-based revenues. We are accomplishing this by continuing to develop large-scale infrastructure that will be critical to connecting the fastest-growing supplies to the fastest-growing markets for natural gas and natural gas derivatives. And in fact, this train is just gaining steam as we saw an 8% increase year-over-year in fee-based revenues at WPZ, and we expect even faster growth into 2014 and '15.","In the fourth quarter, WPZ enjoyed this growth trend despite harsh winter weather conditions in the Rockies and, in fact, we had another record for DCF growth in the fourth quarter of $509 million, up 26% over the previous fourth quarter.","This strong performance exceeded our internal expectations in spite of about $43 million lower in NGL margins. One of the drivers for the better performance was lower costs and maintenance capital expenses.","About 1 year ago, we reorganized the company to enable a flatter management structure and better cost efficiencies by deploying our very best knowledge of things like asset integrity and procurement across our entire operations. And as you can see by analyzing our numbers, we've been able to drive the combination of our O&M and G&A expenses lower despite managing tremendous growth in our business. I want to be very clear that our lower maintenance cost in our maintenance CapEx area has been driven by better efficiencies and fewer required repairs, not lower standards of care across our facilities.","WMB also -- moving on to WMB, we also enjoyed an 8% increase year-over-year in the segment profit plus DD&A for the quarter, with Williams Partners carrying much of that increase. One disappointment for the fourth quarter was the financial performance for our WMB NGL & Petchem Services segment, primarily driven by Canada, where third-party outages dramatically impacted supplies available for Fort McMurray facility. But that project is up and running very well now and is now exceeding our expectations for both recoveries and volumes, as we really have that business up and running very smoothly now with the ethane recovery portion that we added in that business in the third and fourth quarter of last year.","So we look forward to that project becoming the driver for WPZ's results with the drop-down, and we expect that to be completed very soon here, actually, at the end of this month.","So of course, we appreciate the great work the team at ACMP is doing to grow their business in a steady and predictable manner, and of course, this also helped us outperform the year for the fourth quarter.","Moving on to the DCF growth and our expectations for growth looking into '14 and '15. We do continue to expect strong DCF growth, in fact, greater than 50% from 2013 to 2015. This extraordinary growth rate is on the backs of large capital investments that we've been making over the last couple of years, most of which -- a lot of which has been financed by equity, and our organization is very focused right now on executing this large capital program that is essential to this growth. We updated our commodity prices and our latest assumptions on all of our key projects for 2014. With the degree of volatility we've seen recently in commodity prices, there are a lot of different impacts in our guidance, but in summary, our guidance range is unchanged from the third quarter.","We have great visibility around the projects that we expect will drive this growth. We continue to hit key execution milestones that serve to substantially derisk these major projects, and I'll talk a little bit about that in some more detail in a few of our projects. Where we did update our guidance is for growth CapEx, where we have added some noteworthy changes, and we'll see that here on the next slide. And so you can see for the WPZ increasing CapEx, we've got initial spending on some new projects, so projects like Atlantic Sunrise and Dalton. And this higher spending reaffirms our belief in growth potential of our business both within and well beyond our guidance period.","2 of the new projects we've listed here, Atlantic Sunrise and Dalton are on our Transco system where we continue to see strong demand for our services, and really, I think in very positive way here, not just coming from the supply side but from the market and the demand side as well.","I expect you saw our news release this morning with some additional detail on Atlantic Sunrise, and we'll hit that topic here in a few minutes. Gunflint, which is mentioned here, is a deepwater tie-back to our new Gulfstar One facility, and our team on Gulfstar have done a terrific job of making some modifications onto the top sides there at Gulfstar to be able to accommodate the easy tie-back of Gunflint. So we're really excited about the way our team continue to execute on Gulfstar One. And WPZ will be adding CapEx for the new Redwater projects. So these are expansions at Redwater that will accommodate things like the CNRL Horizon volumes that will be coming in, and so we've added capital in there for that as well.","We're also incorporating $175 million higher capital spend for the Geismar expansion on higher costs that result in part from delay in the restart.","For WMB, specifically, you'll see that we have lowered our growth CapEx to reflect a shift in timing to mid- to late 2016 on the joint venture Bluegrass pipeline project to better match the needs of the market. We remain very excited about the Bluegrass pipeline project, and I continue to believe that it's the best solution available in the market. And what I can tell you in terms of where we are is that the activity that we continue to see and the input and discussions that we're having, there is -- there are a number of parties out there who share our view of the market and the attractiveness of the solution, and we are working to reach definitive agreements with all interested parties as we push that project forward.","Moving onto next slide here, on Atlantic Sunrise, just a little bit of update and just some brief information. We did issue a news release earlier today on the milestone that Transco executed firm contracts with 9 shippers or 100% of the 1.7 million dekatherms per day of firm transportation capacity. And so we're very excited to announce that very important project for Transco in that it not only serves as a great investment, but it really opens up a lot of supply availability for expanding markets as well. The project includes 15-year shipper commitments. Then the shippers are both producers, local distribution companies and power generators.","The project represents vital energy infrastructure designed to connect surging, new supplies of natural gas in the Marcellus producing region in, really, coming mostly from the northeastern Pennsylvania area with growing demand centers along the Atlantic Seaboard.","We expect to bring the Atlantic Sunrise into service in the second half of 2017 and of course, this assumes all necessary regulatory approvals are received in timely manner.","Moving onto our milestones and the key accomplishments and developments here on Slide 9. We did have a number of recent milestones in the fourth quarter and even into this year. We brought the Canadian ethane recovery project online as I mentioned earlier. The volumes in the fourth quarter for that were disappointing for a number of reasons, but primarily impacted by some third-party outages, both upstream and some difficulties delivering the project -- the product downstream. Those have all been worked out now, and we're enjoying, as I mentioned earlier, great volume growth now.","We're reaching important milestones on our Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar projects. We also are rapidly growing our northeast business. We saw a 63% increase in our gathering volumes from the fourth quarter of '13 to the fourth quarter of '12, and that compares very favorably, if you really look at the whole Marcellus volumes, which grew about 40% last year. So really, we're growing -- that says we're growing at a 50% higher rate than the broader Marcellus base is growing. So we're very excited about that. We did see our volumes reach an average of about 1.9 Bcf per day for the full year, and of course, our actual volumes are well above that now.","We touched on the impressive financial growth that we expect to see between '13 and '14. I would certainly say that's not without risk, and we've highlighted the largest of the growth drivers here for 2014 as we continue to push forward on these projects. Looking at 2015 and beyond, we're really starting to see the development of our growth, as some of our projects experience a full year of earnings and we bring these new projects online. So '15 is both the combination of a lot of the full year benefit of projects like Gulfstar and Keathley Canyon, which come on in the last half of the year going into '15, as well as some exciting new growth projects through '15 as well.","Beyond the guidance period, you'll really begin to see the effect of these major projects. They provide visibility to our continued WPZ DCF growth and support for Williams' continued strong dividend growth. Because we do have the luxury of so many projects that leverage off of our competitive advantages, we can be selective in pursuing only the best risk-adjusted return projects. So we're in a very envious position to be allocating capital to, really, the very best projects.","Moving on to Slide 10 here. A picture of different services we're providing for the Northeast, and here's our large scale strategy. It really comes together and plays out in this key growth area where we have operations and investments and opportunities across our various lines of our business. We're strategically positioned in one of the fastest-growing production areas. The biggest challenges in the Marcellus and the Utica are exactly the kinds of problems that our large scale infrastructure strategy is designed to solve. This is a great resource basin that needs great market access.","And what stands in our way? Well, as we've been pushing through these major projects, certainly, one of the key issues is the customer's ability to make major commitments up against very complex regulatory structures and the risks in their business. And certainly, the regulatory complexity that it's taking to get this large-scale infrastructure installed as well are barriers to growth. That's both an impediment, but it's also a great opportunity for a company like Williams that's very skilled at taking on these very large complex projects.","Atlantic Sunrise and Bluegrass are really big infrastructure solutions that we've been working on. And in the case Atlantic Sunrise, it took some chronic, very visible infrastructure constraints in the market to bring adequate shipper support and firm transportation contracts with long 15-year terms to the project. Consider that, in this example with Atlantic Sunrise, it takes more than $400 million in annual revenue each and every year over those 15 years, along with very strong credit support behind those, to underwrite a project to the side. That's a very big commitment to make in the face of these regulatory mazes, but as we mentioned earlier, the market has really recognized that it's going to have to invest and support these kinds of projects.","And so Atlantic Sunrise is one of the first major investments that's coming -- that connects increasing markets with the increasing supplies in the Marcellus area. Of course, it's on the backs of 3 smaller projects that we've been doing out of the area, but this is really a very large scale project that we're bringing forth. We certainly believe that the Bluegrass pipeline project will be the next chapter in how the stories plays out. But in the NGL segment of the market as the constraint in the supply sources become more evident and people look harder for really the right solution out of the basin and our discussions with our customers certainly indicate, that's where we're headed.","We expect to bring the Geismar plant back into service. Sorry, I'm moving to Slide 11 here. We expect the Geismar plant to be back in service in June this year. The delay in returning the plant to service and completing the expansion resulted from a variety of factors including the extended loss of utilities. So that's primarily things like steam, our electrical system, those were all damaged severely in the incident. And as a result, getting the project back up and running without those systems has proved to be very difficult and very complex.","Based on the current commodity price assumptions, we continue to expect that we are mostly covered on the financial effect of the incident with the exception of the 60-day period before the business interruption insurance kicked in during 2013 and the $13 million in cash deductibles that were primarily associated with the property damage.","Moving on to Slide 12 here. Talking about some exciting milestones here in our deepwater projects, and of course, that's included in our Atlantic Gulf segment. On Gulfstar One, we've now achieved an important milestone with the mooring process. So Gulfstar has now reached storm-safe status and the contingencies to cover risks related to weather and powerful eddy currents can be dramatically reduced. So one of the key issues is getting a spar like this set. When we set Devils Tower originally, we were faced with some pretty bad eddy currents in this area. And getting that facility moored is a major milestone for our team, and things have been going very smoothly in accelerating the schedule on Gulfstar. So very excited about the team's performance out here on Gulfstar.","And so we do expect our facilities to be in place for an on-time startup of production. Keep in mind that our production -- that a portion of our cash flows will be dependent on the startup of the production and of course, we will be doing everything we can to help to produce and bring production on as soon as possible. I'll remind you that on Gulfstar that Hess and Chevron's Tubular Bells prospect initially, and then as I mentioned earlier, later, outside the guidance period, Gulfstar -- sorry, Gun Flint would be tied back. We do expect production to commence in the third quarter of this year. On the Keathley Canyon project, the customers are Anadarko and Exxon, and we expect this work to be done well ahead of the production commencing in the fourth quarter of this year, and in fact, our deepwater line is now more than 80% laid.","Moving to the summary slide here on 13, which just tells you, we are very committed to the strategy with an intense focus for the long term on the natural gas supercycle. We are convinced more than ever that we're really in the sweet spot. We've positioned ourselves very well to create value in this environment. We are now getting some tailwinds from a lift in both NGL prices and gas prices, and these are exactly the kinds of signals that the producing community needs to see right now to continue to develop the resources that are out in front of us.","We're rapidly converting our business to a volume, fee-based business that is enduring, and we're putting in the kind of infrastructure that is difficult to replicate in the long term. We're very focused on this critical infrastructure and very well-contracted business is going to be here for the long haul due to its competitive advantages in the market.","That's hard work. It's a lot of risk, and it's a lot of grit on the part of our team to push through all of that, but that's exactly what we're going to stay focused on. And it's the stuff that in the long term, the market is going to have to have for a sustainable growth in natural gas and natural gas derivatives markets here in the U.S. I truly believe that there is no other company in this sector that enjoys the degree of visibility to growth that we enjoy both now and over the long period.","So with that, I thank you, very much for joining us, and we'll turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go first to Brad Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","First, a quick question about weather. Obviously, the price impact of this winter has been very good for gas and NGL markets. What impact, if any, do you expect to see as we move into Q1 in terms of freeze-offs or other operational issues as a result of weather either in the West or in the Northeast? And have we seen some of the buildout in the Northeast or some of the drilling activity slow as a result of some of the cold weather?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. Great, Brad. Thanks for the question. First of all, I'd like to commend our Western team and our Northeast team for some great operations despite some pretty difficult environments out West in the fourth quarter. Moving into the first quarter, where your question was targeted, I would say the West continues to do pretty well up against our norms -- we normally do have quite a bit of freeze-off. But I would tell you, they continue to perform very well up against the norms for the Rockies in the Western areas. San Juan Basin has actually had one of the better periods during this than we normally see quite a bit of reduction in production there. In the Northeast, I'm very thankful for the work our team's done up there. Key to reliability up on our system. I will tell you there's certainly been some freeze-up upstream on some of the producer's equipment and some of the volumes upstream of our facilities, but our facilities have remained very reliable. And really excited to see our team having pushed through some very challenging times of getting these facilities up to reliable standards. And so we have set some freeze-offs out there in the wet Marcellus area. But again it's not been on our systems, it's been upstream, and producers have been working quickly to overcome that.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And another question about a little bit more of the long-term outlook in the Northeast on your OVM systems specifically. There have been some really impressive dry gas well results just across the river in Ohio, and it appears that there is some potential prospectivity in Marshall and Wetzel for those very productive dry gas horizons. Are those -- is that kind of emerging play something that you've discussed with your OVM customers? With that dry gas production, if it does emerge, would that dryer gas maybe alleviate some of the operational issues that you've seen with some of the especially super-rich gas that you've had on the OVM system just by diluting some of the liquids content and providing you with maybe more of a dry gas blend stock for some of the ethane-rich gas you produce?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. Well, first of all, I would tell you there are several of our key producers that do have plans this year to test into both the Utica dry and the Upper Devonian. And while the Upper Devonian doesn't provide any relief, I hate to -- as a processing company, I hate to think about getting -- moving to dry gas as relief. But to your point, some of the big volumes that we've been seeing from Utica test in the dry area would certainly help provide some sweeping volumes and a more reasonable gas-to-liquid phase in our pipeline. So we're excited about that, and we certainly are working with the producers. I would tell you included in our capital is some expansions of our systems to be able to accommodate some of those higher volumes on the dry gas side.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great, and just one last one. On Constitution and Atlantic Sunrise. Constitution kind of stood out as the only Northeast pipe project to involve a significant laying of new build pipes, and Atlantic Sunrise, at least from the map you have provided, it appears as though that project would also involve some significant new pipe from kind of the Leidy Line down towards Station 190. And I guess, is there anything from the Constitution process that's maybe something that could be applied to the Atlantic Sunrise process? Or is it something where, as long as you're laying significant new build pipes, there will be some regulatory risks of delays and what have you?","Alan S. Armstrong","Great question. I would tell you that on Constitution, the real issue we're facing right now from a regulatory issue really relates to the New York DEC, not to the FERC. And so the nice thing about Sunrise is it does not go through the New York area. So we're not faced with that same regulatory issue. On the FERC side, I would just tell you, no, they are continuing to push through. You've saw the Constitution's draft EIS. So we're very thankful for the FERC continuing to try to do their part to accelerate these projects, and we continue to work well with them. And we certainly have some -- a lot of discussions, communications we need to do in New York to find the right answers and right solutions there as well.","Operator","We'll go next to Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","A couple of quick questions on Geismar. So you say, expect to be out of service until June. How firm is that date? And then how much extra out-of-pocket costs are there for each month you missed that? It seems like there, you only had, if I'm reading this right, $10 million of additional uninsured losses from delaying this, 2 the 3 months from April to June. Is that right?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. It's for 2 months. That's correct. Just a little over 2 months of delay, that's correct. And so to answer your question, right now, the mechanical completion is expected in the first part of May, and I would tell you there's obviously a lot of things to go right, but I'm very proud of the work that our team has done to really dig in some great detail to understand what the drivers of that are in the productivity and labor. And I think we've got a very studied perspective on that issue. Having said that, I would tell you the window is probably from the last week in May through the end of June as the expected window right now for that startup. And in terms of that cost, of course, if we were delayed beyond that, it's very dependent on ethane to ethylene spreads. But in a range, that's probably around $1.5 million to maybe up to $2 million a day of expected revenues we lose on that.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","And then one more. The $175 million more CapEx and the higher cost for Geismar, is it relating to repairs? Or are you getting a return on that increased capital spend?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. There are -- unfortunately, this isn't one that we'll get any return on. And I would just tell you, it's been driven by a lot of the complexities associated with the damage at the plant. So we've had, as I mentioned early, we would have to go in and wait on utilities being ready, the complexity of working in both the damaged-repaired areas, as well as getting the expansion that's just put a very crowded and complex stage there. So I would tell you that is one of the major drivers for us, but there certainly isn't, unfortunately, any incremental return to come to us from that investment.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Understood. And then moving to Bluegrass, Alan, you pushed it out, but you're still talking quite favorably on the project. And is your sense that producers are eventually going to be willing to sign up, but this is just a timing issue, and I guess, what is causing them to hold off on signing right now and still giving you confidence that there will be in the future?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. Steve, great question, and thanks. I will just tell you, if you look at what cost for a producer, the kind of commitment, if somebody's got 30,000 to 70,000 barrels a day of commitment, and you look at what that looks like on a roughly $0.30 a gallon by the time you pay for transport, frac and go to an export facility. That $0.30 a gallon, put that times 30,000 to 50,000 barrels a day and pile it up for 15 years, that's a very, very large commitment from many of the producers we're dealing with. And it's just taking time for them to get all their approvals and work through all of the issues and concerns that they have with that because it is a very, very large commitment, and if you do the math on that. And so I really think that's the practical issue we're dealing with. We have some very engaged customers. I think, as I mentioned, a lot of our costumers see this opportunity just like we do. That it is essential, and it's an essential piece of infrastructure, and I think some folks would just like to see some of the else get it built, and hopefully be on the coattails of that. But frankly, we're going to have to see an adequate amount of financial support before we push through with additional investment.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And I appreciate -- moving away from Bluegrass, and your comment about discussions with Soroban and Corvex. I want to know if you could just talk any discussions you have with respect to the Access's 50% GP interest held by GIP. Is it something that you would ultimately like to own at WMB? And is it something you're working towards ultimately?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I would just tell you -- we think the ACMP business is a great business. We think it would be a great complement to Williams in a lot of ways, both from a management team standpoint, as well as the structure and the contracts and the focus on natural gas. So it's very much in line with our strategy. But of course -- so I think fundamentally, the answer to your question is yes. We would like to look towards bringing in the synergies of combining those businesses, but there's another party involved. And that means there is a value trade to be added, and we'd have to make sure that the value trade really makes sense for our shareholders. And because we do have some many great investment opportunities in front of us right now, we have to keep that in balance as well. And so to answer your question, yes, we'd love to do it, but at the right price and at the right timing as well, because the bigger hurry we get in, the more extensive that likely becomes.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","One quick follow-up. Are there active -- would you describe as active discussions in that for this or not right now?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. I wouldn't describe there's being any active discussions. I would say we continue to study the opportunity from our own perspective. But I wouldn't suggest that there's any active discussions with GIP on that.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Final very quick one for me. Do you expect to have IDR waivers in 2014? I saw you didn't have them in the fourth quarter.","Alan S. Armstrong","No. We do not intend to have IDR waivers.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Abhi Rajendran with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of quick questions. You increased a lot of your assumptions on your commodity deck, but your outlook was largely unchanged. I guess, is this just a function of most of the commodity movements largely netting themselves out? Or are there some volume offsets? If you could provide some color on some of the puts and takes? That would be helpful.","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. Yes, really, it is very much an offset. So you'll see, of course, some higher NGL prices reflect the current market, and you'll see the slightly lower ethylene prices. And of course, all of that is up against the higher natural gas price. And so as I mentioned in my comments, really, those -- all of those work to offset each other primarily. So really fairly little movement in all those businesses as well.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. Got it. And on the topic of ethylene, ethane prices. I mean, could you talk a little bit about your thoughts on margins for Geismar over the long run? Obviously after it's up and running. Ethane is spiked recently, but there's still plenty of supply coming online. And on the pricing side, ethylene is largely driven by crude, international crude. So just some of the puts and takes there and your thoughts on how margins will shape up over time.","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. Abhi, I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take that question for us.","John R. Dearborn","Sure, and thanks very much for the question. Starting with -- let's start with a short-term look at ethylene. As we look back over our shoulder, coming out of last year in anticipation of the second quarter turnarounds that are in front of us, I think there are 3 factors that are about to turn around in the second quarter. The industry, if you look at the EFPN [ph] inventory data, built inventory, in our estimate is they built somewhere between 700 million and 800 million pounds through the end of this year. That's roughly how much ethylene will be needed in the second quarter. I think on the back of that, we saw the weakening prices in the first quarter. It's our expectation they'll warm up again into the second quarter, and that's -- and then back to what we would consider normal for the year in the latter part of the year. And so I think that's the way we see this year playing out. If we look at ethane, I think in the short term, ethane is facing some operational difficulties in the Gulf Coast, mainly related to brine that's all the new fractionators have built there in the Gulf Coast. I think folks just challenged in moving the inventories around us is necessary because of some brine difficulties. We think that's going to clear out over the short period of time, and as a result, coupled with -- as a result, I think that we're going to see the ethane prices drop back to what would be a more normal level in the $0.30 per gallon range. I think that's what we've got in our guidance. So I think that takes care of this year's view. So now as we look forward, the next significant tranches of ethylene come in, in the 2017, '18 time frames. So our expectation is -- on the back of oil staying high and naphtha being relevantly related to oil, that our ethylene margins through that period until we see new, significant supplies of ethylene come on in the latter part of this decade, I think our ethylene margins are expected to remain pretty strong.","Abhiram Rajendran - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And then one last quick one, if I may. Could you maybe talk a little bit about recontracting on the Northwest and Transco pipelines in terms of what's up for renewal, how we should think about changes in the transportation rates? Obviously, Transco is running pretty close to full; Northwest is not quite there. But any color there would be very helpful.","Alan S. Armstrong","Okay, great. I'll ask -- we're in very good shape on that, as well as Gulfstream. I'll ask Rory Miller to take Transco, and then Allison Bridges can give you a response on Northwest. So Rory, if you'll take that Transco question?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes, that's a good question. Just thinking about Transco a little bit, we've got what I would call some pretty fresh market signals around pricing with our new Atlantic Sunrise project. And although we're not really disclosing all the information on it right now, the rates are above, significantly above where our system rate is. I think we've got an average of 6 years or so on contract length there. But we believe that with the change of the system, supply coming in both ends and the kind of growth that we have from the market side, it's truly a \"supply push, market pull\" kind of scenario. We believe as those contracts roll off that re-upping those contracts is going to be very attractive for our end users. We don't think anybody in the marketplace will be able to touch the opportunity that the LDCs have to just re-up those contracts. And in fact, that's what we've seen as contracts roll off. We've not seen any pressure at all in terms of getting those recontracted. So it's kind of -- it's a very healthy situation, and I think, due in large part just to the quality of the service and the positioning of the assets.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Thank you, and Allison, if you'll take the North -- question on Northwest.","Allison G. Bridges","Yes. On Northwest, we are fully subscribed even though we don't run at 100% load factor day in and day out. We do -- our contracts are fully subscribed, and I believe, on average, we have a remaining term of over 9 years. And we continue to be able to extend terms with customers. Additionally, we're really starting to see, I think, some exciting new market growth opportunities come to the Northwest through potential new fertilizer plants, potential new methanol plants for exports. So I think that not only will that continue to bode well for our existing capacity, I think longer-term, it will also result in some expansion opportunity.","Operator","We'll go next to Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In the Northeast, your processing volume was a bit stronger than I would have expected. How much, if any of that, was due to benefiting from a third-party outage?","Alan S. Armstrong","There was some in the month of -- mostly in the month of December there Christine, that came from the Natrium plant being down, and I think it was around varied, but up to about 50 million a day during the month of December.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then if I look at your NGL production, it looks like you guys may have hit your fractionation capacity maybe at the end of 4Q or sometime this quarter. Is that the case, and is your new frac unit online today?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. We are up against the limits on the base frac, and the second frac, we are -- we'll be commissioning here towards the end of the first quarter.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Was there a buildup in NGL volumes that couldn't get frac-ed or no?","Alan S. Armstrong","No.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. Going to Bluegrass. Was there maybe more acreage dedications than you would have liked and not enough minimum volume and\/or ship or pay commitments? Is that delay in the pipeline more about reducing your volume risks, and that's only going to happen when producers feel more pain in netbacks. Also, have the smaller projects that have been announced since your original announcement of the project played the part in pushing back your timing?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, first of all on the acreage dedication versus not enough volume, we certainly appreciate both of those as contributions. But clearly, we want to have a baseload of revenues that we can count on initially, and so that certainly is a major part of the issue. Secondly, as to the smaller projects -- I think those are great projects. I think they're needed. But they don't provide the kind of long-term underground storage opportunities that you get with the Gulf Coast nor the diversity of the markets for both the growing Petchem businesses and as well as the export opportunities that are very large-scale in nature in well-protected ports. So I would just tell you that I think we're excited those other projects exist because we think the growth in volume is certainly is dictating those kinds of solutions. But we really haven't seen that as a big deterrent for producers committing to Bluegrass.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then last one for me. Can you provide an update on the PDH facilities? Last we heard, you narrowed it down to 2 international players or 2 players, I guess, who are interested in building derivative plants alongside your facilities. But we'd like to know if there's been any progress there.","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take that as well.","John R. Dearborn","Yes. Christine, thanks for the question. Yes, we've made some good progress there. We actually narrowed it down to one person, and we're entering into definitive agreements on that. Give us a couple of months and probably by Analyst Day, we'll be able to bring you a good update on where that the project is at that stage, but progressing as expected at the moment.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was hoping just to possibly drill down a little bit more on the Northeast G&P. Would it be possible to quantify how much weather impacted the quarter, the ROIs?","Alan S. Armstrong","I would tell you it wasn't very large, actually. I'd say, some of the more significant issues were line breaks and a number of onetime operational expenses and some write-downs and so forth. But not too big of a volume impact from weather. One impact, though, that we did suffer was the ethane limitations going into the TETCO system. And so without the ethane systems being up and running yet, there were constraints that TETCO imposed on points like the Fort Beeler connection that required curtailments there. And so that did have some impact on our volumes in the fourth quarter.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And then as we look forward into 2014, I was just wondering if you could provide any color on how you see the segment ramping up over the year? Do you expect the first quarter to be similar to fourth quarter or a steady ramp across the year or any step change in any given quarter?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, some of the big projects that we have coming on, of course, is the Gulfstar project, which would come on in the third quarter, and the Keathley Canyon project, which comes on at the beginning of the fourth quarter, and then the Rockaway lateral project. Additionally, though, the projects in the Northeast, many of which will come on either at the very end of the first quarter or the second quarter, really, are some big drivers, not necessarily just the volume, but to the rate that we achieve for those services. And so even though people come accustomed to looking at volume there, a lot of that will be just an increase in rates. So those are really some of the big projects, I would say. On the Cayman system -- sorry, on the system in Susquehanna Supply Hub area with Cabot, those volumes will continue to grow throughout the year. And we're really excited about the continued growth up there, and we're working very hard to keep the infrastructure out in front of the growth up there. But that's pretty well steady. That growth will be well steady throughout the year.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. So specific to the Northeast G&P, sounds like going into the second quarter, there could be a bit of a step change there?","Alan S. Armstrong","Correct.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Harry Mateer with Barclays.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Two for me. The first, can you just talk about whether your thoughts on the need to have investment grade ratings of WMB have evolved and whether that financial policy might be part of your discussions when you consider taking advantage of the structural and transformation opportunities that you mentioned at the start of the call?","Donald R. Chappel","This is Don Chappel. Certainly, our -- I'll call it policy and desires have been to maintain the investment grade ratings at Williams. We think that it provides a lot of flexibility and ability to be opportunistic, particularly during very challenging times when the high-yield market is locked up. But having said that, we're certainly open-minded to other paths that create more value but it would have to be something compelling that would cause us to deviate from the path that we're on. So again, we continue to be open-minded, but we think it would take a compelling value-creation situation in order for us to deviate from our current path.","Harry Mateer - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And then just a follow-up on Transco and Northwest earlier. Appreciate the commentary on rolling contracts. But you said there's been no issue with getting contracts renewed and extended. But I'm just wondering, has pricing been stable as well? Or do you feel like you're giving up some pricing to get tenor?","Alan S. Armstrong","Rory, you want to take that, please?","Rory Lee Miller","Sure. Harry, we really haven't seen price pressure on those re-up contracts. If you look at where our system rates are, they're probably the lowest-cost opportunity that people have in the marketplace. And so the other thing is so many of our -- the LDCs that we serve, it's not like we're just dropping off large volumes of gas at one point. In some of our bigger customers, we've got over 40 delivery points. And so when you think about the way that we're distributing that gas into a 60- or 70-year-old distribution system and the low rates that we have that they can re-up at, it's just really hard. Plus, it's virtually impossible to replace those with gas from a new competitor.","Alan S. Armstrong","And to be clear on that, we haven't discounted any of that firm. It's 100% contracted, and the rates are getting set by those rate cases. But to those long-haul 100% firms, there's not any discount. There may be a discount in the production area for IT and so forth, but not on the long-haul firm.","Operator","We'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I guess, first question for me, it's WMB-leveled. You've obviously reduced the CapEx here with Bluegrass getting pushed out. I'm wondering if you can just talk about capital allocation, thoughts on the dividends, I don't know, share buybacks, keeping dry powder for acquisitions. What would you do with the extra cash, now that you'll have here for a little while?","Alan S. Armstrong","Don, take that.","Donald R. Chappel","Ted, this is Don. I would say that the extra cash flow now is still going on into some of our growth projects like CNRL. And we'll see what Bluegrass does, but for the near term, that extra cash is being reinvested in that Canadian business. Longer-term, I think we have a lot of options, and we'll have to see how things play out here in terms of investment, as well as all the other options that we continue to evaluate. I think as Alan mentioned early on that we continue to evaluate kind of all the options, and we're very open to possibilities that will create additional value.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then we've sort talked around it a little bit, but can you just give us a sense on Atlantic Sunrise? The returns that we're ought to be modeling in there, it sounds like it's higher than your current system rates. I think there was a mention of $400 million of revenue. Just give us a sense of what kind of returns from the $2.1 billion of capital we should expect.","Alan S. Armstrong","That looks like about -- without providing specific returns there, it does look like about a 7x multiple on that project. Of course, that's a little better than you normally would see on a pipeline project, and some of that is driven by the fact that we did have the competitive advantage of having a lot of that service being provided by the existing system. And so that allows for some higher returns than normal.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then last one for me is -- you sound now a little more bullish on the Gulf. Any thoughts on potentially affecting Gulfstar here? As you're getting close to completion of the first one, what's the opportunity set look like right now?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. Well, first of all, I'd tell you, one thing we are very excited about is the tie-backs that we're seeing to both Gulfstar One and to the original Devils Tower spar. And I'll remind you, those 2 facilities are very close together until there's a pretty nice area there that we can serve from those 2 spars, and we are seeing some nice tie-backs. And certainly, the Gunflint tie-back is a big boost to our expected economics for Gulfstar and came on much earlier in our assumptions. In our projects like that, we assume some tie-backs for the future, but this one came on much earlier than we had expected originally for that project. So that's very positive and of course, we've got a couple of tie-backs to Devils Tower as well. On the new spar front, we have many projects that were out there working, as you look out into the further reaches. I would tell you, we're pretty excited about some of the opportunities that we see to serve PEMEX with some of their big deepwater finds, which I'll remind you, are just south of our Perdido -- of the Perdido fold belt and our pipelines that go out to serve Shell's projects at Perdido Norte. So anyway, we're very seeing a lot of interest in the product, but we don't have any capital and guidance right now. We don't have enough confidence in those projects at this point, have any capital embedded in our guidance right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just maybe if you clean up questions, if I could. Alan, maybe going back to Bluegrass. If we get abandonment -- FERC abandonment in March, do you see that playing any type of catalysts? Would -- did anyone have any concerns over that as they may have with other alternative projects? And two, could you help us with any color, maybe, you saw from the international petchem community as far as going through Moss Lake and perhaps getting capacity on Bluegrass from that end?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. Well, those are both really astute questions. First of all, on the abandonment issue on Texas Gas, certainly, Boardwalk's in control of that issue, and I would defer that question to them. It's certainly at some point with the timing of that abandonment would certainly play into the decisions on Bluegrass. And the catalyst for a decision, we'll just say, we're not certain of the timing of that. And I think we certainly work closely with Boardwalk, but they've been working to manage that issue. But at some point, that would likely become an issue as abandonment word would come out and a decision would have to be made in terms of which direction to take there.","On the question around the international players, lots of interests. A lot of a big interest, I would tell you, from a lot of international players. And I think there are some great strategic matchup there in terms of what we're trying to accomplish in the markets that we're trying to present for our producers in the Northeast. But I also would tell you the challenge to that is it is a very slow process in terms of working through all the approvals not within -- not regulatory or anything like that within the governance, within those very large multinational corporations. And so we're excited about it in strategy, but it's a long arduous process to gain approval on that. And so we're not waiting around, I would just put it that way. We're not waiting around for those approvals for moving on, but we do have a lot of exciting talks there. And we'll remain very excited about that strategically. But we've got to execute in the near term sometimes, and those parties can move, too.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. No, I appreciate the color. Two last questions, if I could. And understanding what the Canadian PDH, we haven't seen the first one yet. So I don't want unless I put the cart in front of the horse, but to the extent that my understanding was at the end of last year, we were looking at perhaps wooing 2 different companies, and that led into potential even assessing the twin of the project. Is that something that is still progressing? Or is it more at this point, let's get the first one locked up under construction, and then we'll, perhaps, assess a twinning at that point?","Alan S. Armstrong","A great question, Carl. I'm going to ask John Dearborn to take the question.","John R. Dearborn","Appreciate the question as well. Yes, the second PDH is certainly still a bright spot in our future that we want to keep our eye on. But I think you've got it exactly right that we need to have success with the first one, before we're ready really to take a big step into the second. The marketplace, though, is continuing to express great interest. In fact, the partner that we're talking with is interested in the second one as well. So just that person is interested, and then we've got an arms-length-long list of folks that have come and approached us about number 2. So I guess, I'll just say stay tuned. There's more future growth opportunity for us up in the Canadian franchise.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And then a final question, if I could. Maybe one for Don and understanding that is sort of one of the risks that were outlined, the insurance recoveries for Geismar and the risk of perhaps oversimplification. Is there any additional color to share that, say, for instance, of the $125 million second payment that should be coming this quarter? Can you express that in any terms of bid versus ask, of what you had requested from the insurance companies versus what they were comfortable at this point paying out?","Donald R. Chappel","Carl, the insurance paid 100% of our claim to date. So I think to date, they've paid the claim as filed, and I think we're pretty well paid up through the end of the year now. In fact, obviously, the business interruption loss mounts every month. So we'll continue to update the claims process and make requests for additional payments. We'll see where that takes us. But the actual claim is based on actual losses, so we can't expect to get paid for February until sometime after February ends, or -- March until after March ends and we know what the real price is. We're in the market, and therefore, the basis of our claim. So those will kind of tick off periodically.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","A couple of questions here. Alan and Don, on this call, you both commented a couple of times about being open-minded to transformational opportunities. But Don kind of emphasized the bar was set high for giving up that investment grade credit rating and also noted that WMB level free cash flow is already spoken for a bit in the near term. My first question is do you kind of see this ongoing internal discussions with investors being an ongoing long-term issue to keep in mind or something that's more of a 2014 catalyst?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I would just say -- it's a great question, Craig, thank you. But I -- we've always had our eyes open to any arbitrage that's available in the market and any additional value we can add to our shareholders to either transformational or structural changes. And as I mentioned earlier I don't think anybody can accuse us of not having been aggressive, and in fact, we've certainly been a leader in many of the structural changes over the last several years. And so we'll continue to look for those, and I think the drivers will be what the market is valuing and how our businesses are being best valued in the market, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as time goes by. So I don't -- unless there became a roadblock between a really good idea and what we are willing to do, that would be catalyst that might limit '14. I just don't see that. I think we're very well aligned with both Corvex and Soroban in terms of looking for the great value. I think their perspective is that we're well undervalued relative to marking to our peers. And that we've got the best growth story in the business, and we ought to be getting value better than our peers and not just at par with our peers. And so I think they see a huge value gap there. And I have to say, I share their perspective. And I'm very well aligned and will continue to work with them or anybody else that has good ideas on how we can achieve that value.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. I appreciate that, and a couple more. With Gulfstar One pending completion, do you see this completion -- successful, on-time completion, being a catalyst for other significant deepwater projects?","Alan S. Armstrong","I would just tell you, I think our producers -- I think Hess and Chevron, and particularly, Hess discussed with some more visibility to them, are going to wind up, looking really smart on this project both in terms of the time that they brought their production to market. And the capital that they have tied up or the lack of capital they have tied up. So I think it's going to look like a really good project for them. It's going to look like a really good project for us because we're bringing in third-party volumes, and we're marketing the project for that. So I think when people sit back and analyze that, they're going to look pretty smart. I think Hess will want to do more business. Chevron want to do more business like that, and I think their peers will be pressured to do that kind of businesses as well. So I think this is a smart solution out there, and certainly, it gives -- we'll continue to gain confidence in our ability to execute on these kind of projects, as well as the producing community.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And last 2 small ones. Can you provide some more color on that $20 million Petchem Services pipeline project write-off? And as a follow-up to Abhi's question about long-term commodity price outlook, and I know this is going out a bit. But if we are thinking maybe nat gas and even ethane pricing, especially could be a headwind towards the end of the decade, would you consider leading up to that, balancing out your short positions by expanding midstream processing POP exposures through development or acquisition or new processing?","Alan S. Armstrong","First question on the write-off in the Petchem Services, that was related to an NGL extension up in the Northeast, a line extension that, through some potential partnering arrangements, we don't think we need any longer. And so we found a better solution than the investment that we've made in the right away and so forth developing the project. So that's the first one. And then secondly, on the commodity price outlook, certainly, the natural gas pricing is one that is kind of bittersweet for us in the short term. It will put pressure on our NGL margins and therefore, ultimately, on the ethylene spread as well, as ethylene prices, as you mentioned. But the good news is, and I think this is very positive news, is that just as we stated, we're really trying to move it forward to being a volume-driven company, and with this shot in the arm for the producers, the gas and the NGL prices that we think are going to spur additional drilling and additional volumes into our system. And so frankly, I think it's very -- long-term, very healthy for our business. In terms of contract restructuring, I think you'll see that we continue to restructure into -- away from the business. And if you look at how rapidly our fee-based business is growing over the period, it's tending to push out the importance of those NGL margins. And so we're always looking to try to reduce the risk in exposure, but it has to be done with an eye towards really the expected net present value versus the commodity risk. And so -- but we're always looking to do that. We see great value in more and more predictable cash flows, and so we're always working towards that.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","I guess, my question there was a little more focused on an appetite even if the individual investment is not as high-return, in balancing out your commodity exposures longer-term. So you have a little less volatility. So in other words, would you be willing to go into fresh midstream commodity exposed operations that would balance out your existing risks.","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I would say that I don't see adding POP contracts as reducing risks all that much frankly. And so I would say you'd see us investing in more fee-based investments. I think POP is a different kind of risk, but I really don't see it balancing out all that much risk. We do have some contracts that will reduce risks like our Laurel Mountain contract with Chevron that's a percent of gas. And that does, but that's not just limited to the processing business that's on the gathering business as well. So we certainly will look to those kind of opportunities that reduce our exposure to natural gas but not necessarily adding length and exposure to NGLs.","Operator","We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a couple of follow-ups. For the Atlantic Sunrise project, do you anticipate that 7x multiple at the start? Or is there a stairstep in the commitments to get to the full capacity?","Alan S. Armstrong","No, that is both initial and end of term revenues. So that's fully contracted from day 1.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then also for the planned Canadian drop-down. Any change in the target multiple? I think you previously mentioned around 7x.","John R. Dearborn","Sharon, we said less than 7x, and I think we're in that same zip code.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And I guess, given the recent news on Boardwalk, do you anticipate that this could have an impact or bearing on shippers' decision to commit to Bluegrass? Or maybe on the way you would like to structure the JV as the project goes forward?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. Just to remind you -- and I'm certainly going to be careful. I do not to speak for Boardwalk here, but I will tell you that Boardwalk has been very clear with us from the inception and have certainly recently reiterated that Loews really stands behind the bulk of their capital commitment. And so we did not worry the recent reduction in their distribution and the impact that's had on the company. So we -- we're very excited to have them as a partner. They've been a great partner to work with, and we really don't see any issues there because of they've got such strong backing from Loews on the project.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Timm Schneider with ISI Group.","Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Just -- I was wondering if you guys can maybe discuss what you're seeing in terms of operating cost creep in some of your different service areas. So if I look at Northeast, for example, volumes and revenues were up pretty nicely, I think, 18% sequentially, but that didn't really push through to the bottom line. Was this just kind of onetime issues? Or is there something else going on?","Alan S. Armstrong","It really -- Timm, thanks for the question. It really is -- has been a lot of onetime issues. We also have allocated quite a bit of cost the way we allocate kind of our support services across the company. Those get allocated on both the capital and a revenue basis, and so the cost of them coming up directly with those allocations as well. But for the most part, the real issue was a bunch of onetime matters in terms of write-downs and so forth that on various assets. And frankly, we're kind of cleaning up what's been a pretty fast-paced period up there. And I would tell you, as we move forward, Jim Scheel and his team are going to be very focused on operational excellence and really fine-tuning our cost structure up there. So I'm very confident in our team's ability to do that. If you look at our overall cost structure across the entire company, you'll actually see that, that actually -- between our O&M and G&A, actually, reduced a little bit from 12% to 13%, which is pretty impressive, considering the amount of growth that we've been managing. So I'm very confident in our team's ability to get after cost and get those in line. But we've certainly been trying to make sure we got some of the reliability problems behind us and for the benefit of our customers and because we saw that as kind of a job one. And I think we've done that and reliability has been very, very impressive over the last 6 to 7 months. But it's come at some expense to get it there, and I think that's a lot of what you're seeing right now.","Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. And as a follow-up, can you guys just discuss maybe your preliminary funding plans for Atlantic Access? Are you kind of happy with the $2.1 billion, I guess, CapEx outlay at this point, or would you consider selling some of that balance to another party?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. I don't think we would be planning on selling that down. It's part of the Transco system and as a result of that, it's not an individual project, the way like a Constitution project is. So Constitution is not part of the Transco system, and it allows for that, but being part of Transco makes that a little more difficult.","Donald R. Chappel","Yes. We like the risk return profile there, and again, most of that capital is in 2017. The amount of capital for 2017 is pretty modest. So it puts it out in a period where we'll have a lot of capacity and be looking to make big investments.","Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Lastly, for me, on Constitution. I guess, what are some of the big moving parts around the in-service date, whether it's going to be kind of end of '15 or early '16? And how are some of the conversations going with producers in that part of the woods?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, that -- the Constitution system is fully contracted as you know. And so the discussions are really more around what all we can do jointly to accelerate the permitting process. And really, the permitting is the issue. As I mentioned earlier, the FERC has certainly been constructive, and they are pushing things along. But there are some permitting requirements in the state of New York that, for various reasons, can be a bit of a barrier. And frankly, I think we just got to work towards the right resolutions that meets everybody's needs on that. And I feel we'll remain confident that we can do that, I think it's very clear, politically, that the infrastructure is desperately needed to serve the New England markets. And I think that bringing that to life, clearly and firmly, will help bring some reason to getting past some of the permit issues that we're facing right now.","Timm A. Schneider - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So was that more at the state level? Or was it actually land owners challenging rights of ways?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. It's state permitting issues.","Operator","We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I hate to beat a dead horse, but if could just go back to sort of the response that you guys have to the activism in the market and your stock. Is there going to be like a formal response from you guys, from all you guys, to the activist shareholders' sort of demands? Or is there going to be any change in the board over the next several months? I know that there were some requests by the activists to take board seats, too. So just wondering is there a timeline when you have to respond to them or put out a formal sort of response and discuss sort of what are the strategic options or at least adopt the strategic options that they're recommending?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. Well, really, the only thing they really asked for at this point is the board seats. And so that's where the discussions have centered, frankly. And as you noted, we -- I'm sure we put out an 8-K announcing that we had expanded or extended the window for nomination post this call in our 10-K release. And that really was to eliminate any disclosure kind of risk and really allow the parties to have a more thorough discussion post that information being out there. So I think you should see that as very accommodating on the company's part and very interested in continuing those discussions.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Is there sort of a time line when sort of these discussions and you guys all present your sort of findings to the market? Or is it sort of just ongoing?","Alan S. Armstrong","I would say it's ongoing, and certainly wouldn't try to speak for Corvex and Soroban. But I think from Williams' standpoint, we certainly are interested to reengage in the discussions. And again, just given the timing that we were up against the window closing ahead of a 10-K and our earnings release, we just wanted to make sure that we didn't -- that the compliance issues were first and foremost in the attendance of the various issues we need to deal with there.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. Fair enough. And then going back to the funding on Atlantic Sunrise. So do you guys envision sort of issuing sort of pick [ph] units in the future for -- to fund the equity on this project? Or do you think that you are -- the cost of equity will be low enough that WPZ to sort of to move forward with the common equity offering?","Donald R. Chappel","Faisal, one is that the significant funding is on a long way out. As I mentioned, the bulk of it is in 2017. So -- and we would expect the WPZ cost of capital to improve significantly, particularly as we -- as Alan cited here, we've got a lot of projects that we -- are expected to go in service here in '14 and '15, which will really boost WPZ cash flow and coverage. And as we do that and the coverage comes back to a -- I'll call it a more attractive level, we would expect WPZ will trade in line with fundamentals. So I'd say, we're optimistic that WPZ will come back in line here over the next year or so.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi from Jefferies.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","I guess, first, Don if you could talk about maintenance CapEx. I realize in the prepared remarks you talked about some synergies that were realized in 4Q that led to the improved spend versus what you were guided in the third quarter. But I'm just wondering a bit more about that, given that we didn't see any change in '14 or '15 guidance, is that more of just a onetime synergy? And if so, what's sort of additional color around it?","Alan S. Armstrong","Let me take that, if I could, please. This is Alan. I think, first of all, the -- a couple of drivers to that. We have a lot of maintenance capital items that had been driving a lot of the costs in '11 and '12. So they were Clean Air Act issues. There was a lot of required inspections on the pipeline to be done by a certain period, smart pig inspections. And so we got a lot of that out of the way. If we also -- if you think about reducing risk on your systems and your asset integrity issues, you always want to hit the systems that have the most risk on them first. And I would just tell you that our costs have been based just assuming that we would continue to find the same number of anomalies on our systems, as we completed those smart pigging and some of the hydro testing. And in fact, as we've gotten further down the profile and the lower-risk assets, we've had less and less dig outs. We've had less and less repairs required, and so that has driven some of that out. In terms of -- so if you were the team that's responsible for that asset integrity work, when you do your forecasting for that, you go in assuming you're going to have a certain amount of digs and certain amount of anomalies to clear. And if you don't find them, then those costs don't show up. Certainly, the big cost is in the repairs of that. So that's one item. And certainly -- and because we had such rough winner out West, in particular, towards into the November and December time frame, it did slow down some of the works that we would have done in that period and would have expected to get done in the fourth quarter. And so a little bit of that'll get pushed in to '14. But it's not like you miraculously have a bunch of new capacity to get the work completed, so that tends to get pushed out into '15 as well. And so I would just tell you that we haven't backed off it all in terms of maintaining the integrity of our systems and spending the right money. We've just been very fortunate that a lot of the early work that we did was on some of our pipelines that we did most reconditioning, and as we moved into the less -- or the newer parts of our system and areas that we've had less issues, our costs are coming down as we do that pipeline inspection and asset integrity work.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great, Alan. That's very helpful. As you think about the '14 and '15 programs, and just as a quick follow-up, in what you have planned for asset integrity. Might there be upside opportunities like what you mentioned when you find less there than what you think, given where you're moving to? Or is it kind of entirely a different aspect of the system?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. I think we're having a hard time, really, believing we're going to get that fortunate on a repeated basis. And so I would just tell you our assumptions haven't baked that in at this point, but certainly, that possibility exists, but we just haven't baked that in at this point. Secondly, I would tell you an area that may be an impact on that would be around well-connect capital. Again, this isn't built-in. Because we're seeing gas prices and NGL prices move up so nicely, we may see more drilling coming on, which might increase our well connect capital towards the last half year. We love spending that money due to the degree that's producing revenues for the future. But nevertheless, given the way we account for maintenance capital, we would include that well connect capital as maintenance capital.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And I think that actually drills down to rather nicely out to questions I have on the West segment, Alan. We saw the ethane equity volumes come down again in a big way in 4Q. Obviously recognized, rejection's been something we grapple with all year. But I was curious, 2 questions out there. One, if there's something in particular that drove the change in 4Q that can be sort of isolated and highlighted? And then two, as I think about '14 and '15, with the commodity construct we're seeing today, if you've had any sort of revised views around the volume could be out there. I did see WPX had numbers out last week, calling some increased numbers out of their Piceance program, for example. Sort of how that might translate into what you guys are expecting out late?","Alan S. Armstrong","Great question. Let me ask Allison Bridges take that question.","Allison G. Bridges","Yes. We did have some -- a little bit of anomalies, I think, in the fourth quarter in that we were -- third parties were actually continuing to recover. And so we were actually giving them some of our equity ethane, which was a positive thing from our financial standpoint. And additionally, we did have a contract that terminated at the end of the third quarter. So those 2 things caused a rather large drop in the fourth quarter. We have been seeing some declines in volumes. As you said, we are starting to see some good signs with increase in gas prices, as well as WPX announcing that they were adding rigs. So we do believe that a little bit out in the guidance period, we're going to start to see arresting of some of those declines.","Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division","Great, very helpful. One final follow-up for me. Just to dovetail on what Timm had asked earlier about costs. Alan, we did see a very strong bead relative to your guidance in Atlantic-Gulf. Obviously, some cost creep continued into the Northeast. You had mentioned, as you have in earlier quarters, about sort of this week calibration or reallocation of costs more towards the Northeast given the activity. Was any of that present in the fourth quarter? Or is that sort of -- have we reached run rates we should expect from here?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. And just so you know, I mean, I think if you're just focused on the Northeast segment, you'll see movement. If you're looking at the total cost structure, you won't see that much movement as it relates to that allocation because it's basically just pulling cost out of area where there's less activity and less growth, and it's being applied again. That's done on a modified mass basis, which basically takes in as a primary allocation is the capital invested and the revenues. And so as both the capital invested and the revenues grow there, it will shift more costs to there. That doesn't necessarily mean that the cost of that business directly is going up, but it just is the way and the method that we allocate cost across the business. And of course, we need to do that because we have regulated assets in our businesses as well, and so we need to make sure that we keep proper tallies on how we allocate those costs, and we keep constant method going on how we do that. So to answer your question, as you'll probably continue to see some allocated costs even though, I would tell you, in terms of the lack of operating profit performance in the Northeast for the fourth quarter, very little of that was driven because we are already expecting that cost allocation. A lot of the drivers, really, a bunch of onetime issues that we had in the fourth quarter, as I mentioned earlier.","Operator","And we'll go next to Becca Followill with the U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","On Atlantic Sunrise, are these 1.7 Bcf a day capacity incremental to the, call it, throughput on the system that's really running from south to north?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","So it doesn't reverse flow on any of the system to cannibalize the existing system? Or is it all incremental?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I think if you just looked at our initial flows back then and you looked at our initial flows after the project is done, those 2 numbers are additive.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","So it won't displace any of the existing, roughly, 60% of contracts that you have rolling off by 2016?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. The -- where the product -- projects are going and deliveries for it will be incremental. And so I think you could -- really, if you think about it, it's the amount of gas going off the system that you would see. And so while you may see the benefit of physical displacement allow us to increase our capacity, so in other words, we don't have to go build as much capital as you normally would think to get incremental volumes because you've got gas coming from both directions. The volumes leaving the system will increase by that amount.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then on Bluegrass, when should we expect a go or no-go decision?","Alan S. Armstrong","As we mentioned earlier, we're still in those discussions, and I don't really think we should pin that down. But -- because frankly, it's some really big commitments, and we think it's the right project, and it's taking some time to get people to make those huge and long-term commitments. But I'm really not willing to put a specific time line on that at this point, Becca.","Operator","And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the call back over to Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Thank you, Dana. Well, thanks, everybody, for joining us. We remain very excited about the tremendous growth that we've got ahead of us. And a lot of the big capital investments, as I mentioned really on the backs of a lot equity, are really start to come in to '14. We're pleased with the performance we saw for the fourth quarter and particularly pleased with some of the operational reliability improvements that we're seeing across the systems. And so we look forward to talking to you in the future and continuing to talk about the great growth story we have here at Williams. Thanks.","Operator","Again, that does conclude today's presentation. We thank you for your participation."],"22782":["Williams Companies, Inc.

Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our CFO, Don Chappel; and our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconciled with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.","So with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan Armstrong","Great. Well thank you, John and welcome everyone. I'm going to keep my remarks fairly brief this morning so we can move quickly to your questions. I'd like to start by thanking those of you who attended our recent Analyst Day event. It really was great to reengage with a lot of folks and to layout our solid plans for Williams in the course we've chartered to deliver on this low-risk, sustainable growth and a very focused and clear strategy that we continue to execute against.","I was also pleased to introduce our new COO, Micheal Dunn, at Analyst Day. He's really hit the ground running and is making a big impact on our operations through his commitment to execution and accountability across the organization. Within Micheal's organization, we recently announced the appointment of Frank Ferazzi as Senior Vice President of Atlantic-Gulf. And Frank replaces Rory Miller, who announced his retirement earlier this year. And of course, Frank's previous role was running our Eastern Interstate. So we've got a nice continuity there of leadership in that area.","More recently, we've added some - another key player to our leadership team. Chad Zamarin came onboard as Senior Vice President of Corporate Development in late June. And Chad joined us from Cheniere and is focused squarely on the opportunities and larger strategic initiatives that we can drive from an enterprise level. So really excited to have Chad join us here and his energy level and he's got a lot of wood to chop and he's getting right after it. So excited about the new energy we've got here at the senior leadership team.","We're also pleased with our efforts to drive cost out of the business, continually improve our project execution and we've made some strides on further improving our operational safety metrics.","On July 6, we completed the sale of Geismar to NOVA Chemicals. That sale, along with the sale of the Canadian assets last year, removed a significant amount of commodity risk from our business, as you're well aware. And we now stand at around 97% of our gross margins coming from predictable fee-based sources that are aligned with natural gas volumes. This move also allows us to streamline the support services around the organization, as we really have narrowed our lines of business and we continue to grow scale within these fewer lines of business. So a lot of opportunity that we're seeing to really get focused on the natural gas transmission gathering and processing side of the business and getting some of those business that were more ancillary to that really does allow us to narrow the services that we provide around the organization.","We also - we did use a portion of the proceeds in the quarter to pay - sorry, just more recently here, to pay off our $850 million term loan. And of course further strengthening our balance sheet which we've made tremendous progress on here in the last 12 months. The team executing on the Geismar sale did a great job and I really want to recognize their tremendous efforts; really excited about the way that transaction was executed by our team.","We're also crisply executing on our 2017 project commitments. You'll remember, we talked about our key 5 projects that are coming online in 2017. Of course, that was Gulf Trace, Hillabee Phase I, Dalton, New York Bay and the Virginia Southside II project. We're chipping away at all these important projects. As you know, Gulf Trace came into service in the first quarter. And Hillabee Phase I which provides all of the supply for Sabal Trail, came online in early July. And then just this week on August 1, the Dalton capacity was placed in service to serve northern Georgia markets from supply points at the northern end of Transco. So really an exciting project there in that we're really starting to now provide capacity moving for the northern end into these growing southeast markets. And so more of those to come. But really excited to see that project come along - come online.","Our line of sight of the future growth is evident as we target the second half of '17. And the in-service dates coming up for Virginia Southside II, New York Bay and also, we'll get Garden State Phase I in this year as well, it looks like.","So in summary, if you kind of think about the $1.4 billion roughly in projects that we were going to be placing in service - in full-service, about 20% of that came on in the first half of '17. And now another roughly 55% in this July\/August time frame. And then of course, the balance of that will be in the second half of '17. So great job by our teams. That is a lot of work that's been going on to execute on that with plenty of resistance in a lot of these areas, but the team's doing a great job of executing in the face of that.","So let's look at the results for the second quarter of '17 now. We met or exceeded our business performance expectations in all 3 remaining businesses. And although the results were somewhat offset by Geismar's continued outage and lower margins, in fact, the go-forward business which excludes the NGL & Petchem, was up 6.6% over 2Q of '16 on an adjusted EBITDA basis.","As you probably know, we will not have any continued operations or assets to be reported in the NGL-Petchem sector other than what will come through in the 3 - third quarter here as we wrapped up the closing for Geismar in third quarter. So really, the go-forward, you'll see those 3 business units and just kind of the tailings of the NGL & Petchem business there.","Looking at - looking first at our GAAP results. WPZ delivered $320 million in net income in the second quarter. And once again, we demonstrated the long term benefits of our strategy as we delivered year-over-year growth on our adjusted EBITDA measure for now the 15th consecutive quarter. So a very nice drum beat we've got going there and we've got confidence in being able to continue that for many quarters to come. WPZ's adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion was a $39 million increase over '16, primarily due to increased fee-based revenues and an increase in proportional EBITDA from joint ventures. Distributable cash flow for the quarter was $698 million which was down over the second quarter of '16, primarily from the planned removal of $58 million in noncash deferred revenue amortization associated with our fourth quarter 2016 contract, where we restructured the Barnett Shale and some of the Mid-Continent region business as well. This is nothing new. We mentioned this reduction on our last quarter's call as well. But just to remind you, that amortization is flowing through our EBITDA, but we remove it on the DCF.","Importantly, the WPZ coverage for the quarter came in at 1.22 and this puts us at 1.27 for the year-to-date. The cash retained due to this healthy coverage supports further investment in our leading growth portfolio.","So now we'll take a look at each of our segments. We'll start with the Atlantic-Gulf, where continued strong performance, coupled with expected growth for the balance of the year, gives us confidence we'll achieve our prior guidance on both adjusted EBITDA and DCF. And our adjusted EBITDA for Atlantic-Gulf came in at $462 million, an increase of around $94 million or almost 26% over the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by an $88 million higher fee-based revenues coming from increased volumes through our Gulfstar One due to the Gunflint tie-back which happened in the third quarter of last year and stronger volumes from Tubular Bells and of course other Transco expansions that just keep coming online and into service and the steady drumbeat of those projects. This really is another proof point of our ability to deliver predictable, sustained growth from markets along Transco and further demonstration of our leading position out in the Gulf.","In the West, gathered volumes were up approximately 4% versus the first quarter of 2017 after we adjusted for the Marcellus for Permian transaction. So after taking the DBJV impact out of there, that gives you that 4%. The seasonal issues experienced in the first quarter this year have lifted and we continue to place a sharp focus on cost and operational discipline throughout our Western operations which now includes the central - what was previously the central area as well.","For the quarter, our adjusted EBITDA came in at $372 million, down versus 2Q of '16, primarily due to the Barnett and Niobrara contract restructures; and the Niobrara, that contract restructure really just affected how we record revenues in the Niobrara and in the DBJV sale and our lower volumes in that area. The declines were partially offset by a $14 million reduction in O&M and SG&A expenses. So really proud of the way the team continues to really push on the cost in the West.","And now going over to Northeast G&P, where volumes increased in our Susquehanna and Ohio River Systems but declined on our rich Utica systems compared to 2Q '16. We talked last quarter about being at an inflection point on the Utica volume increases and we continue to expect a pick-up through the rest of the year. Specifically, we've seen pretty dramatic declines in the West - in the wet Utica, sorry, over the last 5 quarters, but expect the Chesapeake rigs to move back in and begin to offset previous declines later this year and into 2018. So quite a bit of movement going on within the Northeast and even within the Utica zone. But I'll remind you, relative to the wet Utica that while we have confidence in the wet Utica volumes coming back here as we're seeing the activity picking up. If they don't return, our fees would increase because those wet Utica volumes are under a cost-of-service agreement. And so, even though it's starting from a much smaller base, we have already seen strong and expected growth in the dry Utica. So remember, we have 2 basic systems there. We have the cardinal system that takes in the wet Utica volumes and then we have what we call - refer to as our flint system; that is the dry Utica. The dry Utica has been - has seen some really fast growth going on, but it's from a much smaller base. And - but the wet Utica has not had the benefits of any drilling for a long time. So it's pretty interesting to watch, in these basins, where in some areas we're still enjoying DUCs. And in an area like the wet Utica, we're really seeing what the raw decline really would look like. And I would tell you, I think that is an interesting macro picture for people to pay attention to.","It's also important to remember that infrastructure constraints continue to limit the Northeast volume growth. And certainly, we're anxious to see a lot of these big projects come on, because we really think that's going to unlock a tremendous amount of growth. But we do see here in the third quarter, we've seen some pretty soft pricing in the third quarter. And certainly, that could have some short term impact and really cap the growth in our volumes here in the short term. But overall, for the second quarter, Northeast adjusted EBITDA increased $26 million compared to the same period last year. Increased Bradford ownership resulting from the DBJV sale primarily drove the increase, with Marcellus volume growth offset by rich volume declines we talked about earlier. Fee-based revenues remained relatively stable through the period.","I'd also like to just comment, kind of a little more forward-looking on this. Our teams are having great success on the commercial front which I would tell you is following from a great operational performance in terms of reliability in the Northeast. And we're really excited to see what the next 12 months holds for this area. That is poised to grow rapidly. And I would tell you, it's looking like we may be able to pick up more than our market share of that growth as we look forward, given the great performance by our teams up there.","As we go now to NGL & Petchem Services. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was affected by the unplanned downtime at Geismar in the March to April timeframe. We discussed on last quarter's call as well as a modest reduction in per-unit margins due to price movements on those products there. The Geismar transaction, as I mentioned, closed on July 6. So there's no gain on the sale in this quarter's result. But we expect a $1.1 billion gain to be recorded in the third quarter.","So now let's move on to the next slide and take a quick look at our year-to-date results. We delivered GAAP net income of $954 million with adjusted EBITDA of over $2.2 billion, up about 4.5% compared to the same period in 2016. The year-to-date 2017 segment results generally reflect the same drivers we saw in the second quarter. The only exceptions - primary exceptions I would point out there is the typical seasonal issues that we see on big systems like Transco, where we have short term firm that we sell as well as interruptible volumes that flow on those system, relatively small compared to Transco, but we do see some fluctuation there. That is very typical and you can go back and look at any quarters - previous first quarter and second quarter and you'll see that movement. And also, our West volumes which we were pleased to see rebound from the first quarter after some freeze-offs in the Western operations.","Coverage at WPZ came in at 1.27 on the back of 1.45 billion in DCF. And this solid coverage which excludes the $116 million revenue amortization, continues to grow and provide solid coverage that we can reinvest.","So now let's look at some of our executional highlights for the second quarter. I've already touched on the first couple of projects here. And obviously, the Geismar sale was significant. But another area I'd like to emphasize is our growth in the Gulf. It's important to remember the strong competitive position of Atlantic-Gulf's offshore assets which really showed up here in the second quarter and some new volumes and some new business that we contracted that came on. And we continue to make progress on Atlantic Sunrise, where construction continues on the mainline facilities and we will see early mainline service revenues this September.","Assuming timely regulatory approvals, we expect to hit our target in-service date of mid-2018. And with respect to completing the entire project, the long lead item is the greenfield compressor station work. As we've discussed in the past, the majority of the takeaway capacity could be available once the pipeline is in service, even if the greenfield compression isn't in place. And so that's really going to be a big game changer in the area as we bring on these - what we refer to as the Central Penn Line in the area. And in fact, we're in the final phases of permitting for the Central Penn Line and - which is all in Pennsylvania. And our team continues to work cooperatively with PDEP, with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection and other agencies. I would tell you, we've got a very good relationship there. And we have worked hard to meet their very stringent and careful requirements. I would tell you, PDEP's being extremely cautious, as you would expect, in the environment they're operating in. But we found them to be very professional and diligent in their efforts.","For all of our projects and operations, we try to differentiate Williams from our competitors in the way we listen to our landowners and the public and work hard to understand their concerns as well as the regulators. And we think over time, this trust that we continue to build pays dividends as our pipelines are going to be there for a very long time and we understand that and we go into it with that attitude.","In fact, we just finished a public comment period in a round of public hearings for Atlantic Sunrise in Pennsylvania, in which a tremendous number of people stood up to support our project, including people from labor unions, business, manufacturing as well as local elected officials. To be sure, there is some opposition to the project, as you've picked up in the media. But we know the majority of Pennsylvanians understand how important natural gas takeaway capacity is to the future of the common welfare.","In addition to our project - or progress on Atlantic Sunrise in 2017 Transco projects, as we've discussed, our Northeast Supply Enhancement project is progressing as expected as well. And in the West, we expect to place two gathering expansions in service for this year at the Wamsutter and Haynesville spaces. So nice example of high incremental returns in those areas where we've got a very strong presence already. And so nice to see some increased volumes to be coming on in those areas.","Our Northeast G&P team is also working hard to place expansions in service by year end that will allow Cabot to meet its commitment to Atlantic Sunrise and other new takeaway arrangements that they have reported on.","So as I wrap up, I'd emphasize, we're pleased with where we're here in mid-2017. And especially on our project execution, our solid performance and focus on execution this year positions us very well going into '18. And especially with the high incremental return projects we have coming down the pipe, in both the Northeast and now the Haynesville and Wamsutter Fields, we're able to fund our growth within a very comfortable credit metric along with our retained cash flow. Though in general, I would tell you, the U.S. really has a tremendous competitive advantage because of our abundant low-cost natural gas supply. Williams' advantaged position between these abundant supplies and growing natural gas demand is continuing to deliver tremendous growth prospects with better-than-industry-average returns. Our employees across the country are very passionate about driving value and building Williams for the future and doing it the right way.","And on a personal note, I'm really pleased with the significant contributions of our new leaders and - are making here, as we continue creating low-risk, predictable growth for our shareholders. So with that, I thank you and we'll turn it over to the operator for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll go first to Jean Salisbury of Bernstein.","Jean Salisbury","Can just remind us of the major permits to watch for, for Atlantic Sunrise to be on time for Phase 1 and Phase 2?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, sure. I'll have Micheal Dunn take that for you.","Micheal Dunn","Good morning. Right now, we're looking at 3 primary permits to finalize the permitting process. One is the 404 permit that the Corps of Engineers is processing. And the other 2 are from PDEP or for the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection. Those are 102, 105 permits as they're designated. All of these are water-related type permits and we've obviously finished all the public comment periods for all of these. And we do expect these permits to be in-hand in August and that would allow us to start construction certainly thereafter. So what will happen after we received those permits is, we would go back to the FERC and ask for a notice to proceed. And at that point, we would be able to begin construction on the project.","Jean Salisbury","Okay. And that's kind of a 1-for-1 delay, I guess. So if that gets delayed by 2 weeks, then construction start would get delayed by 2 weeks, basically?","Micheal Dunn","Well, yes. It would be a day-for-day delay. But we're pretty optimistic we're going to receive those permits here in the month of August. And FERC has been pretty generous in turning around notice to proceed requests for the industry fairly quickly. So we would expect to be able to start construction shortly thereafter.","Jean Salisbury","Great. And then, as a follow-up. As I'm sure you're aware, there have been a lot of rigs added in the Haynesville since the beginning of the year which should lead to volumes in the back half. You now get fixed fee on that, right? I'm wondering if the ramp has been more than what you expected in your guidance and kind of more than the minimum that you agreed with Chesapeake a couple years ago?","Alan Armstrong","They're a little bit ahead. But part of that obligations they had was a certain number of wells turn in line. I would say what's been surprising to us is not the number but really the performance that they've had on those wells, that they've continued to do better and better on. We do have a new piece of capacity coming on, on what's called our Springridge system. And so that'll add about 150 million a day of capacity. And it is needed, because there are volumes stacking up behind that. So we're excited to be turning that on here in the very near future. And that will unleash some volumes in that area. So yes, we're enjoying growth there and excited to see some of the well performance in that area.","Operator","We'll go next to Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin","I appreciate the update on Southeastern Trail. I just wonder if you can give a little more sense of how much capacity you're marketing there, the type of capital you might be deploying, what kind of returns you're looking at on that project, please?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I would say, still yet to be determined. As we've reported in the past, we got some very valuable capacity there, a lot of demand for it from the market. And we want to make sure that we get the very best investments around that. So I would say, we remain excited. We haven't pinned that down. We do have a binding open season that's going to be closing here as we speak. But we're going to make sure that we get the absolute optimum value out of that, because that capacity southbound - that incremental capacity southbound within our main line or brownfield, if you will, is extremely valuable. And we want to make sure we get whatever other strategic benefits might come with that. And so that's what we're working on. So I would say, very optimistic there. But remain - we're going to be patient in making sure that we get the very best alternatives out of that last easy expansion that we have coming south there.","Theodore Durbin","Okay, that's helpful. And then, you saw an uptick in the West. Maybe I just missed the comments on your gathering volumes, sort of second quarter versus first quarter. I was wondering if you can give us a little more sense of the drivers there that are sort of offsetting what has been more of a declining area than a growing area?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, sure. Mostly I would tell you it was just recovery from some of the production and freeze-offs in general. But for instance, in the Barnett, we're starting to see and this is more recent, but we're starting to see Total. Remember, they had a roughly $40 million a year obligation for drilling dollars in the area. There were kind of late to get started on that just because they had a lot of issues to deal with as they took over as operator. But I'd say, they're really starting to get after that and we're starting to see some improvement from their investments there. So typically, Barnett has been a pretty heavy decline area and we're starting to see that be arrested. Mike, I don't know what other comments you might think to...","Micheal Dunn","Well, I would say, across the board, there were improvements in most of those franchise areas in the West, pretty significant in Eagle Ford, Haynesville and also the Southwest Wyoming. So we recovered from the problems we had, obviously, in Southwest Wyoming over the winter and saw a pretty good uptick there.","Operator","We'll go next to Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan.","Charles Barber","This is Charlie on for Jeremy. Just one clarification on the Petchem segment. So there will be just that first week that Geismar was still technically - before it was finally sold in that first week of July? And then, the RGB Splitter, that was sold, is that correct?","Alan Armstrong","That is correct. I think that closed June 30, so that won't even be in the third quarter.","Charles Barber","Okay, great. And then, just the maintenance CapEx. Obviously below the guidance. Just trying to understand on kind of cadence for 3Q and 4Q, similar step up that we saw in 1Q and 2Q, to kind of hit? Or is there - I mean, any reason why you would come in below that $500 million guidance?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I would say, we have a lot of work to do and it's somewhat dependent on our ability to get to that. But we'll be pushing hard to get that done. And so, I think, probably the best pattern probably to look at is previous year's patterns. I think, that's probably a pretty good indicator of the cadence that we have that's driven by both weather and loads on our systems. Said another way, we're - we have so much load on our systems typically that we have to be careful when we take them off line to be able to do the work. So those patterns are pretty well fixed and really wouldn't expect anything very different in terms of percentage per quarter that we're spending in there. So I'd say, it's probably the best guidepost to look at.","Donald Chappel","This is Don Chappel. Just to clarify on NGL-Petchem. You'll see, I think, as Alan mentioned, 6 days of operations at Geismar. You'll see the expected gain on the sale that we disclosed, an estimate of $1.1 billion. And then you'll see any other, I'll call it, miscellaneous cleanup kind of changes in reserves, things like that, that relate to that segment that'll dribble in a bit over time. But really, from an operating standpoint, it's really only 6 days of operation of Geismar. The gain on sale and then just, I'll call it, a dribbling, if you will, of any other adjustments or costs or revenues that might dribble through there.","Charles Barber","Great. And then, just real quick, lastly. The - during the Analyst Day, you mentioned, within the Atlantic-Gulf segment, the couple of projects that were in negotiations. Just any update there? I believe there was one that you touched on earlier. But I just - curious on the remainder of those.","Alan Armstrong","Yes, we're not quite ready to announce anything on those. So lots of expansion work going on. But - or development work going on. But I'd say, on the Transco system, it's pretty complex right now. A lot of opportunities that we're pursuing, but coupled with Southeastern Trail, there's - we're having to, again, as I mentioned earlier, we're really trying to make sure we're optimizing, because we understand how valuable these tranches of capacity are.","Operator","We'll go next to Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering, Holt and Co.","Colton Bean","I appreciate the comments on Atlantic Sunrise and that there's still a few moving pieces to nail down there. But I think on Q1, you kind of referenced the variance in CapEx guidance as largely attributable to Sunrise timing. So then, maybe a better sense of how that progresses through the back half of the year. Can you guys refine that range at all?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I would say, we're probably, given kind of where the timing's working out, we'll probably wind up closer to midpoint of that rather than the low end or the high end of it. Because we're - the high end would've had us already under major construction. And the midpoint is about kind of what we're expecting and it looks like that's going to come out. So I would say, kind of the midpoint is probably a pretty good indicator right now.","Colton Bean","Okay. And then, on the West segment, so you mentioned the reversal of freeze-offs on the gathering side. We didn't necessarily see that for processing, so is there also a bit of a mix shift going on there in terms of rebounding volumes on the dry gas basins and maybe more of a flatter trajectory for rich gas?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, yes. We did have some shifts in the - at our Opal facility there. We had Ultra, where we reformed the contracts there. And then, on LINN Energy, they rejected a contract that we had. That also showed up in the first quarter. But they rejected a contract that we had out there. We're looking at being able to pick up some volumes in the area. But that really was a change, though. So one shifting from fee to commodity risk and the other was we actually lost the volumes there at the end of the fourth quarter.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We'll go next to Timm Schneider of Evercore.","Timm Schneider","My question, I guess, is a bit more longer term strategic. Specifically, if I look at your business model, right, you have, obviously, the natural gas pipelines which are, I'd say, best in breed; then you have the Gulf of Mexico and Rockies or West Gathering and Processing. As you look at your gross CapEx portfolio, I mean, the majority of that is centered around Transco. But kind of, over the next - and it's not near term, but over the next 3, 4, 5 years, what's beyond Transco? Or do you actually think Transco's going to be the pillar going forward here as well? Or is there other things that you guys are looking at in the portfolio? Basically, it's kind of like, everybody looks at Williams in the context of, \"Hey, maybe they're a takeout target.\" I'm kind of thinking of it the other way around. Is there anything that you guys are interested in?","Alan Armstrong","Timm, thanks for the question. I would just say, we're very excited about the strategy that we have and opportunities that are coming along. We're really working to be the best operator in this space, in this strategy. And I would say, we're working extremely hard as a team to not just be good in the space, but great. And we think, as we continue to execute over time that, that's going to open up opportunities for us to continue to expand in our strategy. But I would say, it is blocking and tackling first and we remain extremely focused on that. And we have so much opportunity, as you mentioned, we have so much opportunity here that's right in front of us that we're really narrowing our focus on delivering on that. But certainly, we're paying attention to long term trends and where we need to be next. And I think, we've always done a good job strategically of positioning ourselves in the right place and we'll continue to do that. So - but I would say, there's a pretty intense focus right now on delivering what we have, because there's so much value to be created just delivering on what's right in front of us right now.","Micheal Dunn","Timm, I would add, if you go back to our Analyst Day, we talked a lot about the Northeast, where we have an opportunity to increase our revenues up there fairly significantly with less capital infusion into that, just because of the backbone systems that we've already built up in that area up there. So that's one of the areas that we talked about a lot at Analyst Day that we have great opportunities going forward.","Timm Schneider","Got it. And I guess, let me ask one follow-up on that. And I know the focus really has been - and you guys have done a tremendous job on this, kind of shifting toward - at the Mantle, that fee or that take-or-pay business model on the gas pipeline side. But would you be categorically opposed to looking at gathering and processing assets, if they have the right structure, right? So it's not commodity price exposure, maybe more fee-based, minimum volume commitments, stuff like that?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, no. We're not at all opposed if it's the right risk-adjusted return. We think we're very good in that space and we think we're a good operator in that space and have a lot of talents and capabilities. So yes, we'll certainly continue there. I would say that, even within the gathering and processing space in particular, it gets pretty hard to match the quality of our cash flows given our contracts and the growth opportunity that we have around some of our business. And so, I would tell you, anytime we're going to look at anything, it's going to be a mix of quality of cash flows. We've got a pretty highbrow mix of cash flows that I think's pretty hard to compete with, both in the current and in the forward-looking.","Timm Schneider","Got it. And lastly, I mean, if I look at your geographic footprint, are you guys kind of happy with the basins you're in right now? Or is there anything else that you'd like to be in? And obviously, there I'm kind of hinting at - you guys don't really have - you guys sold some stuff in the Permian. No scale there. Is - did we kind of - is it too late to get in there at this point in a big way? Or is there still some opportunities, if they were available?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, I would just say, first of all, we do have some pretty significant acreage dedication in the Permian that we think could be significant as the play develops. But as we've mentioned, we really don't have all of the vertical integration that a lot of the big players have in there. And frankly, we're not - we don't - we're not interested in paying the kind of multiples that have been getting paid to get in there, because you're not just betting - I mean, there's no upside left when you pay those kind of multiples. And so, I would say, we've seen that as pretty pricey.","But we certainly are taking a look at it as it could impact gas volumes. We have a lot to offer being the Transco system and being able to distribute those volumes to market.","And so we'll continue to keep an eye on any opportunity there and certainly see both the Mexico markets and the LNG markets along the Gulf Coast as something that we're well-positioned to serve and - however we can use our assets to gain competitive advantage towards those alternatives, we're certainly going to be having an eye to. But I would just say, I - there's a lot of well-hill players in that basin. And I think, our - the question we have is, how do we use our skill sets to help take care of some of those volumes. But I think, going head-to-head on the gathering and processing - upstream gathering and processing out there is - looks pretty pricey right now.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Just looking for a little more color around what governs the potential time gap between the greenfield Central Penn Line for Atlantic Sunrise being in service and the compressor station? And if I recall from Analyst Day, the pickup, when you - the month of revenue pickup when the compressor's online is about $11 million a month. Is that correct?","Alan Armstrong","I'm going to turn that to Micheal Dunn here.","Phillip Wright","So let's start with what we hope to put in service this fall with some main line facilities that we have underway right now. So we would expect to start seeing some revenue you heard Alan talk about earlier from that, in the September time frame. And that's really reversals of our compressor stations on the Transco main line as well as one greenfield - sorry, one brownfield compressor addition at one of our existing stations. That does not get us capacity all the way back into the Northeast PA basin, though.","So what we would anticipate, once we get the Central Penn Line completed and that would be about 2 months or so ahead of the greenfield compression in the Central Penn Line. So we would have 2 months there of about 1.2 Bcf a day of capacity that would come out of the basin there that would certainly create an outlet for our customers up there. And then ultimately, the compression coming on line puts us at about 1.7 Bcf a day. So assuming that we get a construction start date this fall, we think it's about a 10-month construction for the entire project. Optimistically, we could get the pipelines in service a few months before that on the greenfield and be able to put about 1.2 Bcf a day in service on that project.","Craig Shere","Okay. So it's really just logistics and construction? There isn't a separate regulatory permitting issue related to the compression?","Micheal Dunn","No. No, there's not. I mean, ultimately, we go to FERC in a few weeks once we get the 102 and 105 permits from Pennsylvania, the 404 for the Corps. We asked for a notice to proceed for the entire project. It's just the timing of the schedule, it just takes longer to build a greenfield compressor stations than it does the greenfield pipeline.","Craig Shere","Understood. And then, any more color around what's going on at Constitution?","Alan Armstrong","I would just say, we continue to expect something coming out of the Second Circuit there. But I would tell you, we were very encouraged by the D.C. circuit ruling on Millennium. And then, basically telling the - that the New York DC had waived and that they should go to the FERC for their permit. That was very instructive, I would say, relative to Constitution. And so we're excited about that. We continue to work with the staff in the White House to move things along, because we think they have the rights to move things along on that project. So it remains a two-pronged approach. But I would tell you that the last month or so here has been encouraging in terms of how the court ruled on the Millennium project and the attention that that's gotten in - within the White House staff. So anyway, just continuing to push on that. Nothing moves very fast on that front. But continue to be encouraged by what we're seeing there.","Craig Shere","Could you still see potential favorable 2017 announcements?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, my patience has been strained, obviously, as long as we've been pushing on that. But yes, I would expect to see some action here in '17 still. So I feel pretty good. Now we've got a lot of work to do to then get the system installed and get through all of the very final permitting issues. But remember, we already have our certificate from FERC from that. And so, I think, the political environment is ripe and I think we either get some help from the courts which there's some probability, but it's a little bit unusual for a court to overrule an agency like that. But we think we've got a very good case in that regard. But I'd probably say, I'm more optimistic about the pathway through both the core and the FERC to gain approval with the White House's assistance on that.","Craig Shere","Great. And last question, Don, I just want to confirm for the third quarter, there's going to be no cash tax drag relating to that Geismar sale up at the C Corp, is that correct?","Donald Chappel","Craig, we do not expect a cash tax drag related to the Geismar sale. There could be a modest amount, but right now, it's expected to be 0 or a very modest amount.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","I just have one question. We've seen some consolidation among producers in the Northeast. It's pretty fragmented up there. So I'm sure we'll continue to see some consolidation as well as acreage changing hands. There's also a whole bunch of producer-sponsored MLPs on the gathering side. Are you seeing any initial signs of any of these guys wanting to monetize? And then, separately, what do we - what do you think we need to see for the opportunity for some of your partners wanting to get out of the JVs they're in with you on? Are we waiting for pipeline capacity on the gas and NGL side to come on? Or is there any other gating items that we should be aware about?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, Christine, good morning and thanks for the good question. Yes, I think the consolidation is well underway. I think that EQT and Sclotterbeck really, I think, onto a path that's important in terms of being a low-cost manufacturer in the basin and they certainly have, with the Rice transaction, would have a tremendous position up there. And I think, we'll continue to see that, where people are really focused on those areas, on the one hand. On the other hand, I would tell you, in some areas, there's just so much remaining drilling locations. For instance, for companies like Cabot, they just have so many remaining locations within the large acreage position they do have that they've got plenty of scale to execute at a low cost in the area.","So I guess, I would say, I do think we'll continue to see consolidation, but maybe for varying reasons up there. On the Midstream side, I do think that we'll continue to see consolidation as well. As you point out rightly, there's a lot of private equity that's had money up there and it's probably getting a little stale and a little ripe, because they've been in those positions for quite a while. And typically, the way they're rewarded is, the management teams have them anxious to get out at some point in time and it's certainly usually inside of 5 years. So I do think, there's going to be some pressure up there. But I think, there's probably just deltas and bid-ask right now between people's expectations and what the market might allow for. And I'd say, we're just in the process of seeing those bid-ask spreads close in on themselves.","So that's kind of how we'd describe that. But I definitely think that we'll see some shift going on up there just like we always do in big, fast growing basins. There's a lot of people to start with and then, the big players tend to consolidate because they've got the right scale, they've got the right cost structure and they've got the right market outlets. And those tend to drive the volumes to those systems. So I think, we'll continue to see some pretty sizable consolidation here in the next 18 months in the Northeast.","Christine Cho","And as a follow-up, when I kind of think about the Northeast, obviously you talked about Cabot. Your gathering should benefit when Atlantic Sunrise comes on. In Southwest PA, do you think the bigger bottleneck is gas pipeline capacity that needs to come on for you guys to see your volumes increase? Or do you think it's more NGL takeaway, like Mariner East?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, the NGL takeaway issue is more an issue of price, right? Because you can clear your barrels. It's a matter of what you get for them by getting them out of there. Versus on the gas side, it's an absolute issue because there's no alternative other than the gas pipeline. But of course you have rail and trucking to get liquids out of there. So I do think the price improvement on NGLs will be welcome to the basin. And that could have some impact. But I clearly think, the biggest issue right now is on gas takeaway, because it's a point of diminishing return on the gas. If you turn any new gas on, not only does that gas get underpriced, you just put price pressure on the other gas that you have in the basin. And so it's a very constrained and finite point in terms of getting gas out of the basin. And so I think, to answer your question, I think gas is probably more important than the liquids.","Operator","We'll go next to Eric Genco, Citi.","Eric Genco","I was just wondering, on Constitution, I'm just trying to remember, if you were to get a Millennium-type decision, how long would it take to put the pipe into service? And can you remind us if there's some seasonal issues? And what type of barriers would be to starting construction and birds nesting, et cetera?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Mike, you want to take that?","Micheal Dunn","Yes. So right now, we would anticipate the earliest we can get that project in is early 2019, so probably second quarter 2019. And there are quite a few windows. But backing into an opportunity to get released this fall, that would put us in the first half of 2019. For an in-service date.","Eric Genco","Okay. And then, in terms of the cost savings in the West, it was pretty impressive. I just wanted to ask, where do you think you are in terms of like what inning? And if could you expand a little more there? And do you think there's more to come in that segment? Or maybe other areas? And just, how that's been going for you?","Micheal Dunn","I'm sorry. Could you repeat the question?","Alan Armstrong","Mike, the question was on cost savings in the West and whether we're - should expect to see a continuation of that improvement.","Micheal Dunn","Yes, thanks for that question. Our team's doing a great job out there taking cost out of their business. And I think, we will continue to seek those opportunities and find opportunities to continue to take costs, not just out of the West business, but the rest of the business where it makes sense. And there's still opportunities there. We have a lot of consolidation, for example, in our measurement systems that - where we had the legacy Access and the legacy Williams measurement systems, for example, that we're consolidating. And we'll be able to continue to take costs out of the business in that fashion. So there's opportunities just like that all across our business. And certainly in West, we'll continue to do that.","Eric Genco","That's great. And final one for me, I just wanted to ask if you've had any recent conversation with the rating agencies? Or if you have any plans to kind of, post the Geismar sale - I realize it was announced a while ago, but just didn't know what the schedule was there.","Micheal Dunn","We're in regular conversation with the agencies. So yes, we update our model and discussions with them and obviously that's a major milestone. So we'll continue those conversations. What they do with it, who knows. But we think our credit is improving steadily and we're hopeful that they'll agree.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.","Alan Armstrong","Okay. Well, great. Well, thank you. Very excited about the quarter and excited about how we're positioned here for the next 12 months and got a lot of exciting things ahead of us continuing to come on. So I appreciate your continued interest in the company and hope you have a great day. Thank you. Bye.","Operator","That does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation."],"22998":["The Williams Cos., Inc. (NYSE:WMB) Q3 2015 Earnings Call October 29, 2015  9:00 AM ET","Executives","John D.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John D. Porter - Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Michelle. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com.","These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions. And we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us. Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL and Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P.","In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to General Accepted Accounting Principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","With that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. Thanks for being on the call with this early this morning. Before we discuss our third quarter results, I'd like to provide a brief update on the transaction we announced with Energy Transfer on September 28. We are on the path to completion and we expect to file the proxy statement soon. The transaction will then be subject to SEC review and regulatory approval and is expected to close in the first half of 2016.","With that, I want to reiterate that the focus of today's call is going to be on our financial and operational results for the third quarter. And I ask that you please keep your questions focused on our results, and I want to thank you in advance for your cooperation on that. So we are going to hold tight to that.","And so, now, just some brief thoughts on the fundamentals relevant to the third quarter and the industry in general. Overall, I have to say, it really was a great third quarter for us from an operational performance perspective, a project delivery perspective, and progress towards future growth. We remain very focused on execution, on cost management, and taking advantage of the great asset positioning that our strategy has delivered, and I think this focus really showed up here in the third quarter.","Importantly, despite the fundamental pressures on our industry from dramatically lower commodity prices, we've continued with very substantial growth in our adjusted EBITDA and DCF, so really, really showing the strength as we continue to see prices erode and some really dramatically low NGL prices in the quarter, but our strategy of continuing to invest in these big fee-based projects is really starting to overwhelm those lower prices.","And so that's not to say we aren't feeling some of the effects of the low commodity prices directly in our commodity margins and indirectly via the volume shut in on some of our gathering systems, particularly in the Northeast. However, because of our unique position, we continue to deliver strong results and we see strong growth ahead from our projects, especially on the demand or market side of our business as the U.S. industries and the international markets look to take advantage of North America's abundant and low-cost natural gas supplies.","The North American producers continue to really amaze us and continue to innovate and deliver production at costs levels that no one thought was possible even a year ago, and while this has led to painfully over-supplied markets in the short-term, it continues to lead the way towards growing demand and expanding prosperous markets for natural gas and natural gas derivatives. And so, over the long-term, we think we're really seeing a supply-led expansion, and I know that people are getting impatient about that, but I can assure you, as you look through our backlog of projects, it's very evident to us that that capital is going in place to pave the way for growing demand.","So the current barrier to the success that we speak of and look forward to really is the low-cost access to these expanding markets and that's in the way of pipelines primarily, but also other infrastructure required. And we are certainly building out this capacity, it is not just important for Williams, but for the industry, and it's also important for the North American economy. And we really are very excited to be taking on these important challenges at Williams and see it as a critical next role in really delivering the tremendous value that the North American producers have developed via their innovation and continue the learnings in developing our low-cost resources here in the U.S.","So with that, let's move on to slide two. Overall, our strong third quarter results underscore the effectiveness of our strategy to connect the best natural gas supply to the best markets with all this fee-based infrastructure we continue to invest in. This accounted for more than 90% of our gross margin during the quarter and will continue to be that for quite some time. And the tremendous efforts by our teams to deliver the continuous string of large-scale infrastructure projects required to realize the fruits of the strategy.","Once again, we showed our ability to deliver substantial growth in EBITDA and DCF despite much lower commodity prices; and in fact, four segments of our five segments realized substantial growth and our fee-based revenue, which was up over $200 million in the quarter, overwhelmed the dramatic drop in commodity margins from the third quarter of 2014. Additionally, our DCF of $754 million delivered a 1.04 coverage, and that's even without recognizing the benefit of the $209 million IDR waiver for the quarter that was associated with the WPZ\/WMB merger termination.","So let me now drill into the drivers for this 21% improvement in EBITDA for the third quarter of 2015 to the third quarter of 2014 comparison. First of all, big congratulations to our Atlanta-Gulf team who delivered $414 million for the quarter, up 53%. Even more impressive was that this was in the face of dramatically lower NGL margins in the Gulf Coast, and the drivers for this strong performance were a lot of projects continuing that were brought on earlier in the year, things like Gulfstar One, Discovery's Keathley Canyon Connector, but also a full quarter on new Transco projects, including Rockaway Lateral in New York.","In addition to that, the team also delivered a new project during the third quarter, which was the first phase of the Virginia Southside lateral, which our team delivered on time; and we also were able to get some early revenues from the mainline services associated with the Leidy Southeast project, and that we brought in those revenues well ahead of schedule. Of course, the Leidy Southeast lateral is not yet online, but the mainline portion for gas flowing from that lateral, we were able to bring some of that on early. So great job by both our commercial team and our project teams in continuing to deliver (08:32) on that. And as you'll see on the next page, you'll see a string of projects that Atlantic-Gulf continues to grow as we provide capacity for the demand side of this growing natural gas market.","At the Access level, $351 million of adjusted EBITDA. That was up 9% on \u2013 this is really driven on fee-based revenue growth, of course, and we saw both the mix of volume growth and contractual benefits across multiple areas provide steady growth in EBITDA despite challenging commodity prices in those basins as well. Specifically, the increase in adjusted EBITDA between 2014 and 2015 was driven by higher fee-based volumes and contractual support from the minimum volume commitment agreements, as well as the increased ownership interest in the Utica East Ohio Midstream. And so, as you'll recall, we transacted on that earlier in the year, and so that delivered here for us in the third quarter as we stepped that up. And this was despite that area being impacted by very low commodity prices in this basin for both gas and NGLs. And so we did see some shut-ins in that area that were fairly significant in the third quarter, but we've seen a lot of that production return to service now, headed into the fourth quarter.","In the Northeast G&P, $87 million, up 28%, also on higher fee-based revenue and this certainly during the quarter \u2013 a few things to note here, price-related shut-ins from our producers did dramatically impact the fee-based revenue growth on our gathering volumes, but this \u2013 we still managed to grow those volumes by 13% despite some very large shut-ins in the quarter. And as well, our volumes processed. So the inlet volumes to our (10:34) processing plants actually grew by over 40% and NGL production was up 2.5 times last year's production; thanks to new processing facilities that were installed in the first quarter at OVM.","Of course, the NGL & Petchem, I was glad to see a solid quarter of operations from the expanded Geismar plant, and the team hit some very impressive production levels during the quarter as they really started to learn what they could do with the new facility there, but unfortunately, the ethylene margins that we realized during the quarter were much lower than we had expected earlier. But again, from an operational perspective, some nice performance coming from the team there. Canada also had strong production levels with propylene sales being up 29%, but also suffered weak pricing in the propylene area there as well.","The NGL services side had a strong operating quarter as well. And so when we speak of that, that's our NGL transportation and storage piece that's in our (11:40) NGL & Petchem unit. And actually saw the NGL transport volumes on our Overland Pass Pipeline go up by 59%. So overall, a big step up in adjusted EBITDA from $22 million to up to $85 million for this business unit in the quarter.","And then, finally, while the West saw a 28% decline in its adjusted EBITDA to $161 million really driven by dramatically lower NGL margins, it really was a good operating quarter in terms of the team doing everything they could to deliver the best numbers. And we really saw that show up in the way of lower operating costs, and the team was able to hold our fee-based service revenues flat versus third quarter of 2014. And so really, really great effort by the teams out there to keep the volumes continuing to flow out there and continue to reduce our costs.","The NGL unit margins that we realized in the West actually were at a 10-year low, as we saw NGL \u2013 sorry, we saw NGL sales fall by over $70 million this year in the 3Q versus 3Q comparison. Total volumes on Northwest Pipeline were up 14% and this is due to both the increased use of natural gas for power generation in the Northwestern states as well as some basis differential spreads that were existing between prices like ACO (13:21) and the Western states. So really a good sign. I'll tell you, (13:23) when we see volumes pick up, even though they're interruptible and people taking use of the capacity, when you see that kind of increase in our throughput volumes on the system, that's always a good sign for long-term firm (13:35) sales, which is really where we make our money on a pipe like that.","So moving on to slide three here, just a picture here of the continued delivery of projects and great job of our team continuing to put these projects into service. We said back in the first half of the year that the demand side of the natural gas market is driving our capital investments, and I want to touch on some of these projects here.","First of all, the Transco Virginia Southside, as I mentioned earlier, was placed into service in September of 2015, and, of course, we look forward in the fourth quarter here to see the benefit of a full quarter there rather than just the one month. I also would just note there, really impressive execution by our team who really had some very difficult obstacles to overcome in the construction in that area, and I won't bore you with all of the details, but I would just say that the ability to deliver that on schedule given some of the obstacles that the team faced there was very impressive, and I want to recognize the great efforts there.","On Gulfstar One, we continue to see strong fee-based contributions to EBITDA. Lots of work going on right now out on that platform to tie back the Gunflint prospect and to further improve production from the existing completed wells. On the \u2013 moving to the Discovery facilities, continue high utilization on the KCC system. We continue to see record volumes on that system and the team is doing everything they can to maximize throughput, because there is a lot of throughput wanting to get through that system right now. And as well, we're seeing a lot of exciting growth on the horizon for this investment as well. And so really excited about the future for Discovery out there, both in the current and in the future.","On the Northeast G&P, on our gathering processing in the Northeast; we did execute the Pennant JV. And just to give you a little bit of color on that. That's a joint venture that really allowed us to take advantage of some large dedications that we had up in the area and that were some legacy acreage dedicated into that (15:59) we had up there and we were able to combine those acreage dedications with some players that already had some flowing production in the area as well as already had a lot of the capital invested in some new infrastructure up there.","So really excited about the work that our team did there to take advantage of our acreage dedication and find a way to work with partners in the area. That's a very capital efficient way for us to monetize some of those big acreage dedications up there in Northwest Pennsylvania and Northeast Ohio.","On the dry Utica side, of course, we announced a significant increase in the dry Utica acreage from Chesapeake in the quarter. But we also are really excited to see some significant dry Utica wells showing up in the OVM area, so right there, just to the East of the Ohio River, right in our backyard there in OVM, and really seeing some impressive wells that are being completed on the same pads that were earlier developed for the Marcellus-rich area, and really this is a common story here for the Northeast; just tremendous resource potential up there, and an ability to produce a lot of gas at very low cost.","But we sit here and \u2013 as a whole industry \u2013 and really are anxious to see the new takeaway into the structure (17:17) goes into service. And I'll just tell you, there is a lot of growth potential for the future up here and really just dependent \u2013 not really on improved prices from where we are today really, just access to those markets both on the gas and the NGL side. So really, really excited to see the opportunities continue and the growth for the future up here just continues to expand its horizon for us.","On the Haynesville, the 2016 and 2017 MVC cash flows were unchanged via our contract renegotiation with Chesapeake and we were able to extend our dedication through 2035, and also brought in a very substantial additional drilling commitment, which will drive those increased volumes beyond the end of the MVC obligations there in 2017. So great job. I know there has been a lot of debate out there. But I'll tell you, from my perspective, any time we can hold our current cash flows \u2013 commitment to cash flows via those MVCs and expand the Horizon and help a customer continue to grow for the future and us enjoy that growth with them, I think that is a win-win. I'm really proud of the team and very excited to continue to work with Chesapeake on finding ways that are mutually beneficial to our organizations.","At Geismar, the expanded plant, as I mentioned earlier is meeting our production expectations, and it actually \u2013 even though some very hot periods will tend to lower our throughput capability, we hit some pretty impressive numbers relative to our expectation in production for the quarter and expect to see that continue here into the fourth quarter.","We also announced the fee-based off-take contract that we executed for the Alberta PDH facility and we are moving to the next phase of project development, and we do expect the FID or the final investment decision in the third quarter of 2016. But I would tell you, a lot of great work going on there by the teams and really it's hard work to make sure we know (19:42) exactly what our estimate is going to be and that we execute that project in a flawless manner. So a lot of time and care being taken on the front end to get that right, exactly how we ought to be taking on a big project like that.","In addition, looking forward, I want to touch on just a few projects that are going to come on later this year. First of all, the Transco Leidy Southeast expansion. Really important, not just for the cash flows that that project will deliver, but as well, because it's going to provide additional gas takeaway of about 525 million a day coming out that'll be in service in the fourth quarter of 2015.","Our Canadian Offgas Processing project, a project we refer to as Horizon; we expect that to be mechanically complete here in the fourth quarter of 2015. We don't expect any meaningful cash flow from this asset until first quarter of 2016 as we'll be starting this up in the dead of winter up in Fort McMurray, Alberta; and if you've ever been up there in that part of the year you know what I am talking about. So great job by the teams really trying to push through to get that project completed and we are looking forward to bringing that big project on line and into service well during 2016.","And then finally, our Kodiak tieback to our Devils Tower platform, is expected to come on in the fourth quarter of 2015. And a lot of times this gets left off of our project list just because we're not spending the capital on that, so it doesn't show up as a major project where we're being reimbursed what capital we are spending, I should say. But it is a very meaningful additional to our cash flow. And so it really is an exciting project for us and continues to show that our deepwater strategy is alive and well with Devils Tower moving into its, I guess,12th or 13th year now of operation.","Once again \u2013 I think there is a very extensive list and I'm proud of our teams for the progress they continue to make and the growth they're delivering, and Williams really does have a truly unique position in terms of our asset footprint and the kind of projects that we continue to string together.","Moving on to slide four, you can see here a list of demand-driven projects. It is very significant. So while most of the attention in the industry for the past year or so has been focused on prices, production curtailments and shut-ins; we've really been focused on serving the growing demand side for natural gas and we expect to see that continue. And as you can see from this chart, much of our growth potential for the future is on the demand side of the business. We think that's critical to expand out into those key markets and we're really pleased to be positioned the way we are.","Our focus is especially important in the Northeast where we've got many producers up there that are really, really critical to them to get access to those markets, and we take those obligations very serious to get those developed and working hard to overcome continued regulatory and political hurdles that exist in getting all this big infrastructure in place up there. And so in the Northeast, while we, as I mentioned earlier, we did have quite a bit of gas shut-in in the third quarter, it really is a great opportunity for us as we continue to invest out.","In fact, if we touch where we're (23:31) invested in in these assets in the Northeast, we're exposed to these assets that gather nearly a third of all the gas being produced up there. And so as we are able to develop our own infrastructure for takeaway as well as peers in the industry, we're going to see some tremendous growth that does not depend on additional drilling rigs because there's \u2013 not only is there a lot of gas shut-in for economic reasons up there today, we also have a tremendous amount of drilled and uncompleted wells and a big inventory of that, that again is just waiting on the right price signals not from the Henry Hub kind of natural gas prices but they are locally in the area. So we're excited to be working to get our customers exposed in that area.","Moving on to slide five, to sum up some of the things that we went over today. I would reiterate that the quarter's results were a direct reflection of our strategy to uniquely position Williams to connect the very best natural gas supplies to the very best markets, and I really think it's hard for anybody else to make that claim in terms of how we're positioned in the natural gas market there. Very unique in that regard and we've worked hard to get there.","The fact that we're delivering record quarterly DCF and record adjusted EBITDA through some of the tough headwinds for the industry is a real testament to the teams at Williams that are out there every day executing on our plan, working hard to deliver results for our shareholders. And we remain very focused on executing against our natural gas focused strategy and are very pleased with the results we've delivered here in the third quarter. And importantly, our backlog of projects continues to grow as we see the demand side of the natural gas story continue to develop. Sustainable low-cost reserves only serve to fuel the story of demand growth and we're excited to be a part of what will be a tremendous growth of the future.","So with that, we'll move to the Q&A session. And I'd just like to remind everyone that the purpose of today's call is to discuss our operational and financial results for the third quarter of 2015, and I ask that you please limit your questions to these topics. And I want to thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation on this. I know there's a lot of interest in understanding the transaction, but we're going to be limiting our comments today to the Williams operations and our performance here for the third quarter and drivers for the future.","So with that, we'll turn it over to questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Brandon Blossman of Tudor, Pickering, Holt Company (sic) [Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.] (26:49) Please go ahead.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, Alan; everyone.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Let's see here. There is quite a bit. I guess just a little bit of bookkeeping; in terms of project timing in the Northeast, any incremental color on Constitution and getting that kicked off?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. We've gotten through all the work with DEQ with New York and that was kind of our final barrier up there. We are working with the Governor's Office to understand what \u2013 the cause of delay of getting that permit out, but that is kind of the final issue that we're waiting on. And so we're working to understand that. A lot of great work going on by the teams there to get the \u2013 past the requirement for the New York DEC (27:46), but we think we've gotten there. So really just up against getting the Governor's Office to sign off on that and then we'll be in a position to get that done for the fourth quarter of 2016.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And so still on track for that timeline?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","The new Edmonton PDH facility, any color in terms of just how competitive that market is? Obviously, that's a much needed project in that region. Are there other folks competing for similar projects there? And just across your footprint, do other PDH units make sense, and what's the competitive landscape for those types of projects?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Great question. Well, I'd tell you that, that PDH project is very, very unique from our perspective, and that it's taking advantage of very low-cost propylene that's already in the area as well as the propylene that we would make with the new PDH facility. And so we, for quite some time, wanted to see polypropylene unit and downstream derivatives be developed in the area, because it's just a logistics game. So today a lot of that propylene is going into the Gulf Coast being converted into various derivatives, in particularly polypropylene, and then being railed back up into the Midwest market. And so this project takes advantage of that low-cost propane there in the basin and low-cost propylene that comes directly off of those big delayed cokers in the oil sands and then just transports it in directly into those Midwest markets and also will have access to international market out of places like Port of Vancouver.","So really excited to be teamed up with the Goradia Capital Group and a huge marketer of derivative projects \u2013 derivative products around the world, and really excited to have them as a partner there. And I would tell you, the next available project to us is clearly a PDH 2 facility there and they're very interested in that and we certainly have plenty of product, as we continue to expand our upstreams oil sands operations, we've got a lot of propylene that we want to find a better home for than having to be railed into the Gulf Coast.","So I would just tell you it really is a logistics play for us. We're not depending on the kind of propane basis differential that we've been living on up there, but we do expect the propane to be long there in Canada for quite some time and we really look to all kinds of alternatives for other uses of the propane and other logistics for the propane and really excited PDH is a great answer up there, especially with somebody coming \u2013 partnering with us to develop the derivative business for us. So exciting opportunity, not just for us, but really for the province of Alberta and allows them to take advantage of their very low-cost resources in that basin as well.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Awesome. Got it. Thank you. Very interesting.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much. (31:17)","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Christine Cho of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","My first question has to do with CapEx; year-to-date, it's been trending a lot lower than the guidance we got five months ago. And I'm guessing most of it is due to lower than expected spending in the Northeast and for the Access assets. Is the run rate of spending that we've seen for the first three quarters a good indicator for what to expect in fourth quarter? And how much of the spending would you say has been delayed? And is this more of a timing thing into 2016? Or is some of this stuff indefinitely postponed until pricing signals improve, like you've mentioned?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Christine, I would actually say \u2013 I'll separate that. The maintenance capital piece, a number of drivers on that, but we still have a lot of maintenance capital work out in front of us. And just so you know kind of how we forecast that, a lot of that maintenance capital is invested in the inspection and improvement of our pipeline system. And so we go through the smart pigging process and we basically have to estimate the number of repairs or anomalies that we'll find when we do that inspection; and so that's how we do that.","When we don't have as many anomalies show up or as many repairs required, then we don't have as much maintenance capital to spend. And so we still have quite a bit of inspection in front of us for the balance of the year and we would expect that maintenance capital continue to be pretty strong going into the fourth quarter. But clearly, it's a matter of us estimating at the first of the year (33:07) the amount of work we think we're going to have. And when we don't find those anomalies, then that's the money that we put back in our pocket, so to speak. But we have a lot of work out in front of us for both the third quarter and \u2013 sorry, into the fourth quarter and into 2016.","On the growth capital side, that is somewhat driven by things like we would have hoped to have been started on Constitution by now, for instance. And so that is projects like that. But there are a lot of projects that we actually are seeing lower costs come in. And so, up in the Northeast, for instance, on our build-out in the Susquehanna County area, the capital \u2013 the team has been doing a great job up there, bringing in costs lower and as well on Atlantic Sunrise; we've continued to enjoy cost savings on that big project as well. So I would say the delay component is probably -that's built in there, is probably Constitution, and but there are some pretty substantial savings that are coming through in our numbers as well.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay, great. And then on the heels of that, it looks like you funded all the CapEx with debt in third quarter. I'm assuming you couldn't really tap the ATM PZ (34:24) while undergoing a strategic review, but how should we think about CapEx funding between now and closing of the deal at the parent?","I realize that IDR waivers are going to help some, but can you tap the ATM markets given the uncertainty around the future of PZ (34:37)? And even if you could, I'm assuming you don't want to when the units are yielding 11% and credit metrics are high. So how should we think about this? Because I would think that you can't solely lean on the balance sheet for the next six months to nine months.","Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Christine, this is Don. Good morning.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning.","Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","First, I'd say that I think the cost of equity capital is unusually high as a result of the high level of uncertainty regarding the energy industry right now. We expect that that will settle down, and in time here that the market will certainly reward the advantaged companies relative to those that are less advantaged or disadvantaged and cost of capital will make more sense as we move forward. We have a variety of options ahead of us, and the ATM is certainly one of those and we'll be balancing obviously cost and risk and \u2013 with a combination of debt and equity to finance and keep WPZ at investment grade ratings.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Can you go into further detail about alternatives to the ATM?","Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Christine, I think the alternatives we have are probably the same as most of the other industry participants. So I'm not going to delve into the variety of options because there are many, but I would say there are a number of options, and we'll evaluate all of those in an effort to find the lowest-cost solution while balancing risk and maintaining those ratings. And again, I would say that obviously WPZ has a supportive parent as well.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Last question from me, can you quantify how much gas was shut in in the Northeast for third quarter and for how long? And then, also, Alan, you mentioned that there is a lot of wells waiting on completion. Can you quantify that behind your acreage as well?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're certainly not going to pinpoint anything for \u2013 which producers and so forth on that, but Jim Scheel, if you'll take that question generally?","James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P","Sure. For the third quarter in the, what I'd call the dry Northeast, we had a significant amount of volume shut in in the Bradford and Susquehanna Counties. We probably had about 350 million a day in Susquehanna and upwards of 400 million a day in Bradford, so pretty significant for the quarter shut-ins. Again, these are all price-related shut-ins.","As you look at the OVM area or the Ohio River Supply Hub, we had about 150 shut-ins starting the middle of the quarter. We'll see that as we look at our reduced volume growth year-over-year in that particular area. And then, we saw shut-ins also of about 300 million in the Utica, those have come off. Those are \u2013 we are now flowing at full rate. In fact, this weekend we had a Bcf production at the Utica Supply Hub for the first time.","So right now we have about 900 million shut-ins. As Alan indicated at the very beginning of the presentation, there's a number of other opportunities for us to grow volume besides the shut-in volumes including uncompleted wells, and that's true both in the Northeast portion of the Utica as well as \u2013 I mean, the Marcellus as well as the wet Marcellus in the South. Those give us a great amount of potential for future volumes. And as we look at our rig counts, we see those holding relatively steady as we go from 2015 to 2016, probably actually seeing a \u2013 although it'll probably stay at 15, it could go up by a couple of rigs over the course of that timeframe. Does that answer your question?","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thank you so much for all the color. Congrats on a good quarter.","James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P","Thanks.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Donald R. Chappel - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Good morning.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just wanted to follow up on that last point there a little bit if I could. As far as the 900 shut-in that you talked about, is there \u2013 do you have any visibility to that coming back online as far as, is there certain price points or other kind of regional de-bottlenecks you think that could help get that flowing, or any color there would be great?","James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P","Alan, would you like me to take that one?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Please, Jim. Thank you.","James E. Scheel - Senior Vice President, Northeast G&P","All right. Sure. Obviously, we've talked about Henry Hub pricing and the basis differential, as I think you're aware. The basis differentials from the Northeast to market pricing have been significant. Many of our producers have been seeing realized prices in the $0.70 price range and that is pretty significant. But we have a number of opportunities, those of you remember at Analyst Day, perhaps, there are a number of projects including Constitution, Atlantic Sunrise which we're driving that are going to help bring the critical infrastructure we need to really unlock the value of these resources for our producers. In addition to that, you've got (40:19). You've got Leach. You've got Mountaineer.","There are a number of industry solutions coming as we look forward into 2016 and 2017 that will help narrow those basis differentials and really unlock value for our producers in order to not only relieve the shut-in gas, but also really drive up the production rates. I think as we see that come on \u2013 we've already seen the Leidy expansion which is half a Bcf a day of incremental production coming on line that will help alleviate some of that as we go forward. But I \u2013 although we're not giving guidance as it relates to future year volume growth, I would just say, as we see that basis differential come down we're \u2013 if our producers saw the $2 pricing, we would see just tremendous volume growth in the Northeast.","And then, finally, we need to look at winter pricing and weather-related issues as we go into the winter of this year, could also help improve some of those differentials and increase our Northeast volumes.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for that. So it sounds like some of these takeaway solutions, probably, at least a few quarters off, if not a big longer, so takeaway won't necessarily help in the near-term, but if weather can improve that basis that could potentially be more of a near-term catalyst to help you guys out there?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would just add to that. Thank you for the question. I would just add to that, certainly, as Jim mentioned, in the near-term, we have the Leidy Southeast, that's 525 million a day. So that's pretty substantial. Because a lot of that Northeast volume is gathered by our system, we should expect to see some of that relief parlayed (42:17) directly to our gathering assets up there. As well, I would just say, as you mentioned, we are in a fairly warm shoulder here and certainly in the cold \u2013 not just for the sake of gas prices in the Northeast, but as well for NGL prices and particularly propane, we'll see some relief during the winter like we always do as that propane is called on to deliver local markets rather than it being transported from the South, the way it used to be.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for that. And then just looking at Atlantic-Gulf. It was quite a nice quarter all take (42:56). And I was just curious were there any kind of weather or one-time benefits that helped with the quarter there? Or did the quarter really perform in line with your budget and this is kind of a new run rate to think about there?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I'll take it. I don't know if we have Rory on line, he may want to provide some more detail, but \u2013 no, it really was just a matter of these big projects really starting to mount up and it really was a matter of having a full quarter. There really wasn't any seasonal issues. In fact, volumes on Transco on a, just a throughput basis were actually a little bit lighter and that's just based on moderate weather relative to last year's moderate weather. And remember, we don't really make the \u2013 Transco doesn't get driven up\/down (43:43) all that much by seasonal just because all the capacity is sold out firm and so it really doesn't move with throughput (43:53). But the answer to your question is, no, there was nothing seasonal about it, it's just these big projects are starting to pile up (43:59).","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. That's it from me. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. Congratulations on a nice quarter.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning. Thank you.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good to be above one times coverage.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. It is.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","So on Christine's CapEx question, Alan, you referenced some cost savings in Susquehanna and at Atlantic Sunrise, and I'm just wondering is the bulk of that kind of project-specific with good execution or just across the board are we starting to see industry-wide material and labor cost deflation?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say in the case of the Susquehanna Supply Hub, a couple of things: that team has really worked hard to take advantage of the scale of the installation of our compression and our gathering lines up there, and they've worked very hard with the Access team to really pull together our very best thoughts about the way to put infill compression, and so that kind of thinking is really starting to pay off for us out there, and just a real intense focus on tight project controls and execution.","So without any doubt in my mind in the Susquehanna Supply Hub area, it is better execution by our team and years of focusing on better projects execution really starting to pay off up there. And that really \u2013 it's really nice to see the teams bringing the best ideas of both organizations together and really showing up in a tangible way there.","On Atlantic Sunrise, I would just say that given the uncertainties that we've seen in putting in these big infrastructure projects \u2013 we've built in quite a bit of contingency into these projects, and as we deliver those projects we are able to \u2013 and start to have some of those things quantified, we're able to reduce some of that contingency. What we also did see is, as we announced earlier, we did see some lower cost on materials particularly pipe and so it's a little bit of both on Atlantic Sunrise, I would argue.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay, great. And where is the current state of Geismar utilization?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","John Dearborn, you want to take that please?","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Sure. I'd be glad to, Alan. Thanks. And Craig here is where we are. You'll notice in our results we're reporting that Geismar's running at \u2013 we sold about 404 million pounds this quarter. I'll remind you that that's WPZ's share of Geismar, so Geismar actually sold more closer to \u2013 or produced closer to 450 million pounds, between 450 million pounds and 460 million pounds in this quarter. We have been running a bit of propane as a feedstock as we bring the plant back into operation. And so there's about another 18 million pounds of propylene that we've been producing there.","Net-net, when you add all that up and make some adjustments and simplifying assumptions, so you can calculate a utilization rate we, over the quarter, ran about an average of 98%. But let me take you a little further on that. We're extraordinarily pleased with the Geismar team, the Geismar family there, because they have been setting production records that are yet in excess of that and we have a bit of upside yet to be found in that. We have two transformers that are yet scheduled to be replaced in next year that could help the team to further hone or find some increments. So I would say setting the expectation, we have a little bit of upside yet on volume out of Geismar, but it's running extraordinarily well here during this quarter and we're really grateful of the team and all the efforts they put into restoring the safe and reliable operations of that unit.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","That's great, John. I know it's been a long road there and it's terrific to hear such a good quarter in terms of execution.","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.","Appreciate your comments. Thank you.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Last question is the PDH project, still somewhere in the neighborhood of perhaps $1 billion investment or almost then \u2013 picking up on the answer to Brandon's question, is there any thought about the gap in timing that could be for a second PDH project after the first one is online?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'll go ahead and take that real quickly. As to the costs, we're not going to disclose that until we go for our FID on that. And so really good work done by fine-tuning our estimates. And we do think it's a good time to be building up there, but we've certainly looked around the industry and seen what's going on on several of the other PDH projects and have been careful to take note of that as we continue to refine our estimates up there.","So I would say that we've had kind of two things. On one hand we've been taking note of some of the project cost across the industry on that; and on the other hand, we are seeing favorable conditions in Alberta, but we really don't want to book that, if you will, into our estimate, and are hopeful that will provide some upside on our costs there. So big investment and we'll be providing \u2013 we're not going to be providing that number just yet until we get to the FID report, at least further along.","On the gap in timing for PDH 2, really good question. That's a difficult issue, because you don't want to change scope in the middle of your project. I would tell you we have done a lot to make sure that when we do put in the PDH 2 or if we get to that decision that we've got all the space and auxiliary and the planning both on the propylene side and on the polypropylene side thought through, so I would just say we're making investment thinking about the future for PDH 2. And we do think the returns for PDH 2 project would be very attractive, but we're really just trying to keep our focus tightly on the scope of PDH 1 to start with. So I'd just say we're not ready to bring forth a PDH 2 decision just yet, but we are planning for the future.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Understood. Congratulations again on the quarter.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Darren Horowitz of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Alan, just one quick question for you. I realize you're still evaluating like you said that scope of PDH 1, but as we're trying to put some numbers around the profitability of the volume commitments that you announced in addition to obviously the low feedstock cost, is the biggest influence at arbitrage (51:44) between the level of currently produced refinery-grade propylene and where you see the demand growth for PGP and the derivatives? And that's the big driver? Or as we start to model this, do you see maybe the domestic PGP and derivatives demand significantly increasing, or maybe more margin opportunity like you said for international export? I'm just trying to figure out the drivers as to how we should think about the profitability of this plant and possibly PDH 2 over the next couple of years?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Good question. I would say really the party that will be having the lion's share of that exposure obviously would be our partner who would be in the business of marketing that product, polypropylene product, and certainly that's their expertise.","And I think they're really excited about the markets they think this very low-cost supply can get into. From our vantage point, we're going to be very focused on producing propylene at a low cost and into that contract that is a fee-based contract. And so that's what we're going to be very focused on. And while we do have some exposure to the profitability over the time of that, primarily our focus is going to be on just driving volumes at a low cost and selling them to a fee-based contract.","Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Ted Durbin of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Ted J. Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. I would love to ask about the Appalachian Connector project. You mentioned the fact that producers are really interested in getting their gas uptown and it seems like a good solution, but there are some competing projects that look like they're along the same lines there. So just wondering if you \u2013 what the discussions are with producers, their willingness to commit to volumes, any range of sort of CapEx or return you might expect on a project like that?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would just say we've been looking at a number of alternatives on that project. The thing that we \u2013 the two drivers, I would tell you is, this continued demand for natural gas in the Southeast and power generation markets and Transco being so uniquely positioned to be able to expand cheaply out of Station 165 to the South. And so that's a huge carrot, if you will, that we have uniquely available to us and we're using that to bring forward the very best project for the market. So I would just say it's pretty fluid, but that's a very \u2013 almost immovable opportunity, if you will, that is uniquely ours and provides us an ability to enter into the very best project but we want to make sure we can maximize that value after all the other investments have been made. So that's the first piece of that.","Second piece of that, I would say, is that the kind of volumes that we're seeing from the dry Utica are just continuing to impress us and some tremendous volumes up there that we think are going to \u2013 cost is going to continue to lower on, and those are the drivers. So I would just say, we think the need for this project will be out there and we think we've got some unique positions that allow us to maximize the profitability when we do decide to invest in that project.","Ted J. Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you for that. And then a little more housekeeping here, but the \u2013 now, that we have Geismar up and running, the operating costs in the NGL & Petchem Services, is this sort of a good run rate that we saw in the quarter; or is there any other puts and takes there as we think about it going forward?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","John, you want to take that please?","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. Glad to do that. Great question and thanks for it, Ted. I guess the run rate, if I thought about the earnings in the absence of any commodity price volatility, the earnings would be a reasonable run rate to look at for the business coming through this quarter. As I think Alan mentioned, Geismar is contributing. NGL services had a reasonably good quarter for NGL services in Canada with its commodity exposure, was probably third on the list there. As you're looking at the costs, we may have experienced some costs in this quarter that are just slightly higher than we would have expected for particularly the Geismar unit, but that would be on the order of just a few million dollars, so I wouldn't expect the costs to be hugely different going forward as the run rate goes, Ted. Hope that answers your question.","Ted J. Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Perfect. That's it from me. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ted.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Becca Followill of U.S. Capital Advisors. Please go ahead.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Becca.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","(57:17) on the Chesapeake recent negotiation on the Haynesville MVCs, can you talk about what happens in a low gas price environment? Do they have an option for an outpay (57:26) or do they need to continue to drill into that agreement?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. I don't want to be too specific, but, first of all, for 2016 and 2017, as we mentioned earlier, our cash flow from the MVC has not changed, so there really is no change on that. And relative to the obligation to drill, that is a firm obligation and there isn't any out for pricing (57:51).","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","And then post 2017?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well 2017, that's when those MVCs ended naturally under the contract, so (58:03).","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Okay.","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.","And the design of the drilling obligation was to ensure that the volumes as the 2017 period ended were at a relatively high level.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So that really was really great trade for both of us on that. We allowed them to bring \u2013 combine those fields and allow them to put the best economics to work on their capital, but in exchange to that we both got a longer-term and better expectations for volumes and growth (58:39) in the future. So really (58:40) to find a winner and a loser on that, but I would just tell you from my vantage point, and believe me we've studied it hard that really, really is a win-win. And it only makes sense that there is, because when you're forcing people to make uneconomic capital decisions and you allow them to make better capital decisions you improve the lot (59:00) for both parties.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Thank you. And then can you talk about discussions with them? Are discussions continuing to maybe renegotiate some other of these contracts?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","I would just say that we're \u2013 we think those were the bulk of the opportunities, but we'll continue to look for opportunities if there are growth opportunities. And so always, always happy to work with them, great relationship developed there, and we're very, very thankful to have them as a customer. We think they're a great operator and have been very fair to work with. So we'll continue to look for opportunities, but we don't have anything immediately to offer on.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Thank you.","Alan S.

How are you?","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","I'm great. Thanks for all the color this morning. A lot of it's been a hit already, but just maybe two questions from me. The Gulf Connector project, looks like the proposed capacity there came down quite a bit from where you were before. Just wondering on any color you could offer on that project, either costing-wise or counterparty-wise your thoughts on initial versus maybe future expansion opportunities on the side then (01:00:23)?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure. Thanks for the question. Rory, would you take that question please?","Rory Lee Miller - Senior Vice President, Atlantic \u2013 Gulf Operating Area","Sure. Yeah. Good eye there, Christopher. Those numbers did change a little bit quarter-to-quarter. When we initially had that open season we had requests for much more capacity than we could handle, so we moved forward with two parties, and one of those parties has stepped out and decided that they are not going to pursue signing the agreements and making the commitment. So we've reduced the size of the project. Now, that's kind of the bad news.","The good news is, some of those \u2013 one of the other players that wanted to get in, but couldn't is now going to have an opportunity to come into the project. So the project is going to be a bit smaller but the returns actually go up on the project. So we still think it's a very high quality project and one we're excited about pursuing. And kind of as you hinted out in your question, that does leave us some additional capacity that we have to work with for new opportunities that we think are going to be out there.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the color on that. I guess switching gears and this is just my second question. Alan, really appreciate the update on shut-ins in the Northeast and your volumetric projections and thoughts around that there. Was curious if we pivot to the West performance, at least as we were thinking about it, it was pretty solid mostly on the pricing front this quarter. Just wondering how you're thinking about producer activities out there; potential volume movements as we move into 2016 out there?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure. I'd just say that the producers just continue to find ways to bring in additional production out there as well with very, very few rigs running. But continue to find ways to do that, and as well are being very efficient with that. We are seeing some things that are pretty interesting out there in terms of new development. But I think our hope for that right now is to just \u2013 in the current pricing environment is to keep driving our unit costs low and keep the volumes as flat as possible, is kind of our expectation.","The good news about the West relative to what we're seeing in the East is that, there's plenty of takeaway capacity, plenty of infrastructure, the gathering and processing costs are relatively low because it's older infrastructure that was built in a different pricing era. And so the variable cost or the cash cost to the producer to produce is relatively low. So we really just haven't \u2013 and we've seen very \u2013 we've seen a very small almost insignificant amount of ice-related shut-in, just like we would in any winter or shoulder month in the West.","But overall, it's a very low cost place for variable production. And so we really don't expect a whole lot of change out there. So lots of reserves, lots of known reserves, and I think if we do see a price signal producers are ready to jump on it, but we're not expecting anything dramatic out of the area. And really proud of the team for working hard to keep our cash flows as steady as they have, considering how low NGL margins have been out (01:04:02).","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, Alan. Thanks for your color this morning. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Sharon Lui of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Just wanted to, I guess, get your thoughts in terms of the pace of additional capital spending for gathering and processing assets in the Northeast, given the current environment? Specifically, maybe if you can talk about, I guess, the investments tied to the Utica with Chesapeake and how you see maybe that $600 million of capital ramp up over the years?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Great question. I would just say that we're really excited about that acreage dedication and think that once the infrastructure demand, or \u2013 sorry, the infrastructure constraints are lifted out there and the firm obligations that various customers have out there, they'll be working to take advantage of that firm capacity that they have, and so feel pretty good about the prospects of that.","But I also would say that the way we're structured on that, we're not obligated to go spend that money out in front of the production showing up, and so we have an ability to step into that. So we're not going to be out spending capital in front of that drilling from a risk standpoint. But we do think that's a very, very good acreage, some really impressive cost levels available to it. And so we're really excited. We've got a very good vantage point of what people's production versus cost levels are. We're very excited about that acreage.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from John Edwards of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Bhavesh M. Lodaya - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, good morning. This is Bhavesh instead of John on. So most of my questions are answered. Just a question on Geismar. Given where ethylene prices are, curious to know your views on prices going ahead for the next maybe few quarters and whether there are any opportunities to maybe have any fee-based contracts against (01:06:28)?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","John, you want to take that please?","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. Glad to take it and thanks for the question. Yeah. First of all, we're really pleased to be serving customers again back in Louisiana. It just so happened that as we brought Geismar back on, so did Evangeline come on, and so the market was well served. And I think looking back over our shoulder here, in the last quarter, the ethylene market was well served by production in that there were very few shutdowns or unexpected shutdowns. And I think in at least one of the months \u2013 say it was July, we saw industry-high production. So I think all of that lead to perhaps a bit of an oversupply or a slightly long market in ethylene and the necessary price adjustments that occurred during the quarter.","I'll note, though, that over the last weeks, two weeks notionally, we recovered some of that price. It's come back up probably on the order of about $0.05 at this point. And so just to take the conversation a little further forward to answer your question, finally, as we look forward and we look into, we call it, the second quarter of next year, a couple of factors that'll play positively is a very high turnaround season. And I think another factor that will play positively is relatively low inventories of ethylene by any public accounting.","So I'm certain that people are doing exchanges to fill their needs in next year, but low inventories and high shutdown rates, planned shutdown rates certainly bode well for the supply\/demand balance, I think, in our favor. I hope that brings the necessary coloring; that's the way we see things playing out here over the next couple of quarters.","Bhavesh M. Lodaya - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Sure. And are there any opportunities to tie in contracts, pricing-based contracts, on these?","John R. Dearborn - Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids & Petchem Services, The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. Forgot to mention on that. We're always in the marketplace looking to secure the best value for our ethylene out there and we have been in conversations in past \u2013 I'll say, past quarters, including this last quarter, and we continue to have conversations with customers over whether or not they desire to enter into any sort of contracts, all in, including fee-for-service contracts and so trying to lock in some of the margins into the future.","Of course, in this dynamic price environment, everyone sits across the table with kind of rubber guns pointed at each other, and we'll see where those negotiations go over time. But we're always looking, when it would appear to be favorable to us, to lock up solid volumes and solid margins on Geismar 1.","Bhavesh M. Lodaya - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thank you. And thanks, Alan, and congrats on a great quarter.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much. Appreciate that.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay, great. Well, thank you everybody for joining us this morning. We really appreciate the interest and appreciate you respecting the scope of our discussion this morning as well. So thank you for that. Also just want to say big thanks to the team here at Williams, great execution, and just a lot of great focus on delivering a strategy that we had before us, and appreciate all their attention to focus despite the many distractions that we've had.","So with that, thanks again for joining us this morning and have a good day.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn today\u2019s call over to Mr. Brett Krieg, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Brett Krieg","Thanks, Carey. Good morning, and thank you for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily.","Joining us on the call today are our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler, our General Counsel, Lane Wilson; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin.","In our presentation materials, you will find the disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today\u2019s presentation materials.","And so with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan Armstrong","Okay, great. Thanks, Brett. Good morning, and thank you for joining us as we discuss our fourth quarter and the full-year 2019 financial performance and our key investor focus areas. So let\u2019s move right into the presentation and take a look at our strong year-end performance.","Here on Slide 2. 2019 was another year of strong predictable growth and solid execution. This is now the third year in a row we have exceeded the midpoint of our guidance range on key financial metrics. This highly reliable and predictable performance is the result of continuously improving execution by our operating teams on many fronts: capital project execution, reliable on-time services for our customers, safety performance, environmental stewardship, capital discipline and operating efficiency, all of these efforts circle around a deliberate strategy to deliver long-term shareholder value by accomplishing the following.","First is our focus on being the very best at providing infrastructure services for natural gas as an economically and environmentally superior energy source. Second is to reduce direct commodity margin exposure and basis risk to focus on highly predictable fee-based revenues. And certainly, the reason that our business has become so predictable is largely focused on that one. And we\u2019ve very much achieved what we\u2019d hoped to accomplish in terms of that reduction. And third is to deliver the balance sheet to provide flexibility and unquestioned financial stability.","These efforts grow predictable record results in 2019 across key performance metrics. The company produced record annual adjusted EBITDA of $5.02 billion and growth of 8% over the record 2018 performance of $4.64 billion.","Distributable cash flow, also record grew by an impressive 15% to an amount of $3.3 billion and this financial performance was driven by continued growth in the very large volume of natural gas the company gathers from a diversified array of both supply basins and a variety of producing customers.","While our record average daily gathering volume of 12.9 Bcf a day for the full-year of 2019 was a 5% growth overall, and it was 15% in the Northeast. In fact, in the fourth quarter, that \u2013 on that comparison, we saw volume growth of over 10%, up to 13.3 Bcf per day and for the whole gas \u2013 against the whole gas gathering portfolio and a 12% growth in the Northeast G&P segment.","So the company also continued to realize growth in the interstate gas transmission, driven by a 11% growth in the long-term firm contract capacity on Transco, the nation\u2019s largest and fastest-growing pipeline system.","Turning now to Slide 3. I want to take a brief moment to acknowledge some of the key performance metrics we are using to manage the business and to measure our continuous improvement efforts.","First of all, our financial performance, along with the company\u2019s disciplined approach to capital investment and successful efforts to monetize assets, brought our leverage ratio under 4.4 times, which was \u2013 is significantly inside our originally guided leverage ratio of under 4.75 times. So we are certainly well on our way to reaching our target of 4.2 times in 2021.","Also, as an enterprise, we are focused on improving our return on capital employed, or ROCE, while it is only a snapshot and it\u2019s certainly not a perfect measure of long-term returns, measuring the year-to-year improvement keeps us very focused on preserving our precious capital and a 13% compounded annual growth rate on the very large capital base the company has employed is great improvement. But we look to continue bringing our ROCE up with our continued strong discipline around capital investment.","Our operating margin ratio shows how much of our gross margin gets to the bottom line after operating and administrative costs. And to improve on that, we have to utilize our scale to grow gross margin faster than our unit cost. We have improved this metric even in a slowing growth environment and dwindling commodity margins and target continued improvement here through both cost management and growth.","And finally, our total recordable incident rate is a measure of our safety performance among several safety metrics we monitor. There has been a great improvement in our total recordable incident rate over the last several years, as our safety culture continues to improve and our employees find and eliminate hazards from the workplace and protect the public, while operating our assets.","Every employee has full Stop Work Authority and they \u2013 and when they recognize the safety issue and are empowered to make it right. Our employees own this metric and are responsible for this great improvement, and I\u2019m pleased to report on that group\u2019s improvement here. And, in fact, in 2019, our TRIR came in at 0.55, which is well below the toughest of industry benchmarks.","And finally, all this discipline and focus has culminated to drive an impressive 25% CAGR on our EPS from 2017 through 2019.","Now, we\u2019re going to move on to Slide 4. And here on Slide 4, we provided a clear view of our full-year and fourth quarter 2019 financial performance relative to 2018 period. And as you can see, we continue to enjoy steady growth across our key measures, despite the impact of asset sales and much lower commodity margins on a full-year basis.","We covered some key annual performance metrics on the previous slide. But on this slide, from an annual perspective, I\u2019ll just point out that growth in our GAAP cash flow from operations of 12% is right in line with the adjusted EBITDA in DCF performance we\u2019ve already discussed and the per share metrics, both DCF per share and adjusted EPS, showed equal or stronger growth with DCF per share up 14% and adjusted EPS up with that 25% again this year.","Another key piece of 2019 performance is the improvement in an already strong coverage ratio. Our DCF exceeded our dividends by 1.79 times, or nearly $1.5 billion. This healthy and growing coverage is one of the key items the management team and Board evaluated, as we raised our dividend here in 2020 by 5%.","Our impressive performance on leverage was a result of strong operating performance that we\u2019ve already discussed, but also importantly, a disciplined approach to capital investment. In fact, I think, this is one of the great highlights here for the year and for the quarter that our total capital, both growth and maintenance came in under $2.5 billion for 2019, and that was a $1.7 billion, or 40% reduction from 2018 and well below our original guidance on both growth and maintenance.","So during 2019, we saw an environmental \u2013 sorry, we saw an environment shaping up that would challenge the growth plans some of our producer customers have laid out. We quickly responded to the realities we were seeing in the market by moderating our capital spin versus the budget we had created in late 2019. And, in fact, in the Northeast alone, our total capital spin came in approximately $400 million under that original budget.","So against the backdrop of a much lower commodity price environment that we had in 2018, the company produced strong growth in our various earnings and operating metrics and grew dividend coverage, while also realizing over $1 billion in net proceeds from our portfolio optimization efforts and lowering leverage. We are certainly very pleased with the performance that we saw across many of these facets for the full-year.","So let\u2019s move on to Slide 5 and discuss the main business drivers of our 4Q 2019 over 4Q 2018 on an EBITDA basis. And so here on Slide 5 now, we compare fourth quarter 2019 to fourth quarter 2018. Adjusted EBITDA increased about 7%, or 8% if you adjust for the bigger transactions that affect the year-over-year comparison.","This 4Q growth came at a point in the year when G&P customers had already begun to talk about moderated growth plans and commodity price concerns. Our business showed growth against a tough comp, where the prior year period already included contribution from the Atlantic Sunrise project and the associated gathering volumes that grew dramatically in the fourth quarter of 2018.","On the left side of the slide, you can see a net unfavorable $7 million comparability adjustment in the gray bars, which includes removing the adjusted EBITDA from the various asset transactions netted against the favorable addition of 38% UEOM interest. Normalizing for those items, you see adjusted EBITDA growing 8%.","Now moving over to the right side of the chart to focus on the financial performance of our continuing business, the Atlantic Gulf increased by $43 million, or 8% from the fourth quarter of 2018, driven by Transco revenue growth from the Gulf Connector and Rivervale South to Market expansion projects.","Additionally, for fourth quarter of 2019, results include the increased EBITDA from the Transco rate case settlement. And lastly, while total deepwater gas volumes were up 17%, we saw a decrease in revenues due to temporary producer operational issues on our Gulfstar deepwater platform. And this issue appears to be corrected now, as we\u2019ve seen volumes come back very strong here in first quarter.","Also in the Norphlet pipeline, which serves Shell\u2019s deepwater Appomattox field in the Gulf East, continues to see volume increases after flowing first gas on the pipeline in the third quarter of 2019. The next, the Northeast G&P area led the fourth quarter performance with a 19% increase, driven by an increase of about 970 million cubic feet per day, or 12% on higher gathering volumes and higher gathering fees that were associated with expansion projects and escalators that are built into those contracts.","Volume increases were led by Susquehanna Supply Hub and Bradford areas, which grew about 600 million cubic feet per day, but all our operated Northeast franchises saw volume growth over this time period So overall, our operated assets in the Northeast continue to see very strong growth across the Board.","Finally, even though we enjoyed an impressive 10% increase in total gathering volumes on our remaining assets during the fourth quarter comparison, the West EBITDA was relatively flat, due primarily to $31 million decrease in revenues for our Barnett gathering business. As a reminder from our third quarter results, this decrease was associated with the end of a Barnett MVC or minimum volume commitment and a related step down in deferred revenue amortization.","The Barnett MVCs expired at the end of June 2019. And once that happened, the revenue recognition rate of fixed payments that we previously received, began to reflect actual volumes rather than the MVC levels. We also overcame about $13 million of lower NGL margins in the West, which was a 45% decrease from the prior year fourth quarter.","Now moving on to Slide 6. We\u2019ll look at the full-year drivers of adjusted EBITDA, which increased about 8%, or over 11% if you adjust for the bigger transactions that affect this full-year comparison. Once again, on the left side, in the gray bars, if you net these out, you\u2019ll see an unfavorable $110 million comparability adjustment from the various asset transactions that occurred during this time period. In 2019, Atlantic Gulf increased 20% and the Northeast was up 19%, driven by the same factors discussed on the previous slide.","With the addition of a full-year revenue impact of the Atlantic Sunrise project that came online in early October of 2018, the West is down about 6%, reflecting much lower NGL prices, again, to step down to the Barnett revenue we talked about, offset by growth in the Haynesville, Eagle Ford and DJ basin. Also, our Conway frac and storage business, so that\u2019s our NGL services business, continues to see strong fee revenue growth on the back of NGL production that\u2019s been coming out of both the DJ and the Bakken areas.","Our team\u2019s crisp execution drove the growth we continue to show in the Atlantic Gulf in Northeast this year, leading to an overall 8% growth in adjusted EBITDA, despite the significant asset sales, the much lower NGL margins and the one-time step down in the Barnett revenue recognition.","So now let\u2019s move on to Slide 7 to address the key investor focus areas. So first, let\u2019s set the scene a bit for 2020. As of January 1, 2020, our Northwest Pipeline business will be managed and reported with our other regulated interstate gas transmission systems in a segment we will call Transmission & Gulf of Mexico.","This move will streamline the management and operations of the regulated gas transmission business, combine these businesses into a single reportable segment and providing a clear picture of the very solid performance and predictable cash flow generation of these competitively advantaged assets. The deepwater business will remain in this segment as well and become more important to our EBITDA and ROCE improvement, as growth in this basin is coming back strong.","Moving Northwest Pipeline out of the West segment will position the West as a gathering, processing and NGL services business, providing a full suite of midstream services to producers from wellhead gathering all the way through NGL fractionation storage and NGL logistics, especially after the Bluestem NGL project is placed in service later this year.","And the Northeast G&P segment will continue to provide all midstream services to the prolific Marcellus and Utica Shale, the largest source of gas production in North America. We will continue to separately report the West and Northeast G&P segments, but combined management will allow us to take better advantage of our tremendous scale and continue to grow our operating margin in this producer-facing business.","So I\u2019d like to talk for a moment about how we see the G&P business, both in the near-term and the longer-term and how we have positioned this business. We saw record gathering volumes in 2019 because of continued production successes by our upstream customers, continued growth in natural gas demand and great execution by our teams.","But over the last year, robust production growth has outpaced very healthy demand growth and, in fact, demand has grown significantly 21% over the last three years, but domestic production has grown even faster. This imbalance will be a near-term headwind to volumes and EBITDA in the G&P business, as current prices don\u2019t support investment in gas drilling in most cases.","So producers, of course, are acting rationally, slowing their capital investment and reducing production growth. While some producers are still forecasting growth, others are focused on keeping production flat, and while lack of recent investment from the upstream will cause declines in other production areas.","Some producer balance sheets are stressed. We have already seen some bankruptcy filings. While a customer bankruptcy filing is often disrupted to the normal course of business, it affects various midstream services and contracts very differently.","After a very long time in this midstream business, I have seen and experienced many instance of producers\u2019 stress and even bankruptcy, and it\u2019s very clear to me that the most protected service by far is that a wellhead gathering. Wellhead gathering is absolutely essential to any reserves that are going to be produced. Gas could not get to market and cash flow cannot be realized, if wellhead gas gathering is not available.","While counterparty credit is important, the physical nature of the service is even better security. We believe this supply demand imbalance is only a near-term concern, as last week\u2019s storage was only a 215 Bcf above the five-year average.","We see continued demand growth bringing supply and demand \u2013 sorry, supply and demand back in balance. And our long-term strategy is, as we\u2019ve told you many times before, is predicated on the belief that the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas will support continued long-term demand growth, both domestically and internationally and that U.S. domestic supply is well-positioned to grow its share of global demand as well.","In the long-term, whatever demand is, supply will grow or decline to meet that demand. And importantly, we expect low-cost gas basins to continue to be the majority of supply that will meet this demand. Associated gas will be important, no doubt. But gas-directed drilling, the source of approximately 65% of today\u2019s gas supply will remain the bedrock of domestic gas production.","So we feel confident in the long-term position of our assets and strength of our strategy. But the current price environment is a reality that the market will navigate through here in the near-term, and we have built a very resilient G&P business that can succeed in a wide range of market environments, the dramatic growth we\u2019ve seen over the last three years and the currently challenging price environment for our producing customers.","We built this business very intentionally, not by accident. We\u2019ve been at this a long time. And we have moved away from direct commodity exposure and from reliance on marketing and basis spread for profit. We have taken strategic action to broadly diversify our sources of EBITDA, both in the 15 different supply areas, our G&P businesses served and the very wide variety of customers we contract with to provide those services.","Another thing I want to point out is that continues to demonstrate our ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders \u2013 excuse me, is that the free cash flow produced by our onshore G&P businesses grows dramatically when drilling activity pulls back. Capital spend declined significantly, driving near-term ROCE improvement and tremendous free cash flow growth.","So, as we\u2019ve said before, when we do see investment pullback on the drilling side, we see tremendous continued increase in free cash flow growth in the G&P business. Our West is a great example of that.","And with regard to our 2020 guidance, we are reaffirming the guidance we provided at Analyst Day in December. While the largest near-term uncertainty is producer activity, we feel comfortable with our 2020 guidance. We will keep a keen focus on capital spending in cost management as the year evolves. And importantly, we are expecting to fund dividends and CapEx with internally generated cash flow, which benefits the company as we look toward our long-term goal of reaching a net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 4.2 or lower.","And so I just want to comment a little bit more here on the guidance for 2020. First of all, the volumes that we saw in the last-half of the year, certainly in the Northeast and the rates that we enjoyed there, along with what we\u2019re seeing here in January and February in terms of volume, as well as some pretty significant cost cuts that we made late in the fourth quarter of 2019, all compiled to continue to give us confidence on our guidance for 2020, despite the challenging price environment that\u2019s out there today.","So now, let\u2019s move on to discuss some of the key issues around our Transmission & Gulf of Mexico business. First, we\u2019re pleased that we have filed our Transco rate case settlement with FERC on December 31. We had only supporting comments from shippers to FERC. Since the rate settlement was filed with FERC, we are pleased to have reached this settlement that we expect to provide $76 million benefit to adjusted EBITDA in 2020 versus our \u2013 the last full-year of 2018, which was the last time we had a period with no rate case impact.","I also want to point out the successes we\u2019re having on our portfolio of transmission expansion projects. Since September, we placed the Rivervale South and Gateway project in service, both of these were in New Jersey and our Northwest Pipeline commenced service on the North Seattle Lateral expansion. These are two areas with extremely rigorous permitting processes and a politically active vocal minority opposing natural gas infrastructure in short, challenging places to build gas pipelines.","Williams continues to demonstrate our ability to work with a wide range of stakeholders in a constructive manner to address these regulatory, political and community concerns, while still getting important infrastructure expansions permitted and built. We plan to continue that track record on the over $3 billion of pipeline expansion projects that are currently in execution mode, and we are achieving key milestones on each of these projects.","First of all, Hillabee Phase II is mechanically complete and ready for in-service. The Southeastern Trail project has all of its federal permits and began construction in January of this year, with an in-service targeted by year-end. The Leidy South and Gulfstream, Gulfstream\u2019s sixth expansion now, both received favorable environmental assessments, which is a key step in the FERC certificate process, and each project remained on track for scheduled in-service, Leidy South by the end of 2021 and the Gulf Stream Phase VI expansion by the end of 2022.","Our Regional Energy Access project is looking more attractive as time goes on. We have a project that will be between 800 million to 1 billion cubic feet per day. And once we\u2019ve settled on the appropriate size of the project, we\u2019ll move to complete the work to apply for FERC certificate. So we\u2019re in the final stages of tidying up contracts there with our customers. But we do have a project at this point, it\u2019s a matter of the size of that project.","We also continue to feel very confident about the prospects for Northeast Supply Enhancements completion, and we look forward to the conclusion of National Grid\u2019s process to assess alternatives for serving Brooklyn and Long Island\u2019s growing energy needs.","We continue to see this project as the most reliable, most environmentally beneficial, and most economically friendly alternative. At full load, the fuel oil to natural gas substitution for this project would enable an emissions reduction up \u2013 that\u2019s equivalent to taking 500,000 cars off the road.","So that, along with the savings to the customers and the residents in those areas, we think are powerful motors for getting that project approved, despite the very noisy minority around that. And we certainly know that this is by far the best solution for the area.","Beyond these projects and execution, we continue to make good progress on our backlog of projects in development and we expect several of these to move into execution mode this year. Transco is well-positioned to continue growing our contracted volumes and a well-established corridor serving a large portion of the U.S. population.","The forces you see working in the market today are only increasing the competitive advantages of Transco. Low prices continue to incent demand in all sectors, and our access to many geographies and types of demand is unmatched. LNG, industrial, power, residential, commercial are all growing along Transco.","Difficulties seen by Greenfield pipeline projects will also benefit Transco in the long run, as Transco has uniquely positioned to meet new capacity demand by expanding along its existing rights of way, which are irreplaceable and unmatched in terms of their proximity to demand.","Our Gulf of Mexico assets are similarly positioned against the growing market opportunity. Chevron made a positive final investment decision on their Anchor project in December of 2019. Anchor is near our Discovery\u2019s Keathley Canyon Connector, and we are excited to be finalizing the definitive agreements to provide a full range of services for this very rich gas to be produced by the Anchor project.","Anchor represents continued realization of the strategy that supported the original Keathley Canyon Connector investment, capturing new volumes from significant nearby deepwater prospects. Given its proximity and our pre-planning, we will not have to invest any significant capital for this new business.","Williams will continue to pursue similar connections as other nearby prospects moved towards FID and first production, including the LLOG-operated Shenandoah, Yucatan, Leon and Moccasin; the Equinor-operated Monument; and the Total-operated North Platte. The Shell-operated Whale project is an even larger opportunity for us. And the services we expect to provide to this dedicated field include gas transportation, gas processing, and importantly, the crude oil transportation as well.","Shell continues to make progress on this very large-scale project and expects to make their FID decision this year. And, in fact, in November of 2019, Shell awarded Singapore\u2019s Sembcorp Marine the contract to build the well floater. In addition, Williams has executed a reimbursement agreement with the well owners to cover commitments in 2020 to keep the project on schedule for first production. Williams will secure several long lead items, including the line pipe valves and fittings and the installation contract and ongoing engineering costs.","Whale and Anchor would represent a significant increase in the volumes we are currently handling on our consolidated assets. But these are just two of the many opportunities our deepwater assets are competitively positioned to win, as producers in the area are looking to align new development with existing infrastructure to lower cost and decrease time to market.","We believe our business is very well-positioned to benefit from continued demand growth in natural gas over the long-term. And that our strong competitive position and conservative financial model makes us a resilient business that can deal with the near-term challenges in the market, while positioning ourselves for the strong growth that\u2019s ahead.","So with that, let\u2019s go ahead and transition to our Q&A session. And thank you, again, for your time today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will be from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Hi, good morning.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Jeremy Tonet","Just want to start off with, I guess, some of the strategic transactions that you guys had done in recent years and kind of some sales and JVs. And I was wondering if you could comment, I guess, on the ability to kind of capture those type of opportunities going forward here and what that could mean for hitting kind of the 4.2 leverage ratio that you guys are targeting there? If you\u2019re able to do that, I guess, it\u2019s quicker, or if that doesn\u2019t come together, how long do you think it would take you to hit kind of a target 4.2?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Jeremy, good morning, and thank you for the question. I would just say, first of all, we\u2019re encouraged by the attraction to the kind of assets that we have, which have long histories of cash flow. And so that\u2019s very different than some of the other assets out there that aren\u2019t as well-positioned or more speculative in nature of cash flow.","So we think, assets that are stable and have a long history of cash flow are pretty important in this market today. And so we\u2019re very encouraged by that. I would just say, the growth that we have and the continued cash retention that we have in the business, right now, we certainly have our eyes on that 4.2 even without that. But we look at the further transaction as a way to accelerate ourselves towards that, and likely well under that with some \u2013 with any significance to the size of those transactions.","Jeremy Tonet","Got it, thanks. And just want to see, I guess, with regards to producer activity and kind of conversations with producers today versus where they stood at the Analyst Day, just wondering if you could help us think through a little bit more on how that has changed? Has it been notable, or not as notable? I guess, I\u2019m trying to think how that translates into guidance. Should we be thinking about the midpoint, or does this kind of bring more towards the lower-end of guidance, or any color you could provide there would be helpful?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Great question, Jeremy, and thanks for asking that. I know that\u2019s an issue on lot of people\u2019s mind. First of all, I would just say, obviously, we have a very diverse business and some things go South on us and some things go positive. If you think back to last year and you think about the commodity price assumptions that we had versus how the year actually wound up, we outperformed as, again, good evidence of how things can go our way to offset other negatives that occurred during the year.","So I would just say, we do have a large portfolio. I also, though, as I mentioned in my comments, and I think this is really important for people to understand. If you look, for instance, a lot of concern around the Northeast volumes and if you look and took the combined \u2013 took the average of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, you would see that if we \u2013 if all we did was repeat that, we would come in above our guidance level for the Northeast for next year, and I know there has been a lot of concern about that.","If you took and just took four times the fourth quarter, assuming the fourth quarter held where it was and didn\u2019t see growth \u2013 any growth at all, you\u2019d see a \u2013 we would beat pretty significantly that guidance that we had laid out for the Northeast.","And so that, I would say, combined with a couple of things, one is the fact that our fourth quarter did come in stronger than we were expecting for the Northeast. When we were laying guidance out in \u2013 at Analyst Day, we were working off a forecast that was actually exceeded for the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re starting off better than we start than we expected to.","Secondly, we\u2019ve seen January and February volumes now. And so we\u2019ve got pretty good confidence about where actual volumes are.","And then finally, I would say, we took the cost that we took out that we\u2019ve worked on and planned around during 2019, most of those costs and the impact of those costs actually started rolling out very late in the fourth quarter of 2019. So we will have the benefit of that working with us going into 2020.","So I would just say a lot of positive things that are occurring as well with some deepwater production that\u2019s coming on a little faster than we would have expected as well. And volumes actually, again, exceeding where we thought they would be at this point in time when we laid out at Analyst Day. So those are the things that have given us the confidence on our guidance being maintained as we sit here today.","Jeremy Tonet","Got it, great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.","Spiro Dounis","Good morning, everyone. Alan, I appreciate your comments around G&P being one of the more protective components of the value chain. But I guess, when we think about quantifying a potential impact, is there a way for you to help us quantify how much of your volumes or margin could be considered maybe above market or maybe subject to renegotiation?","You\u2019ve been pretty proactive on this front so far. So not sure how much your portfolio is, in theory, still at risk? And if you\u2019re receiving any sort of inbound inquiry from customers to do a blend and extend?","Alan Armstrong","No, we are not \u2013 I think we have \u2013 we\u2019ve completed all negotiations that anybody has entertained with us on issues right now, particularly with Chesapeake. We settled that in the Eagle Ford, and I think you\u2019ll see this year, I think you\u2019ll see that some of the assumptions that were made by some of the analysts about where that was going are going to be proven very wrong about their assumptions on that for the Eagle Ford.","And I would say this in terms of incenting further drilling, we\u2019ve been working pretty actively. Our commercial teams have been working very actively in places like the Haynesville to incent drilling on acreage that\u2019s dedicated to us, but not otherwise being drilled. And that does require us putting an incentive rate out for new drilling, but it doesn\u2019t affect the rates of the existing business.","So it\u2019s just a way to attract new drilling dollars against acreage that Chesapeake, for instance, likely wouldn\u2019t get to, if we weren\u2019t out working transactions to help make that happen.","Spiro Dounis","Understood. And then some of the common pushback we received from time to time just around the growth backlog and your ability to spend, I guess, enough to really on those demand pull projects to drive that 5% to 7% growth. And so in other words, I think people are struggling with maybe the scope of these projects and their ability to grow that $5 billion EBITDA base. And so are there opportunities beyond the ones you list that maybe we\u2019re not appreciating, or is G&P actually still an ongoing major contributor to growth even at the lower CapEx levels?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I think, certainly, we had a great year of growth this last year and on an adjustment for both asset sales and margins, where our growth was a lot better than we would have just built into the plan in terms of volumes and fee-based rates last year, a lot of that came from good cost control and really good execution on our projects, bringing them on a little earlier than expected.","But I would say, the things that I think the market tends to miss is the things like the DJ basin growth that continues to come on very nicely for us, the Bluestem project coming on for us, the deepwater, which is really coming back, I think, 95% of the rigs now available \u2013 floating rigs available are in under contract now in the deepwater.","And so we are seeing a lot and expecting a lot coming from that area as well. So, these projects coming on in Transco are pretty powerful, but that\u2019s not what we\u2019re totally dependent on for our growth by any stretch of imagination.","Spiro Dounis","Very helpful. Thanks, Alan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi, good morning, everyone. I\u2019m just wondering if we can revisit the guidance commentary. It sounds to me that you\u2019re fairly confident with the midpoint of your guidance, despite producers being shifting over to maintenance mode at this stage right now. You\u2019ve talked about some of the pushes and pulls, including some of the cost reductions that you\u2019ve put through that that gives you some confidence in that. If this were to \u2013 maintenance mode were to maintain itself into next year, are there any more levers that you can pull on the cost side and on the CapEx side to sort of maintain cash flow generation, where you expected to be this year or even potentially driving higher next year?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. We certainly have quite a bit of capital still in plan. And despite the narrative that\u2019s out there, we still have producers that are still pushing ahead with the growing plan, some of those based on hedges that they have and some based on contracts that they have. But we still have some pretty big obligations to keep up with that.","I know, the market is \u2013 the narrative is very different than what you\u2019re seeing. But in reality, right now, we do have that capital built in, because those producers are moving ahead right now with their activities, as they told us they would. And so \u2013 and those come with obligation on their part, so we have to be ready with that capital that\u2019s in there.","If that were to change for whatever reason, then that might shift that back. But I think we should be clear that we do have customers continuing to have growth and plan growth in the Northeast. And so, we\u2019ll wait and see, obviously. But right now, it\u2019s getting pretty late in the process for them to be pulling back from those plans that they\u2019ve laid out for the year. And, again, I think a lot of that is based on hedges that they have in place that continue to support those activities.","So I don\u2019t want to get into each individual customers, because that\u2019s up to them to lay out their plans and communicate that. But we are responding to the very detailed planning processes that we work within the customers, and we do have capital in the plan to help drive that. And so we \u2013 like we had last year, if we need to turn that back quickly, we certainly would. But there is quite a bit of activity that\u2019s going on out there, despite what the narrative is.","Shneur Gershuni","And would you feel that you would have more flexibility on 2021, if this were to maintain itself?","Alan Armstrong","Shneur, you\u2019re breaking up just a little bit. Could you repeat that?","Shneur Gershuni","Sure. Yes, would you have more flexibility on capital and cost structure for 2021, if this trend sort of maintained itself? Obviously, it\u2019s late in the year to be adjusting things for 2020, but I was more thinking about 2021? Do you have a lot of levers that you can still pull there if this environment maintained itself?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, we certainly do. And I think part of our effort to combine the West and the Northeast G&P area is, because we do expect to move. I mean, that area has been growing grammatically. It sounds really easy for us to sit here in our offices and think about the kinds and talk about the growth off of spreadsheet. But the reality is the very, very hard work of our employees and the teams out there trying to keep up with all that growth. They\u2019ve done a remarkable job on that.","But it does take a lot of people and it takes \u2013 when you\u2019re investing in the capital, it puts a lot of costs onto the operating teams as well, because there\u2019s a lot of change going on that they\u2019re having to manage. So the more mature in a slower growth environment absolutely allows us to go after and increase our operating margin in an area. And us combining our West and our Northeast from a management perspective is allowing us to get after some of that.","Shneur Gershuni","That makes great sense. And as a follow-up question, there\u2019s some new PHMSA rules out. Just wondering if you\u2019ve looked at it and whether this could kick off potentially a rate-based investment cycle, or do you constantly replace pipe and it\u2019s really irrelevant to all these new rules?","Micheal Dunn","Good morning. This is Micheal. I\u2019ll take that one. So on our transmission systems, we\u2019ve been ahead of the curve there for a long time and maintaining our commitment to keeping our assets safe and reliable. And I would say, with the timelines that have been laid out in the new rules, there\u2019s a long runway to compliance there.","So I think that\u2019s going to allow not only ourselves, but the industry to manage that pretty well within our maintenance CapEx and our normal OpEx. And so I\u2019m not too concerned about having that drive any additional rate cases.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And then one final question, Alan, in your comments about the NESE project, if that were to come to fruition, would that be considered a positive ESG benefit to Williams, given your comments about how many cars you take off the road?","Alan Armstrong","Shneur, I\u2019m sorry, you broke up, again. On which project were you asking that question?","Shneur Gershuni","With respect to NESE, you\u2019d given a whole argument about how many cars who takes off the road and so forth. Just wondering like as we sort of think about ESG, is that something that would be viewed as a positive benefit?","Alan Armstrong","I would certainly hope so. But it\u2019s \u2013 I think there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty right now within the rating systems within ESG as to where we get that. We would certainly pronounce that as a win, because it certainly is going to impact the environment, and we certainly would be taking a big part in making that possible. So we certainly would want to talk about that.","I would say even \u2013 perhaps even larger than that and more directly related to that would be the emissions reduction projects on Transco that we still intend to follow through with some negotiations lingering post the rate case on that. But that would be very dramatic conditions \u2013 reductions.","And it\u2019s exactly the kind of thing that I think the whole industry certainly, Williams and the whole industry is really capable of reducing emissions dramatically. And if the focus got to be on actually reducing emissions, and not just trying to stop fossil fuels, there\u2019s a lot to be accomplished by the energy industry in terms of emissions reductions, and we expect to play a big part of that.","Shneur Gershuni","All right, perfect. Well, thank you very much. I appreciate the color today, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Tristan Richardson from SunTrust. Richardson, your line is live. Please be sure you\u2019re not on mute. Al right. Next question will be from T.J. Schultz from RBC Capital Markets.","T.J. Schultz","Great, thanks. Just first in the Gulf, you\u2019ve got some big projects in 2023, 2024 timeframe. But you also listed off in the prepared remarks a number of projects that may be more near-term potentially. So just any tiebacks assumed in the next year or two, that may be additive to EBITDA, or could offset some slowing G&P growth?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. T.J., great question. First of all, one of the impacts this year will be the growth in Appomattox. So remember, our Norphlet pipeline that we put online last year, that is finally starting to ramp up pretty dramatically as expected. Shell has got some big plans out there on Appomattox, so we\u2019re really excited about that.","So even though the construction work is there\u2019s nothing new on that, the actual volume growth on that we expect to be pretty nice this year. On top of that, we tied in two prospects on discovery last year, that were kind of midway through the year. Those will contribute to discovery this year.","And then finally, on Gulfstar, Hess\u2019 Esox project was brought online well ahead of schedule. They did a great job of executing on that project, and really made for nice returns for both themselves. And, of course, we make nice fees on that business as well. So that was well ahead of our schedule, our plan as well.","There\u2019s also work going on by Kosmos around some of our areas with their Kodiak 2 well that they\u2019re working on right now. So a lot of activity out there, and we\u2019re very fortunate to have a lot of that activity directly around our assets out there.","T.J. Schultz","Okay, great. Just for follow-up, maybe a question for John. You mentioned at the Analyst Day the ability to lower some interest costs. Just what are you seeing today as the ability to lower interest costs for maturities in 2020 and 2021 that get refinanced? And does your guidance assume that you pay down any of that maturing debt with cash, or is that more dependent on asset sales?","Alan Armstrong","That\u2019s more dependent on asset sales. Our guidance assumes a refinancing. But I will tell you, we do have $1.5 billion of our debt maturing in March at a net rate of 5.2%. We could refinance that today, for example, 10-year \u2013 at a 10-year rate of 3.3%. So we like the rate environment right now.","I will tell you though, we\u2019re holding tight and waiting you. I think it\u2019s no secret that we\u2019ve said we are looking at potential or opportunities for asset sales or selling interest in some of our assets. And I \u2013 we don\u2019t want to get in front of that by paying down debt that otherwise could be paid down with cash received through one of those transactions. But I will tell you, our guidance and forecast didn\u2019t include asset sales.","T.J. Schultz","Perfect.","Alan Armstrong","And so we could see interest savings just through the refinancing and obviously much more significant savings if we actually did pay that down through the \u2013 through an asset sale.","Operator, are you still there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Colton Bean of Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co.","Colton Bean","Good morning.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Colton Bean","Alan, you had mentioned that the volume trends that you are seeing thus far in 2020, can you give us or just frame the activity levels that you\u2019re seeing in some of those primary basins in the West? I know we spent a lot of time in the Northeast, but just how you\u2019re seeing some of the West basins and maybe how that compares to your guidance that you laid out in December?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Micheal, do you want to take that?","Micheal Dunn","Sure. We\u2019re seeing really good results in the Eagle Ford right now coming in, starting the year as well as Haynesville are well ahead of where we thought they would be at this time of year. A little bit challenged in the Wyoming area with the weather. There has been some pretty severe weather in Wyoming this year that\u2019s challenged the Wamsutter area as can typically happen at this time of year. But overall, I think, we\u2019re going to see an increase of what we anticipated so far here in the first quarter from what our forecast should.","Colton Bean","Yes. And so it sounds like the Rockies segment there hasn\u2019t been impacted as much as you would have expected from the natural gas decline?","Micheal Dunn","No, we\u2019re still seeing good production coming out of the Piceance. For example, as Alan talked about earlier, we have some incentive rates out there with our customer, where they are continuing to drill in the Piceance, for example, and getting good results. And our DJ Basin is really performing very well with our Rocky Mountain midstream asset, and so we\u2019re very pleased with that and also capturing the NGLs coming off the processing there that\u2019s going down OPPL pipeline system.","Colton Bean","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on Leidy South, given some of the moving pieces around producer plans, has there been any discussions with anchor shippers that would impact that Q4 2021 timing, or is that solely contingent on the permitting process at this point?","Micheal Dunn","No, it\u2019s solely dependent upon the permitting process at this point, and we got our environmental assessment earlier than anticipated. So everything looks to be in good shape there, had no conversations at all about slowing that project down with our customers","Colton Bean","Well said. I appreciate the time. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Derek Walker from Bank of America.","Derek Walker","Hi, good morning.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Derek Walker","Alan, at the Investor Day, you mentioned a return on invested capital around 12% for projects over the last several years. And as you look to sort of allocate capital to the highest returning projects, it seems like it\u2019s a \u2013 for this year, it\u2019s a mix of Northeast, regulated transmission, also some deepwater, where you have some operating leverage. So I guess, relative to that 12% number, do you see at least in 2020 or at least over the next couple of years getting above that 12% number, or is it just going to be a mix, or how should we think about that relative to the 12% number you guys been able to achieve over the last several years?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, great question. Well, first of all, I would remind you that our individual project returns are often \u2013 well, in fact, they are well above that number. But that\u2019s working against things like deepwater declines, the declines in basins like the Barnett and certainly deferred revenue step down and things like that.","So there is a natural decline in some pieces of the business that those returns have to offset. And \u2013 but I would say that our current returns on projects are as good or better than what we\u2019ve had in our previous mix of projects as we\u2019ve tightened the capital budget. Obviously, as you tighten the capital, you\u2019re allocating stuff out. And so I would expect that number to continue to be as good or better than we\u2019ve had on it on an overall number across the whole portfolio.","Derek Walker","Thanks. That\u2019s it for me.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill","Good morning. Alan, you\u2019ve talked about that the Gulf of Mexico assets are well-positioned to win new business. Can you quantify what kind of EBITDA contribution you would expect over the next several years and what potential and the CapEx associated to get there?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, Becca, good question. A lot of the capital, what we\u2019ll start spending some this year, as we mentioned, on things like Whale. And so in some \u2013 versus an Anchor prospect, so I\u2019m just going to give you the kind of ends of the spectrum here. On one hand, pretty significant capital required on Whale now, because the volumes came in a lot larger than we expected to and the producers wanted plenty of flexibility in their capacity. And so that project is going to take more capital.","On the other hand, Anchor, we had laid a sled down, when we built that Keathley Canyon Connector, we had put sled down, so that we could make those connections fairly inexpensively and the producers generally are providing that capital. And so in that case \u2013 and \u2013 but we\u2019re not going to make return on that investment capital. So we\u2019re going to make an existing rate.","So in one case, I would tell you, Whale, very significant revenue contributions and EBITDA contributions, that will be in the 10% to 15% just by itself across the whole deepwater. And then things like Anchor would be inside of that, because it\u2019s not \u2013 smaller.","You also, as we\u2019ve also mentioned, we have Ballymore. It\u2019s a very large prospect. That project that Chevron and their partners are trying to decide if it\u2019s going to be so big, coupled with some other prospects that they have in the area, they have to put a new floater in. If they had to do that, then we would have to invest new capital. Best thing for us is that they find a way to fit that on to blind faith. And that would be pure incremental EBITDA without any new capital.","So it\u2019s still in the mix. But I can tell you based on both volume and EBITDA, we think it\u2019s very significant. In terms of the total percentage increase in the deepwater, it is going to be a very significant step up from our current EBITDA levels in the area.","Becca Followill","Alan, I asked the question, because it\u2019s hard for us to give credit for that and evaluation when I have no idea what significant means in terms of EBITDA. I mean \u2013 or what the CapEx is to get there?","Alan Armstrong","Agreed. And I think I would just be cautious on our part. What we have laid out, Becca \u2013 so I\u2019ll be clear, what we have laid out is that our contracts allow us to get the existing rate on our current systems, plus a 12% after-tax return on any incremental capital that we spend. So that ought to give you a pretty good read, if you take the rate in the Gulf West areas, for instance, you ought to be able to see a pretty nice increase in that. Obviously, we don\u2019t like to spell out exactly what our deals are with our customers.","So we\u2019re not trying to be elusive as much as we are respectful of the relationships that we have with those customers. But if you look at the volume, for instance, on Whale and what\u2019s been quoted out there, you\u2019ll see it looks very much like Perdido, which is what we already gather in the Gulf West.","And so this would be effectively a doubling of what we get in the Gulf West there today. So it is very significant. But, again, we\u2019re \u2013 we\u2019ve got contracts in place that we\u2019re not going to lay out exactly what those are. But if you look at total reserve additions versus our current reserves tied up that are out there, you would see that we\u2019re \u2013 on both the Gulf East and the Gulf West that we\u2019re coming close to doubling those connected reserves out there.","Becca Followill","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question will be from Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital.","Danilo Juvane","Hey, Alan, good morning. Given that we are in an environment of slower EBITDA growth, how are you thinking about managing leverage and dividend growth? And at what point do you see those two converging longer-term?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, great question. Certainly, as we mentioned this year, our coverage came up. And so we certainly \u2013 our DCF came in quite a bit stronger than we had planned. And certainly, those are the things that we\u2019re looking at in terms of dividend growth. And certainly, our \u2013 as our debt comes down and our interest payments come down, we\u2019ll see continued improvement in that as well.","So I would say, the capital allocation question remains out there for us, as we look at some of these larger transactions that we\u2019re going to look to. But the dividend coverage that we have today is allowing us to have excess cash. And so we don\u2019t see anything really changing on that front.","But as we get into some of these higher-growth areas as we get into 2022 and 2023 that are not requiring a lot of capital. That\u2019s going to build some pretty nice coverage even further than what we have today. So I\u2019m not going to give you a very direct answer on that, frankly, because that\u2019s a Board level decision in terms of what our growth rate on the dividend is. And I would just say this year, the factors that were considered were how much our DCF had grown and the other uses of capital that were available to us.","Danilo Juvane","Gotcha. I guess, my next question is for John. To the extent that you did have some impairments during the fourth quarter, any details on how much that impacts DD&A going forward?","John Chandler","Yes. So the biggest impairment we had in the fourth quarter was on constitution. We weren\u2019t appreciating that at this point since it\u2019s in construction. So that won\u2019t really have an impact on our depreciation calcs.","Danilo Juvane","Great. Thanks for that. Last one for me. To the extent that the Texas RRC came out with a report on flaring this week, do you guys have any thoughts on some of the commentary that they laid out?","Alan Armstrong","No, I\u2019m sorry. We couldn\u2019t quite hear that on this thing. Could you try that again","Danilo Juvane","Sorry, I was mentioning that the Texas RRC came out with a report on flaring earlier this week. It may have some implications for your systems in Texas. I wanted to see what your thoughts were on what they came out within the report?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, thank you. Yes, we\u2019ve actually been pretty engaged with the Railroad Commission on this issue and have attended several conferences, trying to come up with the right solution. And so, as always, we think the Railroad Commission is going to be very constructive. And work to address the concerns that are out there, I would tell you, the producer community, I think, for the most part, is being very responsible on that issue as well.","And we were proud to see Chesapeake in there as one of the top producers in terms of limited flaring. And, of course, we provide those services to them. And so that indicates that our reliability is strong when they\u2019re not having to flare, that tells you our reliability is strong on our service providing. And so we\u2019re proud to see that when our customers are on that list.","And so I would just say, we think that there\u2019s going to be an effort to both at the regulatory level and both by producers themselves to continue to reduce flaring. And we think that\u2019s important for the industry. And we are very supportive of that and we\u2019ll continue to push the industry to do the right thing on that front.","Danilo Juvane","Thank you. Those are all my questions.","Operator","Thank you. This is all the time we have for today\u2019s questions. Thank you for your participation at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.","Alan Armstrong","Great. Thank you. And just would close with saying we\u2019re really pleased with the way the year ended up. We had a lot of headwinds, asset sales commodity prices that we overcame and delivered a great year. And I think that\u2019s really attributable to the wide variety of services and businesses that we operate. And we\u2019re very excited about the growth that is reemerging in several areas and the opportunities that we are working hard to capture. And so we appreciate your continued interest in the company, and thank you for joining us today.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Porter","Thank you, Joshua. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include yesterday\u2019s press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily. Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions and we also have the five leaders of Williams\u2019 operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL and Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Access Midstream; and Jim Scheel leads Northeast G&P.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Finally, I mentioned that we will webcast our annual Analyst Day on May 13, where we will provide an in-depth look at all of our businesses and our extensive backlog of in progress and potential projects. We hope you will join us for that session.","So, with that, I will turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan Armstrong","Great, thank you very much, John and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us and I will jump right in here on Slide 2 with snapshot of our first quarter results. The highlight for the quarter was the completing of our merger of the two MLPs to create the new Williams Partners. And with this milestone achieved, we have created a leading natural gas focused MLP that\u2019s positioned to drive consistent long-term value for our investors. And this quarter\u2019s results also show very strong underpinning of growth in our fee-based revenues that will drive our growth for many years to come. And in fact, all five of WPZ\u2019s operating areas had fee-based revenue growth and four out of the five enjoyed double-digit percentage growth compared to first quarter of \u201814.","And so the Northeast Gathering and Processing segment delivered an impressive 43% growth in fee-based revenues and that was even despite an outage on one of our \u2013 an ethane pipeline in the area and the Atlantic Gulf posted a very impressive 22% gain due to the first of many new projects coming online during the quarter and a continued build on the strength of that business and of course Access Midstream fee-based revenues continued their steady upward march going 11% over the prior year 1Q. We expect this growth in fee-based revenues to continue as we had major projects like our Keathley Canyon only start to contribute very late in the first quarter and big projects like the Rockaway Lateral and Leidy Southeast will provide substantial growth in 2Q and beyond. The weak spot for the quarter was NGL margins being off by $105 million versus the first quarter of \u201814 and our Geismar plant did not start consistently producing ethylene until late March. So, due to the strong growth in fee-based revenues and the strong contraction in commodity margins, actually 96% of our gross margin in the quarter came from fee-based revenues.","Overall, our first quarter 2015 adjusted EBITDA was up 12% to $918 million and Williams received $515 million in distributions from Williams Partners, which is up from $455 million in the first quarter of last year. Overall coverage for WMB was at 1.14 times and this was after increasing our quarterly dividend per share up to $0.58, which was up from $0.40 last year.","WPZ\u2019s coverage was lower than we would have liked, but even with the major drop in NGL margins, if just the base, Geismar volumes at the actual sales prices during the quarter had been producing we would have fully covered our distribution in the quarter. So, again, that\u2019s just the base Geismar volume, not the expanded and just at the actual prices so really shows, I think the strength that we are positioned for as we look forward to the Geismar volumes really starting to kick in here in the second quarter and then get to our full expanded growth volumes in June.","I am also pleased that we are reaffirming our guidance today as it relates to WPZ distributions and WMB dividend. And for Williams, our guidance is $2.38 per share in 2015 with 10% to 15% annual dividend growth through 2017 and all that with growing coverage. And for Williams Partners, we are reaffirming our distribution guidance of $3.40 per share \u2013 per unit in 2015 with 7% to 11% annual LP unit distribution growth through 2017 also with growing coverage. So we are also reaffirming our EBITDA and dividend and distribution growth for both Williams and Williams Partners, but we do expect that 2015 to be near the low end of our ranges as we communicated in our 2014 year end conference call. And so this is really primarily due to three items here.","One, the planning assumption that we have changed on the ethylene prices that we think now from a planning assumption, we have got that built in at closer to the first quarter actual prices of about $0.38 a pound for the balance of the year. And we think there will be some ups \u2013 we think there may be some upside of this, but we certainly want to be closer to current prices with our assumptions right now. Secondly, we have been informed by a couple of our Northeast producing customers that they will curtail Marcellus production as natural gas prices in the basin have been low and they will continue if they don\u2019t see this improve. So we have seen some price related curtailment. We haven\u2019t seen that fall into necessarily the drilling operations, but we have seen it in terms of just physical shut-in of production. And so this is going to dampen some of the expected growth from our Northeast volumes. However, we continue to feel very strong about the health \u2013 overall health of that business as demand for natural gas picks up and some of the extreme bottlenecks that exist in the Northeast started to be relieved. And then finally, we missed some revenues in the first quarter from Geismar and we are currently expecting to not get up to the full expanded plant rate until June. And, as you know, earlier we were expecting that to come on at the full expanded rate in April. So those are really the there items that are driving us down towards the lower end of our range for EBITDA and DCF.","So with that, let\u2019s move on to Slide 3. This list really shows some of the large scale assets that we are executing on. As you can see, it\u2019s a long list and you will also see a tremendous amount of progress that occurred during the first quarter here. An important trend that you will see here is that a lot of these projects are really on the demand side of the business. And so the natural gas market as we have talked about, we think is going to continue to expand. It was first driven by low gas prices on the supply side and now we are seeing the demand side start to pick up. So whether in the near-term, with projects like the Rockaway Lateral, Mobile Bay South III and Leidy Southeast wherein the longer-term projects like Dalton Lateral and Virginia Southside II, the demand side of our network is really picking up and the request for proposals continue to come in for many market driven expansions.","These projects, when we talk about for instance like the Dalton Lateral, they don\u2019t just include the laterals into the new markets, these projects also provide shippers with firm on our mainlines back to the supply point. So we are expanding our mainline all the way back to the supply points as we build out those laterals both, because as you know the Transco system is fully subscribed. So, really nice investment opportunities as the market expands. We have also put some of the mainline portions of our Virginia Southside and Leidy Southeast projects in service early. And we have been very busy at the FERC filing certificate applications for projects like Atlantic Sunrise, Dalton Lateral, Virginia Southside II and Garden State project.","We also are seeing the market into our NGL business coming to life with projects like Bayou Ethane in Texas Belle being placed into service this quarter as well. And on the supply \u2013 and during the first quarter we commissioned the Bucking Horse plant in the Niobrara area. And that will now be reported over in our West segment. We also commissioned the Keathley Canyon Connector project and we have reached an agreement to acquire up to 21% interest in the Utica East Ohio gathering system from Enervest.","The Keathley Canyon Connector, just a little more of that, we did receive first production from Anadarko\u2019s Lucius platform about midway through the quarter, but then in late March, we began receiving a very large volume of gas from Exxon's Hadrian field and so just a little more detail on that. The Lucius field, as you probably know is a deepwater oilfield and the Hadrian field is a gas field. And so really the power of that Keathley Canyon project because the Hadrian field didn\u2019t get turned on until towards the end of March, we really didn\u2019t enjoy a whole lot of Keathley Canyon Connector. But here in the second quarter that facility is really ramping up very nicely with some very strong volumes coming off of that as well as our Gulfstar project continues to build in production and volumes there as well. So as you can see, this list is fairly lengthy and it\u2019s a testament to our great teams that are working very hard everyday to execute on this very aggressive and robust growth plan. And we are really starting to see a lot of these projects come to fruition and we are beginning to see the financial benefits, a lot of tremendous efforts by our \u2013 all of our project teams that are executing.","And so with that, let\u2019s move on to Slide 4. Just to close out here, first of all, the ACMP-WPZ merger, as we said really we think puts us in the position for the natural gas MLP with strong cash distribution growth and investment grade credit ratings. We do think it\u2019s the MLP to be exposed to amongst the large caps if you like the prospects of overall market growth for both natural gas and natural gas derivatives. We would remain very focused and dedicated to our strategy on that side. And we really feel very good about where we are positioned on that. And additionally, I would say on the merger, we have also build some confidence in the synergies and the cost reduction opportunities as the combinations of our businesses has preceded.","We continue to commission and bring on these large scale assets. And the first quarter is a great evidence of that, which you are going to see throughout the next several years continued strength of these big projects coming online and really driving strong growth in our cash flows. I will remind you about 88% of our WPZ gross margin is we expect to come from fee-based revenues. And as mentioned, a combination of the strong growth in the fee-based revenues in the first quarter along with some very weak commodity margins actually drove that up to 96% in the first quarter. So we probably will be below that number here in \u2013 sorry, we will probably be above that 88% number here in 2015 by a combination of very strong fee-based revenues and less dependence on these weaker commodity margins here in 2015.","And in fact, in about $9.3 billion of our 2015 through 2017 in-guidance growth CapEx, 99% of this growth CapEx is focused on fee-based projects with nearly $30 billion of committed and potential growth capital through 2020. So our strategy remains very sound and the backlog of projects to serve the demand side of the growing natural gas markets continues to build and it\u2019s also continuing to firm up. And we are very confident our plan is realistic and allows us to continue to provide solid shareholder return in whichever commodity price environment develops. All of this gives us great confidence that we will deliver high quality long lived cash flows from our competitively advantaged assets.","And finally, I want to give you one last reminder about our Analyst Day being held on May 13. And as I said, you can find information related to this event on our website, as John pointed you to. And we really look forward to sharing with you our great future. And with that, we will open the line up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you so much sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Good morning, guys.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Shneur Gershuni","I guess my first question is you sort of talk about a host of projects I think it\u2019s about $9 billion worth of capital to be spent over the next couple of years. I was wondering if you can sort of talk about plans to finance these assets? Is there enough EBITDA coming in place in 2015 that your leverage ratios can support you investing mostly in debt or alternatively will you need to rely on the equity markets as well too?","Don Chappel","Good morning, Shneur. This is Don. I think the beauty of it is those projects come in fairly ratably during this period. So, I think you can look at it as a continuation of the kind of organic growth that we have seen over the last several years. And we have a lot of that built into our near-term plans for 2015 as it is. So, not to say that there couldn\u2019t be some additions, but we think the capital additions would be relatively modest. It could require some additional debt and\/or equity, but we think that will be pretty modest in 2015. Certainly, as you can see in our guidance, the capital falls off somewhat in \u201816 and \u201817 and that will be filled with some of these organic projects as they are contracted and\/or sanctioned and we would expect a combination of debt and equity to finance those in the future.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay, great. And just a follow-up to some of your prepared remarks, you talked about the potential for drilled uncompleted wells in the Northeast, is this a scenario where we would see those volumes really manifest itself in the second half of this year after the summer smoothen gas prices that we typically see or is this something that could take longer to play out? And then, if you can also talk about what the impact would be on the legacy access assets as well too in terms of the fee of service rate structure that you have in place?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, sure. I will take that in the two parts there. First of all, just to clarify, what we actually are seeing is actual shut-in of existing flowing production. So \u2013 and my comment around the drilling operations was comprehensive to both the drilling and the completion. So, we are not seeing a lot of drilled wells not being completed, we are just seeing actual decisions to shut-in production because of extremely low netbacks in some of the constrained areas up in the far Northeast part of the Marcellus. On the second part of that question, ye, the areas that we see that we would obviously see that pickup to the degree that volume coming in lower we would see that affect the cost of service calculations for the future if those volumes didn\u2019t flow. And we will by the way, Bob Purgason is going to be given a nice tutorial of that at the Analyst Day and going to provide some more detail at our May 13, Analyst Day around the way some of those contracts work in this environment.","Shneur Gershuni","Cool. And one last follow-up, I was wondering if you can just talk about the Canadian oil fields business for a minute, margins have been challenged and so forth kind of like what steps Williams is taking to try and improve that and so forth or is it really just going to be dependent on the macro environment?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, great question. I would say that first of all extremely low pricing in the quarter on propane up there. And so, we actually saw Edmonton propane a lot of you probably don\u2019t follow Edmonton propane, because you just see the Belvieu and Conway postings, but Edmonton propane really actually got down to around a dime. So, it was quite a bit lower than the value of natural gas in the quarter. So, we did see some extremities up there in the Alberta markets in terms of seeing very low propane prices and that certainly did hamper and will continue to hamper. The long-term solution to that is great projects like our PDH project, which will provide great markets for those captive propane barrels up there. The propylene market remain actually pretty good and we are railing that out of there as part of our PDH project to the degree we go ahead with that, which we are excited about that project still and to the degree we go ahead with that, not only will that open up markets for the propane through the conversion to propylene, but also will provide a new market for the propylene there via the polypropylene unit that would be built downstream of our facility, but \u2013 and we wouldn\u2019t own that, but it would be part of the overall complex. And so we are working to open up markets if you will for those stranded products and so that\u2019s really the effort that we have growing about that. We also do have with that some structure contracts that will come, that will put some callers around the value of our products up there and help make that look more fee-based and take some of this extreme volatility that we have seen there.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. Thank you very much guys.","Alan Armstrong","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","Good morning, everyone.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Christine Cho","So, I just wanted to touch on this \u2013 the acquisition of the 21% equity interest in UEOM. And given it was immediately accretive, you guys still are or at least WMB is waiving $43 million of IDRs between now and \u201817. Is this because the JV is reinvesting in the cash flow back into the business or is there something else going on?","Don Chappel","Christine, this is Don. Good morning. Williams chose to waive the IDRs, because it\u2019s a business that also has quite a bit of growth. So, the cash flows in the first year, first couple of years, are not nearly as robust as they are a few years out. So, that\u2019s really what made it immediately accretive is really the willingness of Williams to support the acquisition, because we think it\u2019s strategic one. And two, we think it will provide very attractive returns. Does that answer your question?","Christine Cho","I guess just a follow-up \u2013 actually, I will follow-up offline. Pricing for Geismar at least for the existing facility, I know that you have numerous contracts, but from what I understand at a high level, the reference pricing is Mont Belvieu, but I think you are actually selling it in Louisiana. So, are the contracts structured so that it\u2019s Mont Belvieu plus some fixed number on top of that, maybe $0.02 or $0.03, because that\u2019s what the customer would have to pay for transport if they were physically bringing it from Texas? And then it\u2019s \u2013 some of the expansion capacity that will be exposed to the actual spot pricing in Louisiana, which is currently $0.10 to $0.15 higher than Belvieu. Is that kind of how I should be thinking about it?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Christine, actually those contracts are swaps back \u2013 a lot of those are swaps back to the Mont Belvieu market at Belvieu market. And so there are exchanges between parties that have product in the river versus \u2013 and parties that have demand at Belvieu. And so those are actually are setup as swaps. And so you shouldn\u2019t build anything on top of that. The way the business is structured of course there is a number of different contracts and there is quite a bit of complicity to it, but the way you really should think about it is that we have customers that have a call on about 80% \u2013 up to about 80% of our production at Geismar. And sometimes they will take all of that, sometimes they won\u2019t. If they don\u2019t take all of that, then we have the 20% plus whatever they leave for us to sell into the \u2013 physically sell into the Geismar market on spot. And so that\u2019s really how you should think about that. So, when we are operating at just the base rate, we won\u2019t have any excess available to sell in to that market, unless somebody doesn\u2019t call on that production for whatever reason, they might have a plant down or they maybe have a better price from somebody else and it might not call on that volume. And at that point, we would be free to sell it in to the highest value market wherever that is. So, I think that\u2019s the right way to think about that.","Christine Cho","I see. That\u2019s very helpful. And then what about the expansion capacity is that going to be the same way or that\u2019s going to be actually exposed to spot pricing in Louisiana?","Alan Armstrong","Well, as you can think about a lot of the actual expansion, so \u2013 basis, we are running at about 70% of total expanded, which is very close to base rate. And so at the number I quoted at 80% is 80% of the full expanded rate. So at the base rate, we don\u2019t have any excess provided that people call on their volumes.","Christine Cho","I see. Okay, that was very helpful. Thank you. And then I guess could you also talk about expectations for the ethylene market maybe near-term and medium-term, it sounds like worldwide supply demand is pretty tight for the year and maybe was short in the U.S. next year, but any insight into what you are seeing would be helpful?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I am going to ask John Dearborn to pick up on that, please.","John Dearborn","Yes. Thanks, Christine and thanks for the lead-in on the subject as well. So I guess from our perspective, we would be a bit bullish on ethylene as the year wears on, but we don\u2019t want to set an unrealistic expectation. But if we take a look at steadily increasing oil prices, strong demand, strong margins in the derivatives, certainly here in North America, we will be filling some underutilized assets in the Louisiana market. And we came into the year with relatively low inventories and so all of that I think would blend credence to a positive outlook on the year. Of course, how the market performs would \u2013 is yet to be proven.","Christine Cho","Great, thanks so much.","Operator","And next, we will move on to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl Kirst","Thank you. Good morning everybody. John, can we just kind of keep on the thread of the ethylene price for a second. And I guess I am trying to think of basically to Christine\u2019s question, you are trying to reconcile thinking that we would maybe be on a gradual strengthening through the year versus it sounds like Alan what you said for planning purposes, we are kind of keeping it more flat at this $0.38 level. And so I guess I am just trying to better understand what may \u2013 what\u2019s going to have to happen to kick the ethylene price back into the 4 years or where our midpoint of guidance is for \u201816 and \u201917, is there a gating event we should be watching or is it something as simple as quite frankly, just global GDP here?","Alan Armstrong","Thanks for the follow-on question. No, I think there are a number of factors that could play into the prices moving up. I think this is a natural tightening of the market as these markets the uses of ethylene growing year upon year globally into the very large markets at somewhere above 2% a year, somewhere about 3% a year, I am sorry. These global markets grow every year. And its okay, that supply has been \u2013 and there is not a lot of high coming in the next year or so. And so you could imagine it\u2019s going to be a continual thing you can just basically find on demand. Of course, we are going to un-restrict the market a little bit here but from Louisiana and Texas, that should be helpful to the Gulf Coast certainly to the Gulf Coast market. And I think the third factor that could play into this is with relatively low inventories coming into the year of ethylene. And we always predict rather high utilization rates on crackers. We have had a pretty good first quarter, but if there should be some mishaps in some crackers around the system in the Gulf Coast, of course that could provide a negative supply shock to the market, which would of course have an impact on prices. So I just think it\u2019s a general growth in the ethylene building markets that\u2019s going to continue to see us enjoy some positive pressure here. But I can\u2019t ever predict as how quick it\u2019s going to move. If we look at polyethylene today, polyethylene is selling somewhere around this $0.50 range. And so there is certainly plenty of margin in the changed matter of like a split between each of the products in the chain.","Carl Kirst","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Alan and I understand you guys are going to be doing a deep dive here quite shortly, but is there any additional color perhaps to share, say for instance on Appalachian Connector at this point whether it\u2019s on a slow burn or I guess, is there anything incremental to add at this point?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, not a whole lot to add there at this point, Carl. I would just say the market is continuing to try to shape around that. And I would say it\u2019s a mix between \u2013 on our project is a mix between producer push and market pull and trying to find the right balance of that. And obviously, one of our primary goals there is to make sure that we have the very best market outlets available for our upstream assets coming out of OVM. And so that\u2019s an item that we have focused on pretty tightly and has I would just say, added some parameters and constraints to the project. And so that\u2019s one of the things though that from our advantage point, we are very focused on and we are very serious when we talk about connecting best supplies to best markets. We are very serious about making sure we accomplish that. And so that\u2019s really been one of the complicating factors on that. But we will have more to talk about at the Analyst Day on that.","Carl Kirst","Would it be fair if I think the last timing update is potentially late 2018 and the service if it all came together kind of working backwards, is it fair to say \u2013 well, to meet that date, you need to get commercial viability contracts by the end of 2015 as far as the potential target?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I would say given some of the difficult areas that includes Appalachian Trail crossing and some forest \u2013 right around some forest service, I would say that\u2019s getting pretty late if it pushes back that far. So I think people are going to learn some lessons on that effort in terms of trying to get build through that difficult area.","Carl Kirst","Understood, I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Chris Sighinolfi","Hey, Alan. How are you?","Alan Armstrong","Great. How are you doing?","Chris Sighinolfi","I am great. I just had a couple of questions. I am not sure if this is one for you or for Don, but I am just looking at the project sort of calendar, which slide that is, it looks like the CapEx on Atlantic Sunrise came down by a touch from the time you reported 4Q, it looks like about $200 million, just wondering what drove that?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, sure. Well, I would tell you that\u2019s pretty exciting news. And I would say that the \u2013 if you think about all of the resources and the \u2013 whether it\u2019s steel mills or skilled labor, if you think about all of the resources that we are supporting some massive drilling operations here in the U.S. and the fact that those are now slacking, we really are starting to see that come through even though it\u2019s a different area of the business, we are really starting to see that come through in our sector of the business as well. And so that reduction was based on a number of things. One was a firm we now acquired, our pipe is purchased and we saw that come in dramatically lower than our expectation for the price with the price of steel coming down. And we also are seeing much softer prices on the contractor rates for construction practices as well. So the team is doing a great job of really looking for any and every opportunity on that. And so we had quite a bit of contingency built into that. And so we are just taking \u2013 one of those is just actual prices of steel coming in much lower than we expected and some of the rest of that is taking some of the contingency out that we had built in there.","Chris Sighinolfi","So, Alan is that something we are likely to see on some of the other projects you are advancing or is it just given where Atlantic Sunrise was in the development phase at the time of the price collapse that was sort of squarely manifested on that project. And then as the second question, I think you had talked about a seven times multiple anticipated on that project in particular, is that now likely to be improved versus that prior estimate or given your assessment as to what was sort of captured originally is it unchanged?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. No, you are right. That will come \u2013 that will fall right to our bottom line because that project was negotiated, great projects. So whatever capital we save comes to us on that. And on the first part of your question around will we see it, that kind of savings trends into other projects, I would say absolutely. We are seeing some pretty big relief on major equipment, on steel prices and importantly on the availability of engineering and skilled labor resources. And so we certainly will see that come through. I would say though that before we write that into our books, while that is subsiding, I would say the regulatory environment for projects continues to get more and more difficult. And so we have to leave some contingency in there for that. So, the actual cost of construction for these projects, I think is definitely \u2013 the answer to that is definitely that is coming down, but clearly like we have seen on projects like constitution, where the regulatory format is \u2013 and several people have say so over it and sometimes are mutually exclusive requirements. Those kinds of complications I think will continue to hit the industry, particularly in areas where there is heavy population centers like in the Northeast, where a lot of the growth is.","Chris Sighinolfi","Yes. No, I understood. I guess switching gears my second question would be in regards to the ACMP side of business, I think you guys have reiterated the CapEx plan there roughly 21% of the $9.3 billion, with the CHK CapEx reduction already sort of anticipated by you in that number or is there downside to perhaps how much CapEx to put in the ACMP side in conjunction with a slowdown over at Chesapeake?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Let me have Bob Purgason take that.","Bob Purgason","Yes. Chris, I think what you are seeing is the big build out on our systems has largely already occurred. So, even though we are seeing a slight kind of current decrease in capital in general, just you are not going to see something significant, because the infrastructure is built out.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. So, in terms of the cost of service modeling that we had done historically on the ACMP, the major driver of that is simply how much you could deploy in any time period? I guess what I am getting after is do you have much in the way of sort of visibility on that side of it certainly as we move past 2015 or are we sort of just cautiously trading along and watching what the producer CapEx might shakeout to be?","Bob Purgason","Yes. Well, again I think we will talk some more. In fact, I have got some good examples of how the cost of service models respond to this environment coming up at the Analyst Day, but again remember, the bulk of that build out was in the early years that\u2019s occurred. And we had planned always for the capital to tail off in the out years and then you have adjustment there for some contractual growth that happens as a result of that levelized rate. But again, it\u2019s, I would say, on plan to what we have expected in terms of current performance.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay, great. Well, thanks guys for the help there. I look forward to more color on the 13th.","Bob Purgason","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we will move on to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","Good morning, guys.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Shere","Don, to start with your answer to the equity issuance question didn\u2019t exactly sound like what I thought I heard on the last call when maybe you might have described \u201816\/17 base case budget following de minimis equity issuance. Are you perhaps more agnostic as you see how commodity pricing shakes out and how does the CapEx deflation pressure Alan just referred to reflect on those kinds of decisions?","Don Chappel","Craig thanks for the follow-up. Again I was commenting on again what I think we have a modest amount of equity required to execute the plans in our guidance. However, obviously, we have a lot of other projects on the burner here. And I was really commenting on the fact that some of those additional projects would require some additional financing. I think that was part of that question. And that additional financing would be a combination of equity and debt. And the real guiding \u2013 the guidelines there are really maintaining our credit metrics and credit ratings. So, that will really be the guide. In terms of the way we are thinking about UEO right now, we are always thinking of that as more of a 13% acquisition versus the 21%, because we do expect that our partner will step up and acquire the 8% that they have a right to acquire.","Craig Shere","I got it. So, the base plant hasn\u2019t changed at all in terms of funding despite some of the first second quarter headwinds you all described?","Don Chappel","Yes, there is some I would call it modest changes obviously the UEO was certainly not part of the plan.","Craig Shere","Sure. And any further thoughts I am sure you will discuss it in a couple of weeks here, but around ACMP WPZ merger related commercial opportunities and CapEx savings over and above the $50 million cost synergies?","Alan Armstrong","Let me take that. I think the commercial opportunities continue to be very exciting, particularly in kind of the West Virginia and Southwest PA area. And so that\u2019s very attractive. And as well I would say the combination of our joint venture opportunities between in the Utica are also presenting some nice opportunities and the combination of the liquid clearing outlets for that business are very attractive to us as well. So, I would say the opportunities have probably been maybe even a little better than we thought, because we have got Access with providing basically a greater reach and some great capabilities in terms of well connect and compression addition in the area that really allows us to kind of expand the reach for OVM. So, we have got several deals that we are working right now that are fairly substantial and really are just firmly as a result of having those two capabilities brought together. So, we remain very excited about that.","On the CapEx \u2013 sorry on \u2013 further on synergies, a measure I like to look at is what percentage of our overhead or our G&A costs are hitting us as a percentage of our fee-based revenues and that has come down pretty dramatically here over the last \u2013 as we look in \u201814 in other words we take all of our G&A expenses compared to fee-based revenues in \u201814 and look at that into 2015. That\u2019s come down pretty dramatically. And it\u2019s hard to move that number very big, because it is such big numbers, but that\u2019s a measure that I like to watch and that\u2019s improving very nicely which tells me we are able to use the scale of our overhead to grow our business and bottom line improve our net margins. So, both of those things are very positive. And I would say as well on the CapEx side, we are in general expense side we are finding things where we are able to take the best contract offerings, where we buy chemicals or lube oil or things like that on a procurement side and our supply chain management side, we are finding some good synergies there in taking the very best prices amongst the two entities.","Craig Shere","Great. That\u2019s helpful. And last question again I am sure we are going to hear some more, but is there anything more to speak on with regards to PDH and Geismar 2 opportunities?","Alan Armstrong","I would say that as I mentioned earlier the cost reductions that we are enjoying on the pipeline side were also seeing that on some of the heavy equipment side for project like PDH. And so as we are refining those estimates on PDH to come forward for our final investment decision on PDH, we have got a lot of positive tailwinds associated with lower cost on that. And we are hoping to be able to provide a little more detail about where we are on that at the Analyst Day Meeting in terms of the traction, but I would just say just generally the PDH project is moving ahead very nicely and we are more nearing having all the facts and figures in place to make a final investment decision on that. And then on Geismar 2, really strong interest in the project and I am pretty excited about the way that\u2019s positioned with some pretty attractive partners and I think that one is moving at the pace we would expect and we are excited about that as well. So both of those projects I would say continue to gain momentum.","Craig Shere","Great, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Brandon Blossman","Good morning, guys.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Brandon Blossman","Alan, moving kind of to the longer dated end of your project backlog and thinking about what\u2019s out there, including potential projects, it looks like quarter-over-quarter, one, you have rolled forward a year, but two, you have added $5 billion to that big picture outlook, is that just a function of rolling forward or is there quite a few incremental projects in that outlook?","Alan Armstrong","There are a few incremental projects in the outlook and I would say that we also \u2013 I am proud to say we are firming up some things as well as some projects in the kind of the medium-term that have \u2013 that we have added in there that just kind of came to us unexpectedly that have been added. So several of the market-type expansions for instance on Transco, but we have also got some sizable opportunities as the market continues to build out for the LNG. Transco, of course is extremely well positioned to serve many of the LNG projects. And so we have gone through some very successful open seasons and so that\u2019s adding some projects. And as well, we have got some opportunities to with \u2013 into serving Mexico that are \u2013 have come on the radar screen as well. So overall, it\u2019s a combination of new projects kind of in the medium-term that have been added in and are firming up very nicely and further out on the back end some of these new projects that has Transco serving markets in the southern end of its system.","Brandon Blossman","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess fair to assume that we will hear more about that at Analyst Day or all those projects. Third question for you even bigger picture. Are we kind of firmly moving as it relates to Transco but gas transport in general, are we moving from a temporary supplier-driven project Q2 much more weighted towards demand things and demands in your project?","Don Chappel","We absolutely are and I am really excited to see that. I think all along, we have thought that this natural gas market growth would come \u2013 has been supply-led and obviously that\u2019s put lower prices out, which is just further encouraged the confidence in the demand side just are taking advantage of that and we are really starting to see that come through on our systems on the natural gas side. But we also, I think we remain really excited about that as it relates to the natural gas, liquids and the Petchem space and positioning ourselves to be able to serve that growing market as well. So I would say the natural gas market expansion is upon us. And we are seeing that through all of these RFPs and all this growth in our system. And we would try to be ahead a little bit of the NGL Petchem build out. And we are very confident that with the expansion going on in that space, it\u2019s going to take a lot more plumbing and storage to serve that growing market. As we positioned our self well for that and the Bayou Ethane project and Texas Belle are just kind of the front end of those opportunities for us.","Brandon Blossman","Okay, thank you. I appreciate it. I appreciate the color.","Don Chappel","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi.","Eric Genco","Good morning. I was wondering is kind of piggybacking on some of these CapEx questions, is there some building conservatism to your maintenance CapEx guidance of $430 million, because the roughly $15 million this quarter seemed \u2013 is that really just seasonality or is there sort of a hint there that maybe that\u2019s some built-in conservatism?","Don Chappel","No, I wouldn\u2019t go put that in the bank. That is seasonality and we typically see that in the first quarter. We have got winter weather and we have got the crews tied up on meeting peak demands. We hit some extreme peaks on our system here in the first quarter and so that\u2019s a really bad time to be to be maintenance on your pipelines. And so you will see those dollars increase here over the summer months. You will see as our work crews are out doing those \u2013 doing the maintenance on our pipelines, you will see that pick right back up.","Eric Genco","Okay. And then my second question, I was hoping you could expand a little bit on sort of the Canadian side of things, is the Canadian PDH facility all included in some of the CapEx guidance that you have given for the MB side of things?","Don Chappel","No, it is not included in guidance. It is in that potential pie, the $30 billion, but it is not in the $9.3 billion guidance.","Eric Genco","Okay. I am just trying to, I guess, get a sense of the different pieces of what\u2019s there because I kind of look through the projects that are there, it looks like their horizon upgrader comes on 4Q \u201815, is that in parts of PV through 2015 [ph], Texas Belle build through 2015. There is - and then kind of looking at that relative to the CapEx guidance of $260 million for growth for 2015, $185 million for \u201816, what - I guess what are some of the $185 million in \u201816 and just to try to understand how the capital spend is going there, because it really if you look at and I understand that there are some commodity issues that work but given kind of the way it looks like some of those things are coming on, I just want to understand what I am missing because it looks like for an incremental $35 million of EBITDA over that period of time, but $445 million in over those 2 years, I am just trying to understand that and what\u2019s missing?","Alan Armstrong","I am not sure exactly what you are looking at.","Don Chappel","For the segment capital guidance there.","Eric Genco","It's on Slide, maybe not 17, but probably close.","Alan Armstrong","And so your question is where is the profitability from all of that capital spending that\u2026?","Eric Genco","Well, there is that and then maybe also just the timing of what is \u2013 what\u2019s going on in \u201816 that requires $185 million, if Horizon comes along in 4Q \u201815 and the ethane pipe and then what Texas Belle in \u201815, where is sort of the \u2013 where is that going and what\u2019s the incremental?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, great question. And as I mentioned on the previous response, we really are excited about being kind on the tip of the iceberg and building out the infrastructure for the Petchem expansion. And so a lot of that capital in \u201816 is focused on building out for what we think is a growing position on the Petchem side there. And so we are putting quite a bit of capital to work building out some of these legacy systems that we bought a couple of \u2013 2 years or 3 years ago, we bought quite a bit of a latent pipeline down there from parties like Exxon and BP and Explore. And so this capital is putting a lot of those pipelines to work making interconnections, extending them, expanding them and pushing them into those markets. And so that\u2019s what a lot of that capital was.","Eric Genco","Okay, thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Alan Armstrong","And you can see some of those projects on I believe its Slide 37, I believe it is, you can see some of the detail. And we will be providing some more detail in the Analyst Day on that.","Eric Genco","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And next, we will move on to Mark Reichman with Simmons & Company.","Mark Reichman","Good morning. Alan has alluded to some of the challenges in receiving permits, etcetera. And so just wanted to ask if you could just walk us through the process of bringing Constitution in service in the second half and what variables could lead to and in-service date at the front end versus the latter part of the year. And maybe expand your answer to talk a little bit about some of the regulatory challenges of some of these projects that are listed on Page 18 of the data book and your expectations with regard to how they apply to the expected in-service dates?","Alan Armstrong","Question, and then I am going to ask Rory to give you some more detail on the Constitution project and what\u2019s going on. The projects that many of which are on Page 18 there, many of those projects are along our existing right of way. And so to agree they are along are existing right of way, much less public resistance and certainly that\u2019s one of the huge advantages of Transco is that it\u2019s already got right of way in the extremely heavily populated areas that are very difficult to establish any new routes and so most of those projects are expansion along that existing right of way. You can see that one big exception is that leg coming down on Atlantic Sunrise. But our team has really gotten ahead of that and it\u2019s done a nice job of getting out and getting some of the tougher areas of right of way pin down on that one.","And so I would say we are very fortunate to have the established right of ways that we have. And I would say Constitution is an example of one where we didn\u2019t have existing right of ways. And I think as kind of foreshadows what the industry is up against in terms of getting new pipelines built in areas like this. And particularly, as you get further into New York and New England area, it gets more difficult as you get into those areas. And everybody wants lower priced energy, but nobody wants the pipeline in their backyard and that\u2019s simply the issue that we are facing here. And we really need some political leadership to really establish an energy policy that would encourage and help the public understand the benefit of having these lower priced energy into their areas. On the Constitution piece, I am going to turn that over to Rory to talk about the detail to permitting them.","Mark Reichman","And just quickly is it challenged more at the state level, it\u2019s more at the state level than the federal agencies, correct?","Alan Armstrong","It is certainly in general that is correct. In the case of Constitution it is almost squarely on the state there. But the challenge is when the feds have delegated their authority to the state and the state doesn\u2019t see it as something they critically need. That\u2019s the reason we have interstate commerce laws and so that one state can\u2019t block another state from enjoying the benefits of infrastructure. And yet in some of these cases for whatever reason the feds have delegated some of their authority and that is where we run into some of these problems. Rory will take the permit, please thanks.","Rory Miller","Okay. That was a great runway to kind of where we are at from a regulatory standpoint to get this project in service. I think everybody is aware that sometime ago we got our FERC certificate for this project. But as Alan pointed out, some of the permitting had been delegated to the state of New York. We have most everything we need other than the New York DEC final permit on this project. We do have all of our land and right-of-way secured. We are what I would say \u2013 what I would call in the final pros of working through some final details on some wetlands issues and the New York DEC I feel like it really rolled up their sleeves and working with us very closely on trying to get the remaining questions answered. And we are very optimistic that we are going to be getting a permit here in the next couple of months. And I believe there is also Corp of Engineers permit that would follow that. But that\u2019s more of a sequencing issue than an issue where we expect any type of dispute or anything like that.","Once we get started and like I said we believe that will be in a couple of months and take about a year to construct, that\u2019s not exactly right, but for planning purposes just figure a year or so. If we get the New York DEC permits than the permits from the Corp of Engineering which would follow say middle of the summer then we can be in service in the middle of the summer in 2016. If they come in later just kind of use that year timeline as how much we would move back in-service date. But I would say in general right now I feel better about this Constitution project and where we are at than I have in the last 2 years. Things have really been coming together. People have been very engaged at the agencies. They are trying to do their job. And I think because of the climate in New York, their standard is very high. But they are just going to make sure that they have all of their ducks in a row and I think we are very close to that point.","Mark Reichman","So if the DEC is taking public comments until May 14, then you think that they could file or grant the permit say in the June timeframe?","Rory Miller","I think that\u2019s the case. This latest re-filing that we did with New York DEC was merely procedural. In fact the year prior we had done the exact same thing but we basically canceled and re-filed with all the existing information that we have been building up in the project. And in fact the New York DEC came out and said, they required to have this open comments period, but they said look, we have already commented, we got your comment, we are going to be using and considering all the previous comments that have been supplied. So the additional 14 day period would be for if there are any new comments that hadn\u2019t already been covered by the previous comment period then those would come in. But I think all of that\u2019s has been run down to ground pretty sufficiently and I don\u2019t really see that as introducing any new risk into the timeline that we see before us now.","Mark Reichman","And not to flog it too much more, but \u2013 so this was for the water quality certificate application, so what about the air title permit related to the compression station upgrade?","Rory Miller","I think we have got all that. This water issue is the issue that\u2019s really kind of the last has been push we need to get through.","Mark Reichman","Okay great. Thank you very much for the color.","Rory Miller","You bet.","Operator","Thank you. And next we will move to Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Lasky","Good morning. Just curious on the shut-in volumes, can you just quantify the impact of that for the quarter or just the magnitude going forward?","Alan Armstrong","I am sorry could you repeat that?","Brian Lasky","The shut in volumes, yes, can you quantify that?","Alan Armstrong","Sure. One of the probably most obvious pieces on that as Cabot has made some announcements on that. And we expect that to be to between about $300 million and $500 million of shut in volumes over a number of that would grow and we think that\u2019s probably for about five months or six months. So and most of that we think will just be here in the second quarter, during the shoulder months. And so they can make good money at very low prices up there. But when the systems are full up there and there is not enough market. They really get \u2013 the spot incremental sale gets extremely low and puts pressure on their other productions since they are such a large producer in the region they tend to put pressure against their own sales. And so we think this is short-lived but and maybe second and into the third quarter a little better, but that\u2019s about it. So that\u2019s the amount we expect.","Brian Lasky","Got it. And then just on your \u2013 I was wondering if you could just walk us through high level I am sure you will go through this more at the Analyst Day, but just high level how you guys are thinking about volumes across your gathering and processing in the West and Northeast kind of the balance of the year, if you could provide kind of a high level trajectory of how you are thinking about that?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Sure. I would say in the West volumes continue to remain pretty flat, pretty steady out there and the rate escalators that we have in our contracts over time have basically after gathering our fee-based gathering revenues extremely flat in the West despite some pretty light declines. And so I would \u2013 I think we would expect that to continue. I think the bigger question will come into the \u201916, \u201917 timeframes in terms of what kind of continued drilling might occur. The one area we are seeing some continued activity that our team has done a great job of capturing is in the San Juan Basin, particular with the Mancos play and the team has done a great job of continuing to capture that business. And of course the volumes in Bucking Horse will continue to grow and that plant just got really as we speak is really just getting lined out to build a ramp up to full throughput on that facility.","So those are kind of the drivers that I think will keep us relatively flat. And we will just have to wait and see what holds for \u201816 and \u201817 depending on gas prices and how those move over time. In the Northeast, I would say continued very, very impressive production rates from wells particularly the Utica dry the wet really have kind of for somewhat \u2013 to some degree of kind of not built into our plan, but we are seeing more and more evidence that the combination of the Utica dry along with the Marcellus wet particularly around our OVM system is some pretty powerful combination of the economics for producers. And of course the other side of that coin is the great success that they are having is continuing to put pressure on the bottlenecks and constraints getting out of the area. And so, again I think we are excited about seeing all of this demand pool coming into the market on our Transco system because we know where there are some great supplies that can help feed that for years to come and continue to grow the market steadily. But I think we are going to continue to see pretty moderate drilling in the Marcellus and the Utica as forecast. We don\u2019t see really big changes to that. And I think really the only surprise to this for the quarter was just the shut-ins due to lower prices was really the only surprise we have seen on the volume side.","Brian Lasky","Got it. So would you characterize what you are seeing thus far in the first quarter is pretty consistent with what you are planning in the guidance?","Alan Armstrong","Yes.","Brian Lasky","Absent the shut-ins? ","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Very close to it, staying right in line with our expectations.","Brian Lasky","And then maybe just one last question. You talked a little bit about the dry gas Utica, and then \u2013 and one of your competitors that are out there talking about potential opportunity there and I was just wondering if you guys could talk about the competitive dynamics for some of those opportunities that you are seeing right now with the increase in the number of MLPs up in the region and also in light of what\u2019s going in the broader commodity environment?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I would just say whoever has got the pipe in place and has the best market outlet is probably going to win that business up there. And we have positioned ourselves very well to get that accomplished. And anybody can always come in and buy business and so forth. But I think we are positioned to really make a nice return on our investment by just capturing the business that is \u2013 that we are well positioned to capture in the area. And so I think we will continue to do that. But clearly, one of the key issues up there is going to be a multitude of market outlets, not just any one market outlet, but multiple market outlets. And we are trying to make sure as we grow our system, we are really investing our efforts in making sure that we have got best market outlets for the gas up there. And so that\u2019s involved a large team on both our marketing side, on the gathering end as well as our team from Transco and our Atlantic Gulf team really trying to make sure we are providing very best market outlets for the producers up there. And just like that, it\u2019s always been a winner for Southwest, we think that will be a winner for us in the Northeast as well long-term.","Brian Lasky","And just one final one on Appalachian Connector there, do you have to negotiate directly with the park service there, is that how that one works and does that require enact of Congress, can you just maybe just walk through the regulatory process for that project in particular and kind of what you guys have baked into your timeline in terms of the regulatory schedule?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Maybe we will get into that level of detail a little more at the Analyst Day, I will just say we worked pretty hard to stay away from areas that would require that kind of protracted permitting requirements in the area. But it\u2019s an area that requires some pretty careful orchestration to step through. And we will provide some more detail on that \u2013 on the Appalachian Connector at the May analyst meeting.","Brian Lasky","Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much.","Alan Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Abhi Rajendran from Credit Suisse.","Abhi Rajendran","Hi guys, good morning.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Abhi Rajendran","Couple of quick questions, now that the commodity backdrop has stabilized a little bit do you have any update on the drop down of the remaining NGL Petchem projects at WMB level, I know last update you guys gave was that was going to get pushed out maybe later in the year, but any update or color there will be helpful?","Don Chappel","Abhi, this is Don. Really, no update at this point, we can talk more about it at the Analyst Day. But there is no urgent need to do it. And certainly, we feel better about it when equities are trading better. So that\u2019s kind of where we stand.","Abhi Rajendran","Okay, got it. And then last quick one for me. Looking ahead to Analyst Day, are you guys thinking about sort of reintroducing the segment level guidance which you had last year would kind of help give some color by segment what\u2019s going on to volumes and margins and whatnot?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Abhi, I would just say we haven\u2019t confirmed that yet and so just stay tuned for Analyst Day.","Abhi Rajendran","Okay, got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And next, we will move on to Timm Schneider with Evercore.","Timm Schneider","Hey, good morning guys. Most of my questions have been answered, so I have a macro question for you guys. How do you see the Northeast NGL scenario kind of play out, right, so one of your peers is saying they are going to be running at 90% utilization just firing NGLs into the base and you are getting into the shoulder season where it\u2019s another real propane demand basically lack of storage, how do you think about realizations up in the Northeast and getting those NGLs to a home where they are actually needed?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, great question, Timm. And as you know we have been concerned about this since the Bluegrass days and we remain very concerned about the clearing of liquids out of the area. And I think unfortunately, the answer is they are going to get cleared out there by rail. And just as evidenced, what\u2019s going on in that space, our Conway rail facility for the first time that I can ever remember is even though we have dramatically expanded our rail position \u2013 our rail rack position there at Conway, our inbound which I don\u2019t ever remember this occurring, our inbound capacity on rail is fully contracted for the summer months. And so I think that tells you kind of what\u2019s going on, which is all those products getting put on rail and it is going to any home again for storage and Conway is an attractive place for that. And of course Conway then has great access into the Bellevue markets when it\u2019s needed there as well. So I think that\u2019s what we are going to see, I think already seeing it. And I think the wholesale marketers of the NGLs have realized that\u2019s one of the few places that you can clear those liquids and then sell them into the market as the market demands them. So I think that\u2019s what we are going to continue to see more of the beneficiary that there with Conway. And if anything, we are probably guilty of under-pricing that service given how strong the demand has been there.","Timm Schneider","That\u2019s interesting. Can you tell us how much of it is to rail from the Easter Conway?","Alan Armstrong","No, I don\u2019t have the detail on exactly what that rate is.","Timm Schneider","Got it. And in terms of building additional storage in the Northeast, specifically I realize it\u2019s all above ground storage because it\u2019s simply reservoirs and that doesn\u2019t really work for NGLs, do you have any sense of how much more it is to build storage in the Northeast than in the Gulf Coast?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I would \u2013 if you don't have a salt formation, you really don\u2019t have a very attractive place or a few projects that we have been looking at through the Access team and looking at some areas to try to develop that, but I would just say it is the scale of opportunity is very limited for storage because you don\u2019t have the big salt lands like you do in either the Conway area or the Gulf Coast area salt land has provided the opportunity for storage. Without that, it's very difficult \u2013 and frankly that\u2019s one of the reasons that the Gulf Coast Petchem space is continuing to be prolific for year after year after year as one it has access in ports, but also it\u2019s got the great advantage of salt dome storage for both the raw \u2013 feedstocks as well as the finished product. And that\u2019s in the Olefin\u2019s basins. So those are the big advantages. And frankly, I don\u2019t see that changing anytime soon. So, very expensive to build any kind of storage capability in the Northeast, because mostly it\u2019s going to be above ground storage capabilities.","Timm Schneider","It sounds like your view that Northeast in fact does need another export solution over call it the next 2 year or 3 years?","Alan Armstrong","Yes.","Timm Schneider","Okay, thank you.","Alan Armstrong","Thanks, Timm.","Operator","Thank you. And next we will move on to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Good morning. Thanks for all the color this morning, it\u2019s been very helpful. I just wanted to touch base \u2013 here has been some chatter in the marketplace for the potential of a family level consolidation to improve the family\u2019s cost of capital. Our impression has been that there is not really any rush or need to do that, do something like this right of way that we can give the post-ACMP structure a chance to prove itself and earn a re-rating from the market. I was just wondering if you can provide any thoughts on Williams cost of capital and any other updates or thoughts on family level consolidation if that makes sense?","Don Chappel","Jeremy, this is Don. I think we have discussed that periodically in the past in terms of pros and cons. And we do believe that WPZ is positioned to improve its cost of capital. So you know we don\u2019t have that here today and we can certainly talk more about that during Analyst Day.","Jeremy Tonet","Okay, fair enough. Thanks.","Don Chappel","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Ms. Cho, please check your mute function.","Christine Cho","Sorry. I just had two very quick follow-ups. The 80% swap at Geismar to Bellevue when does that roll off, if at all?","Alan Armstrong","You know there is a multitude of contracts there Christine and so none of them \u2013 they don\u2019t all start in, but typically they are not real long-term contracts that are established in that market. But there is a variety of terms on those contracts.","Christine Cho","And then with the maintenance CapEx, I know you kind of addressed the regulated maintenance CapEx, but what about for the well connects, I mean if we are seeing a slowdown in drilling and completion could there be \u2013 could that number have come in lighter than you expected?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, slightly. But as Bob pointed out we have got a lot of catching up to do still. We are still working off of quite an inventory of getting caught up. So even if the drilling does slowdown we still \u2013 the well connects will still keep coming for quite some time.","Christine Cho","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ross Payne with Wells Fargo.","Ross Payne","How are you doing guys?","Alan Armstrong","Great, how are you?","Ross Payne","Good. I was wondering if you can give us a little more detail on the Geismar startup kind of getting pushed back into June, are there other issues outside of the heat exchangers that you talked about in Q4 and has anything really changed from Q4 to where we stand today in terms of trying to get it up fully to specs? Thanks.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Thank you and appreciate the question. It allows us to spend a little bit, because we really haven\u2019t hit that much today. And a couple of things I really want to point out there, one is that we did have the major equipment for the expansion up and running. And so and in fact as we sit here today we are utilizing many of the components of the expansion facility. So contrary to what probably you would be left to believe, it\u2019s not like we have just got the base plant sitting over here running and the expanded plant is sitting idle. We are utilizing in this period a lot of the big elements like the furnaces for instance on the expanded facility. And in fact we had the major equipment up and rolling when we had this transformer fail on us.","And so I think that\u2019s very good news because we been able to test all of the major components. And in fact we are using this time period to put load test on the expansion parts of the facility. But at the end of the day this EBR system is what is bottlenecking if you will the production on the plant, on the ethylene side of the plant. And until we get that transformer back in then we can\u2019t go on with the rest of the plant. So the good news is we are not sitting here wondering about the rest of the major equipment in the expanded plant. We have actually been able to utilize it and get it up and tested. And so really this is \u2013 I hate to \u2013 there is nothing simple in a big complex plant like this, but to try to put in simple terms, we have got the plant \u2013 the expanded plant has been up and tested. And it\u2019s a matter of getting this transformer repaired at the manufacturer\u2019s facility and getting it plugged back in. And we did run that compressor that this transformer drives and everything was fine with that compressor. And so it\u2019s just a matter of getting the transformer plugged back in.","Ross Payne","Okay. And in the last conference call you guys talk about the heat exchangers getting up to about 70%. Are you comfortable now that they can get all of the way up to 90% plus or are there other things that you need to do on that front? Thanks.","Alan Armstrong","Again we have kind of had the luxury, unfortunately we have had the luxury of time in getting some of those things that lined up. And we have gotten \u2013 we had some fouling and some residue oil coating on some of those highly efficient exchangers and we have gotten those cleaned up and they are performing very well now.","Ross Payne","Okay. Thanks guys.","Alan Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you and that will conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.","Alan Armstrong","Great. Well thank you all very much. Appreciate all the great questions. And we certainly are excited about bringing all of these projects and we really look forward to talking to you in more depth here on May 14. Thank you for joining us.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation."],"22913":["Williams Companies, Inc.

At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations, and please go ahead, sir.","John Porter","Thanks, Amy. Good morning, and thank you for your interest in The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin is with us as well.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.","And so with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan Armstrong","Great. Good morning, everyone. Thank you, John. I'm going to start a little bit with the macro conditions that continue to support our strategy so well. So if you think about our continued focus on natural gas demand and how that's driving our strategy and you look at actually what's occurring, we really saw it start to accelerate in '18 as we saw an 11% increase in overall natural gas demand. And as I'll remind you, that's on top of a big demand that we had in '17 as well and we also have another expected 5% increase by most of the forecasters now for North America, so demand growth on top of demand growth on top of demand growth.","But if I put that in perspective for you, it really is starting to -- what is happened is -- what we expected to happen, which is not just the U.S. but all of the world is really starting to try to take advantage of the U.S.'s ability to get gas out of the ground at such a low cost. So just to think about that 11% increase that we had this year, I think it's helpful to put that in perspective and something we can all relate to and that is that 11% increase was greater than all of the dry gas production from the Permian in 2018. So just here in one year, we've had an increase that's greater than all of the dry gas production coming out of the Permian today. So the demand growth is very important to our strategy and we continue to see that be very supportive.","So with this backdrop, I'm happy to report that our portfolio of indispensable natural gas infrastructure performed even better than expected this past year as we once again came in at the top of our guidance ranges for key financial metrics. In fact, we achieved an all-time record for adjusted EBITDA in 2018 even in the face of asset sales totaling more than $4.6 billion over the past 2.5 years. And these transactions continue to reduce our commodity exposure and continue to improve our leverage metric for WMB.","And all the while, we funded growth over the past two years without the need for equity issuance. So as you may recall, we started 2018 setting delivery records on Transco, which we've now, in 2019, equipped once again during the record cold snap that impacted our markets last week. And in 2018, Northwest Pipeline also hit an all-time record for annual throughput, eclipsing the prior record by 5%. So we are seeing the impact of all this increased demand showing up on our pipelines, obviously.","We had a timely and crisp execution on the critically important WPZ rollup transaction, reestablishing Williams as a simplified C-Corp with investment-grade credit. We continue to make great progress overcoming a highly challenging regulatory and permitting environment, placing critical new Transco projects and service like Garden State, Atlantic Sunrise, and just recently, the Gulf Connector. And we continue to make progress advancing the expensive next generation of Transco fully contracted projects like Southeastern Trail, Rivervale South to market, Leidy South, Northeast Supply Enhancement, Gateway and several other Transco projects that we've not gone public with yet.","Late in the year, we saw the beginnings of the accelerated Northeast G&P growth. We expect to continue for many years to come as the takeaway cloud finally has begun to lift from this basin. We expanded our ESG disclosures on our website, kicked off the project to further expand our ESG disclosures in '19 and further strengthen our exceptional Board of Directors with two new appointments. We continue to exercise capital discipline, passing up many opportunities but executing on others like our entry into the DJ Basin, which was funded through our exit from our legacy Four Corners position. And we are now set for continued value-creating portfolio optimization here as we begin 2019.","And once again, despite increasing commodity price volatility in the liquids markets, our low-cost natural gas business strategy has us positioned well for further predictable growth here in 2019. And importantly, today, we are reaffirming the 2019 guidance that we provided in May of last year. So with that quick look back at a very busy 2018, let's move to Slide 2 and take a closer look at our financial performance versus 2018 -- for '18 versus our guidance.","Here on Slide 2, you can see that we've shown how we finished the year relative to our 2018 guidance ranges. Although our GAAP net income was affected by a large impairment on our Barnett gathering system, you can see that adjusted net income exceeded the midpoint of guidance and our adjusted EPS, which was at the high end of guidance, showed strong growth in 2018 of 25% over the 2017 EPS.","Despite selling $1.3 billion in assets that was not accommodated for in our plan back when we made that guidance, our adjusted EBITDA DCF and dividend coverage ratio all reflected strong performance at the high end of our guidance range. You can see that our growth CapEx spending came in about $300 million under guidance and that was primarily driven by shifts of capital out of '18 and now into '19. So when we get to our '19 guidance, you'll see an uptick, which was just the timing of that $300 million moving from '18 to '19.","And finally, with respect to leverage, you can see a nice outperformance with year-end leverage at 4.8. So once again, as was the case in '17, our financial performance was quite good as compared to our guidance. It was another year where we delivered on expectations, including steady, predictable and growing cash flows while improving the balance sheet. On the next couple of slides, we'll quickly break down the major drivers of our financial performance for the fourth quarter and the full year, so let's move on to Slide 3.","First, looking at the fourth quarter GAAP numbers on the upper portion of the slide, we see that the year-over-year comparisons were affected by some large accounting entries, which have been adjusted out of our non-GAAP. Specifically, in 2017, we had some large positive accounting entries related to tax reform. And this year, we have a large revaluation on our Barnett gathering system, somewhat offset by gains on asset sales. Looking at adjusted EBITDA in the lower portion of the slide, we see that the nearly $1.2 billion of adjusted EBITDA was up a little more than 3% versus 2017, but up 9% if you normalize for revenue recognition changes and the sale of our Four Corners system.","Looking at the bridge then, once adjusted for the revenue recognition changes and the loss of Four Corners, which are shown in gray, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA increased almost $100 million, where strong increases in our Northeast and Atlantic-Gulf segments were somewhat offset by a lower quarter in the West. So it's really great to see the Northeast and Atlantic-Gulf adjusted EBITDA numbers growing by 28% and 22%, respectively. Atlantic Sunrise was the big driver, of course, for Atlantic-Gulf, and the Northeast saw about a 13% increase in volumes, led by increases in Northeast Pennsylvania area, but also we saw good growth in Southwestern Marcellus and the Utica area as well.","So as we look at the results for the West, you have to be mindful of the pretty dramatic effect that the sale of Four Corners had on our reported gathering volumes. So specifically, if you look at our analyst package, you'll see that the West gathering volumes are down about 22% sequentially from 3Q and that our full year 2018 volumes are down about 4% from '17. However, if you exclude the Four Corners volumes, then we are flat year-to-year and down only 3% versus the third quarter of '18. And of course, that was impacted, we did have some freeze offs in Wyoming here in the fourth quarter of '18.","Additionally, another big driver for the West in the fourth quarter of '18 related to about $25 million unfavorable swing in the EBITDA of our NGL marketing business, which was driven by the drop in the value of the inventory that we hold for [indiscernible] primarily out West. The value of this near comp and inventory changes every quarter as we mark this product to market prices from one quarter to another. ","So now let's turn to the full year 2018 results and go to Slide 4. Starting with our GAAP results in the upper portion of the slide, we see that the large accounting entries we discussed in the prior slide are also driving the year-over-year comparisons. So again, tax reform entries, gains on sales of assets and impairment entries make it a little tough to see the performance of the ongoing business. So let's look at the adjusted numbers where these items have been excluded.","First off, I just highlight again that the 25% growth in adjusted EPS, which grew to $0.79 from $0.63 in the prior year. Looking at the bridge on adjusted EBITDA, you see in gray the effects of lost EBITDA from the Geismar assets we sold in '17, the changes in revenue recognition accounting rules and the loss of EBITDA from the Four Corners assets we sold in 2018. So once again, adjusted for revenue recognition changes and the lost EBITDA from sold assets, you can see that our adjusted EBITDA increased a little more than $300 million, driven by strong increases in our Northeast and Atlantic Gulf segments. Growing volumes in the Northeast Pennsylvania and Southwest Marcellus and the Utica areas all drove the higher Northeast segment results. The Atlantic-Gulf segment growth was again driven by Atlantic Sunrise, but a number of other projects that came on for a partial year in '17 also drove higher results in '18.","So now let's move on to Slide 5 and quickly recap some of the more significant and recent business developments. This slide showcases our recent accomplishments, demonstrating strong project execution, continued permitting successes, operational excellence and strategic transactions at the corporate level. Our teams have done an outstanding job of bringing key expansion projects in the service, like Transco's Atlantic Sunrise and Gulf Connector projects. One other project that I'll highlight on the list is our Norphlet project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. It's great to see some major new deepwater volumes coming midyear as our Norphlet project serving Shell\u2019s Appomattox builds in the Eastern Gulf gets up and running. With the completion of these three projects, the majority of our project execution risk that is behind our growth drivers for '19 has been squared away. So on the permitting front, we have also seen great progress despite the difficult environment. Northeast Supply Enhancement received its FERC FEIS. This was a critical permitting step for a project that will support the conversion of heating oil to clean burning natural gas for New York City and Long Island areas.","Transco's Gateway expansion was another project that hit a key milestone, receiving FERC approval to expand existing pipeline to help New York and New Jersey meet growing natural gas demand needs in time for the 2021 winter. And most recently, our Southeastern Trail project cleared the environmental assessment hurdle at FERC. This is another example of Transco's tremendous advantage of having existing right of ways in all of the right places.","Operationally, our Northeast GMP segment increased gathering volumes by 13% from fourth quarter of '17 to fourth quarter of '18. And this was driven primarily by several gathering expansions of our Susquehanna system as well as incremental takeaway capacity for Northeast Pennsylvania. We will continue to see volume growth on our Northeast systems into 2019 and beyond. Our Transco expansion -- Transco delivered a record amount of natural gas, setting its peak day mark of 15.68 million dekatherms on January 21 of this year. Transco also set a new 3-day mark from January 30 to February 1. The recent frigid conditions across the country are an important reminder of the vital role transmission pipelines play in delivering natural gas to keep millions of Americans safe and secure. And I want to take a moment to recognize the great employees that are there working behind the scenes to make that happen. It's not a simple task and it takes a lot of dedication, and we certainly have that from our employees here at Williams.","And speaking of records, our Northwest Pipeline also hit an all-time annual record delivery of 820 trillion BTUs versus the previous annual record of 781 trillion BTUs. So a tremendous job our Northwest team as well as they overcome some major supply outages in Canada from third-party pipelines coming in and we're able to manage around that and keep the heat on for our residents in the Northwest area as well. Looking down the list, you'll see our Bluestem project, which we announced yesterday afternoon. Let's move to Slide 6 to take a closer look at the newly announced project Bluestem. We've got some good detail on this slide about this exciting new project, which will provide all new connectivity between vast Western NGL supplies and premium Gulf Coast markets. This strategic partnership provides great opportunity to really strengthen and expand our NGL transportation and fractionation business. We are pleased to partner with Targa on this NGL infrastructure solution that creates an integrated solution and a platform for growth for both parties.","Expanding on NGL pipeline business to interconnect with Targa's strategically positioned Grand Prix pipeline will provide Williams and our customers with access to Mont Belvieu, while opening up additional markets for Conway, attracting new volumes to both our Overland Pass Pipeline system and the Conway fractionation and storage assets and will provide Williams with 80,000 to 120,000 barrels a day of firm access to Mont Belvieu. Additionally, this delivers a long-term infrastructure solution for NGLs from our Opal, Echo Springs, Willow Creek and our new Rocky Mountain Midstream systems in the DJ Basin, while also creating a platform for growth, offering us the opportunity to gain incremental downstream revenues as we expand our GMP business. We're targeting an in-service date of the first quarter of 2021 for this project.","Additionally, I would point out that in connection with this project, Williams will also have an option to purchase initially a 20% equity interest in one of Targa's recently announced new fractionation train 7 or 8 in Mont Belvieu. Our goal is to be well aligned with Targa in maximizing the value of our collected assets in Conway and Mont Belvieu and the piping in between and to offer attractive service offerings to our processing customers in the West. We expect our investment in these NGL logistics projects to be $350 million to $400 million, with most of that spending will -- that will occur in 2020. And now let's move on to the next slide to review our 2019 financial guidance. As we previously discussed, we are reaffirming our 2019 financial guidance with the exception of growth capital expenditures. Of course, much has changed since we originally issued 2019 guidance last May. Specifically, we sold our large scale Four Corners system and entered into the DJ Basin where the system there that we now operate was still in the early stages of its continuing expansion and development. And we and our producing customers, of course, saw a 28% decrease in crude and NGL prices from August until year-end. Really, the key point here is that the stability and predictability of our natural gas infrastructure-focused strategy has allowed our 2019 guidance to hold in there very well even as we continue to optimize portfolio and have seen lower pricing environment for our producing customers.","As a result, our 2019 guidance for financial performance remains unchanged and much of the project execution risk for 2019 is already put crisply behind us. ASR, Gulf Connector and our Norphlet facilities, as I mentioned earlier, all now completed. So as I previously mentioned, we are revising growth capital expenditure guidance from $2.6 billion to a range of $2.7 billion to $2.9 billion, and that's really just the timing shift of some of the amounts we didn't spend in '18 that got shifted into '19. The last thing I will say about 2019 is that we remain very focused on improving our credit metrics. To that end, we will continue to exercise capital discipline and to pursue portfolio optimization transactions much like you saw in '18. And of course, our strong cash flows and continued string of asset sales has allowed us to fund the equity side of our growth capital needs.","So with that update, let's move on to the last slide, Slide 8, and wrap up, and then we'll take your questions. On this last slide, we again just laid out a few of the highlights from 2018, which was a very important year for Williams. It was a year where we beat guidance, returned to a simplified C-Corp investment-grade infrastructure company, completed the largest project ever on Transco, progressed on deleveraging the company and made continued progress in optimizing our portfolio. Also in this last slide, we've summarized some of the things on our mind here for 2019. We look forward to another year of strong natural gas demand growth. We also look forward to showing our business can deliver cash flow stability and predictability during times when the crude markets are volatile and saggy. We continue to be pleased with the opportunities we are closing on in the DJ Basin, thanks to the great work of our Rocky Mountain Midstream team that has done a great job of establishing themselves in the areas well with our customers up there.","As an example, we just executed a new gas gathering and processing agreement for an additional 5,200 acre dedication that is fully permitted in the DJ. To support this development, we'll be expanding our gathering and collection services in the basin as we expect to open up additional near- and long-term opportunities for our midstream services in the DJ. And we will have two new processing trains starting up this year as well, one of which is entering the commissioning stage and the other at [indiscernible] where construction activity is progressing according to plan. We look forward to another year of advancing the important Transco projects that you are aware of and to introducing you to new opportunities for the nation's largest and fastest-growing natural gas pipeline, and we look forward to another year of strong Northeast GMP volume growth.","And last but not least, we will continue to delever. We will do this through solid execution of our business plan, which allows us to reinvest excess cash flows into new growth opportunities, but we will also continue to vigorously pursue portfolio optimization activities in support of this effort to delever. And finally, I also want to let you know that we've taken a look at the timing of our annual Analyst Day, and we'll be making a shift from the May time frame to something later in the year. This major -- the major driver of this move is to really make sure that our Analyst Day follows up our annual forward board session, which is in August. So we think that's a nice move to governance and simplifying our internal process to be able to roll right from our annual board strategy session into guidance.","So with that, let's go ahead and turn it over for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from Shneur Gershuni of UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","Just wanted to start off on the new project that you announced last night. On a go-forward basis, do you expect to aggregate more barrels? And could you see a need for a greater than 20% stake in a frac? And also with -- any sense on what the stack rate would be to get the Y-Grade all the way to Mont Belvieu?","Alan Armstrong","I would say, first of all, on the volume growth, yes, we did build in the flexibility in our relationship with Targa to be able to expand our volumes as we need to, both on transport capacity as well as on the investment in the fractionator. So -- and I would say that we definitely are seeing a lot of opportunity to continue to pick up new barrels out of both the DJ and the Rockies. And so we're pretty excited about that. And obviously, we like the fact that Conway becomes an important center now as we open that up to new markets, so we're pretty excited about that alternative. ","And then on the -- I would just say on the rate, we're not going to disclose that. But I would say it's very competitive and we're very excited about it, about the way that rate is structured. And again, I think Targa saw this as a long-term strategic relationship with us, and likewise. And so we see this as a great opportunity to maximize the combination of our assets at Conway and Bellevue.","Shneur Gershuni","That makes sense. And given your new partnership with Targa, do you see an opportunity to expand the relationship with respect to gas takeaway out of the Permian, given that both companies have been exploring different gas takeaway solution?","Chad Zamarin","Yes, this is Chad Zamarin. I would just say that we continue to -- I think if you look at our recent announcement with the Brazos Midstream system in the Permian, we continue to focus on the Permian. And I would just say, we're going to continue to be disciplined and there have been two projects that have been announced coming out of the Permian to move gas to the Gulf Coast, but we continue to look at options. The Brazos system provides us much like the move that we made into the DJ and the ability to move downstream from that position. The Brazos system provides us with an opportunity to continue to develop projects that we moved to the Gulf Coast. And I would say that we are likely, if we do move forward with the project of that sort, to partner with others in order to make it a most efficient project. So we continue to work in that manner.","Shneur Gershuni","Great. And one final question. When I think about your CapEx guidance for 2019, I know it technically goes up from the prior guidance. But when I think about it on an apples-to-apples basis, you have some rollover from 2018 into 2019. And you've just announced new project, so it would kind of seem like, on an apples-to-apples basis, your CapEx is actually declining versus prior expectations. Can you give us a little bit of color around that? Is it cost related? Is it due to some of the asset sales? Just trying to understand these subtle changes.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I would just say, first of all, most importantly, the Bluestem -- most of that capital for Bluestem will be spent in 2020. So that's primarily why you're not seeing less driver in that. So it's not -- frankly, it's not all that complicated because it really is just quite a bit of pushing. There's a lot of -- in a budget of that size, obviously, there's a lot of things moving around from time to time. But they tend to find themselves towards the mean, and that's precisely the way this came out this year as well.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. We will take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho","Just wanted to make sure I understand this agreement with Targa. Are the economics here really going to be driven by the volume growth out of the Rocky Mountain Midstream JV? And also, any color around when you expect to achieve that EBITDA multiple of 6x and what sort of volume we should assume is underpinning those economics?","Micheal Dunn","It's Micheal. Just -- to start on the first part of that, we see a lot of growth not only from the Rocky Mountain Midstream, but we've got barrels on our Rockies plants that are already out there that will be moving on the Bluestem pipeline eventually. As you know, we've got the partnership on the OPPL system. And we'll continue to move with Rockies barrels down the OPPL system to Conway and then further south on Bluestem. And with our 2021 in-service date on Bluestem coinciding with Targa\u2019s build to the north with us, we would expect a lot of those barrels to move south and ultimately, get to a 6x multiple on that. And really, a lot of that is driven by timing of the barrels coming out of Rocky Mountain Midstream frankly, but we do see some pretty significant growth in the Rocky Mountain Midstream assets, especially with the agreement that we just executed, and so we would anticipate approaching that 6x multiple pretty quickly.","Christine Cho","And just to clarify, the volumes coming out of like your existing plants, are those priced off -- those are priced off Conway, right? And so to the extent that you can bring them down to Bellevue, that's going to be margin that you keep for yourself. Is that how I should think about it?","Alan Armstrong","There's a variety -- for our own equity barrels today, we have the option of either Conway or Bellevue at a differential in price. So today, we do have that option for those barrels up to an amount that we can move under the existing exchange agreement. So I would just say that we do have Bellevue access for those barrels today to the degree it's available. But for the Rocky Mountain Midstream barrels, that's a different story in terms of being able to include those because we're limited on capacity on Overland Pass right now. So as Overland Pass opens up, that allows us to make a very nice margin by making these investments on the downstream.","Christine Cho","Got it. Okay. And then just switching over to the Northeast, the gathering volumes have been great, but the processing volumes have been flattish for the last year. What do you think we need to see to have these volumes increase?","Micheal Dunn","Well, Christine, I would say we do expect those volumes to increase. We have line of sight to what the producers are doing. There's a lot of drilling activity behind our processing plants that will be coming online this year. It's a little bit delayed for more than where you had thought it would have been last year. That's really coinciding very nicely with the completion of growth TXP-2. And so we have very good confidence that our current capacity will be filled probably in the second quarter, and that's about the time that TXP-2 and Oak Grove comes online. So we anticipate certainly [filling] [ph] TXP-1 this year and TXP-2 will start processing gas shortly after that.","Alan Armstrong","Christine, I would just add to that question, and it's a good observation on your part. I would just add, we've got several significant upstream projects, like [Checkmark] [ph] pipeline and some other projects that are -- that we have to get completed before we can bring those new processing of those volumes in for processing. So there's quite a bit of infrastructure having to happen upstream to be able to get some of the new drilled volumes from Southwestern and other customers into the front of Oak Grove and we're nearing completion on a lot of that work.","Micheal Dunn","And Christine, I probably should add to that, we have been in volume commitments whenever we agree to go deploy capital there at those processing facilities. We have MBC to back that up. And so that's why it gives us a lot of confidence that those volumes are going to show.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan.","Jeremy Tonet","Maybe just kind of speaking up on that last point there. There's been kind of concern with regards to producer activity in the Northeast and some producers kind of taking in that growth rate, focusing more on free cash flow. I was wondering if you guys could address how you see that impacting your footprint because it seems like some of the guys behind your systems might be taking a bit of a different task than others there. If you can extend on that, what gives you guys the confidence in the Northeast growth as you expected?","Alan Armstrong","Sure. I'll just take that at a high level and then and Micheal can fill in with some details if required. First of all, I think not all producers out there are created equal, and certainly not all acreage is created equal. And so for instance, if you look at Cabot, which is one of the primary drivers of our growth, they continue to show a very strong growth profile because they've got markets established upwards towards 4 Bcf a day of markets that they've established. And so they've done a great job of getting the markets out in front of them, and we're working furiously to keep our gathering system expanded to keep up with them. So that's very obvious to us where that growth is coming from in that area. As well as Bradford County area continues to grow very rapidly for us as well. And so as Micheal pointed out earlier, we have a lot of transparency into that growth in that area. And then as you move into the South, I would just say that while there has been some folks pulling back a little bit on volume growth, as Micheal mentioned, those MBCs that people have made to us, they're going to work hard obviously to build those up. They are being very successful with the production behind there. ","And I would just tell you the 15% CAGR that we put out there earlier, we had quite a bit of room, if you will, between what producers were forecasting at that point versus that 15%. And so we're still very -- feel very confident in that 15% CAGR that we put out earlier based on the detailed work that we do with producers. I would say, as I've mentioned earlier, probably the one more positive things about that growth that's occurred is the Encino acquisition from Chesapeake on that Utica acreage, which was a very large piece of volume and acreage behind us that was declining previously. And now with their activities, we're actually starting to see that growth. So that's a really big positive for us in terms of offsetting some of the declines that exist there, yes.","Jeremy Tonet","That's very helpful. Just wanted to turn to Atlantic-Gulf here real quick. And you had quite a nice quarter there. I was wondering this kind of -- something that's a run rate level for you guys? Or is there still more kind of Sunrise is not fully baked in for the quarter and you're continuing to see growth there? How should we think about that segment?","Micheal Dunn","This is Micheal again. I would say the majority of the quarter, we saw the Atlantic Sunrise revenues in there came online October 6 is when we started charging full rate for Atlantic Sunrise. But recall, earlier in 2018, we were also charging for some interim capacity that we were able to achieve there. We were able to bring the full volume on October 6. So basically, you would see the fourth quarter having the majority of the revenue in there for Atlantic Sunrise. And if you recall, it's a revenue payment -- sorry, a capacity payment. On a revenue throughput, although very strong throughout the fourth quarter, doesn't drive a lot of the revenue differences there because of the capacity reservation charges that Transco enjoys.","Operator","And from RBC Capital Markets, we'll hear from TJ Schultz.","Torrey Schultz","Just one thing on the last point on the Chesapeake, Utica acreage now with Encino. Can you find any better rated change you're expecting from an asset those in decline. Now it sounds like more activity. Just any notable color from early days of Encino in place.","Alan Armstrong","Well, they're still on their process deciding how aggressively they want to go after it, but I think it's a -- the big shift, of course, is a -- the available capital that Encino has through the Canadian pension fund. And so they are anxious to put that capital to work and driving returns on that. So it takes a while to get ramp back up from the declines that had been occurring in the area, but we're working with them to make sure that we keep the infrastructure out in front of them right now. So I think it's a question of how many rigs that they're going to run in the area right now. I think they're planning -- they've got two and planning on maybe going to three at this point. And so that will -- that's what will drive that. And of course, they're very efficient. They've got a lot of team that was already existing there, very efficient operators. And with three rigs, they'll be growing pretty rapidly in that area.","Torrey Schultz","Okay. Great. Just one more, on Gulf East, if you could just clarify a little on Appomattox. It sounds like coming on a little sooner than expected. If you can just remind me the status of the Northwest Pipeline auction to you. And just, in general, what you're expecting from the ramp in that area this year?","Alan Armstrong","Sure. TJ, yes, we have completed all of our work and the pipeline auction and it gets triggered just ahead of production coming online. So we're in those discussions and that's all pretty -- I would say that's very clean and very baked, and there's not a whole lot to happen there other than us making decision to exercise that. So really, it's just a matter of Shell doing their work on Appomattox and being ready to flow. And so that's what will drive the timing on that is their work on the Appomattox platform and getting that ready to flow. And they've done a great job, really great execution on Shell team on being so far ahead of schedule as what they had planned originally. And our team did a nice job as well having our side of the infrastructure done. So we're excited about it, a lot of volumes just from the fuels proper, but a lot of new work going on by both Shell and other producers in the area and acreage around that, that would be nice [indiscernible] to the Northwest to our infrastructure out there. So I think that's going to wind up being even bigger than we had originally planned in terms of the number of fields and new development that's going on out there. Both -- again, both by Shell and Chevron's activity in the area as well.","Operator","Our next question is from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America.","Dennis Coleman","If I can just go back to the Bluestem project to start. I wonder if you might talk a little bit, how did you first scope the project in terms of deciding where the connect would come and who would build the what with Targa?","Alan Armstrong","Well, we did say that Targa had -- and this is why it turned out to be such an attractive project for both parties, was because they were building up to that Kingfisher area anyway to capture other volumes in the Midcontinent area there. So this was a low-cost expansion for them to be able to pick our volumes up as well for them. So the transaction and the rates that we enjoy, we're benefiting from that. And so it was just a matter of us placing the capital to build down from Conway down to where they were already going to be picking up other barrels in that area.","Dennis Coleman","Okay. And so are there -- there's contracts on these systems already? Is that -- there's a contract structure in place, there's shippers, or is it Williams that's the shipper?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. On our system, it would be own -- of course, remember, you have Overland Pass that we own 50% with One Oak upstream of this. That comes into the Conway area and then we would own that system 100%. We would be the -- in terms of shipping on that, we would have an exchange agreement, purchase agreement with Targa for some of those barrels and we will have relationships with upstream producers. Plants that's in the Rocky Mountain area will have relationships where we will be buying their barrels at a fixed margin in that area. So we'll have a combination of both our own equity barrels, which are very substantial today as well as barrels that we've been continuing to pick up in the DJ Basin and some of the surrounding area there.","Dennis Coleman","Okay, got it. And then just there's a word in the press release that I want to just try and understand. You said there's an initial 20% option on one the fracs. I guess, that implies that there will be additional options or potentially, is that -- am I hearing that right?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Great question. As I mentioned earlier, we structured the transaction so that we can expand both our equity investment and the frac, but that would come with additional volume commitment on our part as well, and so that's kind of how it's structured, so -- but we built in flexibility, knowing how robust we're kind of forecasting the growth in the Rocky Mountain midstream area to be, we want to be prepared to be able to handle those incremental barrels. And so while today, we don't want to make that kind of commitment without seeing the barrels actually show up, we did want to make sure that we had the capacity to allow for that growth coming from that area.","Dennis Coleman","Okay, great. And then I guess, maybe just one on the leverage. It seems that, that further reduction is primarily a function of asset sales. So I wonder if you might talk about what kind of -- any assets that you're particularly looking at. Is there a program going on now or is that going to be more opportunistic?","Alan Armstrong","No, I would say we're constantly looking at optimizing our portfolio and. Where we are working really hard, I can tell you the entire team, with the board's support, is working hard to reduce our leverage. And so we continue to work various transactions and asset sales that would help complement that. So to answer your question, we are actively pursuing those type of transactions.","John Chandler","But I would -- this is John Chandler. I do want to say, even without that, though, again, remember, we're generating around $1.2 billion of excess cash even with attractive dividend growth, and we can use that cash even on new investment dollars. So we actually are deleveraging even with investments in new projects because we're funding so much of it with cash. So again, after sales will enhance and speed up the deleveraging, but we're deleveraging even without asset sales.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Mike Lapides of Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides","Two questions unrelated to each other. One, is there an update on the siting and permitting process for the Northeast Supply Enhancement that you can provide? Just in general, it seems like federal processes are kind of running as expected but just curious given a lot of the challenges others and you all have paid in terms of building pipelines into New York and dealing with kind of state level intervenors or stakeholders.","Micheal Dunn","Michael, this Micheal. I will give you an update on that. This is a great project for us to be able to facilitate the reduction of emissions in New York City as well as improve the cost profile of people's energy use there. We just recently received our final environmental impact statement from the FERC and we would expect within 90 days, further regulations and their practice to provide a FERC certificate, assuming the FERC commissioners approve that within 90 days. So you would expect to see that hopefully within the 90 days and then we're in the process on the state side of getting the 401 certifications from New Jersey and New York. Both of those state agencies had scheduled public hearings for the 401 certifications with just recently, the state of New York giving the notice of complete application on our 401 certification. And so we'll go through those processes with the state of New York as well. And once those 401 certificates are issued by each one of the states, then that allows the core of engineers to issue let's call the 404 permit, and FERC that into consideration in order to give us a notice to proceed with construction. So we've got all that to occur within the next several months.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Much appreciated. And also, totally different topic. Any update you can provide on the Transco rate case, just in terms of whether settlement talks are underway and whether there's a potential for settlement or whether you think goes the full litigated route?","Micheal Dunn","I can give you an update on that as well. So we would expect to see the -- what's called the top sheets from FERC in mid-March, and that's really their staff's reaction to our filing. And they would provide the sideboards, if you will, so what we could then go to settlement negotiations with for staff and our customers on. And so the first or the start, I should say, the next settlement conference is scheduled for the end of March. And so at that point in time, we'll have a pretty good idea of how likely it is that a settlement can occur. And obviously, that's the path we would prefer to go down. I think that's the best for our customers and ourselves to be able to agree upon that and not litigate the case. And that's what the expectation is right now, for us to achieve an outcome in settlement that's satisfactory to both Williams and our customers.","Operator","With Tuohy Brothers, we'll hear from Craig Shere.","Craig Shere","A couple detail items and then a bigger picture question. Maybe my math is off but it looked like there was an unusually high tax rate reflected in adjusted income. If that's correct, what was driving that?","John Chandler","It's really a couple of things. This is John Chandler. There's a couple of things that drive that. Number one, in the fourth quarter is when we usually do our tax provision re-estimation for the year, so I'd encourage you to look at the entire year at the tax rate instead of just the quarters since we do have some noise around that. I'd also say we had several obviously large unusual items in the fourth quarter, including the impairment and other things, that when we do estimations of taxes and the impact of taxes on those unusual items, we use a 25% rate, which is actually higher than our average blended rate for the quarter. So that results in some skewed tight calculations because we're using a different rate for our adjustment items, our normalization items. We use our standard annual rate of 25% than what it actually blended to. It's probably confusing but I'd just ask you to reach out to our IR team. I think they can walk you through that. But so it's really those two things, the significant usual items and the tax position adjustments that are done in the fourth quarter.","Craig Shere","Looks like the EBITDA was in line but the adjusted EPS is a little off and that explains a lot. Alan, in your prepared remarks, you talked about several other Transco projects not going public with you yet. Can you give us a picture of the range of opportunities in terms of size? And maybe any updates on the Transco project one that was heavily foreshadowed on the 3Q call?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, sure. First of all, on project 1, remember we had two there, we had project 2, which was Leidy South, which is moving ahead very nicely and fully contracted. Project 1, we continue to work with the counterparty, a primary counterparty on that. And I would just to continue to be very interested in the project and highly supportive of the project but have some of their own internal issues to get through to be able to transact with us. And -- but we remain very confident in the fundamentals on the drivers behind that project. I would also say though, we have several other new projects that are well on their way to development. A lot of strong interest that would continue to alleviate capacity constraint out of the Northeast PA area. And so we're pretty excited about that and that also helps expand in some of the markets that are continuing to need expansion. And despite what you might hear, those markets are growing pretty nicely in terms of their demand for natural gas there in Zone 6. And so we've got several projects that are pointing at that and again, the interest in those projects is very strong, I think.","Craig Shere","So it sounds like there's incremental pipeline development that can further add to the Northeast GMP opportunities.","Alan Armstrong","Absolutely, yes. And I'm not going to call it project 3 because we're growing weary of that. But it is a nice project flowing right behind the other two.","Craig Shere","Okay. And here is a little bit of my bigger picture question. I understand the Barnett is not a 2019 headwind, but I want to get some sense of the longer-term gives and takes at GMP. If we look out to 2021, as you targeted a 15% CAGR on Northeast GMP volume growth off 2018, depending on assumed margin growth for them, is it reasonable to assume that Northeast GMP EBITDA can rise $600 million to $900 million plus off '18 levels? And then would Barnett maybe be a headwind of as much as $150 million?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. We're not going to provide guidance individually on Barnett. But I would say this, Craig, the lowering or the impairment we took on Barnett is -- I don't want to drag everybody through all the accounting details, but we were -- that asset was held according to the undiscounted cash flows on the assets when the -- and obviously, that was dependent on gas prices in the area, both -- by the way, that contract is set up as well as drilling expectations from Total, our primary customer in that area. When the Permian price for -- so every year, we test an asset like that for its cash flows, looking forward against the held value. And this year, when we had to take into account the very large basis differential in the Permian and how that would affect both the rate that we received as well as the actions of what we've estimated would be the actions of the producing customer, that brought us down below that estimate. And therefore, that triggered us to have to remarket the fair value. In other words, what we think we could sell the asset for in the market. And that was very different than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows, which -- what was related with Mark earlier. So it was a -- said another way, it was a relatively small movement in expected cash flows from the asset but it put us down below that fair value and that triggered a different way of value in the asset, and that's why we got such a large impairment. So you shouldn't read into that, that the business is collapsing there but it moved enough on the far out values, it moved enough that we had to reposition the way we value it. So nothing's really changed all that much there other than, again, the Permian gas supply hits -- if the Permian pipelines all got filled adequately and we see the Permian gas prices come back up, then that avenue would change for that area. But for the meantime, we have to take the facts as they are and look at the forward curve for the basis differential out there.","John Chandler","And I'd just add to that. If you go to the third quarter of 2017, we impaired our Midcontinent asset that was the same scenario that was set up. There wasn't a material change in the actual EBITDA generation from any kind of assets, but the gross cash flow dropped in the -- to make us take it from historically high carrying value down to its fair value. So, same is happening with the Barnett. We don't see any meaningful change in the EBITDA streams but it was just enough to trip that write-down from carrying value to fair value.","Craig Shere","No major change even looking out say, to 2021?","Alan Armstrong","No. Not really. Just the impact of gas prices long term for the asset just brought it down just enough. So we do not see a major shift in the cash flows from that business. We have had pretty modest growth expectations in the past for that, but this effectively just stripped that out, and the growth expectations completely stripped out of there in terms of drilling activity. And so that's what -- but we have had very modest expectations.","Craig Shere","And finally, the bookend that I put out there depending on margin per M of Northeast GMP gaining say, $600 million to $900 million plus in EBITDA over 2018 through 2021. Is that a decent bookend?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I would just say we are very much on our way towards that $0.50 to $0.55 EBITDA per Mcf range that we've talked about earlier. And so with the volume growth and with that kind of margin improvement, the answer is yes. But I'm not crystal clear on the timing that you're laying out, just to be very, very thought through that versus that amount. But in terms of what we laid out here at Analyst Day, we're feeling very good right now about both the volume growth and the margin growth that we're experiencing.","Operator","From Wells Fargo, we'll hear from Sharon Lui.","Sharon Lui","If you look at, I guess, the annualized Q4 numbers for your adjusted EBITDA from equity investments, it sounds like you kind of suggest a much higher run rate versus your 2019 guidance of $825 million. And I guess if you assume contributions from Jackalope as well as Rocky Mountain continue to ramp, maybe help us try to reconcile to your 2019 outlook based on what you guys reported in Q4.","Alan Armstrong","John?","John Chandler","Off hand, I don't know if I have the details in front of me to be able to answer that, so I might have you call Dr. John Porter on that question.","Sharon Lui","Okay, sure. And I guess, just a housekeeping question on the impairment charge. So there's no impact on cash flows, only on DD&A expense. Is that correct going forward?","John Chandler","If there is an impact on cash flow, that's very minimal on Barnett. So yes, it's just that it's an uplift or it's an improvement or reduction of DD&A, that's correct.","Sharon Lui","Okay. And then the amount that Williams actually recognized in terms of the amortization of deferred revenues, is that still about $100 million going forward?","John Chandler","Yes, that sounds right. Yes.","Operator","Next up is Jean Salisbury with Bernstein.","Jean Salisbury","Just a couple of quick ones for me. So it seems like Mountain Valley and the Atlantic Coast project has hit some difficulties. And as you articled that one of these projects is ultimately canceled, could Transco address that demand with new laterals? Like, could that be a source of new projects?","Alan Armstrong","We are very well positioned on the market end for those projects. In other words, being able to help usually existing right away, but not solely. So said another way, some of that market expansion will be required, but I would certainly say that we have a lot to offer in that regard in terms of the use of our existing right aways and systems to be able to help supply that growth. So yes, we have a lot to offer there to the degree that, that occurs. But I would also say that particularly as it relates to Mountain Valley, that there's so much continued growth in demand on our system that those supplies coming in, we're going to be -- we'll have synergies with Mountain Valley whether it gets filled as planned or not, we would have quite a bit of synergies there with that system. So I would say there's little different because they serve two very different needs, but clearly we have the ability to help out both projects.","Jean Salisbury","That makes sense. And then just a quick clarification. That Bluestem EBITDA is all incremental from the EBITDA that you'd expected on the initial Discovery deal. I assumed, so I just want to make sure.","Alan Armstrong","Yes, I think that's probably a good way to look at it. We did anticipate some NGL uplift in the Rocky Mountain midstream acquisition model. So we knew that we would be able to acquire some of those barrels ultimately, and so that's factored into that.","Jean Salisbury","Okay. So maybe a little bit of double dipping but a lot of it's incremental?","Alan Armstrong","Yes.","John Chandler","I would say this though. When you collective put in the investment on Bluestem with the investment in the Rocky Mountain midstream assets, we still accomplished 6x multiple even on even a combined investment when hopefully that system is fully up and operational.","Operator","Next up is Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering Holt & Co.","Colton Bean","So Alan, you mentioned that continued focus on portfolio management, so just wanted to touch on that. With the vertical integration here of the Rocky Mountain processing fleet with some further downstream opportunities, does that change the way you assess those assets and kind of how they fit in the broader asset footprint?","Alan Armstrong","No. I would say that the -- we will always look to vertical integration as one of the facets to consider when we think about whether an asset is strategic or not. Because obviously, the aggregation of barrels, for instance, gives us value opportunities, investment opportunities just like Bluestem. So we definitely think about, when we think about what assets we would want to hold and that we add value as an organization, as a corporation, what we add value to, that vertical integration is obviously a key part of that. So that is a facet that would be dependent on and certainly to the degree that we've got combined downstream investments. It makes those assets more valuable to us as a company often than to somebody else. And so I think that's the best way to think about that.","Colton Bean","Got it. That's helpful. And then just to touch brief on the West. So you mentioned gathering volumes net of the Four Corners adjustment there, down around 3% Q-on-Q. Just interested in what you're seeing on the Haynesville system and maybe a longer-term outlook there as well.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. As we said in '17, we had a really big growth rate on Haynesville in '17, and we forecasted that we didn't expect that to occur again in '18 because that -- there was so much new plus production and the decline rates on that new plus production is pretty high. So and we -- at the first of the year, we actually saw some growth but towards the end of the year, we did see some decline on the Haynesville system, so -- and most of that from Chesapeake production. The good news is on the Haynesville system is our team has been doing a really nice job of capturing new acreage out there from third parties other than Chesapeake. So we're encouraged for the way that looks, not on the base dedicated acreage out there, not really a change on that, but in bringing -- we've been winning some new business out there. So that will help to maintain the volumes in the Haynesville.","Colton Bean","Great. And just on those incremental agreements. At a high level, could you comment on whether those are weighted towards public or private producers?","Alan Armstrong","Mostly private.","Operator","From Jefferies, we'll hear from Chris Sighinolfi.","Christopher Sighinolfi","I'm not sure if this one's for you, Micheal or Chad, but I do want to circle back on the NGL project just one more time, more from a philosophical perspective, I guess, regarding the Conway market. You guys had made clear, the advantage of gaining better access or greater access to Bellevue through Targa's system, both the pipe and the frac. And it's clearly an advantage moving barrels on your own system versus a third-party system. So I guess, two follow up questions with regard to that set up. First, your views on the Conway purity product market outlook over time and your regional frac volumes there, given these announcements seem all Y-grade in nature. And then two, do you have Y-grade contracts now on third-party assets south from Conway that you can transition to Bluestem Grand Prix over time? And if so, what sort of schedule should we anticipate there?","Alan Armstrong","A lot of questions, I'll take a stab at a few. Let's see. First of all, on the Conway market, yes, and I think it's important to know that if we flatten out the spread between Conway and Bellevue, we're a winner in that. So you should think about that being somewhat of a natural hedge for our business because we already own those assets. And so to the degree that Conway product -- spec product prices go up in the purity markets, then that makes Conway and the services that we offer there that much more attractive, so that's a way that we think about that, obviously. And in terms of whether that's spec product or Y-grade, that's just a matter of how much incremental fractionation capacity there is on both ends of the pipe, basically in terms of being able to make those markets. Let's see. And yes, we do have contracts with third parties on Y-grade that have fixed margin built into them.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Okay. And is that something we can expect in a reasonable timeframe, maybe the next 2 to 5 years, to be up that could transition to this new collection of Williams-Targa assets? Or is it a long...","Alan Armstrong","Yes, absolutely. No, those are -- I would say, when we start up in 2021, I think we'll be well positioned there to be able to start taking advantage of that immediately.","Christopher Sighinolfi","Okay, great. I guess switching gears and just a quick follow-up for me on one of Jean Ann's earlier questions. You had noted that when you entered the DJ JV with KKR, that you pertaining some options to acquire from KKR additional interest. And so I'm wondering, Micheal, you had said that you contemplated other NGL solutions as part of that investment. I'm wondering now that they're getting more formalized with this agreement with Targa, if it shapes your view on whether or not or how swiftly you'll exercise options with them.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I would just say first of all, we've got 7 years, I think, total on that option, so a long time to the decide what that is. And I'll just remind you, the investment that we have with KKR is solely the GMP assets. And so, there's not an investment in the downstream value chain on that outside of that JV, it's just in the GMP assets that are proper. So it doesn't really affect so much that option value, if you will, because it's really just going to be the cash flows from that GMP business that will drive the option value there. But it does -- I would say, the relationship there with KKR is very solid, well aligned. And the fact that we have that option does keep us very focused on driving the value in the JV as well. So it's actually a pretty nice feature in terms of keeping us aligned there.","Micheal Dunn","And us being able to provide these NGL solutions downstream creates value for the partnership there with KKR because we can go to the producers and provide a value chain there that we can give them fixed pricing.","John Chandler","And Alan did mention earlier that what we've been successful is some new connections there at pretty attractive returns. You remember, our option with KKR is at a fixed return, so to the extent we can add new gathering business at higher returns, it just becomes that much more valuable, of course, in the future to exercise that option.","Christopher Sighinolfi","And so I guess, final point on that then, John. Assuming your -- the guided leverage number you gave for '19, is it safe to assume that, that does not include any option exercise on that asset?","John Chandler","That's does not. That's the beauty of this agreement. We have quite a period of time to execute that, so we've got plenty of time to continue to bring our leverage down and find that opportunity sometime in the future to execute that option.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. And I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan Armstrong","Okay, great. Well, thanks everybody for joining us. Really excited about the platform for growth that we've got set here for '19. Teams continue to work very well together to take advantage of all these opportunities. And I would say our execution just continues to get better and better and really proud the way the teams are operating. And we like the macro conditions that are set up ahead of us, as well. So feeling very good about both 2018 and the platform for growth that we've got set up for '19 and beyond. So thank you again for joining us.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Thank you for joining us here for our Q4 and full year 2014 earnings call today. To begin with, I'd like to welcome a couple of new members of our leadership team and they are joining us today as John just mentioned by phone. First is Bob Purgason, who became Senior Vice President of our Access operating area in January, and just to remind you, Bob has been COO at Access since 2010 and before that he was here at Williams for about 19 years until 2006. So, the organization here at Williams is very excited to have Bob back and really looking forward to a lot of the leadership he is brining.","Additionally, Walter Bennett is here with us, and Walter previously led the Western operations for Access, and in January he began leading Williams' Western operations post Allison Bridges' retirement. And of course that includes our Northwest pipeline area and all of our big gathering and processing out in the Rockies as well as we've added to that now the Niobrara area in Wyoming that ACMP had this built, and our team, the Williams team had collaborated to help bring that business up as well. So, we're really excited to have Walter's very strong operating background and strong technical expertise brought to our team out there in the west.","Additionally, I would just tell you, there are a lot of great leaders that have come in from ACMP, and they really are contributing a lot to our organization and help us lead through this tremendous growth period that we've got going on here at Williams. So, really nice to see the teams come in together so nicely and so quickly.","Moving on here to slide 2, and you'll see a lot of the major topics listed here on this slide that will hit on this short presentation, but this is the place I'd like to spend a little more time discussing the drivers of our new guidance and really the significant derisking that has occurred as we have dramatically lowered our planned commodity margins. We've lowered our fee-based volume assumptions, and we've got more conservative on our Geismar ramp-up schedule.","So, here first on the commodity price deck, our new price deck is centered on a $55 WTI and $3 Henry Hub gas price, and we've tried to be conservative with the price decks that are largely below the forward curves for products like propane and natural gasoline, where we're along the commodity and below the forward curve where we are short like our natural gas and ethane.","We believe this is certainly one of the most conservative decks being used amongst our peers in the industry, and overall this resulted in a 44% reduction in our planned commodity margins and commodity positions at WPZ, and this now represent only about -- this commodity price only about 12% of our gross margin is now exposed directly to the commodities.","On the gathering volume side, we've assumed reduced activity on the assets with unprotected volume exposure. So, in those areas, we're directly exposed to volumes and in many case we're ahead of what the producers have publicly communicated to investors. In other words, we're trying to get ahead of the lowering of rig counts and making sure that we've got a good handle on what we expect, and in many cases where that hasn\u2019t been publicly tried to get ahead of that with our own estimations.","And fortunately though, I would tell you these impacts are only limited to a handful of our assets, and in the context of the new larger enterprise, the impacts we think are certainly manageable. So for example, our Northeast volumes are currently tracking ahead of our revised plan for 2015.","On the Geismar ramp schedule, we have incorporated a much lower utilization of the facility over the first three months of the year, and this is going to allow for safe controlled ramp-up to full production. We\u2019ve spent a considerable amount of time doing it safely and ensuring a very high quality asset, and we certainly don't want to try to make any shortcuts here at the last minute on that. So, very proud of the team there continuing to be very focused on safe and making sure when we do get up to full capacity that we've got a safe and durable asset there.","A couple of offsets to the impacts of these more conservative assumptions do exist in our plan. First of all, the early in service for Transco projects on the mainline portion of the Leidy Southeast expansion and the Virginia Southside expansion, and I'll hit on more of this in just a little bit, so I won't spend any time there. And then finally, on the next, on the cost cuts, we do have some offset to some of the negative variances as we\u2019ve stepped up our focus on really rightsizing our cost structure to match the reduced levels of activities in few of the regions.","And so, while we've not specifically called out that number, I would emphasize that this can and will be a moving target depending on the ultimate levels of activity, and the production around our assets. But we certainly see an opportunity to offset some slower growth, and take advantage of the lower energy prices and materials in our own business because we certainly are exposed to energy and materials in our own business and a lot of those prices have come down.","So in general, we're taking advantage of this low commodity market to position ourselves for a very strong consistent performance. And with many of the potential upsides that have been taken out of our guidance now, we still see a lot of those upsides out there, but we pulled a lot of that out of our guidance, and so as those occur, they will result in upsides to our guidance.","But despite the significant derisking, WPZ still has one of the highest distribution growths amongst our peers, and this is driven now by approximately $4.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA in 2015 which is further driven by fee-based revenues which make up about 88% of our gross margin. And then, we expect our EBITDA to continue to grow to about $6 billion on the backs of over $9 billion of fee based projects as we look forward to 2017.","Moving on to slide 3, we can see here the key drivers of the fourth quarter and the comparisons to the fourth quarter of '13 along some of the mixed results that generated headwinds for us in the fourth quarter. So, this was certainly another very busy quarter for us as we undertook the commissioning of three very large assets. These assets are now ramping up to our expectations here in the first quarter and will be big contributors to our growth for the balance of 2015 and beyond.","So, first now to hit on the WMB highlight, WMB received $515 million of distributions up from WPZ and ACMP and this was a 16% increase up $70 million. The higher distribution was supported by 30% increase in the fourth quarter adjusted segment profit in DD&A which was up $216 million to now $944 million there in the fourth quarter. So this large increase was certainly driven by the additional ACMP interest that we acquired in the third quarter of '14 and as well the associated consolidation of those interests.","WPZ had mixed results for the quarter. We had some real positives and some real challenges as well. Ongoing mature businesses continued to perform as expected; however, we did have some delays and higher expenses in bringing on Geismar and along with lower commodity prices caused the quarter to come in lower than we had planned.","So, now looking into each segment, the Atlantic-Gulf, strong underlying performance in Transco in the Western Gulf, but this was offset by some producer startups on the Keathley Canyon and Gulfstar facilities. These projects are now online and ramping up nicely here in the first quarter and really pleased to be serving our customers out there both the Anadarko's Lucius facility and the Hess' operated Tubular Bells facility up there.","On the NGL & Petchem side, Geismar being offline versus an expected mid fourth quarter startup plus some LCM inventory adjustments that marks most of the products that we have for linepack and operating inventories back to a much lower market and so this is nothing new in terms of how we account for our inventories, but the sever downward move in NGLs caused a much larger than normal swing in this inventory valuation. We also saw some high expenses for the quarter associated with commissioning and repairs through our Geismar facility.","In the Northeast we continue to ride the wave of strong growth in the Marcellus volumes with a 26% increase on a quarter-to-quarter basis and 28% increase in a full-year '13 to '14 comparison. However we did not hit our expected numbers in OVM due to a delay in bringing on some of the major well pads that producers were bringing on right at the end of the year, but we do continue and enjoy tremendous growth in this area and our current production levels in the Northeast segment as I mentioned earlier are ahead of a more conservative plan now for 2015.","Southwest, the West really performed largely in line with what we've expected with the exception of the commodity prices which certainly clipped our NGL margins in the area. And this area has really held up fairly well despite of lack of drilling and as always our Northwest pipeline asset remained quite steady and in 2015 our plan has less than 15% of the company's gross margin in the west coming from commodity exposed contract.","So, in the past as you know the west has always been an area of big commodity exposure to us and to some of our big processing facilities out there and because of the continued growth in our fee based business as well as the large decline in NGL margins now only have about a percent of that gross margin, actually a little less than that out West. So, lot less volatility as we go into 2015 at West.","So overall, a noisy quarter for WTZ given several one-time and discrete events, but our underlying fundamentals are very strong they give us complements in our 2015 plan and certainly now on the ACMP side, ACMP produced another very impressive quarter. Fee based revenues were up 48% to $593 million and this was driven by a lot of new capital investments that delivered record gross gathering volumes of 6.5 Bcf a day, so tremendous accomplishment by the ACMP team there in the fourth quarter as well.","Moving on to slide 4, talk about some of the milestones and the recent accomplishments here, that certainly give us a lot of confidence in our plan going forward. First of all as I mentioned Gulfstar won the typical startup issues I would tell you for the producers bringing on a lot of new big wells on to that platform, but it is looking like some ultimate upside to our original expected flow rates from the facility and so we're really pleased to see the way that's going and very excited about that investment.","On the Transco side, another winner and another big increase in peak volumes on the nation's largest and fastest growing pipeline. With this year's peak a day here in January beating last year's record by 8% despite a very, very cold winter in January 2014. So, really just a lot of continued growth is driving that on the Transco system and that team continues to do a great job keeping up with all that growth.","ACMP as I mentioned also hit another record volumes and this really a major contributor to this was the gathering volumes in the Utica and those fed into the 49% UEO processing JV there in Eastern Ohio and the latest train to come on line was the new Leesville plant. So, continued great exposure there to the growth in the Utica and really excited to see the way those volumes continue to perform.","More recently, the big addition to our discovery partnership, the Keathley Canyon connector received first production from Anadarko at their Lucius platform and now as we move into March we expect to begin receiving much larger gas volumes from Hadrian field and so again, another huge accomplishment brining on that major facility out in over 7000 feet of water.","Our Geismar restart has certainly been long awaited and we're excited to be where we are on that finally and it is, we are in the process of getting that lined out and we expect to continue to ramp up here in the end of February and our plan does really expect consistent full rate production until the very end of march and so we've derisked that as well and we currently are working to improve the ultimate efficiency of several of the heat exchanger systems before we can reach back for full production.","But all the systems in the base plant have been activated and we've been able to fund that up to about 70% of load there on the base plant. So, we're very confident and where we are today on that it's really just a matter of getting those exchangers being able to operate up to their peak efficiencies.","Our combined access and Williams operating teams came together on the new Bucking Horse plant in Wyoming right during the dead of winter and so, while we don\u2019t expect this plant to generate a significant amount of cash flow, here in the near future, it was very important for our teams to get this plant online for the benefit of our new largest customer Chesapeake and it also demonstrated the clear benefits of integration between both Access and Williams personnel into one new organization out there. So hats off to that team that worked through the pretty touch winter up there to get that plant started up.","Many of our recent expansions have involved along with other facilities modifications to the Transco mainline and so, this allows us to facilitate moving gas from the Marcellus and the Utica from the North to the South. And so, with two kind of projects in common here on this was first Virginia Southside which started up in December '14, the mainline portion did, not yet the lateral but the mainline portion started up much earlier than expected and that full facility of the lateral will come on in the third quarter of 2015.","And then the same story on Leidy Southeast which in March of this year will bring on the mainline portion of the Leidy Southeast project and that also beats our expectations for that project as well. And together these projects will yield $50 million to $75 million of incremental operating profit in 2015. These are all fully contract and that's been approved by the FERC. So we are ready to put these into service and of course bringing on all this incremental operating profit wasn\u2019t expected originally in those investments really gives a very nice boost to our original expected returns for those projects.","And then finally, our Rockaway Beach lateral is expected to start up in either late March or early April and the team has been working hard to hold the schedule despite as a lot of you all know a very wet and cold weather there in the New York area. But really excited to finally bring that project to closure and being able to serve our big customer of their national grid.","Moving on to slide 5, this slide really just provides a real quick snapshot of the different types of cash flow that make up our $6 billion of gross margin. And just to make a few points here, first it shows that now only 3% of WPZ's risk remains tied to the NGL margin commodities and the spread on NGLs and only 9% is tied to our olefins margin in both our Geismar and Canadian facilities. So, meaning 88% of our cash flows are now from fee based revenues here in 2015 and including nearly two-thirds of those that are under contract that have demand payments, cost of service with minimum volume commitment.","So as we can see on the next slide our future growth is even less dependent on commodities as we move to slide 6 here, and this really shows that 99% of our $9.3 billion of growth capital that's in guidance are tied to fee based projects. So this slide really gets to the heart of our lower risk and growth strategy for the next few years. And as you can see the vast majority of this is tied to, even the fee based projects the vast majority is tied to the kind of business that are either on our gas pipeline system or in the ACMP area where we have a lot of protection from volume risk. And so lot of confidence and certainty from our perspective about how we go forward.","So, while certainly commodity prices are and remain important to our business specifically here for the near term cash flows and coverage they really are not the driver of our growth. Our business strategy is built around natural gas volume growth and the demand for associated large scale infrastructure that are going to be required to build out as the natural gas and natural gas products markets continue to build on the back of a very low priced commodity. And as a result we're confident in our ability to deliver one of the highest rates of distribution growth amongst our large cap peers, despite the lower expected commodity prices that are not built into our plan.","Moving on to slide on to slide 7, this slide just drills down into the known projects over this longer period. And so, I'm not going to go through each of these facilities, but one of things that I think we have not spoken very much about but is pretty impressive is the amount of exposure that we have to the LNG export facilities and in fact the Transco has connections that allow it to receive or deliver gas. But nearly every LNG import\/export facility in the Gulf Coast and the eastern seaboard other than the Everett facility in Boston.","Those LNG facilities include Cheniere's Sabine Pass, Exxon's Golden Pass, trunk lines like trialed [ph] Sempra's Cameron LNG, the Elba Island LNG and the Toe Point LNG [ph]. And as you know, we've talked in the past about our access to our Gulf Trace Project being a 1.2 Bcf a day commitment to Cheniere's Sabine Pass facility that's fully contracted and will start up in early 2017.","But we also recently concluded an open season in December of '14 for the Gulf market expansion and this is designed to provide an additional 1.4 Bcf a day of firm transportation from station 65 going back to the West to points on the mainline in Louisiana and Texas and great progress there and we're in the process of negotiating the firm commitments from our shippers and that came out of the open season and it is anticipated that this could possible 1.4 Bcf a day of capacity could be in service as early as late 2018, so just continued tremendous growth on the Transco system, both on the market side and supply side.","Moving to slide 8 here for the conclusion, certainly we're very pleased to have the PZ\/ACMP merger closed and remain more excited than ever really, we continue to see tremendous benefits from the combined strength of this new MLP and we think it is the MLP to be exposed to amongst the large caps if you like the prospects of overall market growth of both natural gas and natural gas derivatives because clearly our strategy is very tightly focused on this opportunity.","As we look to the PZ distribution growth, all of the issues I've gone through the day really drive to this and the revised outlook for PZ and WMB result in a new guidance of 7% to 11% annual distribution growth at WPZ through the '17 period with the midpoint of 9% and this really reflects the strength and the quality of our underlying assets with a growing coverage ratio of greater than 1.05 once we get through this first quarter and '15 ramp up period.","So, not only do we think we have good growth there, but we are continuing to build coverage through period and so we're really excited that despite these much lower and a very relevant to our peers at very conservative price that we continue to be even at the lower growth rate at the low end commodity prices we're still at the high end of our large cap MLP peers. And so, even though this is slightly below the plan that we articulated at the time of the ACMP and WPZ merger, these level of growth in cash and coverage are indicative of the best-in-class large cap MLP.","As we look at the WMB dividend growth we have also slightly slowed down our targeted levels of growth for WMB and this of course is driven by the lower price environment that we've forecast with a range now of 10% to 15% growth largely to match the underlying growth of cash flows coming up from the MLP. So just to highlight the stability of this business plan even under the low price commodity case we can grow WPZ at the 7% we talked about and continue to move over 1.0 coverage there at the low price and at WMB at 10% with additional layers of coverage index of 1.0 at WMB as well. So, we really like our position now with the distribution and coverage and we certainly like the underlying fundamentals that underpin that.","So, overall we're very confident in this business plan. We think it's realistic. We think it allows us to continue to provide tremendous total shareholder return whichever commodity price environment develops as we go forward and in fact across all scenarios we have the best-in-class growth at WPZ and a top-tier growth at WMB with growieng levels of coverage across both entities.","So, this continually building list of investment opportunities are very tightly aligned with our strategy. They give us great confidence in our future and continue to give us a very high quality long lived cash flows that we think are some of the highest quality in the industry and this is coming from our continually, very competitively advantaged assets.","And so with that, I thank you for joining us and we'll turn it over for questions that you might have. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Carl Kirst","Thank you. Good morning everybody. I'll start maybe with the growth projects, and I'm just curious in the current market as you look to Canada, one of the things we were looking at was the PDH facility, I didn\u2019t know if you'll be at the weaker Canadian dollar and perhaps some of the activity coming out of that area might be tempering down the investment costs, and perhaps you know, keeping that potential growth project still in advanced stages, as well as in third quarter, you guys were certainly opening up the possibility of Appalachian Connector, I didn\u2019t know if we could get an update on that as well?","Alan Armstrong","Yes sure. First on PDH, you are correct Carl, the fundamentals are actually improving there as we are seeing some, the signs of lower-cost coming in for equipment and vendors as we go out and are in the process of really tightening up our estimates on that. And additionally, that project is really built around the benefits of the logistics of taking low-cost propane right there in Canada and converting it eventually into polypropylene by our partner and being able to serve markets. ","So, we're basically just cutting down on a lot of rail logistics, and those things continue to improve. Propane prices continue to be a huge spread to Mont Belvieu, propane prices up there and we think that's going to continue for some time because there's not really any logistical answers coming out that will improve that any time soon. And so, we really like how that continues to unfold as well. And really just a matter at this point of getting contracts finalized with our downstream partner there that pulls a lot of that risk off of our shoulders from a commodity spread standpoint, but we really do like the fundamentals and they are certainly improving for that project.","On the Appalachian Connector project, we are certainly still excited. We think the strengths of our market pool and the demand of our market, they are along the mainline is a real positive for us. There has, as you know, there's been some turnover in some of the properties upstream, and certainly with the lower gas prices, people are looking for creative solutions out of that area, and so we're certainly working with a lot of those customers both on the market side and the upstream side to try to bring those two together in a way that they can firmly support our project. And so, we're feeling pretty good about that, but it is -- certainly everybody is kind of, anybody in the energy industry right now is reeling a little bit in trying to get their forward-looking perspectives tend down before they make any major commitments, and so obviously that's where we stand on that today.","Carl Kirst","Do you get a sense, and that's kind of where I was going to, do you get a sense that even as these continue to percolate, they've both been pushed back to the back half of the year if they do come together or how would you think about timing?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I would say on the PDH project, it really is just we're going to be very, very careful. That's a big investment for us. We want to make absolutely certain that we've been, that we know exactly what our numbers, we get as many bids and estimates, solid estimates that are well engineered in the door, so the PDH project is more, just of us moving along at a pace that is focused on making sure we can execute on the project effectively rather than being in a rush on it. And so, that one is more driven by our own efforts and getting the contracts finalized than it is anything in the broader macro industry at this point.","On the Appalachian Connector piece, I think that answers have got to come a little quicker on that, and so I think we'll be pressing in the next quarter to decide one way or the other on where we go with that, but in any way, shape, or form, I think we're going to position ourselves to benefit both our assets in the area, both our wholly-owned and some of our equity investments in making sure that we get good market attachment to those assets and as well making sure that we get the investments that are due to us for the downstream mainline expansions for that gas as well. So pretty excited about it, but we're not going to push a rope on that. We've got plenty of great investment opportunities, and we're not going to step up and take risk on that.","Carl Kirst","Yeah, I appreciate that. One final one just for Don, just very quickly, I appreciate the WPZ equity as far as obviously retaining investment grade. Don, do you have any planned equity issuances in '16 and '17 at PZ in the kind of base case budget?","Don Chappel","Good morning Carl. The PZ equity issuances in '16, '17 at this point is de minimus. So, it gives us capacity to really take on some additional opportunities since we see exciting opportunities develop.","Carl Kirst","Thank you, guys.","Don Chappel","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Ted Durbin","Thanks. First one for me is just on the balance of distribution growth, dividend growth coverage keeping PZ flat here it looks like in 2015, I guess how are you thinking about the right level there, especially given that you have a much higher mix of fee based cash flow?","Don Chappel","Ted, this is Don, I'll just note that we felt we want to go in with a fairly conservative plan here in light of what happened in the marketplace. So rather than continue to boost the dividend or distribution during the year we set forth a plan that we'd hold it steady. And obviously if we see things develop to the upside we could change that, but we felt that we'd set a plan here that was more conservative and one that hopefully investors will agree that is conservative as well.","Ted Durbin","Okay, great. Next one from me is just on Geismar, can you maybe quantify a little bit more closely how many pounds of ethylene are you actually planning to sell in 2015 or some sense of utilization rate you're looking for as we ramp up through the year\/","Don Chappel","Well, as I said really, you can call it about anyway you want to, but we are expecting very little here in the first quarter and then we would be at our typical run rates on Geismar for the balance of the year. And so that would be up against the expanded capacity and somewhere around 98% to 98.5% of that expanded capacity.","Ted Durbin","Got it, very helpful, thanks. And then last one for me, it looks like you're no longer giving guidance by segment here. I guess I'm just wondering if you can give us any sense of versus the old guidance that you used to have of the different WPZ segments, how much plus or minus are we against those or will we start to get some more color there in terms of how the actual operating areas are performing?","Don Chappel","Ted, this is Don, I'm sorry again, given as much changes we have here we took a little different approach this quarter. I would say that as we approach our Analyst Day we'll look at providing some additional information about, I'll note for you that we did take volumes down fairly substantially up in the Northeast at OVM as well as Marcellus, but some volume reduction from our prior growth expectations that is in the West. So hopefully that helps.","Ted Durbin","That's helpful. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Don Chappel","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Abhi Rajendran with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Abhi Rajendran","Hi, good morning guys.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Abhi Rajendran","Just a quick question on the dividend illustration and outlook over the next couple years, obviously on the cash tax rate line, you're not paying anything for the next couple years. I think previously you talked about that kind of eventually rising up to maybe the high single digit, low double-digit sort of percentage, how should we think about that kind of looking beyond 2017 and then what that might mean for maybe long-term growth covers, et cetera.","Don Chappel","Yeah Abhi, this is Don again. You know we had a couple of things change here since our third quarter guidance on this matter and cash tax rates are down substantially. A couple of key points there, one was the bonus depreciation, which again lowered our cash tax rates nicely and then as well the fact that income was lower also it kind of extended in the chart, the period of time although which some of these deductions will be realized.","So, I think you can see there the cash tax rate is about zero through 2017 and in our footnote on that schedule you can see that we've disclosed '18 and '19 we estimated about 4% currently and obviously things will move around a bit, but as we continue to add projects or potentially even M&A that will have the tendency to push the cash tax rate down in '18 and '19 as well as perhaps periods beyond that. So again, some good news on the cash tax front.","Abhi Rajendran","Hey got it and since you mentioned M&A, what are your thoughts on the M&A environment and possibilities? Are you continuing to look or are things sort of put on the back burner a little bit, you know, you guys deferred the drop of the NGL Petchem projects from WMB until bit later down the line. How are you thinking about that whole dynamic?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, sure, this is Alan. Thanks for the question. You know, I would just say we have a lot of acquisition opportunities that are where we have a preferential position to acquire and those are right down our alley and our knowledge base. So we wouldn't be taking a lot of risk where we are already know the area, know the asset, know the investments and so I would say those are probably first on the list for our capacity in that space.","And but you know, we're going to be pretty prudent frankly and we like where we're positioned right now and think that as the cash flows really start to come through and people really see the strength of these investment opportunities we think we're going to be very well positioned to take on some of those transactions. So, I would say that's first, but I think one thing you can, we've certainly been consistent on as we stuck with our strategy very tightly on the acquisition front and have stuck to things that are very consistent with our strategy and so you should think about that as we go forward the same thing.","Abhi Rajendran","Got it, thanks very much for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Jeremy Tonet","Hi good morning.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Don Chappel","Good morning.","Jeremy Tonet","I know things have been changing really quick here, but I was wondering if you might be able to expand a bit more upon conversations you are having with your producer customers as far as their drilling activities in 2015 and if there's any way we can think about quantifying the risk of throughput through the legacy WPZ G&P assets that's a low end of guidance and that certain volume assumptions are different than the high-end or any help there will be great?","Alan Armstrong","Well, just to kind of put that in context for you from where we were in the previous guidance period, we pulled well over $100 million out on that from those fee-based volumes and so we have dramatically reduced that and I would tell you the areas that are hardest hit and we think are going to be hardest hit and I would tell you we've been more conservative than some of the input we've had from some of our producers in many areas, but the areas that have been hardest hit were areas that were enjoying a big lift from liquids.","And I think the gas market overall particularly the demand side probably doesn't appreciate all the nice benefit of continued supply that has come on the backs of high-priced liquids margins and with those pulled out of the space right now you know, we think that is going to dramatically retard drilling. And so if you're, I would say conservative and may be even bearish relevant to our peers about where we think liquids prices will be for the year then that also has you not being very bullish on people drilling for rich gas. And so I would say those are the areas that from our perspective are most affected not so much the dry gas, but really the richer gas areas are the ones we'd really pulled back our assumptions on.","Jeremy Tonet","That makes sense. Thank you and just one last question on constitution if you could provide any updates there as far as how that's progressing?","Alan Armstrong","Sure, Rory, you want to take that one?","Rory Miller","Yeah, this is Rory. Jeremy, we've had some pretty good news in the fourth quarter. This is probably fairly well known, but just as kind of a recap, December 2 the FERC issued a certificate of public convenience necessity authorizing the constitution pipeline project. So that's a big milestone for the project. And then later on that same month on December 24, the New York DEC issued a notice of complete application on the project and sent out three public hearings that took place in that second week of January and they've set a deadline of February 27, 2015 to get all of the written comments and on the action that they are considering.","So, we've been working very closely with the New York DEC, that's probably the next hurdle that we need to clear, but they're asking a lot of questions. I think they are very intent on doing their due diligence on the project and they've been very inquisitive, but we've been working very hard and very steadily to get them the answers that they need and put them in a position to issue that permit hopefully in a few months after the, month or two after the close of the comment period.","Jeremy Tonet","Great, thanks for that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brad Olsen from TPH. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Brad Olsen","Hey, good morning guys.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Brad Olsen","I had a really kind of a financial structuring question, we've obviously seen Kinder Morgan take the step of getting rid of their MLP entirely and as you look out with the ACMP deal now closed and you guys have provided what I think is very conservative guidance versus you know, what market expectations are and you're still building coverage even in this conservative $45 scenario that you painted and yet, we still see WPZ trading a couple hundred basis points in several cases wider in terms of yield than a lot of the big cap MLP peers that its comped against.","And so, I guess you guys have provided some interesting color in previous presentations in terms of kind of where you expect on a yield basis WPZ to trade based on its growth rate. It seems like that discount is persisting and I was wondering if you had thoughts on a) any kind of further steps that you can take to close that discount and b) if you still find that WPZ is not an effective financing vehicle or is just simply too expensive of a financing vehicle would you consider simplifying your structure and eliminating the MLP or folding it into WMB?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, I would just tell you. I think that's certainly a tool for us in the future, I think though right now right we've got a great plan in front of us and we do believe that as these big projects come on and really begin to generate kind of tremendous cash flow that they've got that we're going to see the market reprice that the WPZ currency.","And so, we think that is yet to come and certainly with Geismar continuing to be down and the big Gulfstar and Keathley Canyon, Rockaway Lateral all these big projects really starting to kick up here for the balance of the year. We think that's going to give the market a lot of confidence. So I would say you know, we certainly understand that the benefits of that as a tool for the future, but I think right now we've got to execute on what we have and let the market retune itself before we make any further decision on that.","Brad Olsen","Got it, thanks for that color, just one follow-up, as you look out into potentially heating up M&A market in light of the market dislocations that we've seen recently and you think about potential opportunities in the M&A market, would you be willing to contemplate using WMB as a consolidation vehicle given the fact that you've spent the better part of the last year getting WMB into a fairly streamlined General Partner HoldCo or would you be willing to wait for WPZ's evaluation to get more competitive in terms of an M&A currency before attempting to do anything?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I would just say I think both of them are fairly undervalued right now from our perspective and so I think I'm able to get them both in position, but I think it certainly would depend on the transaction as we move to that point then it will certainly depend on the transaction as to which one would be the more appropriate currency for that. So, it's nice to have both of them frankly because there are times when the co-op currency would be a much more favored currency than an NLP currency. And so we think it's important to have both of them right now and we like having both those tools.","Brad Olsen","Great, thanks a lot for the color Alan.","Alan Armstrong","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Shneur Gershuni","Hi, good morning guys. Just a quick follow up to actually to the discussion you just had with Brad, when you were thinking about it taken or whether it\u2019s a tool in your chest further down the road, is it fair to assume that given the fact that you're effectively based on an earlier comment not a taxpayer at WMB through 2017 that it pretty much wouldn't make sense to even consider it until you actually become a taxpayer, is that sort of the way we should be thinking about that as kind of the first step in terms of whether you would consider taking it at all?","Don Chappel","Shneur this is Don. I think the tool is one that we'll continue to look at and yes, we're not a taxpayer for many years. However, there are other attributes to the option, but again I think as Alan mentioned earlier we think execution is likely to cause WPZ to trade at a level that is appropriate given its opportunity set, the growth set and we think the relatively low long term risk that natural gas growth demand drives. So again, we'll just put that on the shelf. It is something we'll continue to study, but we think that execution is job number one and yes, taxes are something that would not be all that valuable for quite a few years.","Shneur Gershuni","Great thanks. Okay, so just moving on to some of the questions that I had, first there's been quite a few announcements by many of the processors around the country of significant cost saving initiatives, some headcount reductions and so forth and I realized at the time of the merger you were very adamant about no headcount reductions, if anything you were looking to hire people and so forth. But I think more kind of in a different commodity environment today, I wonder if that thought process has changed at all and you are pursuing some sort of cost reduction strategies? Sort of I was wondering if you can sort of comment against what you're doing versus what the rest of the industry is doing?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, great question and we certainly are going to put a lot of pressure on costs and we do think that we've got a lot of room to do that and so certainly using the buying kind of into these lower material costs, costs on things like lube oil which as you can imagine is with as many spending parts as we have in our businesses is a big number for us. And so, we certainly are going to go after cost on that side. On the headcount front, I would say there are certainly a lot of those opportunities coming to us as we merge a lot of support functions.","But I would say we still really need continue to preserve our strength on the operating and technical side because we do have a lot of growth on that front, but it is shifting around and we will need to shift some of those resources around to be focused on where the opportunities lie, but I would tell you we still are looking for great talent in the technical and operating side and we do see some opportunities on the support function side as we continue to consolidate the organization. So we are pursuing them aggressively I guess is the best way to say that and we do think that's quite a bit of opportunity around that.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay, and then a question about the dividend policy, last night you\u2019ve effectively tempered the growth you said it in your prepared remarks reflecting the current commodity environment, is it also fair to say that this is somewhat of an affirmation that's no longer going to be kind of an idea or waiver type strategy in terms of how you sort of structure the PZ distribution and the Williams dividend policy or is it really just about the current commodity environment?","Don Chappel","Shneur, we believe that WPZ is sufficiently strong to carry itself without requiring any IDRs. We initially designed it very stout coverage. Fortunately we have that stout coverage designed in and we used it, but nonetheless as you can see here we're building coverage back again in a way that we do not expect WPZ to need that reverse. And as Alan pointed out with 88% in fee-based gross margin with 30% of that coming from interstate pipes and another 27%, coming from ACMP and its cost of service contracts and MDC's, we have nearly 60% of our gross margin coming from either interstate pipe or cost of service MDC type revenue. So very low risk we think on relative basis cash flows, so again we don\u2019t see a need for IDRs, we don\u2019t think either the market puts enough value on those to make it worthwhile.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay, that's fair enough and one final question just with respect to Geismar, I was just wondering if you walk us through where you are with ethylene production today and sort of the confidence that you know, it will be at full runway in the first quarter kind of like what are the hiccups or challenges that you're dealing with today that you need to get complete so that you can actually be at full run rate by the first quarter?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, well, I am going to have John Dearborn provide you a little more detail here, but I would just say in general as we started up the plant we hit a \u2013 we started seeing some inefficiencies and some fouling in our heat exchangers that are critical to reaching peak efficiency in a plant like that. And so rather than continue to be dogged with that, we chose to take those heat exchangers off line, stop sales on ethylene out of the plant for a while and get those heat exchangers cleaned out adequately to make sure that we could get back to absolutely full efficiency on the plant.","So, and not continuing to try to run through that as we pull through startups. So that's really what's going on, that's not a big issue, it's just a matter of getting some of the residual fouling that had been sitting in those heat exchangers and getting then tuned up. But we have gotten the plant up and running. We've had all the systems up and running. We just weren\u2019t hitting the efficiencies that we wanted to and so we're back getting that tuned up. And then the next step would be to bring on the larger expansion as well and so we think we've got that part of the plant ready to go as well and so that's what we'll be doing here for the next three weeks or so is tackling both those issues, but things are going well on that front and we're pleased with the way the work is going. John, have you anything to add?","John Dearborn","Yeah, obviously Alan is very well informed on this issue of how Geismar is going. I think we should keep him well informed that way. The only think I would add is as we look forward, it's our intension that we bring the plant back notionally to the base capacity level that 1.3 billion pound rate and at that rate which as you heard Alan say earlier we've demonstrated now 70% of that rate already operating with nine furnaces, then we'll line up plants and will be absolutely certain that the plant is running stably and then we'll take the next steps to ramp up to the full capacity getting up into that high 90s operating rate against the full capacity over the subsequent few weeks.","So that's the way we had it planned out and we're making very good progress of getting this heat exchanger cleaned and expect to turn the plant back over to operations next week and in a few days after that be back in the pipeline.","Shneur Gershuni","Perfect. Thanks a lot guys, I really appreciate the color.","Alan Armstrong","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Christine Cho","Good morning. I was just curious, you guys in the press release talk about the deferral over the planned drop down of the remaining NGL and Petchem projects. When are you thinking that that's going to be deferred, do you have a sense of an idea when that's going to be?","Don Chappel","Christine, this is Don. You know, we didn't put a date on it, so it's not embedded in any of the guidance that you see here; however, I think I'll just say we'll be opportunistic about that, so we'll look to do that when we think WPZ has the financial capacity to do that in a real value creating kind of way with that capacity or with a combination of some debt and equity when the equity is trading in a way that we think is more appropriate. So right now I'll just say we'll be opportunistic and we'll deal with that as we see the right facts and circumstances line up.","Christine Cho","Okay, and then my next question is a bit of an operational one. You know in a prior response to a question you talk about how you stripped out $100 million of margin tied to areas where there is obviously rich related drilling. If I am to think about kind of the Marcellus and you know, you've previously talked about Oak Grove coming on at the end of this year, is there really a reason for that to come on by this year? Can we defer that, I mean it doesn\u2019t sound like Fort Beeler is going to be fully utilized this year, so can you just kind of migrate whenever volumes are dedicated to Oak Grove to Fort Beeler in the meantime?","Alan Armstrong","Christine, actually Oak Grove is PXD 1 [ph] is up and running already and recall that that is where our de-ethanizer is and so we have both the processing train there and the de-ethanizer there at the Oak Grove facility. So for operational reasons it's good for us to have that up and running. I would tell you that again even though we pulled the upsides in the step that's not fully contracted out of our guidance on our forecast, there are a couple of very sizable packages of gas out there that we are extremely well positioned to capture, because we do have that capacity available.","And so, I'm not going to get into specific customer names there, but I would just tell you we're extremely well-positioned to capture those because we do have that capacity available and so we're excited to have that Oak Grove capacity ready and available to serve those customers and we think we're going to build and capture that. There's quite a bit of gas that is just sitting there not flowing today because producers have had troubles bringing pads up. And so, I think as those come on and as we have an opportunity to capture some of that other gas out there we're going to be really glad we have that capacity available.","Christine Cho","Okay, so no changes to at least a second chain of Oak Grove then the timing of that then?","Alan Armstrong","That's right.","Christine Cho","Okay, and then my last question is you know, we've always talked about potential to convert Geismar into fee-based with the customer. Given all the changes that have happened in the last couple of months, has this thinking changed or is the challenge really finding a counterparty to do it with?","Alan Armstrong","No, I certainly don't think it has changed and we are certainly looking to really think about that from a shareholder value standpoint. Certainly if we were just looking at the PV or the cash flows as we think that having the commodity risks, especially as it covers our ethane processing risk, we think that absolute PV of those cash flows is probably better providing the commodity risk. However, given the beta and the volatility that that brings in from an investor perspective, we think there's some value to be had by lowering our risk. And so, it's a matter of finding that right trade-off.","And as we said, as I said earlier the fact that we've got a much lower assumption and expectation right now on the commodity margin actually gives us a little more room to go do a transaction like that and so we certainly are very interested in that. And I would tell you that while they seem separate, the ability to bridge between somebody's needs on Geismar 2 and perhaps their more current needs from available production at Geismar 1 starts become the opportunity there. So we're still very interested in doing that and we think the current margin environment gives us a little more room to do that because we wouldn\u2019t be coming out and having to lower our guidance so much if we weren\u2019t able to convert that into fee-based.","Christine Cho","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Brian Lasky","Good morning. Just want to back in on Christine's question a little bit, you guys seen the appetite among producers potentially to convert to fee-based contract as they are looking to print more barrels and show more growth, is that something that they\u2019re potentially open to in this tough environment for the right price level?","Alan Armstrong","I would just say that a lot of our business has converted to fee base. And so really the place that we have remaining exposure on a key pole basis as I mentioned is about a little less than 15% out West of our total gross margins out there.","And so, I would say it continues to be an opportunity, but we structurally I would just tell you there are ways for us to keep the risk and for them to report the barrels. And so, that I would say we figured out and we\u2019ve done a lot of that in the past for the producers report the barrels as an owned equity barrels, but we don\u2019t have to really change the equity ownership of those barrels.","And so, that\u2019s always a discussion that we\u2019re always interested in, I\u2019ll tell you that we on the processing side we have over the years tried to contract for fee base when the margins are high.","And take on the key pole when margins are really low and so, but just because we certainly believe in that cyclicality of the processing margin. And so, I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re really changed the perspective so much on that front.","Brian Lasky","Got it and just on the Access business seemed like quarter-over-quarter a little bit more flat this quarter. Can you maybe just kind of talk about the trajectory you see going forward there and kind of what puts and takes are you seeing?","Alan Armstrong","Bob, can you take that one please?","Robert Purgason","Yeah, certainly Alan and Brian glad to look at, I think we didn\u2019t feel we felt like we had a really good quarter actually and are seeing good volume growth in our Northeast areas, Utica very strong, still strong volumes in Marcellus, Eagle Ford volume is still growing as Alan noted, Niobrara coming up although whilst picking that up here in process. So, we feel very good about our performance coming out no integration impacts from that. And in fact or looking for the kind of growth that you saw in detail as Access standalone continuing and in fact accelerating with the Williams team.","Brian Lasky","All right, thanks Bob, that\u2019s helpful. And then finally Don, I was just wondering if you could maybe just speak to the kind of leverage capacity you think you have at the MB level, I mean in order to stay aren\u2019t you rated up there? I mean then would you guys have any appetite potentially fund some projects of that level? ","Don Chappel","Brian, I think at this point in time we don\u2019t have much in the way of debt capacity to volumes level. So, obviously as cash flows build and for past margins improve or build into that capacity. But today it wouldn\u2019t be here that we have that capacity to do much of anything in the very near future.","Brian Lasky","Okay thank you very much guys.","Alan Armstrong","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Craig Shere","Good morning guys, thanks for fitting me in. ","Alan Armstrong","Good morning, Craig.","Craig Shere","Alan in response to Brian\u2019s question about processing contracts you expressed the long-term contrarian view where you see the cyclicality continuing. On that note, in contrast to going to fee based to Geismar would you have the appetite for increasing the commodity exposure on the midstream processing to kind of neutralize some of your exposures on both ethane and also take advantage of that long-term cyclicality you are describing?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, great question Craig and I would just say that we certainly are not in the Olefin business for the sake of being in Olefin business and we see it\u2019s a nice extension of our midstream business in a way to push through into those markets and keep those markets open. On the tail end and certainly we are working to try to be neutral on that ethane to ethylene spread we\u2019re actually a little bit short ethane right now. If we were to turn on all of our ethane recovery capacity, obviously we\u2019re very short right now, because we\u2019re not recovering ethane anywhere.","But if we wanted to turn on our ethane, if we were at full ethane production against the contracts we have we still would be a little bit short ethane. So trying to get neutral on that, but another way of getting neutral on that would be to and we\u2019re into some T based contracts on the ethylene side and therefore reduce our length on ethylene and reduce and improve our balance between ethane and ethylene. So, I would say that\u2019s more likely the way we would approach that. ","Craig Shere","Great that\u2019s helpful and on the commodity deck for guidance on obviously very conservative. But the one area I had a question on and I understand that you don\u2019t really have a long-term ethane markets that are useful.","But if I\u2019m not mistaken recent ethane-ethylene crack spreads are perhaps few cents below the full-year guidance if I\u2019m not mistaken. Can you provide some color around Olefin\u2019s margin expectations and market drivers you see as Geismar achieves more capacity?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, sure. Well, first of all, just want to tell you that on the ethylene side, remember that that is at a $55 oil price. And so, we think that ethylene price is very commensurate with a $55 oil price that we have in there. Also you obviously have to pay attention to the spread and not just the absolute price that we have in there would it sounds like you are focused on Craig. But the other thing that I think it\u2019s missed sometimes in this is that we are actually at the netted price and remember that we produce in the Mississippi river market.","And so while we certainly sell and exchange a lot of our product in the Mont Belvieu as well, we do have exposure to the Mississippi river market, which has been extremely short and there\u2019s actually a lot of derivative production that\u2019s been down in the area due to shortages.","And so, you have to take that into consideration when you look at our proposed ethylene spread. And so, I think we feel pretty good as you look into the 2016 and 2017 timeframe you can see our ethylene price coming up, but you can also see that the ethane price is coming up right along with that as well.","And so really again need to look at the spread I would say I\u2019m pretty bullish. The ethylene market as we look out in next couple of years, because the growth that I think we're going to see in the economies and the lack of near-term productive capacity coming up, it\u2019s pretty hard to argue there isn\u2019t going to be quite a bit of pressure on those Olefin markets to the upside and lot of demand coming to that.","So that\u2019s what I would have to offer for you. I think we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re positioned there and John is a great student of that space as well and I\u2019ll John provide any additional comment you want to make.","John Porter","And I, only one few other things to add up, first the lower prices are certainly expected to stimulate some demand, but also we\u2019ve been looking at some recent reports that would say that we\u2019re seeing slowing exports and increasing local demand here in North America for ethylene and ethylene to reproduce.","And certainly the ethylene derivative market remained quite strong. The second point I would add for consideration here is that if you look at ethylene inventories, there are pretty much all time low levels to estimated to be about six days worth of production in inventory at this point in time. ","But remember that all those six days are not available to take advantage of a production mishap and nearly no one forecast production mishaps. So we think there are probably only about maybe three or four days worth of usable inventory they\u2019re ready to make up for some production shortfalls.","And certainly coming into the year we see a couple of crackers that are down now though we have a light turnaround season this year. And then lastly, I'd turn your attention a little bit further to the Louisiana market, today with the Evangeline pipeline shutdown and suffered some from reliability issues at the moment, the spot price premium between Texas and the Louisiana is in the $0.08 to $0.10 down range. I think as we bring our facility back in operations that will likely return to more normal levels, but we\u2019re very well aware on some derivative capacity there on the river that is underserved, because of the combined outage of both Edmonton and Evangeline. So I think as Alan expressed and as I would confirm here we are generally positive as our guidance would suggest, so thanks for the question.","Craig Shere","Very helpful, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Sharon Lui","Hi, good morning.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Sharon Lui","Just a follow-up question on ACMP, maybe if you could provide some color on the organic growth opportunities and what type of CapEx is embedded in your guidance relative to the historical levels for the G&P business?","Alan Armstrong","Bob, you want to take that?","Robert Purgason","Sure, yeah Sharon, it's nice to hear from you. In terms of just looking at going forward you'll notice we had a good strong capital year this year and we\u2019ve given I believe a three-year look out here in the new numbers.","And if you compare those to our past guidance you\u2019ll see some strength in capital over our older forecast just in terms of our thinking that there are still new opportunities coming. These assets have not been worked hard and we are seeing the kind of backfill that we\u2019ve always talked into our capital not just dropping off the ledge when we finish this first round build out that arguably happened this year. So we still see good capital investment opportunity and as you know that drives earnings given our business model.","Sharon Lui","But has that been, I guess the shift or change in producer's willingness to commit to like a contract under cost of service under the current commodity environment?","Alan Armstrong","Well, these are not new contracts these are continuing to build on the footprint that we have already established. And are continuing to build out in these core areas like Utica and the strength that we\u2019re seeing there in the Eagle Ford where, yes drilling softer, but there\u2019s still good strong drilling going on and really just filling out our existing portfolio.","Sharon Lui","Okay, great. And I guess just one question with regards to liquidity at WPZ, so post the merger, does the partnership have access to both credit facilities or is there plans to, I guess renegotiate with the bankers for one larger facility?","Alan Armstrong","Sharon, we put a new larger facility in place effective as of the date of the merger as well as a supplemental liquidity facility. So we have abundant liquidity.","Sharon Lui","Okay, and has the pricing terms changed?","Alan Armstrong","The pricing terms are more in line with WPZs pricing given its historic WPZs pricing in light of the fact that we have a mid-BBB investment grade ratings. So the ACMP pricing really moved to the WPZ level of pricing and it felt a little better than it was in our prior facility.","Sharon Lui","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi. Please go ahead, your line is open.","Eric Genco","Hi, I just wanted to follow up a little bit on Craig\u2019s question. When we look at the spot prices for ethylene, if I will get sort of the Bloomberg today, it looks like for Mont Belvieu you\u2019re looking at $34.75 per pound. Is that the right number to be looking at and what is that now for the Mississippi River market today roughly?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, thanks for the question. Unfortunately, there\u2019s not an awful lot of transactions happening on the Mississippi River. The few recent transactions that we saw came out to be plus about between $0.08 and $0.10 to that number that you see at Mont Belvieu.","And as I mentioned in my commentary just a moment ago, at least I would believe that as we bring our plants back into service here through this early part of this year, we would probably see that differential climb to more normal levels.","And those more normal levels range between $0.01 and $0.03, so if you are looking forward and it would be reasonable to expect those kind of differentials, but certainly and once again, we feel that there\u2019s a pent-up demand over on the river that\u2019s been lagging by our outage and the reliability of the pipelines getting ethylene to that market in recent past.","Eric Genco","Okay that\u2019s helpful, but the $34.75 that\u2019s a good number that\u2019s kind of the good number for ethylene pricing in Mont Belvieu as of right now?","Alan Armstrong","It\u2019s a good number whether all transactions happen at that level they\u2019ll probably happen around that number, so yeah it\u2019s a good number you are looking at.","Eric Genco","And just, I mean just kind of to remind me, I should have this somewhere, but I just don\u2019t it top of my head. If Geismar is running at say 95%, 98% or whatever the target is, what percentage of, I guess U.S. ethylene capacity would that be like? How much more is coming back onto the market?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, it\u2019s around, it\u2019s just under 4%.","Eric Genco","4% okay.","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, right in that range, right.","Eric Genco","Right and then my second question just switching gears I guess to Atlantic Gulf and I'm sorry if you touched on this, it looked like the other segment costs jumped pretty significantly there. I can understand that there\u2019s going to be some, perhaps some startup costs associated with Gulfstar, I was hoping you could quantify that a little bit more? And then just try to understand if that\u2019s what it is at Gulfstar, are there any revenues or any revenues whatsoever in the quarter from Gulfstar, inventory and charge or anything like that?","Alan Armstrong","Well yeah, there were revenues in the quarter from Gulfstar. I think we had $19 million of new Gulfstar fees. We actually collected quite a bit more than that in really the second half of 2014. So we have the cash in, but based on the revenue recognition model that we\u2019re using we kind of have to dose out those collected dollars based on the forecasted throughput through the facility.","So our cash numbers are actually are far in excess of the $19 million that we took to earnings. But that will continue to grow and we are collecting a base fee or demand fee under that contract. And then there\u2019s a usage fee as well as those barrels and those MMBTs of gas total across the facility. So that\u2019s a fairly significant impact on revenues in the quarter. Also our Transco transportation revenues were up, fee-based revenues were up about $15 million.","And there was some IT volumes and some short-term firm deals and as well as some seasonal volumes that we saw pushing that number up.","Eric Genco","Okay, but is there something that kind of caused the, I mean is it really Gulfstar startup or how much of this is one-time to go from sort of 3Q number of $133 million above the some of the cash cost to say $160 million?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah that the quarter I would say is not really indicative of the year. So if you look at the year in total on the expense side we were right on our target, but if you look quarter-to-quarter, it looks pretty extreme. I\u2019ll tell you what happened though if you remember the polar vortex that we went through Q1 of 2014, it was kind of an all hands on deck period for Transco we were sudden new records seemed like almost every day.","It was a pretty severe environment and we saw almost all of our expenditures that we could push got pushed into the second, third, and fourth quarters. So just it was a game of catch-up all year and we just wound up loading a lot of those expenses into the fourth quarter. If you look at the year\u2019s total, it\u2019s pretty much right on.","Eric Genco","All right this was helpful, thank you very much.","Alan Armstrong","Yep.","Operator","And our last question comes from Timm Schneider with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead your line is open. ","Timm Schneider","Hey guys just real quick, and first of all I appreciate all the color you gave on the ethylene markets that was super helpful. I think it is funny as your call was going on Axio filed for Private Letter Ruling for their MLPs, so you already got someone for your fee base Geismar ethylene I guess.","I mean, so I just want to switch over real quick then to the Northeast. Can you just give us a little bit more color on what the exit rate maybe was at OEM? And then secondly, have any of the producers up there actually pushed back to you and kind of had some look, can you give us a break on any of these rates that you guys are charging us in exchange for it will keep the volume going?","Alan Armstrong","Timm, sorry Jim Scheel, you want to take that please?","Jim Scheel","Sure, you know as we spoke last time we were pretty bullish about ending the year around 400. That didn\u2019t happen. We had a couple issues associated with some pretty significant CRPs that had some operational issues associated with producers actually having a much richer liquids content. So we\u2019ll expect that volume to show up later in the year as we install the equipment necessary to handle that quality issue that we faced at the end of the year. So we ended just over 300.","We have been talking to our producers and as has already been talked about it, that number of different times we have a much different expectation for growth around OVM, but it is continued growth, it\u2019s just at a slower rate. We have had discussions with producers about renegotiation of agreements and that\u2019s not to go not without opportunities for us to improve on the base agreements that we had achieved with Cayman and negotiate some better terms.","But at this point, those are just preliminary discussions and we have not made any commitments to make any changes, but obviously if we can create a win-win position with our producers we will be open to those discussions.","Timm Schneider","All right, super outlook, thank you guys.","Alan Armstrong","Thanks.","Operator","And it appears we have no further questions at this time. So I would like to turn the program back over our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan Armstrong","Okay, great well thank you all very much, very excited about our future and really like how we've repositioned ourselves here and derisked our forecast substantially and yet still tremendous growth in distribution. And we think, best months it appears, considering our conservative forecast. So, thank you very much for joining us and we look forward to talking to you in the future.","Operator","That does conclude today\u2019s program.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Porter","Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams.","As you know, yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include the press release of our results with related schedules and our analyst package; a presentation on our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our quarterly data book, which contains detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.","This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments, and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our Midstream business; Frank Ferazzi is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel, is also available to respond to any of your questions.","In yesterday's presentation and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.","Alan S. Armstrong","Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. First, let me wish everyone who has been affected by Hurricane Sandy, the best of luck in the recovery. As you know, given the significant disruption that occurred to the normal market activity, we decided to delay our earnings release webcast by a day. We also know this concentrated a number of earnings calls today, so thanks a bunch for joining us this morning for this webcast amongst a very busy morning.","Hopefully, you had a chance to listen to my prerecorded comments released yesterday afternoon. But just in case you didn't, I'll quickly hit on some key themes and then we'll move on to our Q&A session.","We have several really important items to communicate to you this week, starting with, of course, a review of our third quarter performance. So I'll quickly touch on the key themes from that discussion.","For the third quarter, WMB's adjusted income was up about 17% over second quarter, in spite of NGL fracs that for -- sorry, frac spreads that were about 18% lower, on average, than the already-low 2 -- second quarter amounts and the impact of Hurricane Isaac, and I'll talk about that just a little bit.","With regard to the NGL frac spread, we saw about a 9% lower average NGL composite price, but an even higher impact from natural gas Street [ph] prices that were up about 26%, on average. So certainly, the frac spread environment that we saw in the third quarter continued to decline from what was a heavy decline from first quarter to second quarter, and so we were not expecting that degree of decline into the third quarter. And again, a lot of that was impacted by gas prices moving up.","Turning to fee-based revenues now for third quarter. This measure grew about 5% per -- year-over-year for the third quarter. And importantly, at the Midstream segment for WPZ, this grew at about a 12% rate, so continued great volume growth there in our fee-based revenues.","And just to a highlight a few of the areas that affected that, our gathering volumes in the business, so that's as our natural gas gathering volumes in the Midstream business, were up 17% higher from 3Q '11 to 3Q of '12. And in the eastern onshore, which is basically at our Marcellus area and the Perdido Norte, which is in the western Gulf of Mexico, we saw both of those areas gathering volumes, actually double from year-to-year.","The main driver of the 12% growth rate for -- overall for our business was the eastern G&P business, as I mentioned. And, of course, one of the drivers there was the acquisition from the Caiman, which we now refer to as the Ohio Valley Midstream in our business, and that was up about $30 million between years.","Also, there was a couple of factors that brought that 12% growth rate down and tended to lessen it. The Hurricane Isaac reduced some of our Gulf Coast fee-based revenues, and in third quarter of '11, we actually had a pretty significant contract settlement related to some of our Perdido Norte business. So on a normalized basis, we see these fee-based revenues actually growing even stronger than the 12% for WPZ Midstream.","Most of the Hurricane Isaac impacts were caused by interruptions in third-party operations. So while we did have some immediate interruption in our offshore assets, in particular, in terms of getting things back up and running, it really was due to some downstream oil terminals and some downstream NGL pipelines that held us up a little bit longer. So we really did fare pretty well against our assets, but there were some assets that we're integrated with that were a little more challenged.","Hurricane Isaac also significantly impacted our results in the Midstream Canadian and olefins business as Geismar had downtime that affected its production volumes, as well as some damage to a furnace, as we tried to restart the plant after the hurricane. So all-in, this affected our segment profit from about $9 million to $13 million, and about $4 million of this was treated as an assessment for adjusted segment profit.","So that's a quick look at our third quarter drivers. But again, given the continued lower NGL commodity price environment and the Hurricane Isaac impact, we actually had a pretty good operational period here for the third quarter.","So next up, we have some important updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, from both WMB and WPZ. Included in these updates are the effect of the Geismar drop-down, which we've announced we will be closing very soon. But we've also got some other adjustments, including somewhat lower revenue growth rate assumptions for WPZ. And these are really being driven by a prolonged natural gas price assumption and some of the producers' reactions that we're seeing to that as we went through our September planning process, where we take in a lot of the input from a lot of our producers around our systems.","And I certainly want to let you know this really is across-the-board, that we're seeing this in areas that where the -- where we may -- where the producer themselves is heavily impacted by the gas prices. So some examples of that would be areas where we hold the keep-hole [ph] rights for natural gas drilling operations. And so the producers are not enjoying any of the uplift from the NGLs, and so, of course, they're responding to lower natural gas prices. Those, of course, would be mostly out west, where that would occur.","We also had some response in the Gulf Coast and then, to some degree, in the northeast. But we'll get into a little bit, the northeast. The good news, I would say, in the northeast is that the activities continue there. And for the most part, the activities, particularly in the Ohio Valley Midstream area, really have nothing to do with either prices or with the drilling results from the resources. Actually, those are coming in a little better than we thought. It's really just a delay in terms of the activity and our ability to get infrastructure into place there quickly.","So all in all, I would say the environment's pretty good. But I do think with our gas price assumption at $3.25, that's in our assumptions and planning around that, we do expect continued reduction in areas that are totally dependent on just the natural gas price.","So I do want to reaffirm our plans for a strong cash dividend growth where we're expecting a 50% -- 55% higher dividend in 2012 at WMB and, as well, the 20% growth in each 2013 and 2014, which would move our dividend to $1.20, $1.44 and $1.75, respectively.","Our stated policy of paying out WMB dividends for all of the distributions WMB receives from WPZ, less taxes, corporate interests and corporate CapEx. However, we also want investors to appreciate how committed we are at sustaining the great strength of WPZ for the long run and, of course, that's what the Geismar drop-down is all about, and it clearly shows the evidence of WMB's commitment to keeping WPZ healthy and making sure that the commodity hedge, the natural commodity hedge there is shared with WPZ and not just held with the WMB level.","So in that transaction, WMB is receiving nearly 43 million new WPZ LP units related to the Geismar drop-down. Assuming the strong WPZ cash distribution growth rate included in our guidance, WMB will see a significant increase in cash distributions from WPZ. This could result, of course, in an ultimately higher dividend growth rate from what we have forecasted right now for WMB. And certainly, if the forecasted pricing environment that we have out there, particularly around ethylene prices occurs, then we would certainly be in a position to further increase the dividend at WMB.","So a lot of questions around that as a lot of people have snapped to the fact that our cash distributions will go up significantly from that. And we've certainly been clear that we intend to maintain the policy. And I think our response to that is we certainly agree with that calculation, but we do have quite a bit of risk embedded in that pricing at WPZ. And so we don't really want to go out any further on that distribution being 2 years ahead of time in terms of the dividend at WMB. I do think we intend to be very sure and really work hard to maintain the distribution growth rate at WPZ, however, and some of the things that we might respond to if we did see a commodity collapse, it would pull us down -- pull that coverage down, of course, would be our ability to impact the GP IDRs that we receive. So we remain very committed to WPZ and the health of WPZ, and we think we've got a great model. And certainly, if the pricing environment occurs, we're going to be in great shape to continue to increase that dividend at WMB even further.","Of course, at the same time, WMB will no longer enjoy 100% of the cash flow and earnings it enjoys today. And as a result, you've seen a lowering of WMB's income guidance related to the non-controlling interest that arises in Geismar, once it's dropped into WPZ. So even though the cash flow piece of that looks stronger, the -- particularly with the capital burden being shifted over to WPZ, the earnings piece of that gets diluted by the issuance of -- to the WPZ LP unit holders.","Additionally, as I previously mentioned, we have some other updates to our guidance for '13 and '14, including lower revenue growth rates across most of our operating areas that are exposed to natural gas prices, as I mentioned. And although we have some fairly low natural gas price assumptions in place for '13 and '14, you really should not misconstrue that, that we have a lack of confidence in the natural gas market. And in fact, I would tell you, we're fairly bullish about the long-term demand that we continue to see build for natural gas. But we also have been impressed with the capabilities of natural gas producers here in the U.S. to continue to lower their cost of production, and so we're balancing that. We do think it'll take some time for a lot of the big capital that's coming on to build that demand. But long term, I would tell you we're very bullish on seeing this natural gas market continue to expand.","Finally, in the prerecorded podcast, we provided additional information about exciting new develops in our Canadian and Petchem Services businesses and updates on all of our end-guidance projects, most of which are fee based that really continue to demonstrate how Williams is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this long-term super cycle as a trusted name in the development, construction and operation of exactly the types of infrastructures needed to realize the full potential for producers and end users of natural gas, NGLs and olefins.","So with that, I'll open it up for your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Faisel Khan with Citigroup.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I think I understand your -- the lower guidance in '14. I just want to understand a little bit more, if you could, and I have a follow-up question. But on the guidance, it seems like your commodity price assumptions are roughly the same from the last time you issued guidance. And so the decrease in earnings seems like a meaningful decrease in volumes. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what the volume decrease you expect in '14 versus your previous guidance? And I understand it's because of low natural gas prices.","Alan S. Armstrong","Right. And I would just say this, Faisel, that really what we saw -- again, how our planning process works is that we start to pull that together in September, and we take in input from all across our systems, from producers' planned capital for the following year. Of course, it's in their best interests to have us educated on their plans as well because we've got to go build a lot of the infrastructure for those volumes. And so we've been going through that process in September, and I would just tell you that it's really across the board. And I would tell you if we thought gas prices were going to be $4.50 or $5 in '13 and -- and then we probably would have had a different perspective on that. But with our assumption of gas prices being at $3.25 for '13, with that assumption embedded, we'd have a hard time being more bullish than the producers in terms of their capital plans. And so we really basically took the capital plans from producers. Now remember, this was -- a lot of their ideas, of course, were formed over the summer when gas prices were even softer. So if we do see gas prices rebound, we probably would see some more activity and more rigs picked up. But, of course, then we would have to raise our gas -- natural gas price if we believed that. And that would -- of course, would come out of the margin for both the NGLs and the olefins margin. So I think there's a pretty good balance there. But in general, I would tell you that we gather a lot of gas. And there's just a lot of areas that are exposed to the natural gas price, and we're seeing drops in really all of our regions from what we had forecasted earlier in the year, based on producers' forecasts that we would have picked up in the first part of 2012.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then on the olefins business and the chemicals business. How are you guys thinking about the distributions at WPZ once you drop these assets in? I mean, will some of the distributions be a little bit more of a variable rate? Or were they -- will you have some base level of free cash flows that'll be distributed to unit holders and then the rest will be kind of discretionary sort of use of capital? How are you guys thinking about this cyclical business within WPZ?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, great question. And I would say that we do feel like we will need to maintain a coverage ratio there. Of course, one of the things that's heavily impacting our coverage ratio at PZ right now is the amount of growth and amount of equity that we've issued here in 2012. And so I would say that in a more normal environment, with not quite so much leverage to growth in that balance sheet, that we would expect to be seeing higher coverage ratios, despite even with these lower NGL prices that we're -- that we saw here in the third quarter. So bottom line is we intend to maintain a coverage ratio there at WPZ and try to let the swings. Good news is, is that there's a lot of cash flow in WPZ, and we would expect to let that coverage absorb a lot of those swings. If that wasn't enough to absorb that, then our next move in a more dire environment would be to waive some of the GP IDR, if necessary, to maintain WPZ's health.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bradley Olsen with Tudor, Pickering.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just to follow up on Faisel's question about the volume growth assumptions that go into your guidance. How -- you mentioned kind of broadly lower gas volumes across geographies. Would you say that this volume change is enough to impact your longer-term 5 Bcf a day estimate in terms of gas that you handle in the Marcellus?","Alan S. Armstrong","It certainly could in some areas. I would tell you the areas that are the drier gas are most likely to be the larger part of that impact. On OBM, I would say there might be some delays there. But currently, we're actually increasing that a little bit above, in the near term here, from what we had in our September -- sorry, in our June forecast for that. So it's really those areas that are just dependent on dry gas volumes and OBM, I would say, to the degree, that is lowered a little bit. That's going to be from just delays in getting the infrastructure and the drilling activity occurring there. But we certainly are very excited about what we continue to see in the OBM area, in terms of the producers' economics and their activities and the resource there.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And as far -- in the Midstream side of the business at WPZ, it looked like the OpEx, which had ticked up in the second quarter, was kind of flat sequentially. And I was wondering if there are items in there which are transitory in nature, or whether we're looking at maybe a kind of higher go-forward operating cost in that business.","Rory Lee Miller","This is Rory. I'd say for the near term, across Midstream on operating expenses, we're probably pretty flat with '12. And so in terms of thinking about a run rate -- now that's probably a comment that I'm making for '13. But we're expecting to be fairly flat with '12 for '13, and then after that, there may be some growth.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just one last question. Could you -- I realize that some of the petrochemical pipelines are making their way down to PZ, in conjunction with the Geismar drop-down. But there -- are there additional assets, as part of this Exxon asset package, that you've acquired, which will remain at WMB for the time being? And maybe if you could just give a breakdown of what percentage of those assets sit at PZ versus MB, that would be great.","Donald R. Chappel","This is Don. I could just mention that the assets that we announced, the petrochemical assets that we acquired from Exxon, will be owned at the Williams level for the time being. We felt that Williams had more financial capacity to hold those assets while they're being developed than PZ did, given the already large array of growth opportunities that PZ was holding. So that was the primary reason we moved that to Williams rather than WPZ. But that remains a drop-down opportunity that PZ will likely enjoy at a future date.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Maybe just thinking about the commodity exposure here at the WMB level and the increased investments in Canada. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about the mix of maybe adding more commodity sensitivity with those additional investments, rather than -- and then kind of how you're thinking about what the cash otherwise you could do if there's tax issues with bringing it back, and maybe that's part of the reason why you're -- that you're driving more investments in Canada.","Donald R. Chappel","Just -- this is Don again. I would say that, again, for us to bring back $500 million, our cash tax rate would be about 50%, so about $250 million of that would be paid to the IRS. So that's a pretty -- a lot of value leakage. And the good news is we have some opportunities in Canada that we think are very strong with very high rates of returns. So if we look at that versus the opportunities here in the U.S., we just see -- despite the fact there's some commodity volatility, we just have higher hurdle rate on those projects, such that even in a low-commodity price environment, they're still very attractive investments. And in a more of an expected case, it's very strong. And when you compare that to paying all that cash tax and bringing it back and investing it in an opportunity here in the U.S., that the Canadian investment, despite the fact it's in commodity-sensitive businesses, tends to be something that we're interested in. I think the one area that we're exploring is PDH. And again, we think that propane in Canada is likely to be under tremendous pressure, and the margins on that business will likely be very strong.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful.","Alan S. Armstrong","I would add to that on the -- this is Alan. I would add to that as well that the -- for instance, the CNRL business, the ethane contract that supports that does have a floor for the ethane that's at a cost of service pricing for the ethane. So there is some contractual support for that risk that we're taking in that expansion up there, for both the new ethane capital that we're investing, as well as the CNRL expansion.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great, got it. That's great. And can you talk a little bit on the price that you came to for Geismar? It's -- you could argue it's something of a low multiple for WPZ to pay. Just kind of how you're thinking was coming to that price.","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. I think the multiple is always dependent on the amount of pricing risk and where you are, at a peak or a trough, and certainly, that is a build-out of a business. And so today's pricing, of course, if it was a steady, already-existing asset that didn't have a lot of growth in it, would deserve a higher multiple for those more sure cash flows. But I think with the pricing assumption, we -- that is our best guess at the pricing assumption that's out there. But nevertheless, that is a peak relative to the market, and so we don't think it would deserve such a high multiple. So a lot of -- as you can imagine, a lot of interesting debate amongst the conflicts committee to WPZ, and it's -- the folks that support that, as well as internally here. But we think we really hit the right spot, for both WMB and WPZ, in that transaction.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sure. And then you touched on it a little bit. But maybe talk through a little bit more of your assumptions on the price forecast. I'm particularly interested in natural gas at $3.25. It looks like the forward curve is closer to $4 for '13. And then on ethylene, you've got this big jump in '14 going from $0.50 a pound to $0.63. Kind of what's driving both of those forecasts in your guidance?","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. On the gas price, I'll hit that first. I think the gas price yesterday is coming off for year about $3.90 or so, up for '13. And, of course, that's been moving around quite a bit. I would just tell you, we certainly hope that. I think for the health of the industry, that's a good thing. But we continue to see supplies grow. And, in fact, our forecast of lower volume rates is not showing up currently in our growth rates. It's continuing to grow. And so we think that a lot of the demand that we picked up over the summer, obviously, was very price-dependent growth, and you can argue whether that price is $3.50 or $3.75 or $3.25. You can argue as to where that price that kicks coal out and brings gas in, but it's certainly not $4 from our vantage point. And so I think -- we think that, that low that we saw in the natural gas price is pretty temporary and is very price driven. So we continue to be impressed with the kind of drilling and growth around our systems as we sit here today. But we think, eventually, that's got to moderate, and obviously, that's the -- our reaction to it. On the ethylene price, I would just tell you that the -- what we saw in the -- what we continue to see is really a response between crude oil and ethane. As you get into '14, we're actually completely -- or almost completely neutral to ethane prices and, in fact, a little bit short ethane. So if our ethane price is wrong, that'll just show up in ethylene price, but we're really just driving that ethylene price off of CMAI forecast and oil prices then. So that's the best intelligence that we have based on the markets that we're seeing out there.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","A couple of questions. First, I apologize I -- there were some competing calls today. But I just want to clarify, the $600 million segment profit plus DD&A for the drop-down is a proportional number?","Donald R. Chappel","Yes.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","That's great. And, Don, can I stay with you for a minute? Speaking of taxes that have been discussed, can you speak to what the tax rate might be on the LP distributions from PZ? Would that be changing at all with the olefins drop-down? And also, would there be any potential, over time, as you invest more CapEx and get more depreciation in Canada for that 50% tax you alluded to, to come down?","Donald R. Chappel","I would say that our cash tax rate moves around a bit depending on when assets were placed in service, minimum tax, a lot of variables there. It moves around a bit. I think from a planning standpoint on this slide, we have it here in our dividend illustration. We've kind of normalized it at about a 25% rate on the distributions from WPZ. Some years would be higher, some are lower. We've normalized it, therefore, to take some of the volatility out of it. I would note that when we issue equity, including in the Geismar transaction, our effective tax rate goes up. Because in effect, to the extent that we issue units to the public, there's an embedded gain there from a tax standpoint. So it's pretty complex subject. But I think the way we've modeled it here, I think is generally representative with some volatility. I think you'll some years it could come in sub-20 and some could approach 30%. As to Canada, we've got a negative basis in our foreign assets. And so the issue there is that to bring cash across the border would trigger a gain, and that's a pretty substantial gain at this time.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Since they've never been taxed with U.S. authorities, when you reinvest money in the new projects in Canada, do you get credit for that when you bring it back?","Donald R. Chappel","No. I mean, it's -- it comes down to tax basis in all of our international assets. And again, we've got some legacy European and Venezuelan tax positions, so it's a big ball that includes a lot of legacy stuff. So it's going to take some time to unwind that. There is a -- we do have an embedded 25% tax rate in Canada. So we are providing taxes and paying Canadian taxes at about a 25% rate on Canadian income. But it's really that cash balance that we have sitting in Canada or the cash that we might generate is still working against a negative tax basis.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And my last question, Alan, there were some questions around the changes in expected gathering with natural gas volumes. You alluded to trying to be a little conservative, especially as maybe CPG fuel switching eases off a bit and suggested that some of the numbers may change. If you're rolling [ph] to a high side, maybe the volumes will be greater. My question is many producers that have alternatives are saying even at $4 gas, they're not going back and turning on the spigot. Because they make just so much more money on the liquids part of the plays that they have, that there's a limited amount of capital and they just can't see putting it towards dry gas. And you all have mentioned him even the Marcellus, that some of the prolific dry gas areas are easing off, even though there's probably very respectable returns at some of those very good wells today. Can you speak to whether you really think the volumes will necessarily follow price?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, that's a great question and one that we obviously wrestle with around here on a regular basis, and I honestly think it is very dependent on producers' capability. Certainly, not all these basins are created equal. There's quite a bit differentiation from one -- even in Susquehanna County, I will tell you, there's a pretty big spread in one part of the county versus others. And as well, I would tell you that some producers are better than others at getting their costs down and, as well, there's a major variability in terms of what their other options might be and what they're invested in. And so I would just say it's not as -- the market's not perfectly efficient in that regard. It is, remarkably, to -- from my vantage point, sometimes I always marvel at how efficient it is, particularly this summer, the kind of a pickup we saw with low natural gas price on the demand side. But in the producer side, it's not -- not everybody has the same number of options about where they might take the rigs, and some are more invested in others in getting their cost structure down in an area. And so we certainly saw that with our previous ownership of WPX in the Piceance, where they had a very low-cost structure in the Piceance. And we certainly see that in the Marcellus, with some players having a much lower cost structure and a -- and lower cash cost than others. So I would just tell you, it's pretty variable out there, and I think it's hard to draw it with a broad brush. And so that's not the way we do it. We do it kind of from a building it from a ground-up perspective based on all the different input we get from producers in each of our areas, and so that's really the -- how we come up with that.","Operator","Your next question will come from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo Securities.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just wanted to get your thoughts on what's an appropriate coverage ratio for WMB and WPZ longer term? Are you thinking about, I guess, the figures you outlined in 2014, meaning 1.2x for WMB and 1.1x for WPZ?","Donald R. Chappel","Sharon, it's Don. I would say it's a complete function of business mix and commodity prices and the growth rate. Because again, as Alan mentioned earlier, in the near term, we're burdened with an extraordinary growth rate. We're financing a lot of growth, and that means more units out, more interest expense, with little cash flow. But if you look at '14 and you look at the ethylene price, you can bury that ethylene price and you're going to get a of lot different coverage. You can move gas price, and you're going to get much different coverage. So I think it's really a function of what you assume on prices. So the 1.23 is built off the price assumptions we have here, price and margin and all the other assumptions. So if you have lower margin assumptions, you'll get lower coverage. If you have higher, you'll get higher. But again, I think it's going to be variable. Coverage would be variable based on where we are in a commodity cycle and a number of other factors.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess looking at your 2013 guidance for the low end, are you comfortable at this point in terms of continue to deliver growth at WPZ and distributions and have a negative coverage, given the cash flow visibility in 2014? Can you maybe just talk about that?","Donald R. Chappel","I'd say we still have positive coverage in 2013 based on our guidance, though. Yes, we are comfortable. Obviously, there's business risks, including commodities that we'll face and there's upside opportunities. But at this point, we're comfortable with our guidance as being what we're certainly targeting, and we think that it's realistic.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess the last question's just any operational impact of Sandy on your northeast operations at this point in time?","Alan S. Armstrong","Frank, do you want to take that?","Frank J. Ferazzi","Yes, I'll -- this is Frank Ferazzi. I'll take that question. We did lose purchased power in many of our compressor stations in New York and New Jersey and parts of Pennsylvania. But at those stations, we have backup generation capability that's powered by natural gas. So there's no disruption to flows. We do have our LNG facility that's located close to the water. And so we anticipated that we may get some minor flooding, and that did, in fact, happen. So in anticipation of that, we took the facility down on Sunday. We did, in fact, get some water. But once the facility dried down and we pumped a couple of feet of water away, we're not expecting any permanent damage there. No leaks on the system, no other disruptions in flow. And so I think on balance, we fared remarkably well. We're going to have to remove some trees from the right of way, some fences were blown down. But again, no permanent damage to the facilities and no disruption in flow.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","On the gas pipelines, it just looks like the EBITDA's a little bit -- or the EBIT's just coming in a little bit lower than, at least, we were expecting despite some double-digit increases in throughput. Can you talk about what you see going on in that business? And then just given where you are year-to-date, do you still think you're going to meet the low end of your guidance?","Richard Rodekohr","Yes. Becca, this is Rick Rodekohr. In the third quarter, we did see some higher expenses at our gas pipelines. Those were driven principally by the Pipeline Safety Act. As you know, we have to complete testing on our system by the end of 2012. So we're certainly on track to do that. But as we get near the end of that period, we did have some higher integrity and testing costs that we did see in the third quarter. And then, we also saw some higher benefit costs related to our pensions and our post-retiree medical expenses. So those were the primary drivers, I think, of the lower results in the third quarter. We are on track to hit the guidance that we have given for 2012.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","That would -- I mean, that would imply a really big fourth quarter of close to $200 million versus $178 million a year ago. So what's really driving that?","Richard Rodekohr","Well, we have some additional revenues from expansion projects that we put in service earlier in 2012. So we'll get revenues from there. And then we do have some projects that we look at expensing those dollars until they reach a level of probability. And so to the extent that we have some projects that move down the development path, we'd have some opportunities to reverse some expenses there as well.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Got you. And then on the Caiman Utica JV, any status updates on that?","Alan S. Armstrong","This is Alan. I would just say there's a lot going on there. We're not in a position to announce anything new on there, but very pleased with the opportunities that are coming forward on that. So stay tuned on there.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then, on shared services, you guys talked about a new shared services undertaking in your second quarter 10-Q and then had a charge for reorganization in the third quarter. Is there more to come on that? And what kind of benefit do you see to Williams as a result of this?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, great question, Becca. There has been a lot of efforts around the organization on that. And frankly, we were responding to overhead costs as one item that came at us from the spin-off of WPX and so trying to make sure that our overhead costs are in line with the size of the company and the complexity of the company today. And so we are going through a process of taking out some layers of management across the organization. But as well, I would tell you, very much on the positive side, we are bringing a lot of alignment and a lot of focus around our engineering and construction capabilities, as well as getting the customer voice from all of these various areas right up to the leadership table and getting that as close to our actions as possible. So a lot of very positive things coming out of this where we're really trying to get more of our resources focused on our areas of opportunity. And when I say that, I'm talking about people resources that are really focused on where our frontline opportunities, whether it's growing out our business on the E&C side or being able to be very responsive to customers' needs, as this infrastructure build-out continues to really amaze us; in fact, in terms the amount of demands and opportunities that are in front of us. So we're really trying to position the organization to be more responsive to the kind of build-out that's ahead of us and we continue to enjoy.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Do you have a financial impact in terms of incremental savings or incremental costs?","Alan S. Armstrong","We have not. We don't have a final number to put forward on that yet, Becca.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then finally, on EBITDA guidance. It looks for the base business, it's coming down, and you talked about the gathering volumes. But we're also seeing CapEx for the base business come up once we net out the numbers for Geismar. So what is that higher CapEx related to on the base business?","Alan S. Armstrong","Is this on WPZ, Becca? I didn't follow that.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Yes, yes. If you want, I can wait, announce that on the PC call.","Alan S. Armstrong","We'll get back to you on that, sorry. One item there, Becca, that I can think of that's in there is the gumbo [ph] acquisition and the capital that's driving that is a piece of that at Williams. And so...","Donald R. Chappel","Some of it is timing that we've shifted some capital from '12 to '13 and the timing of some other projects have moved around as well. So we'll dig out the detail here and advise you, if not on the call, after the call.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Carl Kirst of BMO Capital Markets.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just a quick question on the Petchem pipeline initiative. And I guess my question is, is since you guys have some of a first-mover advantage here, as we look at the return profile of that capital being deployed, should we be looking there in the sort of the return profile of a normal kind of fee-based contracted pipeline asset? Or is there the opportunity to earn perhaps significantly higher returns for that capital?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. Carl, good question. And I would -- we didn't get it -- given all the other moving parts we've had in this earnings call, we haven't had a chance to focus very much on that. But I think we've forecasted that in the past in terms of our bullishness around the need for infrastructure as the Petchem business grows out from all the new NGLs coming into the market there. And we are more convinced than ever that, that is the case, and there's going to be a lot of infrastructure. We've made 3 acquisitions from pipelines that we are converting the service on here in the last 10 months or so, and have been doing that fairly quietly as we want to make sure we've got the business contracted for that business. But in terms of return expectations, I can tell you that it does vary according to risk. But I would say probably, on average, it's between about 14% and 20% pretax returns on those capital investments.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time.","Alan S. Armstrong","Okay, great. I will close it up here. Thank you, all, very much for joining us. Very excited about our future. A lot of moving parts happening in this quarter.","And I want to reiterate that we are very committed to maintaining the health of WPZ as you -- as I think we've demonstrated with the Geismar drop-down. And frankly, we -- as we've been forecasting for quite some time, we were concerned and had been concerned about the ethane supply getting out and ahead of the cracker capacity. We certainly think our Geismar expansion is very timely and is going to be able to take great advantage of new ethane supplies ahead of -- in the other cracker expansions. And so -- but we think eventually the petchem market is going to respond to the huge amount of NGLs that producers are going after today.","So we're excited to be in this space and excited about the growth opportunities that are out for us, really across-the-board in our business today. So really feel very good about the growth prospects that lie before us in the company. And we've got a lot of to execute on, but very confident in our team's ability to do that.","So with that, we'll close it up. And once again, thank you very much, and good luck in your recovery, if you've been impacted by Hurricane Sandy. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at any time. Thank you, and have a great day."],"22995":["The Williams Cos., Inc. (NYSE:WMB) Q2 2016 Earnings Call August  2, 2016  9:30 AM ET","Executives","John D.

Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to The Williams and Williams Partners Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John D. Porter - Head-Investor Relations","Yeah. Thanks, Keith. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include yesterday's press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily.","Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions, and we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Central; and Jim Scheel leads the Northeast Gathering & Processing area.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","There are a lot of calls today. So we're planning on keeping our call to about an hour. If we miss any of your questions, feel free to follow up with Investor Relations later on today.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're certainly glad to have you here this morning. And we've got quite a bit of information to go through, and we do have a tight timeline. So I'll try to move through this pretty quickly and then turn it over to Don for some comments, and I'll come back and close.","So I'd like to start off today just telling you something I'm very proud of relative to Williams, and really that is how this organization has stuck together and despite a lot of the upstairs issues and a lot of the distractions has remained very focused on executing our strategy, which our entire team is very excited about and just couldn't be more proud of the way the organization has really rallied and is absolutely all in on executing what we think is by far the best strategy in the industry. And so this focus that we've had certainly showed up here in the second quarter and we continue to see some great execution on all these projects that we have coming to fruition and tremendous amount of work going on up and down the system right now, particularly, on the Transco system, as we expand that out to meet all the growing demands there.","So I would tell you that as well in addition to the employee base, I would tell you very thankful for the board and their commitment and very active engaged board right now, working very hard, overseeing the execution of our plan and our strategy and very much appreciate their engagement as well.","So the plan for today's call is to walk you through our strong second quarter results and then discuss our execution on key initiatives and growth projects. Don Chappel will discuss the immediate measures that we're implementing to enhance value, strengthen the WPZ credit profile and fund a significant portfolio of really big large scale fee-based projects and all while maintaining flexibility to review financial and operational plans.","So we're going to \u2013 these measures, you'll see as we go through the DRIP program for Williams Partners. And as you've seen in our earnings release, we're also announcing a dividend reduction at Williams and the new level of our dividend will allow Williams to retain about $1.3 billion annually and that will be reinvested back into Williams Partners. So really think this is a great answer for bringing us the right cost of capital to go invest against all these great growth projects that we have as the natural gas market and the demand side continues to expand out.","Moving on to slide two here, we'll talk about the quarter. As you'll recall, in the first quarter of the year, we launched several actions to address the realities that we had as we saw a lot slower growth going on in the key supply areas as the demand side was building out, but the production side really was starting to see some pretty reduced activity even in the best basins here in the nation.","So, as a result of that, we really focused on two things that we talked about in the first quarter. One was our asset sales, and we talked about getting our asset sales done with in excess of $1 billion in asset sales, and we also talked about cost reductions. We made great progress on both of those in the quarter. First of all, we expect here in the third quarter now to finalize an agreement to sell the Canadian business, and the expected proceeds on that in excess of $1 billion, as we told you, and in addition to that, Williams Partners' share of that sale is expected to be in excess of $800 million.","On the cost side, really terrific execution on the team's part here, and we went after those costs right at the end of the first quarter. We took some action. We continue to take action across the organization and showing up here pretty dramatically, here in the second quarter, with $55 million lower O&M and G&A expenses than we had in the second quarter of 2015. And I would tell you that's even on top of the growth in our business. And so we've certainly been adding assets and growing the business, and despite that we were able to bring our costs in. We continue to find opportunities to reduce costs further and so we're really excited about the way the organization has responded and the great progress on this front.","And more importantly for our investors, we're pleased to deliver the adjusted EBITDA at WPZ of $1.065 billion. And this was about a 6% increase over the second quarter of last year, and this is the now fifth quarter in a row delivering adjusted EBITDA of more than $1 billion. And so, certainly, despite the challenging market conditions, our business of moving natural gas continues to expand, and we continue to take advantage of that.","We also had strong quarterly performance in our distributable cash flow at WPZ, which came in at $737 million, which was up 5% from the same quarter last year. And very importantly, our cash distribution coverage was 1.02 here in the second quarter, which is exactly what it was in the first quarter of 2016 as well.","So I mentioned back in May that Williams has delivered a strong \u2013 a long string of quarters with year-over-year increases in what we now refer to as adjusted EBITDA. We used to call it segment profit plus DD&A. But if you look to that and compare it into the prior year's quarter, we now have 11 consecutive quarters where we've shown improvement in that. And that, of course, is despite a pretty significant decline in unit commodity margins over this period. Of course, that's been driven by our fee-based revenue growth and our ability to continue to control cost in this environment.","So with that, let me highlight some of the strong performance delivered from the operating areas this quarter. I'd note that all five of our areas are showing year-to-date improvement and, however, here just starting with the quarter, you can see Atlantic Gulf actually came in a little bit lower than the second quarter of last year. But I would tell you this is really for good reason and according to plans as we had a month-long shutdown of the Gulfstar tie facility, which allowed us to get the Gunflint tieback made.","That tieback was made \u2013 done very safely. We had over 1 million hour, man-hours of work, making that tie-in, and we had zero reportable incidents on that effort. So great job by the team getting that work done safely. And here, as we look into the third quarter, we're going to enjoy both the Tubular Bells facility coming back or Tubular Bells Field coming back on Gulfstar as well as Gunflint, and we also enjoyed Kodiak a bit for the quarter, but we'll see that come back here as well.","Moving onto the Central and Northeast and West, really going to combine all three of these because it's really kind of the same story. Steady as she goes business and the improvements were primarily driven by the team's ability to go after costs during the period. So continued very, very well positioned as the natural gas market start to pull on these areas, but nice to see the growth at 5%, 8%, and 2% better in the Central, Northeast, and West, again, driven mostly by lower cost and volumes holding up very well despite the pressures on gas prices. So a great job of the teams continuing to operate low cost and in a safe manner.","In the NGL & Petchem area, our second quarter GAAP results were affected by a held-for-sale non-cash impairment related to our Canadian assets, and we reported $419 million decrease in segment performance as measured by modified EBITDA.","But as we look at the adjusted EBITDA, that actually increased by $47 million or a 142%, which reflected the higher fee-based revenues. That was a lot driven by the Horizon project coming on up in Canada, olefins margins and lower operating costs in this segment as well. Geismar actually saw a very strong operational production levels and we did have a little bit of lower ethylene prices during the quarter, but our sales volumes, you'll know, were quite a bit lower or lower than our production volumes if you get into the details there.","And so we did hold back some inventory during the quarter as we expected the ethylene prices to improve in the third quarter due to a number of extended outages on turnarounds from a lot of the competing plants in the Gulf Coast. And we're fortunate enough to have called that right and we have seen a price improvement here in the third quarter. And of course, that benefit will show up here as we sell off some of that inventory from 2Q in 3Q.","Moving on to slide four, every quarter we review a list of our key milestones and, for me and the leadership team as well, it's an opportunity to highlight how the teams across Williams are executing. And if you're a regular participant on these calls, you know we just keep adding milestones quarter-after-quarter. So let's take a quick look at the 2Q list. And I would tell you this list, as I said, just keeps expanding in terms of the number of opportunities off Transco.","We did receive FERC approval for the Garden State Project and so this is to increase some new demand in New Jersey, the New York Bay Expansion, and that's an expansion right on top of our Rockaway Lateral last year, another expansion on that for $115 million a day, and we did receive FERC approval for that as well. Virginia Southside II which is serving a major new gas-fired power generation complex there in Virginia, and Virginia Southside I is in service. This is another expansion on that project as well already and we received FERC approval for that during the quarter.","The Northeast Supply Enhancement, really exciting project, really big investment for us, and that's $400 million a day expansion that's going to continue to take on new gas demands up in the very far northern reaches of our system. And so, we did close a binding open season on that. That project's moving ahead, again a very large investment for us.","And then in addition to that, we have a lot of projects that are ongoing. We have the Gulf Trace project that is under construction, and construction is going very well on that. That's mostly a Louisiana area project. We also expect here in the very near future FERC approval for the Dalton lateral. So that's a big lateral that goes from the southern part of Atlanta up to the very northern reaches of Georgia, and we expect to begin construction on that in the fourth quarter. So lots of new things going on here in terms of construction across all of these projects. And our cost reductions are ahead of plan as I mentioned earlier, and we're continuing to find even more ways to increase those cost savings.","In terms of coming soon, things that will drive us here in the near term, happy to report that our Rock Springs facility, another expansion off of Transco to a power plant in Maryland. That was brought in service August 1. Most of that work was done, completed back in the second quarter, but per the contract, ready to go in service here now August 1 and is in service.","On the Gunflint tieback as I mentioned, that's \u2013 really will drive our third quarter pretty substantially, and so we're excited about that. And so we also have, I would tell you, some other drivers here for the third quarter. We'll get a full quarter of Kodiak up and flowing. We also are enjoying the \u2013 some additional incremental volumes that came onto our system as a result of the Pascagoula plant outage, and so we'll see a nice improvement on influx of volumes into our Mobile Bay systems as well for that period. So a lot of great things that are coming together here for the third quarter.","Moving on to slide five, this is just a look now at really the \u2013 some of the big investments that we've got going on and you can kind of see by year how those pile up. So a lot of what I just mentioned, but this kind of shows what it looks like in terms of cumulative capital that will be placed in service.","And so, I think the really big takeaway that investors should have here is this is very clear and identifiable growth in our business that's coming from all these fully-contracted projects. So we've got a couple of billion dollars this year, a little over $3 billion next year, and about two-thirds, a little more than two-thirds of that is coming from these big regulated projects and they are going to really drive growth well beyond 2017.","So, next I'm going to turn it over here to Don to talk about the new program, the new financing plans. But before I do, I just want to remind you, it really is important that our investors understand how critical the expansion of natural gas markets are to our strategy, and we are very confident that that's occurring, certainly all the projects that we've listed on Transco. But we think those are going to continue to come and are going to come on the backs of low-price natural gas and, ultimately, all of that demand pull is going to pull out of the great basins that we're exposed to on the supply side. So I would say for the next couple of years the growth is going to be coming largely from the demand side, but when that demand shows up the volumes have to flow behind that and we're extremely well positioned to capture that on the back end.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about our new financing plan.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Thanks, Alan, and good morning. I'll just run through the slide six fairly quickly. It hits a number of the points included in our press release. And again, these actions were designed to enhance value at both WPZ and WMB and strengthen the credit profile and maintain investment grade ratings at WPZ as well as fund the significant portfolio of fee-based growth projects at Williams Partners.","It totals about $5 billion in the 2016-2017 timeframe with the vast majority of that being Transco related. So first, Williams announced that it planned to reinvest $1.7 billion in WPZ through 2017. That reinvestment is funded by retaining cash flow that was previously paid out in the form of a dividend.","The dividend reduction totals $1.3 billion annually, a 69% reduction, and the new dividend level at $0.80 represents about a 3.5% yield in terms of where we've been trading here the last couple of days and we think that's a level we'll continue to attract investors that are interested in a meaningful dividend. WPZ will maintain its current $0.85 per quarter, or $3.40 annual, dividend through 2017 and then expect to resume some level of distribution growth in 2018.","As I mentioned, we expect our actions to significantly improve the credit profile, again, with $1.3 billion of cash being retained by Williams and reinvested into WPZ. That is a very strong credit positive that we think the agencies and debt investors will take note of.","The estimated growth capital \u2013 let me back up here a second, again, that will reduce the external funding needs for WPZ. It will enable deleveraging at both WMB and WPZ and really targeting having WPZ below 4.5 times by 2018 and, again, with a commitment to maintain those investment grade ratings at WPZ.","And, again, I mentioned the $5 billion of growth capital, which is $1.9 billion in 2016 and about $3.1 billion in 2017, with 68% and 77% in 2016 and 2017 respectively, related to Transco. So we're delighted to have the ability to grow our Transco franchise anchored with demand payments with strong counterparties and we think that will add a lot of value over time.","WPZ intends to fund the growth by a number of means here, as Alan mentioned. We plan to sell the Canadian assets during 2016, plan to sign and announce in the third quarter and close the transaction in the second half of this year with combined proceeds to PZ and MB totaling more than $1 billion and PZ share being more than $800 million. We're establishing a distribution reinvestment program, or DRIP program, that will be available for all common unitholders, and we're hopeful that we get some public participation in that. And Williams does plan to reinvest $1.7 billion into WPZ through 2017.","The third quarter distribution that Williams receives will be reinvested in WPZ via a private placement transaction because the DRIP program is not going to be available quickly enough, and then the contributions or the reinvestment thereafter will be through the DRIP program.","WPZ would also plan to access the public equity market to the extent it has a need through its ATM program or other means as well as access to public debt market, also as needed. And, again, to the extent that we get public participation in the DRIP program, that would reduce the need for ATM or other equity.","I'll pause there and turn it back to Alan.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Great. Thank you, Don. And so just a few things to wrap up here real quick before we go to questions. Certainly, I don't think there's any argument around the industry that we hold the premier natural gas asset base in the nation and we see that continuing to deliver growing fee-based revenues. The fee-based revenues now is about 93% of WPZ's gross margin, and you're going to continue to see that grow. And so we're excited to see that, again, first on the demand side and then pulling the supply basins along with it.","With the financial measures that we've announced, we'll be driving significant reinvestment at WPZ, and that's going to stabilize the investment grade ratings and improve the coverage at PZ as well. And so we certainly are on a path to continue delivering steady growing result for our investors. And I want to say once again before we close here just how pleased I am with our organization.","I'd tell you the team really does understand our strategy, they understand what's critical to us, and really lots of energy around the organization right now excited about showing what we're made of and showing how we can deliver against this exciting strategy and plan and execute on this multi-billion-dollar project backlog that's going to continue to drive our growth, especially along our big interstate pipelines here for the next couple of years. And we believe that our natural gas focused strategy has positioned Williams as the company for long-term steady growth.","And so with that, thank you again for joining us, and we'll move on to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We'll go first to Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the detail today. I wanted to start with the $250 million that MB will be buying. How should we think about the price at which WMB will be buying that and the private placement of the common unit? And is the parent primarily funding this with the $200 million, give or take, of proceeds, of its portion from the Canadian asset sale?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Christine, good morning. The discount is something we're not prepared to speak to today, but I would say it will be in the range of customary discounts. We think it will be attractive to WPZ. We're unable to talk about the DRIP program today because we would be getting ahead of our registration statement. So we'll have to be patient on that. And our intention would be to have a discount that is consistent with the discount that would be available to the public once the registration statement and the DRIP program are activated. As to the $250 million of cash, or the $200 million of cash in the current quarter, that would be funded from the WPZ distribution or the Canadian asset proceeds.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then the DRIP program, like you guys say, goes through 2017, how confident are you that this won't have to be extended, especially in the event Atlantic Sunrise is delayed from the late 2017 in-service date? Is this generally something you're comfortable with because the CapEx generally drops off in 2018? Just some thoughts there would be helpful.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Christine. First, I'll just say that, again, Atlantic Sunrise is currently moving along as planned, but if there were a delay, that would also significantly reduce the capital spend in those periods as well. So you'd see some reduction in DRIP program requirements or equity requirements just generally. As to 2018, we're not providing any kind of guidance on 2018 today, so again I'll ask that you be somewhat patient on that.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, I guess if I was to go by what you said and continue to operate under the assumption that Atlantic Sunrise does come in on time, then it does look like you guys may have to rely on the ATM just given the big CapEx next year. And the WPZ cost of equity is still pretty high. A lot of your peers have gotten rid of the GP in some way, shape, or form, whether it's the parent buying in the LP or the LP buying in GP. Can we just get some updated thoughts from you guys on this trend and whether or not at some point you will have to evaluate the same in order to be competitive with these peers?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","You know what I would say today that I think we announced a series of actions today, but in terms of other potential actions, we always are looking at other possibilities, structure change or otherwise, and you've seen us take a number of actions in the past and we'll continue to evaluate the possibilities again as we continue to move forward. So I wouldn't rule anything out, but at the current time I'd focus on the actions we've taken and we really don't have any commentary really on anything else that we're looking at.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you for the color.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Thanks, Christine.","Operator","We'll go next to Jean Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Just a couple of quick ones. Can you provide an estimate of the EBITDA from the Canadian assets for sale? I know it's very sensitive to NGL prices, but a range would be helpful.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Jean, I don't think we have disclosed that. I can tell you that in the current environment that there's not a tremendous amount of cash flow there in the current environment with propane being so heavily depressed there in Canada. Of course, that was the purpose of the PDH project, was to take advantage of that, but it's not a meaningful amount of EBITDA here in 2016.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. And can you say how much CapEx you've put into the PDH plant so far?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","I don't think we've singled that out yet.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'm sorry, Jean, I don't think we've disclosed that, and we're right in the middle of that sales process or getting that finalized. So I'd prefer not to disclose that. Thank you.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. No, no problem. And then, as a follow-up, a number of news reports have come out that Chesapeake is close to selling their Barnett assets. Have you had any discussions with them about what it would mean for their midstream agreements there?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","I would just say we're always working with Chesapeake on ways to improve our relationship with them, and certainly we're interested in trying to get the drill bit to work there in the Barnett, which would improve volume today we have those MVCs that protect our cash flows there, but certainly would like to see the drilling activity and development activity increase there. So we are working with Chesapeake, we always are working with Chesapeake on ways to improve that, but we're not in position to be able to disclose anything on that today.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay, great. That's all for me. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks and good morning. As you guys sort of think about the dividend in 2018, should we think about the potential rebasing as something that is gradual off of the $0.80 number or will you sort of have a hard rebasing at that point?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Danilo, I don't think we have much in the way of guidance there, but certainly several factors. WPZ expects to increase its distribution somewhat by 2018. Obviously, we're not quantifying that today. And then, secondly, over time we would expect the reinvestment to diminish or be eliminated and a combination of factors will be considered as Williams determines what its dividend will look like. So, again, really not in a position to provide any guidance on that today, but I think it'll be something that we look at all the factors and make a decision as we got closer to that time period.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. And just to clarify on your Canadian asset sales, are those proceeds after-tax?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Those are pre-tax proceeds. We do not expect a tax burden in light of the high tax basis on those assets.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Last question for me. You guys realized a lot of cost savings during the quarter. Can you quantify how much you expect to realize here for the balance of the year and maybe also even through 2017?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. Thank you for the question. We do think that the level that we have now is sustainable. These are not kind of one-time, these are more systemic kind of cost reductions. Our head count from the first of the year is down about 12% and our team has done a really great job on the supply chain side of things of lowering our costs there as well. So these are things we've worked hard to not just \u2013 not as simple as just head count reduction, but also process improvements across the organization. And we do think that we're reducing costs in a way that's sustainable. And we are looking for some things to simplify the organization looking forward as well. And so we're hopeful to continue to improve on the cost savings beyond what we have today as we get into 2017.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","A couple of questions. I guess, the first one is kind of a multi-part question, but when you think about restarting the dividend in 2018, is there a net debt to EBITDA target on a consolidated basis that you have to achieve first, or do you just sort of think that the way you \u2013 if you're on the right glide path, that that would allow you to restart that?","And then, secondly, is it only going to be dividend increase, or are you thinking about share buybacks? And then, finally, would you be interested in calling some of the WMB debt, or would there be premium issues and so forth? I was wondering if you can sort of talk about that in context together?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Yeah, a lot of questions there. I would say that we would like to, again, hold WPZ at investment grade stable levels. We would like Williams to be not more than two notches lower than that, and also have Williams credit profile strengthening as well such that Williams begins to come back to investment grade levels over a multi-year timeframe here as well.","Having said that, I think we would certainly be looking at all of our options, but at this point, I would say that we would look at all the options, whether it's dividend, share buyback or debt reduction. But again, I think we'll have to see exactly what the facts and circumstances look like, what's the best use of capital as we approach 2018. I think right now we've got a pretty clear path and plan through 2017. But 2018, I think we don't want to get ahead of ourselves and really start to lay out too much until we get a little further down the road.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then as a follow-up, and I realize you guys have been very busy and announced a lot today, but when you think about Geismar in terms of the options that you have for it right now, what is the appetite in the marketplace right now for a tolling arrangement? When I think about the amount of M&A that we've seen in the chemical sector, some of them seem to be short ethylene capacity. Do you see yourself signing a potentially longer term tolling arrangement with one of those guys or when you think about the M&A appetite that's out there for chem assets, do you think about possibly selling Geismar as well, too?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I would say that we certainly are exploring what the tolling market looks like out there. We've kind of done that almost piecemeal in the past, kind of one customer at a time and we are looking at doing more of a process. Really if you think about, there's really two groups that would be the counterparties of those tolling agreements. One would be the market. So the parties that are selling the ethylene and have that supply, and that's a fairly consolidated group on the river.","And then on the other side of that you had a multitude of buyers that really are dependent on Williams as a merchant provider in that market. So that's the downstream derivative buyers. And so we really are trying to determine which party is the better counterparty for us on that between the supply side versus the market side of that. So I would say we've moved from doing that in a kind of \u2013 I wouldn't \u2013 in a piecemeal manner, one party at a time, to kind of looking at it in a more aggregated process, and so we will be pushing ahead on that for the balance of the year.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, finally, there was an earlier question about the Barnett and Chesapeake. It's my understanding that the recent activity in the Barnett is more about an oil target. Would that be a benefit to you longer term? I was wondering if you can sort of talk into context as to what the targets are there and why folks would be interested in potentially acquiring the asset?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I really couldn't help you too much. I think the window that's there is primarily a gas window that we're involved with, with Chesapeake and the acreage that we have. But there's just a lot of \u2013 if you think about how old a lot of those completions were versus modern technology today, there is a lot of improvements that don't require the kind of capital to drill, but just a lot of improvements that can be done with everything that the industry has learned about completions. And so we think there's some pretty low-cost incremental gas production to come out of the basin. And so we think putting ourselves in a position where we're helping encourage that is good for us long term. And so those are the kind of things that I think we would be looking for, for that basin.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Just on the CapEx guidance here, I just want to confirm, first of all, how much have you spent on Atlantic Sunrise, if anything? And then, do you have full completion of the project in your $3.1 billion through 2017?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let's see, on the capital, I don't think we've disclosed that. So we have spent money, it always takes a lot of money upfront on a project like that, and we've been very successful on the right-of-way acquisition piece of that. And so that's where the permitting and right-of-way acquisitions where majority of those dollars will go, but team's done a terrific job on that front and so we're doing very well on that.","In terms of the timing of the capital, certainly the $3 billion in 2017 includes Atlantic Sunrise. I will tell you that, as we've mentioned before, team is very focused on that 2017 in-service target. But I would tell from you a financial plan standpoint \u2013 I think this has perhaps brought some confusion, from a financial plan standpoint, we always give ourselves, on all of our projects, we give ourselves some room so that we're not expecting cash flows and we can absorb some delays if they do occur. So I would just say on the planning and the project management side, we are full bore into making that 17-date, and things are going well in that regard. But from a financial planning standpoint, we put a more conservative date in there for expected start-up.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. That makes sense. And then, I think, for Don, you had mentioned in your prepared remarks 4.5 times debt to EBITDA at WPZ in 2018. Can you just confirm does that have a full year of Atlantic Sunrise, is that sort of an exit rate type of metric, and do you think that's the number you need to get to, to stay IG with the agencies?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","I'd say \u2013 first, I'd say that I said less than 4.5 times. That would be an agency adjusted number, so it wouldn't be right off the books, but it'd be an agency adjusted number. It has a partial year of Atlantic Sunrise, I think as Alan mentioned. We build a contingency into our financial plan for potential delay in all of our projects. And we just wanted to be clear about that. So it's partial year that's included in our 2018 numbers.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That makes sense. And then just in Northeast G&P, the volumes there, it looks like they're down sequentially. You've spoken, I think about price related shut-ins. I'm just wondering if you're still seeing that, and is it more a northeast Pennsylvania or it is now more widespread across the basin, what you're seeing there?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll ask Jim Scheel to chime in on that, please.","James E. Scheel - Senior VP-Northeast Gathering & Processing","Yeah. So right now we have about 700 million a day shut-in. And you're correct, the majority of that is in northeast PA, specifically in and around the Bradford area. As you can recall, our volumes are down somewhat, but you've got to remember this is a shoulder month where we really haven't had much cooling impact until the last month of the quarter.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great.

Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning, and congratulations.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning, Craig.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","So, Don or Alan, can you comment on the updated cash tax outlook at WMB over time with this updated plan? Also, any prospects that you envision as far as cash flows for the size of excess coverage at WPZ through 2017? And any thoughts about the combined range of potential public DRIP and ATM proceeds that you might look for through the end of 2017?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Craig, cash tax rate continues to be at or near zero for extended period of time in light of the heavy capital investment and significant NOL that we have. In terms of WPZ's cash flow and coverage, we've not put out a number on that. I think you can calculate that based off what we have put out. And, again, we've not defined the size of the public DRIP or ATM program. But again, I think given the data we have put out, I think you can probably come up with some pretty good estimates yourself.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Are we to anticipate some cash tax drag before the end of the decade?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","I think that's unlikely.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citigroup. Please go ahead.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hey. Good morning. It's Faisel from Citi. Just want to go back to some of the equity funding statements you made for WPZ. I understand that looks like it funds the equity portion of the capital program. I take it, Don, that the rest will be sort of funded with debt on the \u2013 incremental debt on the balance sheet?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Well, Faisel, I'd say, we have a pretty limited amount of debt in this plan. As you know, Transco issued $1 billion of debt back in January of 2016 when the market was not very attractive. But the amount of debt being issued in this plan is pretty modest. There are some debt retirements that are coming up. So we'll obviously be issuing debt to fund debt retirements. But beyond that, it's pretty limited given that we're in the process of delevering.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, in terms of the distribution coverage, I know you're around one times. What do you think the right target for distribution coverage is? I mean, you still have some cyclical cash flows in the portfolio of assets and you've got some concentrated counterparty risk. I'm just wondering, what's the right coverage ratio at PZ and that is comfortable for you and the agencies?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","That's a great question. Again, I think it'll be a function of the amount of commodity price or other risk that we have in the portfolio. And I would say that it's somewhere going to be between 1 and 1.2 times. But these are general range of coverage that I would expect over time, again, depending on facts and circumstances, but obviously it could be a bit different from that.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And did the agencies get a chance to preview this plan, and does this take at least one or two of them off the negative watch do you think?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Well, we did preview it with three agencies and it will be up to them to determine their point of view.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then just on the \u2013 you guys used to publish your \u2013 sort of your sensitivity commodity prices. I just want to make sure that the historical sort of guidance you used to give us on the sensitivity is still sort of intact?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","I would say that \u2013 I don't know anything offhand that throws it off, but our volumes have changed somewhat since that date. So I wouldn't want to say that it's up-to-date, but I think directionally it's in the right direction. I think we'll look to provide some updates in the future date as to what those look like. But again, we've had some movement in volumes, so I wouldn't want to say that that's as precise as it used to be, but nonetheless I think it's still something that is useful.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I think probably the main delta looking forward, of course, would be the Canadian asset sales because those are very commodity sensitive and so that would probably be the big change in your model looking forward.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Understood. Now, Alan, last question from me. On the corporate governance plans, as you go into sort of, I guess, a November proxy, what's the plan in terms of number of board seats and the sort of independent Chairman role? I mean, what's the plan from a corporate governance and sort of corporate structure perspective?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, sure. I would tell you we are out recruiting and going through the interview process. We've got Spencer Stuart helping us with that effort. And it's gone very well, very impressed with the kind of candidates that we've seen and that I'm very excited about, frankly.","And so we are looking to add a few really great candidates in that regard, and I would say stay tuned on that. It's moving ahead pretty quickly. But we are anxious to hear if there's any other candidates that surface as part of the \u2013 from outside of the board, the Spencer Stuart effort. We're always anxious to hear that feedback as well. So again, things are going well. We're excited about adding the board today is very stable, very engaged, but as always we're looking to add to the quality of our board.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Any independent Chairman spot?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Today Kathleen Cooper is our Chairman, and would expect that to remain the case.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay.

Please go ahead.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good morning.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","A lot's been hit here, so apologize if these are sort of second-tier type questions, but just curious on a couple of things, Alan. First, I guess, the time profile of your appeal process on Energy Transfer, if there's anything you can tell us as a guidepost for that, when we might put it sort of formally behind us?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","We're hoping to see that expedited, but would just say that it moves through the Delaware courts at a pace that \u2013 I would expect that it's going to drag out too terribly long, but I don't really have any specific dates for you on that. I would just remind people that the focus there is for the damages. And we certainly are \u2013 our outside counsel is certainly very focused on that. I would tell you the management team has got their head down to really execute on the plan before us, and so fully expect our outside legal team to be successful in going after those damages. But I would tell you the management team's focus is just head-on on the business before us.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Understood. Thanks for that. And then, I guess, just a final question for me. With regard to the MVC accruals that you make, are you asking the counterparties to post collateral for those? How does that process, I guess, work? And then, as it relates, how does \u2013 in your conversations, Don, I guess, previewing with the rating agencies, how did they think about those cash flows as it pertains to your leverage and the defense of IG down at WPZ? Thanks.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Chris, we do not get any credit support on those. They're contractually due, so the counterparties require to pay those. Obviously, in the event of a credit event, that's a different situation. But absent credit event, they're contractually due, and they have been paid timely every year. And we would expect those would continue to be paid to us in full and timely. So it's really not a worry, except in the event of a credit event. And in terms of the agencies, I think the agencies view it the same way so that they would view it as certain cash flows, except with an assumed credit event. So that would be some stress-testing around that.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for the color.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. I'm just wondering if you could provide some more details on your underlying assumptions for 2017 in your financial planning, especially when you think, I guess, targeting that debt leverage of 4.5 times and below? Just wondering what are you expecting for 2017 commodity prices, as well as is there any anticipated deterioration in the Chesapeake cash flows?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Sharon, we're largely using strip prices, so I'd say something that's very much in line with where the current market is. And in terms of CHK cash flows, we're not expecting a significant amount of drilling activity from Chesapeake in light of the fact that they have a number of priorities for the use of their capital including some debt reduction. So again, I think we have what appears to be a fairly realistic plan at this point, and we'll see how things play out.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. But no change in terms of the gathering rate for the MVCs at this point?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","No.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And then to achieve, I guess, the 4.5 times or below, are you assuming ATM equity or additional asset sales in 2017?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","We are assuming ATM equity, and the amount will be dependent upon the amount of public participation in the DRIP. But between public DRIP or public ATM equity, we are expecting to tap that. We are not planning any additional asset sales at this point, certainly to the extent that there were any, that certainly could reduce the needs in that area.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And just a question about 2017 growth CapEx, you provided guidance of $3.1 billion. The bulk of it is Transco spending, but just wondering if you can give some color on the other areas of investment for the remaining balance.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","I'd say it's Gathering & Processing assets throughout our system. I would say with the Northeast as a factor there just to meet growing production needs, particularly as this new pipeline capacity comes online, there's some gathering expansions that have to occur as well to fill those pipelines. So I think that's probably the biggest portion of that.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","And we also have in that \u2013 other than interstate, we also have some investments going on out in the Permian as well. So in the joint ventures out there as well as in some of our operated facilities in the Permian, there's quite a bit of committed expansion and capital going on in that area as well.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. And just I guess in terms of expected timing, when you would provide more details on 2017 guidance?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Well, we haven't determined that yet, Sharon, in terms of when we would provide more detail. Certainly, you can see on slide five of the package that we produced today, you can see the projects and the amount of capital we expect to be placed in service in 2017. So that can give you some idea of the amount of growth that we expect for 2017. But we haven't determined exactly when we would lay out guidance for the 2017 period.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Next, we'll go to Darren Horowitz with Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning. A couple of quick ones. The first, Don, what's the average return threshold across the projects in the backlog for next year? And I'm just curious, when you look at the current cost of equity, where you think the cost of equity is going to be as well as the current cost of debt, any opportunities to high grade or defer that capital commitment in order to alleviate some of the financing burden next year?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Darren, great question. Something we look at all the time. I'd say our pipes projects tend to be in the low-teens, un-levered returns. And we think the cost of capital for those is pretty low too from the standpoint if you were to really isolate that business and say what is the perfect cost of capital for that business. So I think you'd be looking at pretty low debt costs there and a pretty attractive equity cost as well I'd say. And I think that's exactly the kind of business that investors are pretty enthusiastic about and probably lowers our cost of capital overall.","So we think all of those Transco projects are just really right down the sweet spot. So while we could lay off some capital there, it's not desirable, I think, from our perspective. The rest of the returns on some of those investments tend to be fairly high because they're incremental returns on existing asset bases. So, again, we'll continue to look at those and see if there's capital that is not earning a sufficient return or otherwise can be deferred or laid off. But at this point, this is the plan, but we'll continue to focus on that in an effort to maximize value creation opportunities for both PZ and Williams.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","I would just add to that. As you think about the returns on projects like Atlantic Sunrise, great project, great returns, but in addition to the returns we get on a particular project, something like Atlantic Sunrise pulls all the way through the system. So you heard Jim talk about the 700 million a day that we have shut-in up there as \u2013 and that capital is already there, the gathering system is already there. So to the degree we unlock those constraints and systems like that, we get a very high increment in cash flows because we would see the gathering volumes pick up there as well. So, really, those projects are really important to us in terms of incremental cash flow.","Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","So, Alan, if you think about it in that context just meaning that those projects are sticky because they've got, if you will, more intrinsic returns, just based on how vertically integrated they are, if you balance that with your funding plan, how do you guys think about \u2013 and I know this is tough to answer, but how do you think about balancing the equity issuances that are needed through the ATM beyond WMB's investment in WPZ, and the headwind that leaning on that ATM could have on PZ's equity cost of capital, maybe challenging some of those returns?","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No, we certainly look at it that way. And I think the way you are describing you should look at it, with just kind of on the incremental cost of capital is the right way to think about that, and that is the way we think about it. So I completely agree with that assessment. I would just tell you I think these projects are pretty powerful in terms of what they do for us going on the increment. And we have trimmed a lot of capital out of the plan. But I think as WPZ investors see the amount of coverage that we have and see the kind of growth that is out before WPZ with all those big capital investment, I think we'll see some very constructive positioning for the PZ units. And so I think that will be a positive. But, again, I think the kind of returns that we're talking about, are powerful and we'll overcome that over time.","Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then last question for me. Don, Alan, in your eyes, what's more net present value accretive? Is it a meaningful leverage reduction in the near term where you can return to a larger dividend reset with a de-risked cash flow profile, or is it a more moderate dividend restatement and greater operational cash flow being reinvested in the business for theoretically greater returns like you just talked about over the long term?","Donald R. Chappel - Chief Financial Officer & Director","Darren, I think we're comfortable with the plan that we laid out here today based on the facts and circumstances we have in front of us, and obviously we'll continue to look at the changing landscape, including how we're valued and the cost of capital and make decisions from that new baseline. But we're certainly very focused on the cost of capital, very interested in reducing spending where we don't see a good spread between the return on capital and cost of capital as well, but all consistent with supporting our franchises. So we'll continue to balance those points and try to find the path that we believe will create the greatest long-term value.","Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Darren.","Operator","And, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude the Q&A portion of the call today.

We're really excited about the platform that we're sitting on here for growth and very excited about really moving this business to a much more predictable set of cash flows and continuing to execute on these projects that are just coming in one after another as we expand out the business, and then ultimately the pull-through that we'll get on our supply side.

I'm Travis Campbell, and I head up the Investor Relations team here at Williams. Before I turn it over to Alan Armstrong, let me go through a few housekeeping items. Today, we put on our website, williams.com, the slides that Alan will shortly be discussing. You can download those slides for viewing and a podcast of his remarks, if you desire. As always, we thank you for your interest in the company. In a minute, Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will review the slides that we have this quarter. Tomorrow, our business units heads and Don Chappel will be available to respond to questions on our analyst call in the morning at 9:30 Eastern Time.","You'll notice that all the results and guidance in today's slides, including the EPS numbers, are presented excluding WPX. Be aware that this is different from the EPS guidance given on the third quarter slides. Don't let this confuse you because numbers on the Street have included the former E&P company and results presented today do not.","At the beginning of the slide deck are the forward-looking statements which are included on Slide #2 and Slide #3. These are important and integral to all of our remarks. You should review those. Also included are various non-GAAP numbers that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules are available and follow the presentation.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Thank you, Travis, and good morning, everyone. A lot of great information to go through here this morning and glad we've got the context set clear here now . Some of the things I'll be hitting on this morning here, first of all, talking about our 2011 performance, and then I'll work through some of the rapidly expanding growth capital that we've got out there and a lot of the projects that are behind that capital expansion. And then I will move to the guidance for 2012 and '13, along with an updated commodity price deck that reflects our latest thinking about the commodities environment that we look forward to in '12 and '13.","First of all though, before we get into that, I want to remind you, certainly, we could not be more excited about Williams going forward and the way we're positioned in what we think are definitely the right assets, great markets and we certainly are excited about the strategy and how that is performing for us. Also, our MLP structure continues to fuel our dividend growth at WMB and allows us to continue to raise capital in a very cost-efficient manner for Williams shareholders and our high-dividend payout expect an increase every quarter now as we go forward rather than either annual or semiannually. We now have laid out our policy to increase that and are going to be increasing that at a rate of about 7\/8 of $0.01. And that equates to a December '11 number versus a December '12, will give us a 14% increase in our annual dividend growth from '11 versus '12.","So we continue to be very excited about our ability to grow the dividend. We think it's extremely transparent where that growth is coming from. And as we continue to add more and more capital projects to this, we expect to even be able to expand that further. We continue to be very committed to our investment grade credit as well.","Okay, moving on here to Slide 5. Great financial performance for 2011, a 37% growth in our adjusted net income. That was $734 million versus $537 million from our continuing ops. Very strong business performance, growing at a clip of about 27% on our adjusted segment profit. And that was driven by a 24% increase in Williams Partners and a 67% increase in our Midstream Canada and olefins.","Some of the drivers there, certainly, in the fee-based business, we grew our fee-based revenues by 12% in Williams Partners and a lot of that volume growth is coming from our Marcellus business, as well as our Deepwater business. The higher NGL frac spreads also were a driver for 2011, and our NGL production volumes were up. But as some of our contracts continue to roll into a fee-based business, our NGL equity volumes were flat. So our business is growing but more and more of our revenues are coming from fee-based business.","We certainly, on the Deepwater Gulf business, as I mentioned, not only did we see growth in revenues for 2011, but we also signed up 2 very significant growth projects that will come on in 2014 and beyond, and that is the Keathley Canyon project and as well, the GulfStar FPS. And I'll speak a little bit more about that later.","Our Gas Pipelines continued to grow as well. And really, the big projects for the gas pipelines, there was actually 4 new major expansions that came on in just during 2011. And most of these projects started up in the end of -- latter part of the year, and about $67 million in increased revenues from those projects.","And then again in the Midstream Canada and olefins, higher sales prices really drove a lot of that, as well as increased volumes. But I think probably most important to note is that it wasn't just priced just that the market offered us, but our butane\/butylene splitter that we installed in -- towards the last half of 2010 really provided tremendous margin upgrade for us in the 2011 timeframe. So a very high-return project as we continue to optimize the mix that's coming off the oil sands off gas stream. So we continue to be very excited about that. And as well, we had better margins in our Geismar ethylene business and somewhat impacted by some downtime that we had in the fourth quarter for Geismar.","So here on Slide 6, we show the visibility to growth across all of our operating areas. And really important changes going on here. So I'll draw your attention to this. First of all, 2011 has been dropped from this. Prior, you would have seen 2011 included here, so you really have to look at things on an annualized basis to get to a more comparative viewpoint. So for instance, in guidance, we went from 3 years now to 2 years and on an annual average basis, you see that increase being up 47% on an annual average basis, moving from $1.7 billion to $2.5 billion here in the fourth quarter. And so some of the drivers, of course, for this, and a lot of this is weighted towards 2012, but some of the drivers here, primarily, the Laser acquisition and then some of the expansion cap around the Laser acquisition, as well as a small portion for Constitution. Both of those additions are included in that new Marcellus slice.","Moving to the middle slice then, you can see now we're going from what was 6 years, 2011 through 2016, is now 5 years. And the midpoint on that -- or sorry, the annual average at midpoint on that was about -- a little over $1.5 billion. And before now, that is $2.5 billion and a 56% increase on the average annual growth capital spending for that period. The drivers on this, a lot of which is on the Eastern Seaboard, which is a number of small projects that are in-guidance quality projects, but the capital push is into 2014. So it's out of that guidance period that's shown to the left. As well as a pretty significant increase on Constitution, again, that's shown in the Marcellus slide. And then additionally, we've got some increases in the Deepwater and some increases in the area of our Midstream Canada and olefins, particularly some projects that we have serve, some pet chem infrastructure needs for third parties. We haven't disclosed those projects yet but are looking forward to doing that yet in the very near future.","Moving over to the larger pie. Here, you can see this moves from $2.6 billion up to $4.2 billion on an annual average basis or a 62% increase. A number of large drivers here, but I'll tell you, probably the biggest single theme to this is the fact that we're seeing so much increase for demand on Transco along the Eastern Seaboard and the markets there. So our largest increase here is in the Eastern Seaboard pie that you can see there, and you can see Marcellus keeping pace throughout this as well. So a lot of great growth going on. And we just continue to see the demand for our infrastructure continue to drive our forecast for growth opportunities out in front of us. And frankly, we're going to be in a nice position to be able to prioritize to the very best capital opportunities that we have available for us looking forward.","Moving on to Slide 7, as we mentioned in our capital explanation and the opportunities ahead of us, the Marcellus area continues to be an area we're extremely excited about and continue to grow a very strong presence in the Marcellus, and particularly, in the Northeast Pennsylvania area, we are making progress in growing out the infrastructure there, really leveraging off of a resource base there in the Susquehanna County area and our key customers there, Cabot, WPX Energy and Carrizo. And we are really excited about how that's coming together. We've got 2 new things to announce. Certainly we closed the Laser pipeline that we had mentioned earlier. But as of yesterday, we also disclosed the Constitution Pipeline project which will provide even greater access for our customers in this area into new expanding markets as we connect into both the Iroquois pipeline and a favorable location on Tennessee Gas Pipeline in New York. And Cabot is the anchor customer for that project, and we will be moving ahead with that project. The size and total capital on that project will be somewhat dependent on the amount of interest we have from other parties, but we are prepared to move ahead with the commitment that we have from Cabot for that project. So very excited about this. And really, this area, we believe by 2015, will have about 3 Bcf per day. Gathering capacity matched up with 3 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity from the area as well. And so this is exactly right onto our strategy of providing large-scale infrastructure solutions to producers in the right locations. And certainly, we think Susquehanna County in the Marcellus is the right location.","Moving on to Slide 8. Here, you can see another exciting project that's leveraging off the growth in the Marcellus Shale as well. And this project is really aimed at serving both producers in Southwestern Pennsylvania and Northern West Virginia, and as well, potentially Utica Shale shippers as well. And so -- but the really unique thing about this project is it not only provides producers with access into these markets, it also provides these great, growing markets on Transco in zone 6, 5, 4 and even 3, it provides these folks with access to these growing reserve base as well with actual firm, backhaul capacity on Transco. And so Transco, as you know, continues to -- has been continuing to expand with moving supplies from the South to the North, but those expansions have been coming in such a rapid manner that we really -- or welcome a new supply source from the north to be able to expand our capabilities to serve these markets even faster. So this is not just a supply-based project. It also is providing a great opportunity for our markets along the Transco system as well. And you can see, we would expect this to be in service as early as December of 2014, and we do have an open season out there right now and look to conclude that on April 2. And we'll know a little more about the details of this project when that's concluded.","Now moving onto Slide 9, in the Keathley Canyon Connector, and we've talked about this project. Fortunately, I won't spend a lot of time here. But this is a 215-mile project with a gathering capacity of 400 million a day. And these contracts were executed in late 2011, another great accomplishment that we had in 2011. This project will be expected to be in service in mid-year 2014. And I point that out because despite the great growth that we continue to have throughout our guidance period, a lot of these projects that I'm talking about will -- do not come into service in that timeframe and will continue to fuel our growth beyond the guidance period.","Moving on to Slide 10, our GulfStar FPS, another project that we contracted during 2011, and you can see a lot of details offered for you here on the slide. This project is going extremely well to date and a lot of the major contracts for the fabrication and installation of both the spar and the pipelines that will tie it into our existing pipeline system have been executed, and are at or below where we expected the estimates to come in for this project. So getting off to a great start on this project and really excited about the degree of interest that we're getting from other producers in the Deepwater as well as they're starting to see the reality of this project come together and the speed at which this product can be deployed.","Moving on to Slide 11, moving out West now. The West continues to provide opportunity to us and the Parachute Plant is a great example. It's a 350 million a day cryogenic train, almost completely fee-based project, and it will be in service in 2014. Major customer on this is WPX Energy, and this will really help them lift their cash returns on their drilling operations out there as right now, we continue to be a little bit short on processing capacity in that area. So very excited about what's going on out there. Another thing that's not mentioned here is the Overland Pass Pipeline, and that pipeline, that's the NGL pipeline that comes out of the Rockies and into the Mid-continent area. And that capacity is going to be increased up to 255,000 barrels per day to accommodate One Oak's new volumes coming out of the Bakken Shale, as well as Parachute TXP1 plant as well.","Moving on to Slide 12. And you can see here great visibility along our gas pipeline system here and a number of projects that are mentioned. And I'll tell you that the drivers for expansion on Transco in particularly is largely driven by power generation load. And right now, we are pursuing projects. These aren't speculative matters. These are actual projects we are pursuing right now that are requiring an excess of 3 Bcf a day of pipeline capacity. And that's about $2.5 billion of pipeline investment to accomplish that. So that's outside of some of the things that we most recently announced. And as well, I will tell you, in a broader study that we looked at, about 30 gigawatts of new power generation load we expect within about 50-mile radius of the Transco pipeline. So you've been hearing a lot about this for the last couple of years from the industry pundits, but we are actually seeing it come to -- into very tangible projects for Transco, and we expect to be able to grow both our capital investments and our revenues from our Transco business here pretty rapidly over the next 4 or 5 years.","Okay, now moving onto Slide 13 into Canada in our Midstream Canada and olefins area. Our Boreal pipeline is a great example of how well our project teams are executing up there. And this is a project that's being funded out of our international cash reserves, so it's not drawing down on any of our ability to provide dividend. And as we've mentioned before, a lot -- all of this Canadian business today is really being held in reserve from a dividend standpoint. We're not using any of these cash flows. But the point, really, of this slide is to show we continue to be able to execute our projects up here very well. In August of 2010, we brought on the BB splitter, and we brought that in below budget and on time. And also now, in Boreal pipeline, expect to be able to say that as well, and we're expecting that to come on in May or June of this year, and that will be slightly ahead of our schedule for that project. And as well, we now are forecasting that project to come in under the original budgeted amount. So great execution by our teams up here, and that's a good thing because we have a lot of remaining expansion projects to build with the next one that will come online will be the expansion for NOVA of our ability to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the gas streams up here as well. And that will come on in the first part of 2013.","And as you can see here on Slide 14, we have a little more detail on that particular project. This is the NOVA Chemicals project, and we basically have contracted with NOVA to extract the ethane and ethylene out of the existing gas streams up there for them. And particularly, the first amount of work that's going on is at the Suncor facility. And this involves both some upgrades on the extraction facility, as well as some upgrades on the fractionator down at our Redwater facility. And as you can see here, that project is -- you can see that range of that budget moving down as well. So making great progress on all of our projects up here.","The next project here on Slide 15 is our Geismar plant expansion, very excited about what this offers to us from a strategic standpoint. And we've got a very low cost expansion, and we think we're going to be well ahead of the market on most of the other expansions that are coming on in the ethylene cracking space. And we think this is going to be a good thing for Williams relative to the choppiness that we expect to see in terms of ethane volumes coming up in 2013. And we think this project is extremely well-timed in terms of being able to capture the spread between gas and ethylene. And so from a Williams standpoint, we are going to be rather insensitive to the spread between gas to ethane or ethane to ethylene because we'll perfectly balanced here between our ethane supplies coming out of WPZ and our ethane consumption in Midstream Canada and olefins. And so things are going well on this project as well, and we've got a really talented staff and a great operating team there at Geismar, gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to bring this project in on-time and on budget as well.","Now we're going to move to Slide 16 here and talk about our perspective on the industry fundamentals that are driving our NGL margins and our olefins margins as well. So first of all, I'm going to kind of go through the general perspective that we have, and then I'll come back and talk about the specific changes that we've made to our pricing guidance. First of all, the crude-to-gas ratio continues to be at record high levels, and we certainly expect to see that in both '12, and to a slightly lesser degree, in '13, as we expect gas prices to rebound a little bit from '12 even though we don't expect dramatic movement.","The NGL-to-crude ratio however, is really continuing to soften. We're certainly seeing that here in February and in March, and we expect to see that continue through the second quarter of '12. We may see some rebound, and hope to see some rebound in the second half of '12, as a lot of the ethylene cracking capacity that is out-of-service right now, some of that down time is related to expansion on some of those ethylene crackers. And so we expect to see ethane demand towards the second half of '12 rebound. And then as we move into '13, though, we expect to see some of the new processing and NGL transport and fractionation infrastructure start to come into service in '13. And we -- so we expect to see supplies getting a bit longer in '13 and expect to see some dampening of the NGL-to-crude ratio further into 2013.","The natural gas-to-ethylene spread, really, is the thing you need to stay tuned about relative to Williams because we really have that entire space covered with our ethylene cracker at Geismar. And so we really aren't all that sensitive at the WMB level between gas-to-ethane or ethane-to-ethylene spread. In fact, in 2013 and mid-2013, when our ethylene cracker comes into service, our expansion there comes into service, we'll be almost perfectly balanced between our ethane production at Geismar -- or sorry, our ethane production in our processing business and our ethane consumption at Geismar. A very positive thing that we're seeing out of this commodity price environment that we're in is a tremendous demand for infrastructure on the market side on natural gas, particularly on Transco pipeline, and it's driving a lot of demand for power generation loads. But as well, this big spread that we continue to see between gas and crude oil-based products is continuing to demand infrastructure that helps us arbitrage that tremendous spread between domestic natural gas and world crude oil prices. And so it takes a lot of infrastructure to close that arbitrage, and we certainly have seen a lot of demand to get at that.","So what this boils down to in terms of specifics for us, first of all, in 2012, we previously had $82.50 oil, WTI Oil, in our pricing environment. We're seeing that go to $100 here in 2012, and we're taking gas down from what was $4.25 at Henry Hub down to $3 in the period. That equates to a tremendous crude-to-gas ratio of 33.7. So -- and that's up from about 23 in 2011. However, the NGL-to-crude relationship, we really are expecting to diminish significantly, and we certainly have seen that, as I mentioned here in the first quarter. And in 2011, we saw that the 56%, previously in our guidance, we had a 58% NGL-to-crude relationship. We're taking that all the way down to 45%. So very conservative on our part, but reflective of a very warm winter for propane demand, and as well, this lack of demand we're seeing right now for ethane due to these ethylene crackers being out of service in the near term. So at the end of the day, we're taking our NGL margin down from $0.83 in 2011 down to $0.78 at the midpoint of our guidance. And on the frac spread side, that goes from $0.91 down to $0.83. So about 9% on the frac spread for 2012.","Looking at 2013 then, pretty similar viewpoint, moving a $100 crude oil, and we also are seeing gas go from what was $4.75 down to $3.75. And that gets us to a crude-to-gas ratio of about 27 in 2013. And we're expecting the NGL-to-crude relationship to be 45% during this period. Additionally, our NGL margin is dropping again relative to 2011, $0.83. We're seeing it go down to $0.70 for that margin. So certainly, very conservative outlook here on NGL margins. But as you'll see, despite that conservative outlook, we continue to be able to grow the cash flows of this business and drive our dividend very substantially. And I really think that's the takeaway. We certainly hope that folks are cautious as they look at our growth against some of our peers' growth because we probably have one of the more conservative perspectives out here on this pricing level. And so, despite, though, this conservative picture, a lot of growth continuing in our business as you'll see on our guidance of the next page.","Moving on to Slide 17. This really just lays out for you all of the adjusted segment profit, the changes that we expect the capital expenditure, the dividends and the EPS. And as you can see, a very nice pattern, with up into the right here in terms of adjusted segment profit. Our dividend, certainly strong increases there, and our EPS adjusted earnings. So the capital expenditure, as you can see, is very volatile over this period. Really, this is driven by, first, the Laser acquisition in 2012, and as well some dollars that we pushed from '11 into '12 in our capital -- in growth capital buckets. So 2013, you can see that going down. I would tell you, given the amount of demand that we've got for project and so forth, I would be surprised if we continue to see 2013 held so low as we get a little closer to that time and some of the projects we're working on become more of a reality. So, great picture here in terms of the continued growth in our business. And I'll remind you -- and I think this is extremely important, that when you're comparing our growth in these businesses, you recognize how conservative our pricing forecast is relative to what we've seen out there in the market from others. And despite that very conservative picture, we continue to see growth that looks like this. If we were to see this normalize with our -- from our 2011 margins, as a lot of folks are showing, you'd see a much higher growth rate in here. But we are very comfortable with the picture that we have here and our ability to continue to increase the dividend even over a more conservative pricing environment.","So moving to our last slide here on Slide 18. As we mentioned before, we certainly have transformed Williams. We're very excited about the growth prospects that we have in the business and the demand for our infrastructure services as they continue. And we certainly very much appreciate the model that we have between Williams and WPZ and the ability to increase our dividends that comes from that.","And so with that, thank you for joining us this morning, and we look forward to being able to talk you further about our growth.","Operator","Good day, everyone, and welcome to the Williams Companies Fourth Quarter 2011 Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Travis Campbell, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Travis N. Campbell","Thank you, and good morning, everybody. Welcome to the year-end 2011 call. As always, thanks for your interest in our company. As you no doubt know, we released our results yesterday afternoon after the market closed. Also yesterday, Alan, using a few slides, had some commentary about the results, our new guidance and growth opportunities. That audio commentary and the slides are available on our website. So on the website, williams.com, you should be able to find a number of things that were posted yesterday afternoon. The earnings presentation with the audio commentary by Alan, our normal data book with the usual information we make available each quarter, the press release of our results and our analyst package.","As usual, because we had the commentary yesterday, this morning's call should be fairly brief, and we'll get very quickly to your questions. In a minute, Alan will -- Alan Armstrong, our President and CEO, will make some brief comments, after which we'll open the lines for questions.","Be aware, as always, all of our business unit heads are here, and they'll be available to respond to any questions after Alan's remarks. With me here this morning are Rory Miller, who oversees Midstream; and Randy Barnard, who heads up our Gas Pipelines; as well as Don Chappel, our CFO.","On yesterday's presentation and in the data book, there is a disclaimer on forward-looking statements. This is important and integral to our company. You should review those. Also, there are non-GAAP numbers included in the various presentations. These have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules are also available.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Good morning, and thank you, Travis. First of all, we certainly had very noisy result from the EPS as we spun off WPX. But really boiling it down and looking at the continuing operations, you'll see that our adjusted segment profit versus our third quarter guidance came in right in between our midpoint and high that we've given you for a guidance there, so our continuing operation is performing very well in the fourth quarter and throughout 2011. As we look forward, a tremendous amount of new growth and you'll see that built in to both our guidance and capital, as well as our opportunity pipeline that we continue to project. And one of the -- probably the biggest area of change that we had in that opportunity pipeline was a large number of increases coming from our gas pipe segment as major expansions, particularly on Transco, and a little -- to a lesser degree, on Gulfstream, really start to present themselves as the industry and power generation industry look to take advantage of continued low natural gas prices. So very excited about the way we're positioned in that space, and our opportunity pipeline certainly demonstrates that.","On guidance, you'll note a raise in guidance for both '12 and '13, and this is an improvement in our adjusted segment profit plus DD&A of about $40 million and 12 at midpoint and $120 million in 2013. In '12, the drivers there are slightly higher NGL margins, the addition of Laser to our guidance, as well as some offsetting impact of lower volumes in some of our areas due to lower gas prices and our expectation of slow drilling in some of those areas. So overall, an improvement in '12, though. In '13, you'll see even lower NGL margins than we had previously in our guidance there, and I'll speak to that in just a moment. But those were -- are offset in '13 by higher ethylene margins in our MC&O areas, so a nice raise there for '13. And I think it really shows the strength of our portfolio, and a big part of that strength is the growth in fee-based revenues that we continue to see in '11, we're going to see in '12, and we certainly are going to start to see present itself in '13.","Speaking of commodity prices and our changes there, what you'll note there is very high crude-to-gas ratios reflecting kind of what we're seeing in the current market out there. We've got gas now at $3 for '12 and $3.75 for '13, and we've got crude holding steady at $100. However, despite that very high crude-to-gas ratio, much as we usually see when we see that ratio blow way out, we do not see the NGL components keeping pace with that big separation. And so you'll see a very low NGL-to-crude ratio in our forecast of about 45%. And that has us have our NGL margin declining from '11 through '13 of just a little over 15%. But as I said earlier, we are projecting our ethylene business, particularly in '13, starting to take advantage of those lower ethylene prices. So -- but despite what I would say is a very conservative outlook in the NGL margin space, we continue to show very strong cash flow growth and very bullish about the way our continued cash flows from both WPZ and our Midstream Canada and olefin segment is going. And I would just remind you, as you're looking out there amongst our peers, making sure you're looking at it on an apples-to-apples basis, we feel like we've got a pretty good insight into the commodity prices. But I think what's impressive is we've got continued nice strength in our growing cash flow despite a 15% decline in our NGL margin, and I think a lot of our peers would be hard-pressed to show that kind of resilience and strength in a lower price environment.","So with that, we will turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","A couple of quick questions. It looked like the Geismar olefin volumes were perhaps down a little sequentially in the fourth quarter. And I was wondering if you could discuss if that's accurate, what's driving that and prospects for the volume growth ahead of the expansion of the facility? And also, where you see potential weakness geographically in terms of gas processing and Midstream as producers pull back in this environment?","Rory Miller","I'll take that. This is Rory. We had a 10-day shutdown at Geismar. We had a problem with a missed pad there and that accounted for the lower volumes there in the fourth quarter. So that's something, obviously, that we're not planning for in '12, so you shouldn't put too much stock in that. Prospects for volume growth ahead of the expansion of the facility, I expect -- or I suspect that you're talking about the major 600-pound expansion that we've announced. We do have some furnace upgrades that are ongoing. Those are being done one at a time. And so we will see some very slow volume growth across the period as those furnaces are reconfigured and brought back up. But the big jump will come in '13 when we bring up the major expansion.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Will we see some downtime ahead of that to prepare for that?","Rory Miller","Yes, we have a turnaround planned, and our intent is that we would coordinate the activity as much as possible to limit any additional downtime associated with the expansion.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And any slowdown geographically you could discuss in the Midstream area?","Rory Miller","Yes, yes. Good question there. I think any of the slowdowns that we're seeing, I think, we already have priced into our guidance. I'll just note that upfront. Out West, we're not seeing massive pullbacks of drilling, but we are seeing some moderation in the drilling out there. We've got one rig that we've just heard of. It's being laid down in Wamsutter, but everything else is still moving ahead. Generally speaking, say, from quarter-to-quarter, we're seeing a little softening in the drilling. But I guess, that -- one point I would make is if we do see fewer well connects for the year, we'll also see less well connect costs. So we think, at least, from a PZ standpoint, any slowdowns near-term ought to be DCF-neutral to PZ, and of course, that impacts WMB directly as we get those distributions.","Operator","And we'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just wondering if you could talk about maybe the cash flow contribution from the Laser acquisition and how you anticipate the cash flow to ramp-up over time.","Rory Miller","Yes, the Laser system acquisition, which I'm sure you've heard, has closed, is being looked at as what I call an integrated system. I think we're, in fact, we're going to be disallowed from using that name shortly. But one of the big values from Laser is it's coming into our complex up there to be operated and run as part of an integrated, holistic system. And so we'll be referring to that area up there as the Susquehanna Supply Hub. The project was, I would say, was -- the purchase price was more like what you would typically see on acquisitions in the Midstream space. We're -- if you're looking at guidance just for PZ, that's probably going to contribute about $25 million of segment operating profit in '12 and about $50 million in '13. That's the net impact. There's a little other noise in there, but we see that as being a nice driver overall in terms of improving segment profit and a big help just in general to that overall complex in the area.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. That's helpful. And I guess turning to the Constitution JV with Cabot, if you can maybe talk about the potential investment in terms of dollar costs and the expected returns for that project?","Randall L. Barnard","This is Randy Barnard. I'll be happy to answer that question. Sorry for my voice, it got a little froggy this morning. The stated investment for that project is around $700 million, actually $701 million, eight-eights if we build the 24-inch version. We've got an open season on that project. Now that may end up leading to upsizing on that project to 30-inch that would raise the capital by another $22 million or so. The joint venture between us and Cabot, us being Williams Partners, would be 75% owners. So that would be our share of the overall capital depending upon which version, the 24 or 30 inches built. Does that answer your questions?","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And then maybe just the expected initial returns on that project?","Randall L. Barnard","Well, we haven't negotiated rates for the project. But they would be -- I would just say consistent with regulated pipeline returns.","Operator","And we will go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just thinking about the pace of the dividend raise here. It sounds like with what you're going to hit for 2012, you're going to be above your -- the midpoint of your range, the 12.5%. I'm just wondering if you're thinking you can hit the high end of the range, maybe now that you're adding more of the fee-based earnings from WPZ with Laser and some of the new pipeline projects, or are you still thinking the midpoint is a reasonable way to think about the raise?","Donald R. Chappel","Ted, this is Don Chappel. Again, we'll stand with the range we've put out but certainly, our bias is to target the high end of the range.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the mix shift at -- I'm assuming PZ is going to be moving more fee-based here given that you are fairly call it conservative on your NGL margin. Does that change your thinking at all?","Donald R. Chappel","Right. I think we look at the whole portfolio and clearly, the fact that WPZ is building more and more fee-based business, gives us more confidence in support for distribution increases. So I think we're on the same page there in terms of -- we think the outlook is very strong. I think, as Alan said, the business prospects have never been better. So we're adding a lot of great assets. I think Rory spoke to Laser, and that's kind of the early innings for Laser. We think that '14 and beyond are even brighter.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just sticking with dividends, and I realize it's a little early to think about it, but we do have potential change in tax law here coming at the end of the year. I mean, how does that inform your thoughts about capital allocation, whether it's dividends, buybacks, things like that?","Donald R. Chappel","Well, I think it's way too soon to think that the tax law is can be changed. We certainly are mindful of the possibilities. We certainly are educating those that make those decisions, but I don't know that we want to speculate on what we might see or what we might do. But again, I think at this point, we think it's pretty low probability that anything happens.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. The -- you mentioned a little bit about expecting stronger ethylene margins. Can you just talk about what you're expecting for '12 and '13 there? And then is it a function more of lower ethane prices, or is it just increases in ethylene prices or maybe a combination?","Donald R. Chappel","Well, I would say a couple things here. One, most of the driver in '13 from our previous guidance is lower ethane prices. And so that's a big chunk of that. For '12, I would just say the current experience that we have out there is that because there are outages and that's driving these -- on the cracker side that is driving some of the lower ethane prices. But it's also increasing ethylene prices because those crackers are out as well. So we're on both sides of that coin. And -- but I would say generally, most of the driver that we're seeing in a longer-term despite this kind of current period that we're in with high ethylene is really driven by lower ethane prices.","Operator","And we will go next to Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.","Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I think my question is really kind of a follow-up to Ted's. It looked as though the NGL pricing that you have in the February slide deck has declined over 20% at the midpoint from the November NGL pricing. And at the same time, the bump up for segment margin in MC&O in 2013 seems relatively conservative. Is there any of the, I guess, ethane price decline that -- or anything about the contractual structures that you guys might have with ethane suppliers that would prevent you from realizing all of the favorable impact of a decline in spot ethane prices?","Rory Miller","I'll take that. This is Rory. If you look at '13 and focus on that, we're down about $0.11 on our ethane assumption and up about $0.04 on our ethylene, which is driving about a $50 million increase in segment profit there. That's kind of the long and short of it. I don't know if that's helpful but we...","Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's helpful. And then there's nothing in terms of contractual structures. It's reasonable to think about segment margin in the olefins business as really being determined by just -- by spot prices?","Rory Miller","Yes, I think the good news there is if -- and I'm not going to get into a lot of contractual detail on our offtake agreements, but right now, we have a pretty high percentage of our agreements that do have collars on them, and so we're not getting full exposure to that pure spot market margin, which today, is around EUR 40 -- maybe even a little more than GBP 0.40. Most of those are rolling off, and so we'll have contracting flexibility in '13. And we'll -- we haven't made those decisions yet, exactly how we're going to play that, but at the end of the day, you want exposure to that margin and you want certainty of takes. So that's kind of the trade-off there.","Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess just as far as why the 2012 MC&O margin didn't move, that's more associated with the collars that you referred to?","Rory Miller","That's definitely part of it. We've got a much smaller percentage of our offtake that's purely exposed to that at spot margin without some kind of limiting collar.","Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great, and just one question on the Midstream side of things. As you think about the current low ethane price environment, when you think about some of your customers in the Piceance specifically, but in, let's say, kind of a variety of Rockies plays in the Green River and the Piceance where maybe you see anywhere from 1 to 3 gallons per Mcf on average so not extremely liquids rich, do you think of those rigs as being in danger of being laid down as you think of, perhaps, ethane prices on the Gulf Coast not being high enough to justify shipping ethane all the way from the Rockies down to the Gulf Coast and incurring those transportation costs versus just selling that, the BTU, locally as methane?","Rory Miller","Yes, well, it certainly doesn't help. The Rockies barrel does have a fairly decent percentage of ethane in it. But I think what I would say generally speaking, the lack or the slowdown in drilling that we expect to see, we've already got in our guidance. I think that impact has already been accounted for. I think the uptick or the strengthening that we're likely to see for ethane in the second half of '12 will help. And -- but I think generally speaking, we've got that impact and that effect already dialed into our guidance.","Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And you don't think that will affect utilization on the new capacity on the Parachute Plant coming online in 2014 or kind of similar deep-cut processing facilities?","Rory Miller","I think that in the Piceance basin in general, there will be some drilling slowdown there. I think WPX, in particular, has already made some comments about that. The good news I think there is we do have some Mancos acreage under contract out there, and that's kind of where I see a lot of the backfill coming and some of the interest building out there. There's some rich gas windows and possibly even some crude oil Windows in the Mancos and Piceance. And if we do have any slowdown here in the front-end, I think we've got a chance to backfill that eventually with Mancos rich gas production.","Operator","And we will go next to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","A lot of my questions had been hit, maybe just a few others if I could, though. And maybe, Randy, on the pipeline side, going back to Constitution, just noting that it's -- it looked like it was sort of an in-service date for early 2015, and we think a 120-mile pipe that could kind of be done in 1 season. Is there a reason why that's taking that long, or am I not perhaps thinking about it correctly?","Randall L. Barnard","Well, the timing, generally speaking, is the whole permitting process and FERC certification process. This would be a interstate-regulated pipeline. So we have to go through all the prefiling, public meetings, all the environmental studies, all the FERC certification and that generally chews up 1.5 years to even sometimes 2. So the actual in-service state that we're quoting on the project is fairly aggressive, believe it or not, from the perspective of the development cycle, typical development cycle of regulated pipe.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great. So it's really all the regulatory issues, not necessarily waiting for more contracts, for instance?","Randall L. Barnard","No, sir. No, sir. The Cabot commitment to that pipeline is sufficient to anchor the construction of that pipe.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","No, that's great. And then just a question maybe on the further investment potential in Transco on the gas-fired power generation and, I guess, Alan even mentioned to a lesser extent, the Gulfstream. So as we think about that, and you guys have your wedge pie charts over the next 5 years, do you see that sort of developing as far as perhaps leading to announced projects, something that might be nearer term of the first half of that 5-year outlook, or is it more in the back half? Is there any sense of color on that?","Randall L. Barnard","Maybe I would cop out by saying about the middle half. Transco, in particular, is pursuing over 20 projects right now that are largely driven by power gen growth. And it's up and down the Eastern Seaboard. There is a slide in our packets that I'm trying to find so I can direct you to it. Slide 57 in the data book, we've just touted some future potential expansions on Transco largely -- either along the Leidy Line or in the Southeastern U.S. and in Gulfstream as well. All those is because of our view of potential power gen growth. And there's something -- and some of it would be actual growth, and some of it is driven by coal plant conversions. There's over 30 gigawatts within -- of potential either conversion or new power build within 50 miles of Transco. And we could see -- we are pursuing about the equivalent of 3 Bcf a day or about $2.5 billion of investment associated with -- or close to Transco right now. Now I'm not saying we're going to get all that. We're in competition for that, but it's a pretty positive outlook for Transco.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","That's great. And then maybe one final question, if I could, either for Rory or maybe for Alan. And this kind of turns up to Canada and just thinking about Williams 10 years ago. You guys had a pretty large Midstream presence in Canada. You obviously have a growing oil sands franchise right now. There's been a lot of shifting landscape up in Canada, claims to BP assets, Pembina Provident, et cetera. And I guess, my question is, do you guys, with all of the liquids-rich structures that they're finding out there, do you guys see an opportunity beyond the oil sands franchise, or is it more just to kind of develop that key area?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, that is a great question. I would tell you that first of all, first and foremost, we are going to make sure that we monetize -- we take full advantage of the great competitive advantage that we have in the oil sands area first. And I would tell you there's a tremendous amount of opportunity to not only capture that existing business but to grow that business further and be able to optimize the value of those streams even better. Our BB splitter that we did in August '10 is a great example of that where we're further optimizing the value of those streams. I would tell you that from our vantage point, that a lot of the oil sands operations are fairly immature in terms of optimizing the value of those resources. And so things like hydrogen that is in big demand out there and will continue to be in big demand. Helium transfer, we think there's a lot of services up there that we have a lot of room to grow that business in. And so I would tell you, we're going to seek out those areas where we have the largest competitive advantages and provide us the highest return. And I would say some of those more competitive areas are going to have a hard time competing with those opportunities. Having said that, we certainly keep our eyes open if we think that some of those projects could demand a return that's competing with our other opportunities that we have both in the U.S. and in Canada.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","For you, one, on the gathering side, there's lots of moving pieces with the acquisition of Laser and the Springville lateral coming online and some declining volumes elsewhere. Do you guys have guidance for us on percent change in volumes in that segment in 2012 and 2013?","Rory Miller","Hang on just a second. Let me check on that.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then while you're looking, do you want me to ask the next one, or do you want me to wait?","Rory Miller","Yes, you can go ahead and ask another question...","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. The other is on NGL market. You guys lowered your NGLs as a percentage of crude. What was -- we all know that prices are low right now. So is it a function of what you're seeing today, or is there something else that's changed in the market that causes you -- caused you to change your guidance?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, I'll take that second question, Becca while. Rory's gathering his info for your first one. I would say that certainly, the current environment has got us a little bearish on that. But I'll also tell you that if you just look historically, if you look at the gas-to-crude ratio or crude-to-gas ratio, and you realize how high that is relative to historical, there is an inverse relationship, generally, that occurs between high crude-to-gas ratio and the NGL-to-crude number. And so even though it seems unprecedented low number on that NGL to crude, we also are unprecedented crude-to-gas ratios as well. And so if you look at the overall margin, I'm not sure that it's that far out of line. And so -- but certainly, the current environment, the very warm winter that we're having, certainly is impacting propane storage. And propane is just as exposed to that as natural gas is. And so that could be a hangover certainly in '12. I think, '13 it's a little early to call, frankly, and we may be a little bit conservative in '13. But I think as we look for both ethane for the balance of this first half of '12 and propane for the balance of the year, that we could see some pressure there just because of what we're seeing in storage volumes on propane right now.","Rory Miller","Becca, just getting back to your question, and you stated it real accurately that there are a lot of moving parts up there on Laser and Springville and the way that they're priced. It gets a little confusing, too. But I think that the thing that we have given some guidance on is kind of where our total capacity is going with Springville. Right now, we're in the 300 range. We'll be going up to 625, 650 over the course of the year on Springville. Laser is going to be up around 1.3 billion a day of capacity. And then Randy talked about the $500 million in a Constitution project. And we also have about $500 million a day of inter-connectivity with Tennessee Gas Pipeline in that field. So that kind of adds up to that 3 Bcf a day of takeaway capacity. And maybe what you ought to keep in mind is that, that is one of the limitations out there. So producers are out scrambling to get takeaway capacity and then drilling to fill that, evidenced by Cabot's willingness to take the full 500 on the Constitution project. So it does take time to build. I think we exited the year, just say on our Springville assets, for instance, and '11 at around $600 million a day. That will be going up by well over 50% by the end of '13. And the Laser -- the whole Laser story is one that's unfolding. It obviously just started up. So volumes are building there. The earning potentials in '12 and '13 are just a shadow of what they're going to be. So we've got a real strong producer group right now behind those assets, and they're going to be ramping up quickly. Cabot, I think, has been pretty transparent about their plans. This is one of WPX's key areas, and they've been having good results out there. And the Carrizo volumes are backed by a drilling carry from reliance. So we're very excited about the opportunities up there, and I think you'll see these producers working hard to take advantage of that takeaway capacity.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","But no specific number for 2012 or 2013 on percent changes?","Rory Miller","No, we haven't offered that up.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just one more data point on the 1.3 Bcf a day capacity on Laser, is -- where is it now? Just so we can get some kind of sense of how we can ramp it up.","Rory Miller","Yes, it's a little over 100 million a day now and that's a pretty dynamic number. But we're obviously in the early days of starting that out.","Donald R. Chappel","Capacity of that.","Rory Miller","Did you say the capacity of that?","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","No, no, the current throughput. I think you answered it, what I was looking for.","Operator","And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the conference back to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong","Okay, great. Well, thank you very much. As we said, we think we continue to have rock solid growth, and it's certainly not dependent on a rising commodity price environment. And if we get some of that and we start to see that at the back half of '12 or '13, we certainly will improve beyond these numbers considerably that we've got it guided for. We're very comfortable with what we have out there, and we think this is great growth in both the cash flows and the dividend that we can continue to produce. And so we're excited about what we have before us, and it's going to be a matter of prioritizing all of these great opportunities to continue to make sure we're executing as well as we have to date. So, thank you again for joining us, and we look forward to talking to you in the future.","Operator","And this concludes today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Dana. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Earlier this morning, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily.","Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions, and we also have the five leaders of Williams' operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; Bob Purgason leads Central; and Jim Scheel leads the Northeast Gathering & Processing area.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to generally accepted accounting principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","We're planning on keeping our call to about an hour. If we miss any of your questions, feel free to follow up with Investor Relations later on today.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Great. Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you've been able to join us this morning and we look forward to discussing our third quarter results here this morning. As you can see from this quarter's results, our organization is firing on all cylinders, and it continues to capture opportunities as we execute against our proven natural gas focused strategy. We're very confident about where we stand today, and our team is aligned and excited about all the great prospects that we've got in front of us.","We've been taking decisive actions to enable steady predictable growth in our EBITDA by steadily increasing our fee-based revenues, lowering our cost and positioning our portfolio of assets to capture growing natural gas volumes. We're making progress on many fronts as we work to execute on our strategy to drive predictable long-term sustainable growth.","We've brought new projects online, renegotiated some win-win contracts with Chesapeake and expect to close on a new agreement in the Barnett soon. And we also completed the sale of our Canadian asset, and as you're aware, we also have now kicked off a process for our Geismar asset. That process is now in full swing.","On the cost savings front, since our cost reduction efforts were initiated at the end of the first quarter this year, we've seen approximately $76 million of lower adjusted cost and expenses at WPZ versus the prior year, and that's all while continuing to add additional new projects and grow the business.","Specifically, we've seen WPZ's total cost and expenses decline from 55% of 2015 adjusted EBITDA to 47% in 2016 for the first nine months. So, an important metric that we're taking into account there, and continue to push that cost component down to a lower percentage of our overall adjusted EBITDA.","We continue to implement steps to further lower our cost by streamlining our organization, and to-date, head count has been reduced by a little over 13% since the beginning of this year.","So today, we'll walk through our results and provide some perspective on where we are relative to guidance and financial performance. Our results here in the third quarter certainly validate the hard work of our teams across Williams. We'll also provide some update on the Atlantic Sunrise project and highlight some of the key growth drivers that are now on horizon.","So, let's move on to slide two. Here as you can see, Williams Partners delivered net income of $326 million as measured by GAAP, and in terms of adjusted EBITDA, every segment of WPZ contributed to the 8% improvement over the third quarter of last year. Our DCF for the quarter was $795 million, which was an increase of 5% over the third quarter of 2015.","As we've been doing consistently, we delivered fee-based revenue growth and we continue to benefit from the aggressive cost reduction activities we've been working on this year. We achieved a coverage ratio of 1.08x at WPZ for the quarter, which excludes the benefit of $150 million IDR waiver that was associated with the sale of our Canadian asset. And as you all know, that sale was finalized, I believe on September 23.","Overall, the quarter's results continue to demonstrate that our strategy is on the mark, so let's just touch briefly on a few of the operating areas, first of all, in the Atlantic-Gulf. The Atlantic-Gulf continues to deliver solid results as we put projects into service that are capturing more and more of the demand on the Transco system. Our adjusted EBITDA came in at $427 million for the quarter compared with $414 million for the third quarter of last year. And for the year, Atlantic-Gulf's adjusted EBITDA increased $53 million so far year-to-date, primarily due to fee-based revenues from offshore operations and Transco's new expansion projects.","The quarter also benefited from incremental volumes that came into our Mobile Bay system from the Destin Pipeline System as we were providing service to volumes that were stranded behind enterprise's path to do a processing plant.","We did see increased operating expenses related to pipeline testing activities as we continue to proactively focus on safety and regulatory programs along our Transco pipeline. Obviously given the tremendous growth on the Transco system, we continue to focus on and ensure the safety and reliability of this critical piece of infrastructure. And so, solid results in the Atlantic-Gulf. As we'll see later, lots of things coming down the pike to prepare for the tremendous growth in this sector of our business.","Moving on now to our Central, Northeast and West. I'd like to cover our non-regulated midstream set of businesses here because we continue to see some common themes emerging across all of these operating areas.","First of all, we have grown their adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year for both the quarter and also year-to-date. As you can see from the chart on the slide, Central is up about 7%, Northeast up 3% and West up 3% on the quarter-to-quarter comparison.","All three of these businesses reported lower operating cost during the quarter. Our leaders and teams are very focused on preserving operational cash flows in today's slower supply growth environment, and we continue to see the benefits of that show-up in our results.","A specific note about the Northeast because I know there's always a lot of extra interest in this particular area. We continue to see steady to slightly increasing volumes there, but this area remains in significant need of incremental takeaway capacity and market in the area.","We believe that both the local and the national demand growth is going to really unlock the area over the next couple of years. But in the meantime, we're staying very focused on the cost containment and achieving the best results for our customers.","Getting all of this critical new midstream plays as well has us positioned for when this tremendous low cost resource really comes on in the next couple of years, and we really do believe that the natural gas demand that we're seeing on the Transco system will call on these constrained supplies once the infrastructure that connects that comes online. The unleashing of this resource and expected dramatic growth in the gathering volumes from this area represents tremendous upside beyond the more visible demand side growth that shows up in our CapEx.","On the NGL-Petchem side, we saw an increase in adjusted EBITDA driven by higher olefins margins and strong operational production levels. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter increased by $51 million to $136 million in the third quarter of 2015. And as I mentioned earlier, we also completed the sale of our Canadian asset, and we are off and running in a big way on our process to monetize Geismar. This Geismar facility and the complex there really is a great asset, and we believe it's a good time to be in the market with the asset. There's a lot of very smart players in this segment, and a recognition of just how well placed this efficient plant is in the Mississippi River market.","So, let's move on now to slide three. As we've been saying, our natural gas focused strategy is proving out and our year-to-date performance certainly validates that. Year-to-date through third quarter of this year, WPZ delivered $286 million in net income and nearly $2.3 billion in DCF, up 8% over the same period last year. And we also achieved a year-to-date coverage ratio of 1.04x at WPZ here so far in 2016.","I'm also pleased to report that we expect to exceed our 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance and also expect to hold coverage above 1.0 times as measured for all of 2016, even with the expected seasonal increase in maintenance CapEx that we generally see in the fourth quarter.","As you can see, all of our operating areas are ahead of where they were a year ago, and you can see the results of our focus on increased fee-based revenues, cost reductions, and the full production and higher margins coming through at Geismar.","Let's move on to slide four. This is a list of a lot of what's going on, and I'm not going to go through each of these items. But really the important thing is, here is this long list of accomplishments that the team continues to execute on. And so, what's really impressive about this is all of the activity that we've got going on that's driving our growth for the future. Just to mention a few here, highlight a few. First of all, look at the number of projects that we began construction on in this quarter. And so, Dalton, Hillabee Phase 1, the New York Bay expansion, and Virginia Southside 2. Our teams really have pushed through the permitting gauntlet on these projects and are now really focused on safely constructing these important expansion projects. We also have a number of projects that were already under construction.","Moving down on the list, the Geismar process, as I mentioned earlier, we have launched that process, and we're really excited about the degree of interest we're seeing there.","And then finally, on the coming soon part down there, in addition to all the projects that we've got going on, we are making a move to simplify our organization further here in 2017, and we're moving from five operating areas to three operating areas, which is going to enable some further cost reductions over and above those that we captured here in 2016.","Moving on to slide five, a picture now of Atlantic Sunrise. Lots of questions, of course, coming out of the announcement from FERC that they were pushing back their approval by about two months. So, Atlantic Sunrise is a very key piece of energy infrastructure that is going to drive, not just jobs in the Northeast and particularly Pennsylvania, but really the overall national economy, as these low cost, very strong gas supplies here in the Northeast are going to enable manufacturing, power generation, and a lot of new trade around the world, for markets around the world for our low-cost natural gas here in the U.S.","So, the Atlantic Sunrise system really does have a unique advantage, in that it's one of the few of these major projects that takes advantage of the existing Transco infrastructure and by building the segment that we have that's just new pipeline in Pennsylvania, all contained within the State of Pennsylvania. We're going to be able to reach markets in a very significant way all the way into the Southeast markets where there's a lot of growing demand, be it coal conversions, natural gas power generation, the industrial markets and, of course, the LNG facility at Cove Point there is an important market for those supplies as well.","So, we announced on last Friday that we expect to begin a portion of service during the second half of 2017 and that we've revised the targeted full in-service date for mid 2018. I would note that, as we have previously, that our financial plan further risks (13:50) the cash flows by approximately six months, and we've already adjusted our growth capital guidance to reflect this analysis.","We revised these dates because FERC now anticipates the completion date of the FEIS for Atlantic Sunrise will be pushed back to December 30, 2016. This adjustment will allow more time for the agency to complete a general conformity analysis and review two minor route alternatives. Additionally, we're focused on expediting the work required to obtain other key permits within the State of Pennsylvania.","To provide a little more context on this, the construction schedule on a project as large as Atlantic Sunrise is very tightly sequenced. Even a minor two-month delay on one aspect can have a ripple effect on other components of the project schedule, some of which are dependent upon lining up with a narrow environmental schedule. So the good news is, we've got about 96% of the survey work done, that means the landowners are cooperating with us in a way to get the survey work done. And we are pushing ahead to get the remaining 4% of that done. So, a lot of activity going on to get the survey work done.","Of course, if you think about the way these windows work, the field survey work has to be done in a period where there's not any snow on the ground, and so that does put some risk into our schedule that, obviously, is the reason that we push some of this back. Because, if we don't get those surveys done before snowfall, and it certainly looks like that's not going to be the case, then we've got to wait to get those final surveys done once we've seen things thaw out there. So, that really is what's driving some of that scheduled push-back. So, again, seems like a simple two months, but it does complicate things, in terms of getting those surveys done in a timely-enough manner.","I will say this about Atlantic Sunrise. This is a situation where the regulatory agencies are being very cautious, given all of the environmental opposition, and it's been focused around pipelines of late. We think that's prudent, and I would tell you that Governor Wolf has been very steadfast in his support for the project, and really all of the critical energy infrastructure project in Pennsylvania, and he continues to be clear in his support through that, with his legislature and with other elected officials in the state, and we really do appreciate his cooperation, as he has a lot of issues to balance. But we certainly support the Governor in making sure that the resources are developed in a way that protects the environment and the health of the citizen. And we share his commitment, and look forward to our continued work with the PADEP there, which is the regulatory agency in Pennsylvania, to meet all these objectives. So, feeling very good about the degree of cooperation and support that we're getting from the State of Pennsylvania, but it's just a matter of people being very cautious in the environment that we're operating.","With that, let's move on to slide six. You can see here the key growth drivers for 2017. Of course, the obvious stuff is the full year impact of a lot of these projects that came on mid-year, and then a lot of new projects that will be coming on in 2017 that you can see listed here. And then, of course, the full year of cost reduction efforts will show up in 2017 as well as likely some additional contributions from the streamlining that I mentioned earlier.","Another consideration, of course, is just the impact that a normal winter would have on the Northeast local market demand for the regional consumption there in the Northeast. And so, if you think about that, there's two ways for gas to move out of those gathering systems in the Northeast. One is the takeaway capacity and we're certainly anxious to see the latest REX expansion come on here towards the end of this year. But in addition to that, we also have the regional consumption and with the very mild winter we had last year, we are hoping to see some incremental demand that would drive gathering volumes in the Northeast as well.","Moving on here to slide seven, really excited about the strengthening of our board and what's going on here in the third quarter as we've added five new members to The Williams' board and we're in the process of recruiting two additional members. The five new members are certainly energy industry experts and each brings significant experience and have unique perspectives they're bringing to the table.","I can tell you firsthand that the new directors, Steve Bergstrom, Steve Chazen, Peter Ragauss, Scott Sheffield, and Bill Spence have hit the ground running and are very engaged in helping us maximize shareholder value. They're working with the rest of the highly-qualified and independent board to keep the management team accountable and focused on our execution as that continues to deliver shareholder value.","I do want to take a moment here to just recognize three members of the board who have chosen to not stand for reelection at our Annual Meeting in November in order to support our ongoing board refreshment efforts. And that is Joe Cleveland, John Hagg, Juanita Hinshaw, and really all three have given tremendous service to Williams over the years. They've been involved with us and we're extremely grateful for their leadership, commitment to the company and to our stockholders. Williams' stockholders can certainly be confident that this independent board is working diligently on its behalf and we, as a management team, are really excited about that.","With that, we'll move on to slide eight. So, today the premier natural gas asset base in the nation is delivering fee-based revenue that amounts to about 93% of WPZ's gross margin. There's tremendous demand growth occurring and continuing to come down the pike, and Transco is the energy lifeline that physically connects Williams to that growth.","The team has delivered continuous growth and the third quarter of 2016 is no exception. We believe that the natural gas focused strategy that we're executing on has us exactly where we need to be today and well-positioned for a large degree of upside in the future as the natural gas market grows on the back of this very low-cost resource base, and we'll really draw on the Northeast and drive strong growth in our volumes in the Northeast, as that occurs. We're continuing to capture fee-based opportunities. We're reinvesting in Williams' Partners and we've taken swift, decisive actions to strengthen the balance sheet, reduce risk, and focus on driving shareholder value.","So, once again, we thank you very much for joining us today. And, with that, let's move on to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go first to T.J. Schultz with RBC Capital Markets.","T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thanks. Maybe if I can just start with Geismar, just any color at this point on your bent toward an outright sale or to try to convert to a tolling structure. And then if you could just discuss what type of counterparties you're engaging with under each scenario, that may be helpful, too. Thanks.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. Thank you very much for the question. We remain open. We're going to look to whatever the best value is in terms of those two opportunities. I would say on the sell side, of course, it's going to be a party that we're confident that can close the transaction swiftly and puts a very best value proposition on the table. As to the tolling arrangement, a little more dependent on the personal nature there because I think somebody we would be involved with for the long term and, of course, it would have to be somebody with a strong credit to stand behind the obligations of the tolling agreement.","So, I would just say we remain open to both, but we'll have to see what the best value comes through there. I will say really long, long and large list of parties engaging with us on that, and we're really excited to see the way that asset is positioned in the market right now.","T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks. I guess, just one more on Atlantic Sunrise with that push-out, kind of two parts. I guess, first, with that risked I think in your financial plan by six months, do you essentially have that full service in your plan for the beginning of 2019? And then the second part, just given that timeline or even if we assume it comes online in mid-2018, I guess, the question is just really around the DRIP or more WMB support, does that change the timing or how long or what degree you would need to keep participating? Or is there any other support you may need in 2018 as you kind of \u2013 keeping that IG rating at WPZ?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Great. Thank you very much for the question. I'll take the first part of that and I'll turn the second half over there to Don for the financing side of that.","In terms of the schedule, I think couple of key things that are coming through in the change in the schedule. First of all, really excited to be announcing that we're going to be able to bring on the mainline portion of that project, which is obviously really important in the Northeast, to take gas out of the Northeast down into the Southeast markets that we'll be able to do that in the second half of 2017. So, that's pretty exciting.","Then there's another section that we likely would be able to bring on, which would be the pipeline, the new pipeline itself that would come on second and as soon as it was constructed would come on second. And then finally, and this is where that final date that we talk about would be the compressor stations that are on the new pipeline, not the existing but brand new compressor stations that would come on to add some incremental volume to the project. And that part would come on six months after the mid-2018 so whether you want to call that, end of 2018 or first part of 2019 is going to splitting hairs a little bit there perhaps, but that is what our expectation are.","But I think very important is the amount of volumes that we can bring on with the first section coming online in the second half of 2017 and then later the pipeline section that would be carrying gas out of the Susquehanna County and Bradford County areas, and that would be coming on ahead of that final section, which would be in our risk financial segment would be either very end of 2018. And so, I think in terms of the clarifying that our team is very focused on bringing this mid-2018 date to reality. But, as always, we put further financial risk into our plan to allow for all the regulatory uncertainties that all of us in the pipeline industry are facing these days.","So, with that, I'll turn it over to Don to talk about the financing side.","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. Thanks, Alan. Certainly, the target date change or our financial plan date change related to ASR reduces the 2017 CapEx and related financing needs somewhat. We're not making any, I'll call it, formal change in our financing plans at this point as we continue to drive our credit metrics up or improve, I'll say it that way, in an effort to ensure that we have strong credit metrics, we get credit from the agencies, and we continue to delever WPZ and WMB. But nonetheless, the fact that there's less of a bubble in 2017 I think is helpful in terms of 2017's financing plan. But I think, as you point out, it does push some of the capital into 2018. As to how we'll finance that, we're not prepared to provide any guidance on that today.","T.J. Schultz - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Brandon Blossman with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Just a quick follow-up on Atlantic Sunrise. So, I guess, one, it's (27:39) to say that the vast majority of the permitting or regulatory risk resides with the greenfield portion of the pipe and not the new compression stations on the mainline, is that correct?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","That is correct. And just to be clear, most of the work on the mainline is just turning around. And for those involved in the project, they'll scold me on this when I say just, but it's a matter of redoing a lot of the station piping on those existing compressor sites that is required at the second half of 2017 in-service for the mainline.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","And then as we think about second half 2018 in-service for mainline reversals, how should we think about EBITDA associated with that? And in terms of contracts or counterparties and who can actually flow on that portion of the line?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Of course, we'll be working through that. I would tell you that we've seen a lot of strong interest and people have started to acknowledge that that likely would occur, and that's what we've done in the past as well. When we've had projects come on that have involved mainline, we opened up that capacity, as it's been made available. So, we don't have any specifics on that yet in terms of how much that EBITDA would be, but it will allow for some pretty significant flows to the South coming out of the mainline in Southeast Pennsylvania area there. So, other big interconnects coming off of other pipelines will now have a way South.","And I think if you think about how the demand would look, all you need to look at is Zone 6 on Transco versus the Southeast market, you see that differential there, and you would see the amount of demand that would be available for that capacity. So, we're not going to pin that down yet because we haven't finalized the negotiations for that but, obviously, there's plenty of demand for that service.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Thanks, Alan. And then switching gears back to Geismar, obviously, a very good quarter, Q3. Last quarter, Q2, you had said or mentioned that at least to some degree you're holding back inventory to sell onto Q3 on expectations of better margins. Obviously, you got that. Just in terms of capacity factors in-quarter for Geismar and inventory levels, are you thinking about anything like that again for Q4, in terms of holding back some production?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I'll turn that to John Dearborn, who is on the line with us.","John R. Dearborn - Williams Partners GP LLC","Yeah. Thanks, Brandon, and thanks for your interest in Geismar. Geismar has been running extraordinarily well, very reliably, and we're really pleased to be able to deliver ethylene again reliably to the market, and we've proven that out now for a year.","As to your specific question about inventory, we came out of the first quarter with about 30 million pounds of inventory. We sold our full production during this past quarter. We held some inventory coming through this quarter with an expectation that \u2013 we pushed that expectation out into the fourth quarter, because we still do have a belief that some of these crackers that have been challenged in the third quarter will remain to be challenged in the fourth, and we may still see some better margin. So we actually, coming through the third quarter, built a little bit of inventory here on hopes that now the fourth quarter is going to give us a little bit of a better return on that.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you, John. Great color. That's it for me.","John R. Dearborn - Williams Partners GP LLC","Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Brandon.","Operator","We'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Maybe just on the earnings, if I could start with Atlantic-Gulf. You had a big step up in your non-regulated fee revenues versus what you did in the second quarter of 2016. I'm just trying to figure out the drivers there. Is this the new run rate? And then, I think you mentioned you got more volumes on Destin as well, because of Pascagoula being down. Maybe you can give us a number there, on how much that impacted you?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. Thank you for the question. Certainly, the big driver for second versus third quarter and 3Q was having both the Tubular Bells business online, and remember, that had 30 days of shut-in in the second quarter as we tied in \u2013 as we did some of the work for the tie-in on Gunflint during the second quarter. So second quarter was abnormally low because of that big shut-in. But here in the third quarter, both Kodiak, Gunflint, and Tubular Bells were all producing. And so some improvements are going on out there. In fact, we've completed the mechanical completion on the second phase of the Gunflint capacity out there, so a lot of important work still going on out there in terms of enabling further flows.","So, that was a big driver. Then, as we did mention, the Pascagoula plant was down, and our team went to work very quickly to make some big offshore interconnect in the July timeframe, June and July timeframe, that enabled us to bring that gas in very quickly. So great work on the team's part of getting that work, first getting it permitted, and then very quickly bringing it on. So, that didn't just fall on our laps, it was great work on the team's part to get that in.","We expect that, I think, enterprise have said they expect to start bringing Pascagoula back up in December now. And so, we would expect to get a couple of months in now here in the fourth quarter from that. And, in terms of impact, I don't think we specifically said how much that was, but you can see some of the impact to our volume, I think it was about 200 million a day, maybe 210 million of volume that's come in to the system from that. Just to get an idea of what that's done to gathering volumes in the Eastern Gulf.","John R. Dearborn - Williams Partners GP LLC","Alan, some of that shows up in fee revenues, some of that shows up in liquids margin as well. So, it's not all impacting fee revenue, I might just point that out.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks, John.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's very helpful. Thank you. And then, if we can just talk through your renewed Barnett gathering agreement. Some of the parameters or assumptions you are making to get to that $240 million loss of undiscounted cash flows, I think you put in the press release. So, there are volume assumptions behind that. Can you quantify what percentage of Henry Hub the new gathering agreement's at? Maybe what other things we should be thinking about in terms of rig count or what not to get to that number?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Let me have Bob Purgason take that, please?","Robert S. Purgason - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Let me just kind of recap what we've done. Is right \u2013 we traded the minimum volume commitment numbers for, in essence, a percentage-of-NYMEX contract. For competitive reasons, we're not ready to say what percentage of NYMEX that is, but it's set to, in fact, hopefully incent the drill bit. In addition, we have contractual obligations for the producer there to spend certain amounts of money on drilling and recompletion work during the next two years of the contract. So, we're anticipating that we'll at least lessen the decline, maybe even get some pick up, depending on what the completion technology does today. And it's really \u2013 the cash difference that we indicated was the difference between that absolutely no MVC and what our projected volume and revenue difference was during the period through mid-2019, when the MVCs ended. On a present value basis, we picked that up and it's a present value neutral transaction to us, but we did have a slight cash difference in the next two years.","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","And this is Don. I'll just add that the price assumption that we had, I think, when we put out the disclosure was basically forward strip prices at the time. And a modest amount of arresting of the decline. So, again, the drilling that Bob described would slow the decline somewhat.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. And then, just a follow-up on Atlantic Sunrise. So, are you in a position where you can tell us the amount of volume you'll actually move on these, sounds like three phases, the main line and then the new pipeline and then the compression, or are you still working through that?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yes, we are. So, we haven't detailed that out yet. We are working on that. I would tell you that, of course, the mainline will be prepared for \u2013 move all of the volume South of the project, but it's got to have deliveries from the North, pressures from the North to be able to do that. So that'll be somewhat dependent on what comes in from other interconnects in terms of really getting down to a specific volume coming from the Northeast. So, said another way, it's not going to be finite because we don't know exactly what the other interconnects are capable of delivering into that.","Secondly, the pipeline portion, what's called the Central Penn and we just referred to as Northcentral Penn coming out of Susquehanna County, that pipeline will be capable of delivering a very large portion of the volumes from the North without the compression during most of the year. And so, in other words, just depending on other operating conditions on the pipeline, but it will be a very substantial portion of the available volumes from the North.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. But you're not upsizing the site? In other words, the 1.7 dekatherms a day I think, that is still confident for (37:59).","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","That is correct. That's right.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. That's it for me. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Just a couple of quick clarifications to some of your earlier responses. When you had said that there was a lot of interest in Geismar, does that mean that the data room is now open and people have actually expressed interest formally or is it just more in conversations?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No. The formal. We have opened that and we're in the process of getting all the NDRs (38:38) resolved, but that process hasn't actually kicked off.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then in some of your responses about the Atlantic-Gulf performance, I was wondering if I can ask the question in a different way. The level of EBITDA generation this quarter, does that fully reflect the run rate for the new plants that came online, Kodiak and so forth? Or is there a little bit more to step up there as well too?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. We always hate to get ahead of the producers and their announcements of volumes out there. But I would tell you, I think, Hess has been pretty clear that they've been doing some rework on their wells out there on the Tubular Bells field. And as well, as I mentioned earlier, we did in the quarter complete \u2013 get to the mechanical completion part for the Phase 2 of Gunflint \u2013 for Gunflint, which allows additional capacity for both Gunflint and Tubular Bells out there. So, we would expect to see some improved volumes coming on here into the fourth quarter and first quarter of next year from those prospects.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And one last final question. Alan, you guys have been fairly successful in bringing down cost for over a year at this stage right now if I sort of think about it. Your head count is down 13% I think you said earlier in the call. Should we think about this kind of level of O&M and SG&A as kind of the go forward rate? Or do you see incremental opportunities to bring down costs further on a go forward basis? How should we think about this sequentially I guess is my question.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you. First of all, I'll talk about the kind of the two issues that balance that. First of all, on the overhead and management side, our team is very committed to continuing to put pressure against the overhead cost side of our business, as well as the direct operating expense. When you go into an area, for instance like the Northeast, and you are rapidly growing things, it's very hard to really streamline your operations and really focus on cost reduction, at the same time you're trying to build up staff, training people and get your operation safe and reliable.","And so, that business, as it's gained its scale and its footprint is very well positioned and out to really take out some cost, likewise our Central area has just done a tremendous job there because, if you think about the pattern of growth and build out that had gone there for several years, that has slowed down in terms of that pattern of build out. And so, the management team has done a great job of redirecting their focus as a management team on safe and reliable and even more cost efficient operations. And of course, out West, that team has taken that on kind of as their mantra and they're very, very focused on constantly lowering their unit cost. So, that's really driving a lot of that in terms of the cost reduction. I do think it's sustainable on the one hand.","On the other hand, I would tell you that as we go into the pipeline operations, a lot of need to make sure that these pipelines are maintained extremely well. And I always tell people, I think that's a really terrible place to try to save money is in the place of doing a great job of maintaining your assets safely and particularly in these critical areas along the Transco and Northwest Pipeline and Gulfstream routes. And so, that's an area that I think, as you've seen a little bit in this quarter, we had a lot of hydro testing and repairs on the Leidy system and quite frankly we're not going to shy away from improving the system there whenever we have an opportunity to do that. And so, that's the cost side that will probably continue to pressure us up on the one side, but I think on the cost efficiency side and overall day-to-day cost, we'll continue to have opportunity to push that down.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Cool. All right, Alan. Thank you very much. Really appreciate the color.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Faisel Khan with Citi.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thank you. Good morning. Just a few questions. First, on the balance sheet, you guys are clipping away as you're revolving your debt balance at the WMB level, looks like $260 million a quarter. How long \u2013 I guess, what's the game plan for the pay down of debt at the MB level? How far do you want to take that debt level down?","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Faisel, this is Don. I think the amount that we're able to take it down in the quarter was aided by the Canadian proceeds. So, we don't see that same opportunity over the next several quarters. We do have a plan to, I would say, that continue to chip away at The Williams debt. But it'll be at a modest pace for the foreseeable future.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got you. And then the $250 million investment in WPZ common units, were there any other third-parties that participated in that placement?","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","That was a private placement. It wasn't offered to any third-parties. We'll take a look at what the DRIP program that will be upcoming here in the very near future. We'll see what that holds.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then on the cost of the Sunrise project, was there any change in the cost given the slight pushback in the timeline?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No. We still are maintaining our cost targets on that front.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then, if I look at \u2013 going back to your, Alan, your comments around the volumes that will come online in the second half. So, is it fair to say that on the Leidy Southeast line which is, I guess, 0.5 Bcf a day that you'll be able to flow that entire volume down South in the second half of 2017? I think that's what I was trying to figure out if you're getting towards, but maybe I got it wrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. It's kind of hard to know exactly who will take that space on the main line. So, anybody that's got gas trapped in Zone 6 that can get in into the system. So, you have, of course, you have the big Texas Eastern TEMAX project that connects just north of this point. And so, there's a lot of \u2013 the expansion goes just north of that point. So, there's a lot of big interconnects like that that could supply gas into this and it'll just be a question of who wants to \u2013 where the gas is the cheapest I suspect as to where \u2013 whoever takes that capacity and utilizes that capacity, which would likely be the existing holders of the capacity for the full project. I suspect that given in the money that will be, I would be surprised if they don't take that. And if they do, it's just going to be a matter of where they buy the cheapest gas in the area to move it south.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","And just how far south was that move, I guess from Station 210 or 195, and how far south will you be able to move it in the second half of 2017?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. So, that will be the full expansion that goes all the way to Station 85 at its further extent. And of course, one of the big delivery points there is to the Cove Point delivery point is one of the big takeaways for that. But the capacity kind of as designed goes all the way to Station 85.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got you. And the last question from me. Just on the MVC in the quarter, I guess if I look at the adjustments or the add backs, that add back is a cash item or a non-cash item that's being actually added to adjusted EBITDA?","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Faisel, in the quarter, that's a non-cash item, so it's, I'll call it, a contractually expected MVC. Now, that will all be settled as we close the Barnett transaction with that $754 million payment.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got you. Great. Thanks, guys.","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yes.","Operator","We'll go next to Darren Horowitz with Raymond James.","Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Alan, considering the currently expected Northeast takeaway project in-service dates across the board on the east side of the Marcellus and Utica, what impact do you think that's going to have on basis differentials over the next few quarters, specifically Dominion South, TETCO M2 versus Henry Hub?","And more importantly, how do you think the Northeast market gets further rationalized regarding the amount of marketed pipe capacity versus that big growing magnitude of supply growth that's waiting on pipe to get out of the basin?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I think that's such a complex issue because it's very dependent on where the gas is. It's very dependent on what outlet markets each of that gathering volumes. I would say some of the big players that have done a great job, and I would include Cabot in that group that have done a great job of going out and finding incremental markets, whether it's local power generation that's coming on and have really used their scale to go out aggressively and capture some of those markets will be the parties that are advantaged.","And so, this isn't the first time we as an industry have seen something like this. We saw this in the Rockies back when we had a $2.75 basis differential, and it worked itself out over time. People started to think it was never going to \u2013 we were never going to come over that barrier. And, today, we sit there with basis differentials of around 5%, often less in the Rockies today. So, I think we'll eventually get there. But it is a complex question, just given all the number of projects that are coming on and the interconnectivity of the pipelines to be able to address that. So, I would say that I think the Southwest markets probably are going to be picking up hopefully the REX expansion here in the very near future, which will be helpful to that area.","And then, I think Atlantic Sunrise will be the next big adder to that area as we unload all that gas trapped up in Zone 6 on Transco with those projects coming online. And I do think that will \u2013 to your question, I do think that Atlantic Sunrise coming on will improve the Dominion South basis just because you got so much capacity between coming over on the TEMAX project that will have a chance to move South as well. That's pretty well trapped up there in that Zone 6 area today. So, I think it's going to take time for all these projects to come on, but I do think that we will see that basis collapse pretty substantially as we get into 2018.","Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then as a follow-up, just quickly on the discussion around Zone 6 on Transco, thinking about, as you mentioned, all that gas trapped behind the pipe. Over the next few quarters, what do you think that means for potential IT opportunities either back-haul initiatives at better economics or maybe just incremental EBITDA pull-through from walk-up shippers that are trying to arb basis? How do you think that plays out specifically for Northeast G&P profitability over the next couple of quarters?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I think the market need to take advantage any time there is any little opportunity. And I would tell you, I think the market has been in this situation long enough now up there. It's probably rooted out most of the easy stuff in terms of little IT.","Now, Transco is a good example of that where we've had Leidy limited on capacity here most of the summer. And that just got released and so that was held back because we had some pressure limitations on that pipeline that we needed to do some inspection before we returned to full pressure. We've done that. And so, that's a big \u2013 will be a positive in terms of incremental volumes out of the area.","I actually think the biggest driver for incremental volumes out of the area is going to be the local load, as we hopefully have a more normal winner in the Northeast. That's actually going to allow for the local load to absorb some of that gas. And if that occurs, there will be some incremental IT opportunities on days when we could move the volumes out of the system because we've got good pressures and good load in the area. So, I think that's what you \u2013 probably the biggest driver for incremental IT is probably local load in the basin.","Darren C. Horowitz - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Most of my questions have been hit. I had one quick follow-up. On Geismar, as you sort of further the strategic alternatives here, do you have a sense for when you will choose to go either way, with a toll or a sale?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Again, it'd be sometime when we see all the bids in the door, but I would expect that'd be towards the end of the first quarter, probably, before we would know which way we were going on them.","Danilo Juvane - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. That's it for me. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning, Sharon.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","I was wondering if you could touch on, I guess, the new G&P contracts in the Powder River Basin and the potential impacts on cash flow, as well as any discussions about re-contracting in the Eagle Ford with Chesapeake?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah, sure. I'll take the Eagle Ford question, and I'll let Walt Bennett take the Niobrara question. On the Eagle Ford, I would just say that there's a lot of talk about that, but I think from our perspective, we're pretty happy with where we sit there. And we think that there's good business to be had by increasing volumes in the area which will, of course, serve to lower the rate just through lower volumes. And so, there may be some opportunity as we found in other areas, there may be some opportunities for marginal improvement there. But I think, from our perspective, we like the business out there and are anxious to see Chesapeake continue to be more and more successful, as they have been in their technical accomplishments out there. And so, we're excited to continue to work with them to see those volumes expand.","And I'll turn the Niobrara question back to Walt.","Walter J. Bennett - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. Thank you, Alan. So, on the Niobrara contract that we have agreement of terms on now, and we're working to finalize that into a definitive agreement. The way to think about that is that that will keep EBITDA near-term pretty steady for that gathering and processing system. And what we did in the agreement with Chesapeake is really aligned both the interests of Chesapeake and Jackalope, which is the JV between Williams and Crestwood, to make sure that it was incenting development of some of the other formations there. So, we got dedication of additional formations that we didn't have previously, and it allows Chesapeake to go out and explore those economically and see what the upside may be. So, as I said, it will be pretty consistent for EBITDA in the near term, and then there's definitely potential longer term as those new zones get explored, and hopefully Chesapeake is very successful at that.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks. That's helpful.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Great. Thanks, Walt.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","And just another question in terms of guidance. Given the strong quarter as well as your project updates, any change in 2016 guidance, as well as your leverage targets and potential distribution growth target for 2018?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. No, we haven't put anything out beyond 2016. And as I mentioned in my comments, we do expect to exceed the earlier guidance that we put out for 2016, but we haven't put a specific number on that. I think our business, if you look at how steady we've been in growing the business, I think it's fairly predictable here as we go \u2013 within a fairly tight range as we go into 2016 \u2013 or sorry, as we end 2016 \u2013 but we certainly expect to beat the earlier guidance for 2016. And we'll be making some decisions about when we announce the 2017 number, but certainly would intend to do that by the time we announce the fourth quarter where \u2013 either at the time we announce fourth quarter results or before that, for 2017. So, that's about all we have to offer on that.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning, Craig.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","On Geismar \u2013 and I appreciate the update on the timing on that. If you did go up for a sale versus long-term tolling, how do you envision the impact on the DRIP with that? Could you materially reduce the amount of equity being raised through 2017?","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Craig, this is Don. I think it would depend on the sales price, and we would likely have a conversation with the rating agencies as well. So, obviously, we can lose EBITDA in the process. But qualitatively, the EBITDA is margin EBITDA, so just depending on where margins are. So, I think that will be something we'll decide once we see what the numbers look like from the process, and then take a look at what we think that means and have a conversation with the agencies.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Well, on that note, Don, obviously, given your enterprise multiple, a Geismar sale would be cash flow dilutive, but nobody is going to give those cash flows based on margins at the same kind of credit that they would, all these fee-based projects you're bringing on over the next couple of years, that could be being built at similar multiples. So, how much credit do you see the rating agencies giving you in terms of just derisking the business with the Geismar sale?","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Craig, I think that's unknown at this point. So, I think that will be dependent on kind of where margins are and really the rating agency point of view. So, you'd have to stay tuned for that. I think that's something that we'll know as we get closer to the end of the first quarter.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. And last question. Any updates on the broader industry M&A process?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Craig, no updates on that. I will say in terms of your prior question, we'll be down to around, I think, 2.5% of our business if we execute on a Geismar sale as well as the Canadian sale will be down to around 2.5% of our gross margin coming from direct commodity margins. And so, we would expect that certainly deserves some attention by the rating agencies. And so, I appreciate you pointing that out. But no, we don't have any updates on broader M&A picture.","Craig K. Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll go next to Becca Followill with the U.S. Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Good morning, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Just back on Atlantic Sunrise, can you \u2013 I know you talked a little bit about volumes. Can you talk about when you start getting paid when the contracts kick in on the project? Does it wait until the entire thing is done or at least the portion that's without the compression in Pennsylvania?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No, Becca. The way that would work is that \u2013 and as we've done in past situations, it would just be putting capacity and early in-service and people could elect, if they chose to, to pay the full contracted rate for the project to \u2013 for that portion of the service that's made available early. So, that's the way that works.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","So, you're saying that you wouldn't get the contracted volumes until mid-2018 and it would be IT in the interim?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No. The same service would be made available. Of course, that goes through a FERC process, just to be very clear. So, it's kind of not prudent for us to predict exactly how the FERC would (01:00:46). But in previous situations, we've been able to sell that service for whoever wants to take that firm available capacity in the earliest since they have a limited service, they don't have the full extent of the service available to them. Again, that is subject to the FERC's determination on that as we would apply to put portions in service early.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","And then can you clarify, in the Pennsylvania portion of the line, how much capacity the compression adds?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","That's very determined by the pressures on the downstream system and whether the system is operating full design pressure. If the system is operating at normal operating conditions, it would be pretty substantial in getting up near 80% to 90% of the volumes. And on below normal days, even higher than that without that compression (01:01:49).","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","I think I'll follow-up because I'm unclear on that answer. And then, do you have any \u2013 how much volumes are shut in on your system in the Northeast in Q3?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No, we're not providing that this quarter. And mostly just because our customers have not wanted us to be advertising what that is for the benefits of their markets and we certainly want to be respectful of that.","I will say, back on your earlier question, it's simply a matter that you have a pipeline in service, the compression is designed to make sure that you can have adequate pressures on the system and deliver at full design situation. So, when the pipeline does go into service, but you may not be at full peak design demands on the system, obviously, you can move more gas when you're off peak. And so, that's the reason that's not a simple question. I mean, it's very dependent on what the operating conditions are on the pipeline at the time.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude today's question-and-answer session.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Porter","Thank you, Corina. Good morning and welcome. As always we thank you for your interest in Williams. As you know yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include the press release of our results, with related schedules and our analyst package, a presentation on our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong and an update to our quarterly data book which contain the detailed information regarding various aspects of the business. ","This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments and then we will open the discussion up for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our midstream business, and Randy Barnard is here from our gas pipeline business. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to any questions. ","In yesterday's presentation, and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. ","Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to generally accepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials. So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Thank you, John, and good morning to everybody. Thanks for joining us. I know it's a busy day for earnings releases. ","Certainly, you've have all seen the strong financial results for the quarter, so this morning I hope to provide just some color around the business fundamentals that provide great transparency around the projects and the business growth that it supports our confidence in a sustainable high-growth dividend for WMB. ","First of all, our quarter came out to about 8% above consensus due, to I believe, a combination of mild weather and continued growth in revenues from our recent capital investments that continue to ramp up. And then as well, the high ethylene margins in the first quarter as well. I think we're higher than most people expected. So let me hit on just a few of these things real quickly. ","First of all, the mild weather, how that impacted us -- drove lower natural gas prices which of course improved our NGL margins despite some lower NGL prices. The very low natural gas prices actually helped prop up our key pulse margins. ","Secondly, and probably less obvious is the fact that we had great operating performance during the quarter. Because normally in the first quarter, we have a lot of freeze offs of production from our producers and so forth. So in this period, we did not experience very much of that at all. So we've enjoyed the mild weather in those 2 ways. ","Secondly, as I mentioned, the projects that we continue to bring online continue to grow our fee-based revenues and actually, in the midstream the fee-based revenues were up 19%. And really this was due to a combination of issues. ","First of all, as I mentioned, projects that we've been investing in over the last couple of years continue to ramp up, namely, the Perdido Norte volumes continuing to come up, the Echo Springs -- fourth train at Echo Springs continue to enjoy more and more volumes from the Piceance. And the Northeast Pennsylvania assets were up and certainly the volumes there grew actually by a little over 160%. As well at our Markham, our new expansion at Markham, that also experienced new fee-based volumes from the Eagle Ford as well. So really across the board, a lot of the investments we've been making for the last several years really starting to pan out in terms of driving our fee-based revenues, particularly within midstream. ","These 2 factors also drove strong operating statistics, the mild weather and the new projects online. Our NGL production was actually up 18%. Our gathering volumes were up 19%. ","Of course, most of our capital expansion in our processing business has been fee-based so our equity gallons were only up 7% and I think probably the main driver for that is the fact that our, again as I mentioned, our plants were up and running more during the first quarter than we saw in the first quarter of '11. ","Certainly the lower -- sorry, the higher ethylene prices were driven by the lower ethane prices during the quarter. And we continue to see strong demand for ethylene in that area, particularly there was a lot of outages and it drove the ethylene demand even higher in the area. So, pretty excited about the way that business is helping support our overall combined MD revenue. ","And then certainly, our gas pipe growth continues on a steady pace as well, we actually saw a 6% growth in our fee-based revenues in our gas pipes areas as well. ","And so, while we're certainly excited to see this continued strong growth in our fee-based revenues, we are not surprised because our project development and project execution continues to be the underpinning for our confidence in dividend growth of 20% in 2013 and 2014 on the back of the WPZ distribution growth of 8 -- 10% and of course continued growth in our MC&O area as well, even though we are putting a very high coverage ratio as we explained to you on that. ","Certainly, the risk-reducing investment we intend to make in our ethylene-cracking capacity continues to support that dividend growth as well. ","Looking ahead and even beyond the guidance period, you can see many of our larger projects don't even start up until 2014. And many of these investments are just reaching stride in 2015, like the recent Caiman acquisition, our Canada expansion that's continuing and certainly Northeast Pennsylvania with acquisitions like Laser really continuing to grow very steadily beyond the guidance period. ","And as we mentioned several times before, we continue to be very encouraged by the amount of demand for services on Transco, as the market continues to look -- to take advantage of low priced natural gas. ","So the opportunities really do just keep coming at us and we are fortunate to have a great operating and project management talent on board. And we certainly are mobilizing a lot of that talent from all over our system right now, help deliver these great opportunities safety, on-time and on budget and we're proud of the track record we continue to build in that regard. ","So taking full advantage of North America's abundant natural gas and gas liquids resources, it is certainly going to take a tremendous amount of infrastructure, as demand for these great resources grows and continues to drive volumes on our infrastructure. And we certainly think Williams is the best positioned company to deliver the critical infrastructure required to take advantage of these great resources. ","And I'll also remind you our Analyst Day webcast is May 22, and we look forward to being able to describe in some more detail all of the great projects that continue to drive our confidence and our growth. And with that, I'll turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Alan, I think when we last spoke in March, I guess with the Caiman acquisition, there was hopes may be that by this time, we might have a little bit more color on the follow-on Utica joint venture. Is there anything additional you can share at this point?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. We still are under a confidentiality agreement there and so not ready to be able to disclose that in full detail. We're certainly expecting for our May 22 Analyst Day to lay that out in some more detail. So that would be our hope for this point. I really don't see any reason that won't occur at this point. It's just a matter of finalizing some things and dotting the Is and crossing the Ts on that.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, appreciate that. And just a lot of different projects kind of moving on, moving around. One of the latest is the Atlantic Access project of course kind of getting reengineered as I understand it, with respect to kind of what your customers came back to you on. It looks like a lot more paths are being, I guess, viewed access. But I wasn't sure with the Southern Pennsylvania sort of a new pipeline. It looked like it was being downsized. And I guess at the end, I'm trying to kind of figure out is this a proposal, that from a capital dollar standpoint? From investment standpoint, is this something that has, is getting larger, is getting smaller? I\u2019m just trying to better understand the moving parts.","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. I'll take that and Frank Ferazzi is on the line and if there's any detailed required data into that, Frank, you can do so. I would just say that probably one of the biggest changes about the project is the fact that by doing some of it along the Leidy Line, it allows us to do it in a scalable fashion. And so growing into the increments that the market is requiring. And so that's probably one of the big changes. In terms of the southern-most route, it is really a matter of delaying that. But certainly what we are trying to do here is add flexibility. Having said all that, right now, the project as laid out is larger both in terms of capital dollars and volumes than we originally expected. And primarily that is driven by demand along the Leidy route that came in as a result of the open season. As you recall, we opened that leg up to the Northwest, that leg up to butler to the Northwest and saw some very strong demand on that leg. So we had to decide how we best serve that load in Northwest PA, particularly volumes coming down from Northern PA as well.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great, that's perfect color. And then just one final question if I could, and this actually kind of goes to the equity volumes if you will at midstream PC [ph]. Notwithstanding sort of first quarter being -- over first quarter of last year wells, freeze-offs and the like, we were down slightly from the fourth quarter. Between the fourth quarter and the first quarter, is this sort of your kind of expected run rate for the equity volumes as pretty much everything else kind of comes in on the fee basis?","Rory L. Miller","This is Rory Miller, I'll take that question. I think the levels that we're at now are pretty indicative of where we're going to be as we contract for new business. Most of it's going to be fee-based, consistent with our strategy. And frankly consistent with what most of the producers want. They need to see those margins back at the wellhead in order to keep their drilling rigs moving in the richer areas. So I think we'll be able to maintain that for the foreseeable future. At some point, it probably starts to fall off. But I think that's -- that 300 million gallon per quarter range is a pretty good spot to be thinking about our equity launch.","Operator","And next we'll go with Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You and the Marcellus talked about gathering, getting up to gathering about 5 bcf a day by 2015. How much are you gathering now? And can you talk about just any, what needs to happen to get to that 5? And sort of any concerns you have over the big gas environment over the next couple of years impeding that?","Rory L. Miller","Yes. This is Rory again, I'll take that. Just doing some quick math there. We'll probably turn volumes -- bcf, 1.1 bcf a day of current volumes gathered. And I'm including the Caiman asset in those numbers, which actually is closed tomorrow. So I maybe gun jumping just a little bit there, but just so you have some context to that question. The path to go from there to the 5 bcf a day number that we've shown in all of our materials, it's really around construction and that is not a straight-line event. I think we've been pretty candid about some of the challenges, but I think we've got the right team in place. We've got the broad resources across the organizations drawn and we continue to refine that construction effort up there. But that's kind of the critical path. The producers have a lot of the same challenges. So a lot if it is just working through the process and refining the process that would get wells drilled and connected up in the Northeast and it gets better every month. So I'm very optimistic about the progress that we're making. But that's probably one of the bigger challenges. And of course we're actively working with the regulators and the local governmental authorities that set the rules out there. And I think there's a pretty good dialogue going now and it's getting better. So it's moving in the right direction.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And you guys are moving much more towards fee revenues now. Are you seeing at all pushback from producers in well or gas or ethane price environment to not be as fee-based and want you guys to take on more risk? Or is that just not the case right now?","Rory L. Miller","We have not seen that. That's probably a short answer. But I don't know that it requires much elaboration either. The -- most of the producers, when they do get a chance to recontract are interested in getting that exposure to their -- the NGLs and their gas.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And my final question, you have a mandatory Transco rate case coming in March of '13. Is there -- can you elaborate at all? Is there anything we should expect out of that materially?","Alan S. Armstrong","Frank, you want to take that, please?","Frank Ferazzi","Yes, we do have as part of the settlement of our last rate case, we do have a filing requirement. Filing will actually be made in September of this year and we will file an increase. And so the commission will suspend it for 5 months until the rates will become effective March of 2013 and we're expecting a rate increase. It's difficult at this point to quantify exactly how much it's going to be.","Operator","The next we'll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","A couple of questions. Alan, in your recorded remarks online, you mentioned that the long-term growth was of course excluding any incremental M&A. And kind of it struck me with Laser having just closed in February and Caiman closing out tomorrow that for you to say that in your prepared remarks, well it sounded like there is more appetite despite all this activity. And I just thought you might want to flesh that out a little bit.","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I certainly didn't intend to comment on anything other than the fact that our previous guidance hadn't included those acquisitions and certainly this hadn't. So I would tell you for right now, I\u2019d say we certainly feel like we have our plate full, in terms of things that are back-end loaded cash flows much like Caiman and Laser are. So I wouldn't read too much into that other than we'd be making it very clear that all that is in there is identified projects sort of few relatively small acquisitions that are just kind of bolt-on assets here and there and there. But for the most part, it's all just organic growth and that was really the purpose of my comment there.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Understood. And as a follow up, I don't know, if Alan you want to respond or Don. But with the Caiman acquisition announcement and the increase in distribution guidance, it became clear that the growth in fee-based businesses is so transparent for a number of years and so great. That for an interim period to have some of your distributions based in part of commodity-sensitive operations that are doing well, isn't such a big deal since the fee-based stuff is going to catch up to it not too long anyhow.","Given the fact that you're taking out so strong results particularly on the olefins' side, what's the appetite? Because like 6 months ago, you all would have been shy about making distributions contingent on fee-based businesses. But given the backdrop of all the growth in the fee-based stuff, what's the appetite for juicing the distributions a little more if commodities continue to be favorable like that?","Donald R. Chappel","Craig, this is Don. I think we've put out what we think is still industry-leading distribution growth at WPZ. We don't think that there's a great incentive to do more than that. And so again to the extent that we could put out something that we think is a sustainable, higher rate of growth, we'll do that. But we're not inclined just to call -- jump the distributions on the back of high commodity prices. But we think we're building a portfolio business that will enable us to have industry-leading growth in WPZ distributions over a number of years. And as has been pointed out in the call, we think we got great visibility to it. I think another way to kind of come out the M&A comment was really we don't need any additional acquisitions in order to drive this distribution growth or the dividend growth at Williams. So this is now all within our control. And I think we're delighted by that. And we're just taking excess cash flow and plowing it right back into building this fee-based business out.","Operator","Moving on to Brad Olsen with Tudor, Pickering, Holt.","Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of questions about the MC&O business. The olefins that are -- the MC&O business as a whole posted a really strong kind of margin expansion quarter-over-quarter as you alluded to a result of the ethylene and ethane spread. I think last quarter you mentioned that there are some legacy contracts that might limit, for the next 12 months or at least for the remainder of the year, your ability to capture the full ethane, ethylene spread. And do you have any comments on what that margin expansion or the quarter-over-quarter growth might have looked like if you didn't have those contracts in place?","Rory L. Miller","This is Rory. I don't have that assessment that you just asked for. But I can give you a little color on the contracting situation, just so you maybe have a flavor of what's coming. If you look at, say, where we're at in February, about 30% of our offtake portfolio had kind of unfettered exposure to the spot market. The majority of the rest was under collared deals. So meaning it had some exposure, but the exposure was limited. We page ahead to the end of the year in December, that exposure to the -- just the pure spot market is around 55%. And then by February of 2013, that exposure goes up to 84%. So if we had a -- let's just say a steady-state situation around the crack spread, we'd expect to see that open up significantly over that period.","Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And now moving to Midstream Canada, you guys are working on that, the ethane extraction project to deliver up to 10,000 barrels a day to NOVA in Alberta. And I was wondering if you could maybe talk a little bit about how -- I know there's not really a direct linkage between the Canadian ethane environment and the U.S. ethane environment. But does the drop in ethane prices in the U.S. affect the economics of that project at all?","Rory L. Miller","No, I don't think so. That project made a lot of sense, but the Canadian government also provided some subsidies that helped on that project significantly. The Boreal pipeline is I think set to start being filled in May 28 and then the ethane project I think is set to be online second quarter of 2013. And there is a floor in that contract that we think gives us the kind of earnings and performance that we're looking for, in spite of where the commodities go.","Brad Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Great. And one last question, we've seen some kind of dry gas Marcellus rig count declines recently. Do you guys have any comments on that? And also as we've seen kind of weak propane demand up in the Northeast this quarter, do you see any change, just kind of preliminary change in producer attitudes as propane is a large share of kind of the liquid yield up in the Marcellus, on how they think about operating rigs in that area?","Rory L. Miller","Let me take that first question. First about the -- what we're seeing in the dry gas and maybe some falling rig counts in the Marcellus. I just would say our approach has been start with the geology first. And we've tried to target the places that we think are the sweet spots in the Marcellus. It's not all created equal. But during the best parts of the Marcellus, in the dry gas windows, you're probably in the best place to drill United States of America for dry gas. So Susquehanna County probably being the #1 dry gas location. We have seen a rig or 2 come out of that area that we have access to with our system. But what the producers have been doing has been replacing less efficient rigs with more efficient rigs. And so it hasn't had any impact at all on our volume forecast. So the situation is very robust up there for us and we're very confident that, that system is going to perform. In fact, we've got the majority of that 3 bcf a day of capacity, takeaway capacity that we highlighted in the slides. We got the majority that's contracted for. There's a little bit of available capacity, hydraulically available, and we're in the process of sorting through the demand for that right now. We have more demand for it than we have space. So situation is still very robust, very, very positive. There are places in the Marcellus where it's fringier and those are not areas that we're in right now. But those fills will probably see less activity than the better areas. In terms of the propane demand, propane is a tougher commodity to predict probably right now just with the increases in supply and maybe a changing demand profile and exports and probably going to be a big part of that story going forward. We have not seen any changes in drilling in the rich gas areas particularly in the Northeast. All we've seen is more and more interest. So certainly, if propane is down, that is going to hurt a bit. But I still think it's not going to fall to the point where it greatly diminishes the drilling economics in those rich gas areas. They're some of the best in the nation right now.","Operator","And we'll now go to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","You have I guess in one of the slides, a budgeted amount or percentage of projects potentially for the Utica. In terms of those types of investments, are you looking at gathering projects? Processing projects? And maybe if you could give a sense in terms of the potential timing of those investments?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. Sharon, we can't really give you much in terms of timing on that. I would just tell you that the assets that we acquired or will be acquiring when we close from Caiman, those are well positioned to kind of be a first mover to attract volumes in from that. So initially probably that infrastructure would likely be more gathering that would be bringing some of those volumes over. But certainly, we'd be looking to take advantage of that first mover position we have and ultimately build the kind of infrastructure that would serve that area long term because the infrastructure that we're building for Caiman really is, to the large, very large community we already spoken for, from volumes just from that area. So we would have to be building further processing capacity for the Utica in the long term. But initially, it would just be a matter of being able to gather that into that -- those plants just as a temporary solution.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And I guess just following up on Carl's question about Atlantic Access. Do you have updated number for the potential CapEx? I think last time we spoke it might have been about $1.5 billion.","Donald R. Chappel","Sharon, this is Don. At this -- with this current proposal a top tier [ph], it's quite a bit bigger than that. We've not put a number out. I think we'll try to give you a better range at our May 22 Analyst Day. But again, it's quite a bit larger, if it went off exactly as it's currently proposed. But obviously, we have to get feedback from customers as [indiscernible] begins.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess for the Constitution Pipeline, is the CapEx around $725 million?","Alan S. Armstrong","I think we're just saying it's between $700 million and $800 million at this point, Sharon. It certainly expanded as a result of the Southwestern Energy volume. But that's about as close to target as we're going to draw on that at this point.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I noticed for 2014, the guidance for the MC&O business actually increased a bit. Maybe if you can just touch on the reason for the increase in guidance?","Donald R. Chappel","Sharon, this is Don. I'd just say that we have risked that. But I think upon further study, we decided that some of the, call it probability had improved somewhat, in terms of timing, just timing of cash flows. And that really caused us to increase the 2014 guidance.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","We have heard a lot about the Marcellus here. But I'm just wondering if you can go back into your legacy areas, in the Rockies. Are you seeing with the low gas price, seeing the rigs call back? Surely, given that there's a lot of key pulse that the producers aren't really getting as much of the liquids uplift out there?","Rory L. Miller","This is Rory, I'll take that call -- or that question. Yes, maybe just starting out in Southwest Wyoming. We have seen a little bit of fall off there, probably down about $100 million a day from the first of the year. And I will tell you that we've got a lot of wells tied into those gathering systems. Most of it's coming out of tight-sands production and so it's a hyperbolic decline. The builder wells are on the very flat part of the decline. And so up in Wyoming, we've seen both shale and ultra have gone down to 2 rigs each, so that's a drop of about 4 rigs in total. That $100 million a day is probably indicative of the flat production that we were seeing. And we think it'll be pretty stable because we are on those flat parts of the decline. Over in Wamsutter, we've had 4 rigs drilling over there and we've had 1 pull out. And the other 3 are from producers that are getting the benefit to those NGLs and we don't anticipate those coming out of the equation. Piceance has been down to about 5 rigs and that had been running at about 8. So there's a little bit of slowdown there. Again, the producers are seeing the benefits of the NGLs there and we're not expecting any further decline there in the Piceance. Down in Four Corners, there are lots of wells tied into that. It's pretty resilient to any kind of drastic falloff. But we are down about 40 wells per year there in the Four Corners. So it's pretty modest and I think the fall offs that we've seen they've been minor but I think those are indicative of what we'll see going forward until we get a little bit of increase in gas price.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, that's really helpful. And then maybe a question for Don. In terms of the equity that you did at WMB, it looks like you entered [ph] a little more equity than you kind of have indicated for the Caiman, Dow [ph]. I think you were -- you said you're going to give out 50-50 debt and equity for the $1 billion WPZ transaction. Can you just talk about that? Is that -- or is it more sort of a defensive move or maybe is it more offensive? Are you thinking about acquisitions or whatnot down the road?","Donald R. Chappel","I would say that on average, our debt and equity mix will be about 50-50. But in this case, these assets were not really cash flowing and therefore didn't really support much debt. So as we looked at our credit metrics, to really do much in the way of debt would have really either caused a ratings -- a negative ratings reaction, or really put us up against being really tight for additional growth. So we felt that was the right thing to do to provide ability to continue to execute on some of the additional projects that we're currently contemplating.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And then just talking about the WMB equity again. Would you use that -- similar to this for a transaction kind of related to that. Or would you consider even just using it as an investment in WPZ? Do you have a lot of growth capital you're willing to do? And a lot of financing at the PZ level. I'm just wondering what's the best use of the cash flow? Is it WMB relative to the dividend increases?","Donald R. Chappel","I think to the extent that we have sustainable cash flows at Williams and kind of we laid that out in our dividend slide there in terms of the distribution from WPZ plus very strong distribution growth that MC&O after substantial coverage of both PZ and MC&O, yes, we think it's appropriate to pay dividend with the bulk of that. We see Williams\u2019 currency as being kind of a backup currency. I think WPZ will be the primary financing vehicle for obviously, for Williams Partners. But certainly in situations like the Caiman, we're trying to do more with WPZ, may have put some stress on WPZ. We felt that having Williams step up because it was good for Williams as well as good for WPZ. So we'll use I think Williams very sparingly. That's the only acquiescence we've had in the last decade. But again if we see a situation that really is compelling, it's a tool in the toolkit and I think a real advantage that we have relative to a lot of our competitors.","Operator","Next we'll go to Tim Schneider with Citi.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","It's Faisel from Citi. Could you -- I just wanted to clarify on your Utica position, how much dedicated acreage do you guys have? I see your Marcellus acreage at 1.2 million, but what's the acreage I should look out, in terms of what's dedicated for the Utica?","Alan S. Armstrong","There's not -- we have some what I would say kind of historic acreage dedication that has Utica rights underneath it but we don't have any acreage that we've specifically done after for Utica drilling at this point. So there is some locations back from the, particularly from the Atlas dedication that had that -- had Utica acreage underlying it. But in terms of things that we specifically gone after for the Utica, we do not have any Utica at this point.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, got you. And then this goes in the Rockies, I guess it's been kind of a little bit of a discovery in the Paradox basin for liquids and oil. Can you guys just remind us how you guys are positioned in that basin?","Rory L. Miller","Yes, I'll take that. This is Rory. Paradox is something that I think was drawing some interest several years ago. And in fact, we built some early production systems out there. The resource is definitely in place there. Producers were working hard, including our affiliate at the time to kind of crack the code on how to commercially produce that. I think they're still working on that. So I would look at the Paradox as still a work in progress. We do have some minor facilities there in case things do take off. But I don't see that as something that we're real excited about right now. I think if I was to point to some of the exciting things that are coming out West, I'd point to the Mancos shale play down in the San Juan basin. It's like a lot of these shale plays. It's got 3 different windows, a dry gas, a condensate, wet gas window and an oil window and that's starting to attract a lot of attention. There's a very similar play in the Mancos -- in the Piceance with the same 3 types of windows and there's activity in that area as well. And although this is probably something I can't say nearly as much about, there is up in the Wamsutter area a shale play that's being tried up in that area as well. So as we're seeing these shale plays, particularly wet gas shale plays that are developing around the country, they tend to be in places where there's already production. And what we're finding is that's the case out West as well and there's activity in 3 of our 4 basis today pursuing that kind of a play. So I think we'll have some more exciting things to talk about in the next 6 to 12 months as those place get a little better understood.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And then, Alan in your prepared remarks on the podcast, I think you talked about some opportunities in your Marcellus part of the pie to take advantage of power conversions, I think. I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit about that? Was that coal-to-gas switching? Was there something that -- something else, I'm talking about new buildup of gas plants? And what was it that was opportunity out of your under negotiation of your potential part of the pie?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, probably I was talking so fast I mixed 2 things there. Certainly coming for Transco, really the 2 primary drivers for Transco right now is serving the producers' needs, getting out in the Marcellus. But as well, we've seen a lot of interest from the market and wanting access to the Marcellus as well for long-term things like power plant conversions. And so I think there's a real concern on the part of the power generation industry about making sure they've got plenty of reliable access to supply us long term. And so I think Transco is perfectly positioned to do that because it can provide access from supplies in the South and even areas obviously like the midcontinent supplies and Barnett Shale and Haynesville and so forth. They come into Transco at station 85 and as well as of course the Gulf Coast supplies. But as well, now they would have access with supplies from the North. And so the power generation -- Transco is extremely well positioned if somebody is concerned about reliability, be it its multiple loop lines right through these populated areas and access, multiple access to supply points. And so that is driving a lot of interest and demand for Transco being kind of the pipe of choice out there for the power generation conversions.","Randall L. Barnard","Yes. This is Randy Barnard. I was just a blurb to add, in the quarterly data book, you'll see a couple of slides in there that attempt to quantify with little more exactitude the opportunities for conversions surrounding Transco, slide 53 in particular. There goes another one in there as well.","Faisel Khan - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay, great. And then last question from me. Also in your prepared remarks, you talked about in the under negotiation of potential category, 2 more FPSs. What's the -- I mean how do we look at converting that potential into a firm sort of project? What are the things that could happen or could go against you in order to turn that into a fixed, firm project?","Rory L. Miller","I'll take that. This is Rory. I guess what I would say is that the main competition out there for that kind of a product is the producers themselves. There aren't a lot of people out there right now with that kind of product. And the big advantage is really time to first oil [ph] so it's really around the producers wanting to accelerate their cash flows. We're standing ready with the product that can do that. The producer's option is to self-develop, but they're starting from a standing soft and has a fairly significant impact on the present value of the projects. So we think the financials on the product are very compelling. We've got probably 5 or 6 of those that are in various states of discussion. And one of the nice things about these opportunities is that the producers will make a decision. When they find and make a discovery, and they're probably in the 100 million barrels plus range, with the price of oil, where it is and the prospects going forward being pretty bright for crude oil. These producers are going to make a decision and they are going to move forward. And so we're really counting on a couple of more of them deciding they'd like to accelerate that cash flow and they'd like to outsource that business. And there are a number of producers that are getting interested in that even more so. They don't really get any credit on their balance sheet for adding steel. They get credit for adding proven reserves. And so it works well for both parties. And I think the confidence that Hess and Chevron has shown us in our first sale of a GulfStar augurs well for the additional opportunities for us out there. So just in terms of timing I think over the next 12 months, I think there's a great chance that we can add another one. There's no guarantees on that, but the deal churn that we've got, I think that's a possibility.","Operator","We'll now go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Well, Williams seems to have a very full plate of organic growth projects to drive growth going forward. I was just wondering if you guys could comment on any appetite for expanding or acquiring assets further down the NGL value chain.","Alan S. Armstrong","Well I would say that we do see a lot of opportunity. And as Rory mentioned earlier, in the Marcellus, we certainly are very aware that in fact even though it wasn't embedded in our economics for the Caiman acquisition, we think that puts us in a great position to be a solution provider for NGL infrastructure in that area where it's so desperately needed. But certainly, the Mont-Bellevue area is pretty crowded in terms of service providers in that area. But we're getting a lot of interest from the petchem side, in terms of providing more customized infrastructure and helping to move product around. You can't really go expanding the ethylene cracking capacity in the way the ethylene volumes are growing without quite a bit of infrastructure in and around the petchem space there. And so we are very focused on that area. So I think we see a lot of opportunity at the far upstream end of the midstream infrastructure and the far downstream end of the midstream infrastructure and are looking at some very interesting projects there that take advantage of our liquids and our production, but help petchems look out for the future where their supplies are going to be coming from. So to answer your question, it's yes. But I wouldn't translate that into thinking that we're going to be into the fray, where there's plenty of players right now in particularly -- in the Bellevue area proper as the merchant during that space. So we think there's quite a crowd there already. And we wouldn't want to butt in to that space just because we don't think we'd provide the kind of margin and return that we expect from our other opportunities.","Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's very helpful. I was just wondering also if there were any updated thoughts on where the Confluence project stands?","Alan S. Armstrong","Confluence is moving ahead. We, of course, we announced there that Southwestern Energy had also -- oh, sorry, Confluence, sorry, I had that confused -- we have too many projects starting with C. Confluence is a lot of interest from producers in that area. But that area is very underserved with infrastructure in Northwestern PA, both on the gathering side and particularly on the NGL extraction. And that area is very rich with gas. So we like that area. We think it's going to need some infrastructure. And while we don't have anything new to announce there, we're having a lot of discussions going on with a lot of different large players in the area that understand the need for the infrastructure and see us as well positioned to providing that.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong","Okay, well great. Well, thank you. Appreciate all the great questions this morning. And we certainly are continuing to drive forward and execute. Very proud of the way our organization continues to execute in a very -- in an area that we got so much growth going on but very proud of the way we're executing on projects and continuing to run the businesses very well as we demonstrated this quarter. And so we look forward to continuing to talk to you about some more detail on these projects at our May 22 webcast. Thanks for joining us this morning.","Operator","Once again, this does conclude today's conference. We do thank you all for joining us."],"22911":["The Williams Cos., Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Todd. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck, that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily. Also joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Michael Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler; and Chad Zamarin, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to generally accepted accounting principles and these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.","And so, with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Great. Well, thank you, John, and thanks, everybody, for joining us this morning. I'll get right into it here. This was another very predictable quarter for us from a financial metric perspective. It was just slightly above our internal plan for the quarter that was used to forecast our guidance that we've provided to you. However, the extraordinary thing about the quarter was the tremendous amount of progress on projects, planned expansions and new business that was contracted during the quarter that gives us even more confidence in our growth rate for years to come.","We are obviously looking forward to more dramatic growth in the second half of the year as Atlantic Sunrise project nears completion and producer activity on our systems in the Northeast and in Wyoming continues to ramp up. We're also excited about the transactions announced earlier this week. Selling assets in a very mature basin at attractive multiples and then redeploying that capital to higher growth basins allows us to capitalize on future growth opportunities without stretching the balance sheet or issuing equity.","It is also clear that the demand for natural gas that we have been saying is just around the corner has recently come to life in a very dramatic manner. In fact, all sectors of natural gas demand are up in 2018 compared to the equivalent 2017 time period. LNG exports are up 57% for the year-to-date versus 2017. Power is up as well, up about 9% versus 2017. Residential is up and industrial is up and growing very rapidly.","As a result, we have storage inventories now that are nearly 560 Bcf or 20% below the five-year average, yet price remains low, which is just creating another wave of investment in businesses poised to take advantage of this low pricing clean fuel. All of this spells higher production volumes and transmission throughput here in the U.S. to keep up with this rapidly growing U.S. and global demand. And as I think most of you appreciate, no one is better positioned to benefit from that growth in volumes without taking commodity price risk than Williams.","And now some quick financial highlights that I'm excited to share with you from the quarter, first of all, we are up quarter-over-quarter in net income for WMB by over 66% and up quarter-over-quarter in adjusted income per share by 31%. On the WPZ side, we were up about 33% in net income quarter-over-quarter.","So, for today's call, we're going to hit the following topics. First of all, the key driver behind our financial and operations metrics for 2Q and year-to-date, I'll highlight the major project contributions in 2Q and provide an update on other key achievements, also discuss the two strategic transactions that we announced earlier this week and finally highlight the value proposition to be created by the WPZ merger. And then, of course, as always we'll take questions.","But before we move on to slide 2, I want to publically welcome Vicki Fuller, our newest Independent Director on The Williams' board of director. Vicki most recently led the New York State Common Retirement Fund where she had tremendous success as an investor there and leading the organization on their investments. She brings a wealth of leadership skills and financial expertise. Her investment management insights will be invaluable in our ongoing efforts to expand our investor base and maintain crisp focus on creating long-term shareholder value.","Vicki will serve on the Audit Committee and the Nom. and Gov. Committee. Her appointment you may recall follows the June 4 appointment to the board of Nancy Buese. Nancy is currently Executive Vice President and CFO for Newmont Mining Corporation. Prior to that she was the CFO at MarkWest, now MPLX, and a key part of that leadership team that created tremendous shareholder values over the years and during her tenure there. We're already benefiting from her outstanding financial and energy leadership experience. And Nancy is serving on the board's Compensation and Management Development Committee as well as our EH&S Committee. I really am excited to welcome both Vicki and Nancy to our board of directors as we continue to build on what I think is the strongest board in the sector.","Going to move on to slide 2 now and first of all, net income on a GAAP basis is up at both WPZ and WMB quarter-over-quarter. This is primarily the result of an increase in operating income of about $68 million at WPZ. WMB's GAAP EPS was up $0.06 per share or 60% versus second quarter of 2017.","After adjustments for certain non-recurring items, WMB's adjusted EBITDA came in at $1.1 billion. Williams also delivered strong growth in EPS on an adjusted basis and adjusted income per share was up 31% over the second quarter 2017. As you can see on this slide, if you adjust for the sale of our olefins business and the impact of adopting new accounting standards for revenue recognition, our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up about 4%. This was a little above our quarterly plan, but both financials and operating stats were impacted by several plant outages, most notably the Mobile Bay and Echo Springs plant in Wyoming.","NGL margins for the whole industry were extremely strong in the quarter, but our impact was limited by both NGL takeaway capacity as well as NGL hedges, which impacted us by about $7 million. In both cases, these plants were being modified to get ready for significant increases in volumes from the very liquid-rich new streams of gas. So, a lot of new opportunities coming on, including the Norphlet in the Eastern Gulf, and we are getting very near being completed with all of our work that readies our systems for that very large influx of very rich gas and as well in Wyoming in the Wamsutter field there, a lot of work going on and a lot yet to come in that area to ready for also a very large stream of new rich gas in that area.","So, a great job by our teams in executing these efforts in a well-planned and safe manner. We also accelerated a significant amount of pipeline integrity work that was planned for the second half of 2018 into this quarter. The maintenance cost shifted from the second half to the first half was to take advantage of the timing of outages associated with expansion, construction work and project work that's been going on along the Transco system. This timing of maintenance work minimizes the impact on our customers, while reducing future revenue interruptions.","Additionally, most of the increase in maintenance CapEx during the quarter was also on Transco and we fully expect to recover this capital investment via Transco's rate case.","Let's move on to slide 3 and look at our year-to-date results. Year-to-date net income is down on a GAAP basis for both WPZ and WMB. The absence of a large gain on asset sales in the first quarter of 2017 affected the results and this comparison for both entities.","Moving on to our non-GAAP results, which normalizes for non-recurring items like the 2017 gain on asset sales I mentioned earlier, our first half adjusted income per share attributable to WMB was up an impressive 33% over the first half of 2017 and WMB's adjusted EBITDA was $2.245 billion, again slightly ahead of our business plan that was used to create our guidance. And as you can see on this slide, if you adjust for the sale of our olefins business and the impact of adopting new accounting standards for revenue recognition, WMB's adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up about $99 million or 5%.","So, now let's move on to slide 4, where you'll see a list of several accomplishments and projects that are in progress. Here on slide 4, as you can see, our second quarter results featured contributions from a number of recent achievements. First of all, the Transco team placed Phase 2 of the Garden State project in service during March. Our customer activity continued to grow in the Northeast, where our inlet gas processing volumes were up more than 37% in our Ohio Valley Midstream processing complex in looking at the second quarter of 2018 versus same period of 2017.","Our gathering volumes were up 160 million cubic feet per day quarter-over-quarter and up by approximately 250 million cubic feet per day on a year-to-date basis. Led by the Haynesville again, the West combined natural gas gathering volumes were up 270 million cubic feet per day on a year-to-date basis. And in the Atlantic Gulf, we saw Transco's transportation revenues up $114 million or 16% on a year-to-date basis and this was driven by fully contracted expansion projects.","There are several good updates listed here for our various projects, including our Southeastern Trail project, which filed its FERC certificate application in April. In Wyoming, we just announced an exciting expansion on our Jackalope Gas Gathering System and associated Bucking Horse gas processing facility in the Powder River Basin that will increase processing capacity to 345 million cubic feet per day by the end of 2019 to meet the growing customer demand in this under-served growth basin.","We also have begun construction activities on another major expansion of our G&P system in the Wamsutter field to serve Southland's fast growing production that was recently contracted.","We achieved key milestones on Northeast Gathering and Processing expansion projects, which were highlighted at Analyst Day. We've now executed final agreements supporting system expansions in Northeast Pennsylvania, which are expected to increase capacity by about 800 million cubic feet per day. So, this is another expansion on top of the one that we just completed here at the first part of this year up in the Susquehanna Supply Hub area and we also have another major expansion underway at our Oak Grove gas processing facility in West Virginia, which is also fully contracted and we'll expand that system dramatically as well.","The effects of these additions of supply are just now beginning to show as we complete key compressor facilities on our gathering systems that allow newly connected pads to begin flowing. So, we are really impressed with some of the production rates that we're seeing from some of the new pads that we're just now turning on. The number of projects that our teams are managing in the Northeast are way too numerous to mention here, but the fruits of their labor will begin to show later this year and into 2019.","As mentioned at the top, we are nearing completion on our Atlantic Sunrise project and are targeting full in-service towards the end of this month for that 1.7 billion cubic feet per day expansion on our Transco system. I'm going to pause here just a minute and tell you how proud I am of our project teams for their focus on doing the right thing, both from a safety perspective and an environmental compliance perspective.","They have been very thoughtful in listening to regulators and key stakeholders in the communities and their careful planning, engineering and patience is truly distinguishing our efforts as we near completion of this important project. They have dealt with very tough regulatory issues, religious orders, a very tight skilled labor market and record levels of rainfall with tremendous diligence, professionalism and integrity. And while we are still battling the impacts of major flooding in the area last week, we are pouring it on in order to bring this one over the finish line as the weather allows.","So, let's move on to slide 5 and talk about the two strategic transactions announced this week. Our ongoing business and project execution has become remarkably predictable, but we have also been working hard to manage our portfolio of assets in a way that maintains our platform for growth for many years to come.","I'm really pleased with our execution on the two big transactions we announced earlier this week. First of all, Williams, along with KKR as our joint venture partner, announced the acquisition of Discovery DJ Services for $1.173 billion, subject to the customary closing conditions and purchase price adjustments. Our initial contribution is 40% of the purchase price or said another way, Williams is responsible for approximately $470 million of that total purchase price and will be the operator of these very attractive assets in the DJ Basin.","The assets feature a total of 260 million cubic feet per day of gas processing capacity, which is expected to be in service by the end of this year and permitting underway for greater than 1 Bcf a day of gas processing that is required to service the 260,000 acres that are already under dedication.","In addition to the attractive growth opportunities we see just in gathering and processing, Williams also expects to generate additional value by integrating production from these assets with our existing footprint in our West segment, including our downstream NGL assets.","We expect the Discovery transaction to represent a 5 times to 6 times multiple and that's using The Williams' investment inclusive of the required growth CapEx based on the 2020 EBITDA forecast and the growth on the asset should continue to ramp well beyond 2020 and of course that multiple will get even better as that growth occurs.","Now we realize that this multiple seems higher than a competitive market would typically allow, but this is an example of when we can take unique downstream synergies being applied to a 50% upstream investment. So, said another way, we are enjoying 100% of those synergies, but they are being applied to a 50% upstream investment and that really is what drives that much higher-than-market multiple.","We like this strategy a lot and I would tell you that our team has been working hard to develop these kind of opportunities where we work with private dollars and really leverage those to take advantage of a lot of the great synergies that we have available to us from our large scale footprint across the U.S.","Concurrently, we announced the sale of the Four Corners asset for $1.125 billion in cash from Harvest Midstream Company, an affiliate of Hilcorp Energy Company. The cash proceeds will help fund the Discovery transaction in a portion of our extensive growth capital and investment expenditure portfolio.","The Four Corners Area has been an important part of Williams dating back to its acquisition in 1983. However, pressure on natural gas pricing from adjacent basins, like the Permian, demand a new basin model that consolidates and integrates upstream production with midstream operation in a way that optimizes throughput and lowers cost.","We believe that Harvest Midstream along with Hilcorp are ideally positioned to achieve this integration while Williams is able to redeploy the proceeds into improved opportunities for growth. This value and multiple on EBITDA of 13.7, we are receiving as a testament to the high-quality assets that Williams' employees have grown and maintained in the Four Corners Area for the past 35 years.","So, now, let's look at the next slide and discuss the CapEx guidance update. After consideration of the effects of both the purchase of the Discovery DJ Services and the divestiture of the Four Corners Area as well as several other forecast updates, our current guidance from a Analyst Day on May 17, 2018, remains unchanged except for our growth capital expenditure.","Growth CapEx has been revised for 2018 and 2019 to account for the inclusion of the purchase of the Discovery system and other projects included. In the 2019 figure are our planned Niobrara expansion and our various expansions in the Northeast G&P segment.","While CapEx is up due to the Discovery deal, it's important to note that the Four Corners transaction allows us to fully finance the initial Discovery DJ investment and its follow-on CapEx without issuing any equity or increasing our debt and we've generated additional cash flow beyond those needs to finance other growth projects.","So, while this transaction doesn't drive the metric shown on this page, the Harvest and swift deployment of capital into higher returning opportunities that take advantage of our downstream synergies is a terrific example of how we're focused on driving shareholder value through active portfolio management.","Now, let's look at the key investment benefits for Williams' shareholders following the rollup of WPZ. We look here at slide 7. Williams is certainly unique investment amongst the S&P 500 companies. The post-merger entity will provide a large scale entity, focused on natural gas with significant growth opportunities, low volatility and highly predictable fee-for-service cash flows.","After the WMB-WPZ merger closes, we'll have a much more simplified org structure and a highly liquid C-Corp with associated shareholder rights and impressive market capitalization. Our attractive dividend yield and growth along with our strong focus on improving ROCE will deliver significant advantages for shareholders. Williams fares extremely well when compared to other S&P 500 companies in dividend yield, adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA growth and dividend growth. In fact, Williams is so unique that you'd be hard pressed to find another S&P company whose consensus estimates meet or exceed Williams' outlook for these key measures.","Now, we're going to move on to slide 8 here to wrap up. So, as we wrap up the presentation here and prepare to take questions, this slide 8 really provides a good summation of Williams' attractive position. Our financial results are meeting expectation with solid results for our continuing businesses. Importantly, net income and adjusted EPS are both up substantially quarter-over-quarter. There's also clear visibility to future growth.","We are leveraging advantaged assets and approaching our expected in-service date for the Atlantic Sunrise project. We expect Northeast volume growth to accelerate into the end of 2018 and continue to grow at 2019. The West portfolio is also gaining attractive growth opportunities and we have plenty of great high-return investment opportunities to invest the proceeds from the sale of our Four Corners Area business.","Finally, The Williams and Williams Partners merger is on track and as a reminder, our special Williams stockholder meeting to vote on the proposed merger of WPZ and to WMB will be held on August 9 at 10:00 AM in the morning, Central Time, at our Tulsa headquarters. Williams' stockholders of record as of the close of business on July 9, 2018, are entitled to vote. I would remind those who haven't yet voted to please do so.","Assuming a successful vote when the merger is completed, Williams simplified structure, investment-grade credit ratings, growth opportunities and cash flow available to fund that growth, all contribute to positioning Williams as a uniquely attractive investment opportunity compared to almost any sector or equity across the broad universe of investments.","So, with that, we thank you very much for your time today and operator, let's take our first question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I just want to touch on the transactions in the West here that you completed. And just wondering if there is any more to read into this as far as looking to kind of diversify into \u2013 more into liquids-rich areas or kind of grow the presence in more basins, bigger presence of the basins inside the Northeast. How did this factor into your thought-process here?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Well, thank you. Great question. And I would just say that, we're always looking for basins where we have a lot of downstream synergies to be able to apply and it's really a unique situation when we can take private dollars and invest a smaller slice of our own capital and do something, but enjoy the downstream of synergies and drive downstream synergies into our existing asset base.","And so, I think that's really the clue that you ought to be looking for is really where we can drive synergistic value and that unique competitive advantage that we have in a process like that is really where our efforts are focused. And so, I wouldn't see this as wide scale outside of areas where we've got the ability to drive quite a bit of synergies with either existing assets in the basin or with downstream assets that we could develop.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thanks. And just wondering, Bluebonnet, if there's anything new to report there.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I'm going to ask Chad Zamarin to take that. Chad?","Chad J. Zamarin - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. Thanks. I would just say that we continue to advance that project and we strongly believe that Permian volumes are going to want to access Transco markets, which are truly second to none. So, we do see a lot of momentum towards a build-out from the Permian towards Transco markets. I would just say that we're going to remain disciplined in how we contract that project. It's certainly an active area to competitive market. We've got a great inventory of projects across our footprint.","So, we're confident that, that infrastructure will be available for us to build to bring those volumes into Transco markets, but at the same time, we're going to be thoughtful about how we contract. I would say we've seen one project fully contracted for a Permian takeaway and we fully expect that there will be multiple additional projects over time. And so, we've continued to see good momentum on the BMX project and we'll continue to work it as we move forward.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. Thanks. And then, in Appalachia outside of Northeast PA, I was just wondering if you could give us a feel for producer activity and focus on drivers as you see in your areas there and how you see volumes trending. And then, NESE as well, just wondering if you could add any new updates there. Thanks.","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Okay. This is Michael Dunn. I'll take that question. In the Northeast, we are seeing our volumes grow really significantly in the Ohio River Supply area with the richer gas that's coming into our Oak Grove processing facilities. So, we're anxiously awaiting the in-service date of our second train there at Oak Grove to process this gas and we think we'll be at capacity on Train 1 that's already in-service there by mid next year, which is when we expect Train 2 to come online.","So, really seeing a lot of good growth there. We saw about 30% growth in the Marcellus South year-to-date compared to last year at the same time and so really excited to see those volumes coming on. And also in Susquehanna and Bradford, we're seeing volumes grow there as well, but overall, we'd expect volume to continue to grow in Northeast Pennsylvania after Atlantic Sunrise comes online and we see some of those volumes continue to grow from our customers there.","As far as NESE goes, on the NESE project, I think you've probably seen the updates that we've had there in regard to our permits that we've been working through with New York and New Jersey on the 401 certifications under the Clean Water Act and both of those permits have been resubmitted to New York and New Jersey. And we're working with both of those states to continue to process the permits, the data requests there. We have a draft EIS that's out on the project as well and continuing to work with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the core of engineers in the states to process those permits, but we have anticipated now that will slide the in-service date out to the end of 2020.","And I will tell you and remind you that we typically do risk-adjust our revenues in our guidance and our balance plans and so that will closely align with where we anticipated our revenue in the first place with the projects. So, we've had a shift of capital out of 2019 and more closely aligned with the 2020 and service date on NESE.","Jeremy Bryan Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. I'll stop there. Thanks for taking my question.","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi. If I could also start with the acquisition, could you provide any additional information about your option to acquire a portion of the KKR interest at the predetermined, agreed-to terms?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure, Christine. I'll ask John Chandler to take that.","John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. First, I want to say just generally about the structure, we find KKR to be an excellent partner in this project. This is unlike maybe some of the traditional partner investments you've seen with private money in that this isn't a preferred investment. So, there is preferred coupon or anything like that between joint venture partners in this transaction. Even though it's an initial 40%, 60% investment, 40% Williams, 60% KKR, we do have voting control and governance control in the partnership from day one.","And over the next year-and-a-half, we will bring our equity interest up. We invest first dollars in the growth projects over the next year-and-a-half, which will bring our economic interest up to 50%, 50% interest. And as it relates to the buyout option, we do have a buyout option in the future with KKR, but we're able to call their interest as \u2013 I'm not going to give you the exact return, but it's a low to mid-teen type return.","We believe these assets on their own just the gathering assets produce a return higher than that. So, we think that's going to be a very attractive economic option for us in the future. But it's at our option to call that interest for a limited period of time and in the future. And in doing that, we did give up something to them. We gave them a liquidation preference in the event there was ever a meltdown of the investment, which is highly unlikely. And so, they did receive that return for us getting the right to call their interest and also the right not to be drug if they did sell their interest and we didn't want to participate in that.","That answered your question?","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. And then, can you talk about how the contracts are structured for the Discovery asset? Is it fear of pop (30:53) and will you be offering a bundled service for the gathering processing, Overland Pass and frac? And also would you have to loop Overland to accommodate those volumes?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Christine, thank you. The business is almost all fee-based there in the DJ Basin and there are downstream contracts for the NGL services that are separate for that. And in terms of whether we would have to loop OPPL, I think that's dependent on other actions from players, but unlikely I think, given ONEOK's Elk Creek facility and the White Cliffs conversion, I think it's unlikely that, that would be required. But \u2013 so, we don't really expect that to occur.","So, I think, we see a lot of opportunity under our existing contracts and business to really help the DJ Basin producers and get access to attractive markets and we think we're well positioned to do that and that's where a lot of those synergies come from.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, up in the Northeast, just in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned the Oak Grove expansion is being contracted. Can you remind us what those are? There were some contracts that you announced and the acreage had turned over from some of the original producers to ETT and Southwestern. But just curious if there were any additional signed subsequent to that.","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No. Christine, this is Michael again. Those are the primary contracts we have there, but we're obviously talking to a lot of different producers up there that are bringing in rigs at least anticipated and we'll continue to have new contracting opportunities to continue to fill that, but, right now, we have, like I said earlier, Oak Grove TXP Train 2 under construction and we're actually under construction with a portion of the civil work on Train 3 as well, which we think will probably need by the end of 2019, early 2021, once Train 2 fills up.","So, we expect Train 2 to rapidly fill in 2019 and be at capacity by the end of the year. That's why we're currently building Train 3 as well and even talking to our internal parties and some of our producers up there about a need for Train 4 after that. So, there's a lot of activity up there and we're pretty excited about it.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","And I would just add to that, Christine. In addition to the Oak Grove or to the Ohio Valley Midstream area proper, we also have some expansion ongoing with Chevron on the LMM system as well. That's new business to us. And so, really kind of across the board right now with the one exception being the Utica, we're seeing pretty substantial growth and, of course, we're excited about the new investor in the Utica replacing Chesapeake there who is going to bring a lot of new capital to that area. So, while Utica has really been kind of the slower growing piece of our Northeast position, we're really excited about their plans there in the Utica now.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Very helpful. Thank you.","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I should have also talked about our NGL pipeline that we announced at Analyst Day as well that we're well on our way to having that project completed probably in the second quarter next year from our Oak Grove facility up to the Harrison Hub as well. So, we've made great progress there. We've got all the right-of-way acquired. We've cut the majority of the trees along the right-of-way and we'll start construction on that this fall.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt Company.","Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning. So, it looks like the Northeast unit operating expenses were relatively flat versus Q1. So, just given the volume trajectory you guys expect in the second half of the year and then particularly moving into 2019, should we expect that rate to continue to decline or I guess, definitely, how are you thinking about the potential margin expansion you've highlighted in the past?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Colton, great question. I would say, yes, we are expecting as volumes continue to grow and we continue to take cost down. The second quarter is always a \u2013 and particularly this second quarter where we had a lot of rainfall in the area, so there was a lot of pipe slips in the area and even a lot of road damage in the area that we had to contend with up there tends to drive our operating costs higher. As well, it's also the time when we come out of a thaw period there in the Northeast and we start doing a lot of our maintenance work in overhauls.","So, typically, the second quarter gets a lot of those kind of incremental cost. So, even though we were able to hold it flat, I think if you normalize for those, you'd start to see a trend towards even better unit margin than you're picking up on. So, we're really excited about that.","The team is very focused on that and I would tell you, as an organization, we focus on and in our goals is the operating margin ratio for each of these areas, which is very close to the EBITDA unit margin that you're looking at. And so, we pay very close attention to that. The teams are measured on that and the executive team is compensated on that. So, you'll continue to see us really pushing on those numbers and the teams are extremely focused on that.","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I'll just add to that, Alan. We do have variable cost up there that are driven by our electrical power costs. We do have a lot of electrical compression in the Northeast. And so, when we have volumes ramp up, those power prices \u2013 those power costs are translated into our operating expense, which for the most part are reimbursed, but it's not netted against our operating expense, it comes in other revenue. And so, you wouldn't see that as a net to our operating expense.","Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Yeah. That's helpful. And I guess, could you just update us on where you stand with the proposed Leidy Project that I think you guys highlighted the Leidy to Zone 6, I think at that point in time, you had a precedent transaction agreed to and were in negotiations with a couple of other producer counterparties there?","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. We're still making progress on that. Really nothing new to update from Analyst Day with the exception of the fact that we're just making progress there and hoping to conclude those negotiations soon. And the team is working on the applications that we will need to make for the FERC filings on that, but still making progress there and expect to have an exciting project to talk about in the near future.","Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Okay. And just last one for me here, in the past, you've noted the Hutchinson rail terminal, the loading capabilities there near the Conway assets. Just given the spread that we're seeing between Conway and Bellevue, does that asset have any value to you guys in terms of arbitrage capture?","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. We're seeing a lot of activity actually there. We're taking in lot of barrels from the Bakken, which is because of some impacts, probably short-term impacts, with takeaway capacity there, but we are seeing some new contracts that actually go out a little further than you would expect in regard to when those constraints are relieved. So, we're actually pleased with that. It's new business for us that we're capturing there and I think we'll continue to be able to do that.","Colton Bean - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","All right. Well, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Good morning. Just wondering if you can comment on the key drivers and maybe the pace of growth to get to that five to six multiple for Discovery DJ and if you can maybe just talk about the potential to add processing capacity, I think you mentioned that there is a space or permitting for 1 Bcf.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Chad, if you'll take that.","Chad J. Zamarin - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Sure. Yeah, yeah, thanks for the question. First, I'll take that in reverse. As part of the acquisition, the Discovery system already owns sufficient property or has under lease sufficient property to support the over 1 Bcf a day of capacity that's expected to be required to service the existing dedications and from a growth perspective, it is a growth asset. There's a lot of activity already underway on the acreage that dedicated to the system. There's a really attractive portfolio of producers that make up that 260,000 acres of dedication. And we've modeled a fairly conservative expectation around ongoing activities.","So, we're not expecting a tremendous amount of new activity to have to move into the area to support the growth that the Discovery system is poised for. So, we're really excited about the fact that we've got a very stable strong producer base that we fully expect to be moving a lot of volumes through the system over the next several years.","John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I think it's also fair to say, given \u2013 I think you're trying to mathematically look at the ramp of the EBITDA, we didn't change our guidance in 2019. Clearly, the Four Corners assets have gone away and they historically produced an EBITDA in the range of $80 million to $85 million. We're not saying these assets will produce that level, but it's certainly close enough that -we aren't adjusting our guidance. So, there is a ramp through 2019 and into 2020 to that five to six times multiple.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. That's helpful. And then, I guess just on constitution, any thoughts in terms of potential timing for FERC rehearing or any updates on that front?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Lane, do you want to take that?","Terrance Lane Wilson - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. This is Lane Wilson. The FERC denied rehearing. And so, we're now clear to pursue that case in the D.C. Circuit. We're evaluating that right now, but we anticipate doing that at some point before the deadline.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Sharon.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning, Alan.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning, Chris.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Couple questions for me. I was just curious if there was any update on either the timing or the components of the pending Transco rate case. I know, you've talked about August 31 as the filing date, at least \u2013 as the last date. But you had mentioned sort of the acceleration of some of the maintenance work into the first half of the year to coincide with the outage there. It sounded like that might have been a bigger amount of maintenance than you had initially planned, probably small in the margin, but just wondering if there's any changes we should anticipate with regard to that case?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Mike, do you want to take that?","Michael G. Dunn - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I will. Hi, Chris. We permanently took advantage on those outages of getting the work done before ASR came online. There was a significant amount of activity that has been planned for quite some time with our in-line integrity work. This is primarily the smart pigging that we've been performing on the Transco system as well as the number of hydro tests that were going back in pressure testing, the older pipeline system components of Transco.","So, that's \u2013 really what we were doing was taking advantage of the shoulder season here in the second quarter primarily. So, I would think you would see a different thing you've seen in the past in regard to our maintenance CapEx and our OpEx on the Transco system, where we really had to flip it this year and a lot of that was driven by ASR coming online later this year, where the Transco system is going to be operated much tighter than it has in the past. And so, we really wanted to get that work done before ASR came online.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","And, Chris, I would just add to that. Obviously the maintenance capital, which also you saw was high during the quarter, obviously that does \u2013 that will affect the rate case through May obviously. And so, we fully intend to build or recover the maintenance capital portion of that through the rate case.","So, I would say we're looking forward to getting that rate case out on the table and getting on with that. So, there has been a lot of changes obviously on the FERC side that have kept people hopping on a tax treatment there, but we feel very good and team has done a terrific job of keeping up with all those changes and is ready to follow through with the rate case here in August.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for that. If I could pivot and I apologize if I missed it, but was curious, John, if you could let us know or if you had outlined what the cash tax expectations were in association with your Four Corners sale. You had put the sale proceeds number in the release, I just didn't know sort of on a post-tax basis what we should anticipate?","John D. Chandler - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Obviously with the step-up from the roll-up, there will be not be a tax consequence. We'll be recreating a significant net operating loss through that. So, we don't anticipate cash outflow relative to the transaction.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay. That's what I anticipated, I just wanted to confirm. And then finally, I guess dovetailing back on a question earlier from Jeremy about the appetite to enter new basins or make step-out investments that might not be entirely homegrown, particularly, Alan, as you've mentioned where you have sort of capability for downstream synergy. I think it's obvious to a lot of people as they look at the pro forma WPZ merged Williams, there's a lot of capacity to spend money.","And so, just wondering \u2013 you had mentioned in prior calls, probably last year, about potential consolidation in the Northeast partnerships. There is at least one third-party entity in the Northeast that might be coming out in a more independent fashion. I'm just curious, the appetite you might have and then also geographic focus for that appetite.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I would just tell you, I think this team is extremely disciplined. There are a lot of opportunities out there, but we recognize that our cost of capital relative to the private cost of capital right now is strangely enough. We're going through a period right now as an industry where it's very obvious to us that the private infrastructure fund money is much lower cost than the public dollars are. And particularly given the growth rate in our public equity that I would argue is not being reflected in our price, it really pushes us to recognize we've got a very high cost of capital outside of what we can \u2013 of the cost we can internally generate obviously.","And so, we have to think about the other uses of that cash whether that is dividend or share buyback or whatever that might be, that's alternative use of that capital. So, yes, we have some great high-return investment opportunities as a result of our big footprint. And we will take advantage of those where we can and if we can use other people's money, that is lower cost than ours, to help capture some of that like we are doing on the DJ transaction, then we will certainly pursue that. But I would tell you we're going to remain very disciplined around capital allocation and look at it broader than just to our assets, but what it means ultimately to shareholder value.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Yeah. That's helpful. We've obviously noticed the same cost differential and I don't know if you have views on it, but perhaps perversely, it might be good rising rates, which I think historically were thought to be negative for midstream equity values as given that they had a dividend component might actually be a positive, but they drive off the cost with some of this private competition.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah.","(47:47)","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. No. That's a very interesting thought, Chris. I would just say, I think, right now it appears to us is there continues to be a lot of money trying to flow in to the infrastructure funds and private equity and I think, we see a lot of money, anxious to go to work and we think there's great places that are aligned with us that we can put that money to work and that's exactly what the team has been working on. And I think, again the transaction we just did is a great example of that.","Christopher Paul Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC","Great. Well, I appreciate all the added thoughts.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you, Chris.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Derek Walker with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Derek Walker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Derek Walker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I have just a quick one on the merger. With the shareholder vote on August 9, how should we think about \u2013 assuming that there is a successful process there, should we expect that to close shortly thereafter or are there some other items we should be watching out for?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No. You should expect it to close very shortly thereafter.","Derek Walker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. And then, Alan, you mentioned a new customer in the Utica. I just want to confirm is that related to the Chesapeake sale that was recently announced? And then, just want to also confirm, do those contracts roll with the new customer and have there been any discussions yet from that customer to perhaps renegotiate any of those terms?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","The answer is yes. Those contracts roll. And no, there hasn't been any discussion of restructuring those contracts. As far as I'm aware of, I don't think there is any expectation of that. I think the new customer knows. Obviously, we're always open to value-added transactions. And teams are always very aware of how value can be added.","But right now, those contracts roll with the acreage and we think there's a lot of value. I would just tell you that to the degree there's capital available, obviously Chesapeake has been capital constrained. They've had a lot of great opportunities, including the Utica, but they've been capital constrained. If you think about the nature of those cost of service contracts, like we have on the Cardinal Gathering System there that services the rich Utica, if somebody can come in and apply the capital and get the volumes up, they naturally take the rate down.","So, there's a way to fix and get a lower rate just through the investment of drilling capital. And so, that's kind of what I would expect to happen, given the availability of capital that, that team is going to have to apply to those assets. So, I would just say that's been a challenge for Chesapeake to take advantage of that opportunity just because they've been capital constrained.","So, I think this is a good example of the market working and new capital being brought in against attractive return opportunities in terms of drilling on that acreage and that's fully what we expect to see and volumes will go up and rate eventually will go down be it a cost of service model associated with them.","Derek Walker - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Thank you, Alan. Appreciate it.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Good morning, guys. Back on the DJ Basin, the downstream synergies that you talked about, what are those?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Becca, there are multiple synergies. I would just tell you we have some fairly complex contractual relationships downstream that I'm not going to get into that relate to our existing Rockies business, but we're not going to divulge the details of that, but I would just say there's quite a bit of opportunity in that. And as well obviously, we have a downstream infrastructure in terms of both OPPL and Conway fractionator as well. So, I would say there is multiple opportunities around that and a lot of it relates to our contracts that we have for our existing NGL volumes coming out of the Rockies.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Thank you. And then, you talked earlier in your remarks about some constraints on NGL takeaway, maybe dampening a little bit EBITDA. Will you have the ability to flow volumes from these processing plants, especially when you're at the 200 million a day on OPPL since it's full?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Good question. First of all, I would say the NGL constraints are in multiple locations as you know, I think you're well aware that the two ways out of the Rockies are either on the MAPL System, which unfortunately flows through the Permian to ultimately get to the Bellevue. So, that path previously has been an open path, but with all the Permian congestion, the route south on MAPL out of the Rockies has been constrained.","And so, the San Juan Basin asset, as an example of that, has been on allocation for quite some time. And so, when ethane margins become available, that's very difficult to capture, given the allocations going to South. And of course, the other option out of the Rockies is on Overland Pass and that has been on curtailment for, I don't know, maybe 13 or 14 months now. It has been on curtailment and has limited our ability to extract the ethane margin out of the region as well.","So, that's the constraints that I spoke about earlier. In terms of things that are changing obviously on that, as I mentioned to Christine earlier, of course the Elk Creek pipeline that ONEOK is building along with the more near-term transformation of the White Cliffs System from crude to NGLs as well as another major expansion out of the DJ Basin in the way of the Front Range system, all are providing quite a bit of relief for that particular area that will provide relief for both the Bakken and the DJ and the Rockies ethane molecules. And so, that's where a lot of that uplift will come from as those systems all are expanded out there.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Thank you. And then, last question is there have been more roadblocks put out in front of pipelines, a lot of surprising wins by the Sierra Club, the FERC now going to take into account or looking at taking into account the larger greenhouse gas emissions, how is that playing into how you're projecting your timing for new pipes \u2013 new gas pipes?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Well, I would say, for instance, on the NESE project even though that's been delayed from what we had in our capital in terms of our internal projections, we had a delay built into that. So, I would say, unfortunately, we're pretty accustomed to the delays and I think have done a good job of predicting them.","I also though \u2013 and so, I really \u2013 I would tell you that I think that, that opposition has been very effective on a number of fronts. And I think we've got to continue to do things the right way as an industry. We've got to improve discipline across the industry on our construction practices and how we deal with the public. I would tell you, I think Williams is a leader on that. I think Atlantic Sunrise is a good example of that.","But we have to build in quite a bit extra time in the Northeast. I think it's yet to be determined if that opposition spreads outside \u2013 dramatically outside of the Northeast. Obviously, the attack on Sabal Trails is an example of it spreading out of the Northeast. And so, we may see that expand other areas as well.","And so, I think everybody better have eyes wide open when you think about greenfield or long-haul pipeline construction. I think everybody better be eyes wide open and they need to sharpen their skill sets both in terms of regulatory compliance and the engineering that goes into building these pipelines in a way that stays well within the bounds of the regulators and the communities that we serve.","So, I would tell you we've been attuned to that issue for a long time just because a lot of our construction has been in the Northeast. But I have a feeling that, that is going to spread outside the Northeast. And I'm hopeful that the rest of the industry really starts to pay attention to those issues.","Becca Followill - USCA Securities LLC","Thank you. That's all I had.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks. Thank you, Becca.","Operator","Thank you. We are out of time for questions. I'll turn the call back to the speakers for closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much. Thanks everybody for joining us. Again a very predictable quarter from a financial metric standpoint, but a tremendous platform being built and a lot of work that went on this quarter that positions us for even greater growth here in the second half of 2018 and certainly in a big way into 2019 and beyond. So, really excited about the great work by the company during the quarter and we look forward to sharing that with you in the future.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John D. Porter - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thanks, Tony. Good morning and thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website. These items include press releases and related investor materials, including the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily.","Our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to questions, and we also have the leaders of Williams' 2016 operating areas with us: Walter Bennett leads the West and Central; John Dearborn leads NGL & Petchem Services; Rory Miller leads Atlantic-Gulf; and Jim Scheel leads the Northeast Gathering & Processing area. Our Engineering Services leader John Seldenrust is also with us.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconciled with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. These reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","We're planning on keeping our call to about an hour. If we miss any of your questions, feel free to follow up with Investor Relations later on today.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Great. Well, thank you, John, and good morning, everyone. We're glad you could join us today. Let's jump right in here on slide two where we have an overview of what we're going to talk about this morning. We'll discuss our full year 2016 performance and also provide some perspective on where we see the business going and why we believe Williams is so well-positioned to continue on our growth trajectory.","And first, I'd like to recognize our teams across the Williams Companies for the strong performance that was turned in for 2016. They endured a lot of uncertainty and change but just kept on delivering both great performance and execution against our projects. Cash flows, as a result of their efforts, were up and we exceeded our adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Our performance reflects the decisive actions we began taking in early 2016 to focus on cost reduction, strengthen our financial position and align our workforce to execute against our more narrow strategy.","Very importantly, we continue to bring major new projects into service and make projects on others that are now permitted. We closed the sale of our Canadian assets in 2016 and we announced a restructured win-win gathering agreements in the Barnett and MidCon regions with Chesapeake. And we also announced the start of a process to monetize Geismar, which is on schedule. We also completed a board refresh process that saw the addition of seven new board members. We're very excited about the counsel and involvement of our entire board of directors that bring years of energy company experience and a solid track record of building and sustaining growth for stockholders.","Throughout 2016 and 2017, we continued to make progress in debt reduction, and we're also enabling the funding of significant growth portfolio of WPZ at the same time. And just this month, Atlantic Sunrise reached a major milestone with its FERC certificate, and we continue to make progress on both the regulatory and construction planning fronts for this important project. There is significant support for the project from both business, industry \u2013 general industry in the area and as well big labor organizations who realized the value of the Atlantic Sunrise system to both Pennsylvania and to the U.S. economy.","But Atlantic Sunrise really is just one example of projects we're pursuing as we transform our asset portfolio to deliver fee-based predictable and stable cash flows from connecting prolific supply basins to growing markets.","On that note, we announced a transaction last week to increase our ownership in a Bradford County PA gathering operation. I'll discuss that a bit later, but we're very excited about the way that transaction worked out for us.","So, with the unique advantage position we're in across both demand and supply markets, we believe there is additional value in WMB and WPZ pricing, given our strong adjusted EBITDA growth since the oil price collapse at the end of 2014. And I'll show some detail of our perspective on that at the end \u2013 towards the end of this presentation about our growth versus our peers and our valuation against our peers.","So, with that, let's move on to slide three and discuss our overall full year 2016 results. Here, we look at the full year results for WPZ on GAAP measures of cash flow from operations. We were at about $3.7 billion, up nearly $1 billion on cash from operations. On the full year 2016 GAAP measures, we delivered net income of $431 million at PZ, up over last year due to lower non-cash impairment charges, a little bit of help on commodity margins and of course increase on fee-based revenues.","On the non-GAAP measures, we look at 2016 adjusted EBITDA is up in every segment, all five of our segments here for 2015 (sic) [2016] with a total overall increase of 8%, I think, really demonstrating the strength of our natural gas-focused strategy. And our DCF was also up about $151 million or 5.4% versus 2015, giving us a coverage ratio of 1.01 times. And of course, this is measured against the higher distribution rate of 340 a unit.","Our ongoing cost reduction efforts across the company are contributing to our strong performance, even as we brought new assets online. So we're continuing to grow the business, but as you look at our operating costs, we've been able to lower those in many areas and keep those flat in areas that we're growing. You can see some of the key drivers for the full year results by various operating here on slide three, but let's turn over to slide four and I'll provide some color on each of the areas as we look at the 4Q 2016 results.","So, looking here at slide four, the simple headline here is, we do continue to deliver growth across the business here in the fourth quarter. And our CFFO for the fourth quarter was up nearly $1 billion, primarily driven by the Barnett contract restructuring as well as growth in our modified EBITDA.","Again, on the GAAP measures, similar story. Net income of $145 million was up over last year, once again due to lower non-cash impairment charges. And in the fourth quarter, EBITDA growth on adjusted EBITDA, we saw a growth of 5% over 4Q 2015. DCF for the quarter was down about 3% versus 4Q of 2015, and this is primarily driven by increase in maintenance capital and an increase in interest expense. Of course, we're beginning to take that interest expense down.","Overall, coverage for the fourth quarter came in at 0.92 times due to higher maintenance capital spending and, as I pointed out, the increased interest. But for the year, the coverage again was 1.01 times.","So, now, let me provide some perspective across all of our five operating areas. And just as a reminder, this would be the last time you hear about all five because we are consolidating those into three areas, which will be the Atlantic-Gulf, the West, and the Northeast G&P as we go into 2017.","So, looking at Atlantic-Gulf, we continue to deliver growth both year-over-year and in the fourth quarter. For the year, adjusted EBITDA was up $112 million with the increase driven by free-based revenue growth and embedded fee-based revenues in our Discovery JV. Of course, the Discovery JV was driven by natural gas volume growth from the prior year as we brought on some of the big systems in the deepwater. Great job by our Discovery team of continuing to operate safe with tremendous growth in their business there.","We saw higher fee-based revenues as well, but we had a nice lift from the Pascagoula opportunity in the second half of the year. And just let you dial that in a little tighter, we think that was about $24 million in the fourth quarter that came from the excess volumes coming in from the Pascagoula outage there in the fourth quarter. The Gunflint revenues were up as well, and we did see a partial offset of these increases due to some outages for well work-overs and repairs on the Tubular Bells field that flows into Gulfstar.","Overall for the year, cost related to new assets being placed into service and maintenance and modernization on our existing systems offset some of the fee-based revenue growth. But pretty impressive cost controls allowed a large portion of the revenues to be recognized in EBITDA. This Atlantic-Gulf team really has been managing tremendous growth and continuing to reign in costs the same time.","But I also would point to the fact that they also have tremendous amount of new business that they're developing at the same time. So, his team really is managing a lot of growth and doing it in an operationally prudent manner. So, very proud of the Atlantic Gulf team and their efforts there.","Looking to Central. The adjusted EBITDA increased $13 million to $912 million for the full year. In the fourth quarter, Central's adjusted EBITDA decreased by $25 million to $194 million. This adjusted EBITDA was unfavorably impacted by approximately $23 million due to a one-time year-to-date true-up of amounts previously recognized during 2016 related to Barnett Shale Minimum Volume Commitment, and that was caused by of course the Barnett restructuring and recontracting that occurred during the fourth quarter.","Moving forward, we're looking forward to working with Total to improve the performance of this important gas sale through their $40 million per year drilling commitment to the area. And overall, the restructuring has been viewed positively, and we think we're on track here to deliver steady continued growth in this area. And so, really excited to get to work in an area that's really been neglected for quite some time as it wasn't an area that was attracting any capital from Chesapeake.","Just to note about the Haynesville now, that's an area which is further advantaged if the Northeast takeaway capacity is unable to supply most of the coming demand in the Southeast U.S. So, we view our position here as very strategic. And I would just tell you, I think, as we look at production here in the U.S. right now, and we see that continuing to fall, it's going to be really hard for \u2013 as prolific as the Northeast is, it's going to be hard for it to make up all of the production decline that we're seeing across the U.S. without the infrastructure coming on here in 2017.","So, we really believe that anywhere that has low cost reserves and existing infrastructure like the Haynesville are very well positioned here as we head into 2017.","So, let's look at the Northeast. In 2016, our Northeast G&P delivered a $43 million increase in adjusted EBITDA. These increases were due mainly to fee-based revenue growth as well as strong focus by Jim Scheel and our team there on cost reduction, including a reduction of $36 million in our O&M expense. So, that team is really making the Northeast, which was just on a growth tear there for quite some time, getting these big systems built out. And his team now is very focused on really getting our unit cost in line and continuing to be able to reign in costs there. So, really impressed with the way the team has come together there.","As we've discussed, the Marcellus and Utica areas really hold the key for America's energy future, and we're working very hard on increasing not only our gathering position there but also making sure we're connected to all takeaway capacity to unleash this tremendous resource that will supply low cost, clean natural gas resources for decades to come. We did see some impressive volume uplift at the end of the quarter and set records on several of our big dry gas systems in January as local load and the REX 3 expansion gave this bottlenecked area some relief. So, a little more on that later, but really seeing here towards the very end of the fourth quarter and in January, we're finally seeing some volume response to price up there.","And for the West operating area, the main story of 2016 was remarkably steady and predictable cash flows across the year with a very slight increase in adjusted EBITDA for the full year. The results were positively affected by a strong focus on cost controls and lower O&M and SG&A expenses. So, great job to Walt Bennett who leads that area for us as well and his team that really continue to put pressure on cost and at the same time really driving our focus on process safety across all of our big gathering systems both in the West and now in what was previously the Central area.","We can report that producers in the West seem a little more hopeful than they've been recently. So, we're cautiously optimistic based on some of the activities we're seeing out there, most recently in response to both better gas prices and better NGL margins for the Rockies. The fourth quarter volumes were a bit impacted by weather-related freeze-offs, and we continue to see some impact from weather here in the first quarter.","On the NGL and Petchem Services area for the year, NGL-Petchem adjusted EBITDA was up $163 million, so a very nice increase over 2015. We had a significant accomplishment in 2016 when we completed the sale of our Canadian business. And as reflected in the quarter and year-end results, it was one of the big strategic moves we made to focus the business on our core capability of gathering, transporting and handling natural gas.","As you know, we're in the process of selling the Geismar facility and an anticipated announcement here in the first half of 2017. But I can tell you, the process is moving ahead as planned, and we expect final bids in late first quarter. The Geismar facility ran well in 2016, but we did have an interruption in production late in the year as we took the facility down to make some repairs, which resulted in about a 12-day outage during the quarter.","This is a plant that's very strategically located on the Mississippi River, and we're really focusing on safe and reliable operations there as we're in the sales process. And it's a plant that is very well positioned to serve both Louisiana and the global market. Our other business, Conway and OPPL continue to generate very steady and growing cash flow. So, that area that doesn't get a lot of focus will now be included in our West, but great job of our teams there continuing to deliver cash flow growth in Conway and OPPL.","Moving on to slide five. We regularly show how we are doing against the long list of projects and deals that support our very clear strategy. It's a really good measure of progress as we continue to steadily deliver these large complex projects and deals. It's critical to keep our eye on this list of high-priority items as it is a pathway to growing high-quality, predictable fee-based revenues. And we think it's a great list for our investors to keep their eye on as well.","I think any objective observer would have to agree that progress is being made as we pursue tremendous demand growth on Transco, which is both the largest and the fastest-growing pipeline system in the U.S. But we also are preparing for the tremendous follow on in volumes as the demand builds and the Northeast is called on to meet this very identifiable growth that's right before us.","So looking at some of the recent developments, first of all, the Transco's Atlantic Sunrise, I mentioned earlier, we did receive a FERC Certificate on this 1.7 Bcf a day system. And we're continuing to now work with the State of Pennsylvania to get our final permits for that project. All is going well there, and the team is really excited about moving ahead with the construction after a very long permitting process there on Atlantic Sunrise.","On the Gulf Trace system, this is a system that most of the construction was done in Louisiana, and it's a 1.2 Bcf per day expansion to serve Cheniere Sabine Pass LNG export terminal, and this was placed in service ahead of schedule and under budget. And really nice, I would tell you, I think a nice break for our teams that are used to building in areas that aren't so friendly. Nice to see what they can do in an area, in an energy-friendly state like Louisiana and Texas. So great performance by and great execution by our team there, I'm really excited to have that in service so early. And it is now up and flowing.","Also, several other expansions that are under construction, the 1.6 Bcf a day expansion in total, 448 million cubic feet per day for Dalton, 818 million cubic feet per day for the Hillabee Phase 1, 115 million cubic feet a day for the New York Bay system, and another 250 million cubic feet per day for the Virginia Southside 2. All of these projects are scheduled to be completed this year. So in total, five big Transco projects are scheduled to be placed into service this year. I might say, just because I think that sometimes it's hard to really put all this growth in perspective, that just the projects that I mentioned here brings on about 4.5 Bcf a day of expansion capacity on Transco, and I'll remind you that, that is all 100% contracted. So we do not have volume risk against that 4.5 Bcf a day.","Pretty impressive when you think back to 2010 with Transco being about a 10 Bcf a day pipeline back in 2010. So again, great work by our team, both capturing business and growing that system. And speaking of growth, Transco did set another delivery record for peak day and three-day average deliveries of 13.7 million dekatherm per day and 13.6 million dekatherm per day on January 7 through to January 9. And so these are measured as we deliver gas into our customers, and really impressive considering we had a fairly moderate winter here in 2017. That sounds something really easy to roll off my tongue is to talk about hitting that kind of peak day on a system.","But I'll tell you, it takes a tremendous amount of coordination and focus on operational excellence by our teams to reach brand-new levels of delivery off of this massive system, especially impressive when we have so much construction and maintenance going on, on the system to be able to coordinate those. So I think a lot of times, we all take for granted the extraordinary work that our workforce do to keep up with the kind of growth and volume and construction going on, but our Transco team has been doing it and doing it in stride.","Looking out west, our Northwest Pipeline, very quietly, our team moved ahead out there and got a rate case settlement or pre-settled rate case with FERC. And though that's been filed now with FERC on January 23, those new rates will be effective on January 1, 2018. I'll also note here that Northwest Pipeline set a monthly record for deliver in January of this year as well. So that was a whole month of January record. So new monthly record. In the Central area, Barnett, the new gathering agreement course executed on November 1 with Total, and really took the risk, of the collection risk we had on those MVCs, and exchanged it for large cash payments received at closing. We also improved our counter-party credit rating and received drilling capital commitment from Total. So a lot of activities starting out there, really excited to work with Total, that area has really been neglected, and certainly it's a very important gas resource to the nation and one that we think ultimately is going to get called on here as the demand picks up here in the U.S.","For our Marcellus-for-Permian transaction, this is really an important transaction for us. Great work by Frank Billings and the team to get that deal closed, and it really puts us in an area we really like. And in fact, the Bradford Supply area where these two systems that we acquired additional interest in, just set another record on February 10 of 2.725 Bcf a day, and that means for the Northeast PA, so this is just for our two big dry gas systems up in the Northeast PA, we exceeded 5 Bcf a day on that same day on February 10. So just to put that in perspective for you, on just two of our systems and in just two counties, we gathered over 7% of the entire U.S. production. So really starting to point out how incredibly important the Marcellus is, and these big dry gas systems are up here. So we're really excited about the acquisition there in Marcellus. And I think it's a great trade for Western and Anadarko as well. So a great example of a smart trade between two companies.","On the Northeast G&P volumes, daily volume records across the northeast systems with strong winter pricing. And so as I mentioned, we continue to see great records hit, Northeast PA was the most impressive of that. But I think as we enter into the fourth quarter here, we start to see some capacity open up in the southwest part of the play, and in the Utica we're going to start to see some increased volumes there as well. So on the coming soon list, of course we have the Geismar process, that final bid from the late first quarter. But I also, one thing is not on the page that I'd like to mention here, is that we just announced the new open season on the Southeastern trail project. And this is a project that will run from our existing Pleasant Valley receipt point near Dominion's Cove Point Pipeline in Virginian, down to the south, the location is far south as our existing station 65 Pooling Point, which is a very liquid pooling point in Louisiana in St. Helena Parish, Louisiana.","So another project, it's great to see this list of 20 or so projects who we're pursuing, start to come in fruition. But we're in the early stages of this project, but we've seen great evidence of continued strong customer interest, and pulling supplies off of Transco to meet their growing demands. So let's now move on to slide six. So just little bit of overview on the transaction we did there in trading out of the Permian system. That was a non-operated Delaware Basin joint venture. It was a joint venture with Western Gas and of course Anadarko then as the parent. And so we traded out of that area. And I'll tell you, it's certainly an area that has a lot of growth. It also had a tremendous amount of capital load against it. And so we're trading into an area that has tremendous free cash flow and growth that'll be associated in volumes as that area gets opened up to new takeaway capacity. So we think the timing of this transaction was really good, and very much meets our strategy. We also took in $200 million in the trade, and again, we're very excited to continue to double down on our focus on natural gas and natural gas market fundamentally.","If I move on to slide seven and look at the financial repositioning that we've done recently. We're really excited about this, and I just want to highlight some of the real positives that came out of this transaction. First of all, we really are getting to the point \u2013 no external equity financing need against our existing business plan. Certainly, the market risk, it's always easy for us to ignore market risk and market access risk. But I'll just remind you where we were a year ago in terms of access to the market risk. So we're really excited, I think that's a key risk to take off the table so that both we as a company and investors can really focus on our business performance, which we think has continued to be strong despite some ups and downs in the equity markets.","On the coverage side, a really interesting note here, and one I think that's being missed as people look at comparison of WMB to other entities, and we just point out here that the Williams economic coverage of 1.7 times is expected for 2017. Of course, that's driven off of the 1.3 times coverage at MB, plus 74% interest in the 1.2 times coverage at WMB. So we'll provide some detail on that in the back. But pretty impressive in terms of the kind of coverage that we're building that support to WMB dividend and yield. Looking at the strengthened credit metrics for both PZ and WMB, we note here the amount of debt that we've taken down here in the fourth quarter of 2016, as well as the first quarter of 2017. And we continue to really bring this down pretty dramatically, and in fact, if you look at where we were in just five months now with lower PZ debt by nearly $2.5 billion before asset sales, and WMB debt reduction down $75 million in the fourth quarter of 2016, and an additional $500 million expected here in 2017 as we execute our plan. So really bringing that down rapidly, and certainly that was a goal of a lot of the transactions that we've been taking on.","The PZ cash cost equity reduced by 50%. We now have a top quartile yield amongst our MLP peers. And while we don't have any plans to use that cost of capital any time in the direct future and within our existing business plan, we think it's very important to have that low cost of capital because just as I pointed out, we continue to find new places to invest money in new projects. And we think for the long term, having that little cost of capital is exactly what we think matches up with this low risk growing cash flow profile that we have at PZ and WMB. And so speaking of low risk cash flow deposit, if we look at slide eight here, very impressive look at our EBITDA growth at 8% year-over-year, EBITDA growth, and that is going to continue as we continue to invest about 68% of our 2017 capital in the regulated pipeline. And so we're really excited about how steady this growth in EBITDA has continued to perform. And that's with things like the sale of our Canadian assets as well in there. And so really think this perhaps gets overlooked a bit by investors in terms of how steady and predictable the cash flow growth has been.","And as we look at slide nine, really I think a very interesting picture here. So let me just quickly explain this to you. On the top chart there, you have the EBITDA growth. Now, this begins in Q1 of 2015. And why Q1 of 2015? A couple of reasons; one, that is right at the first quarter after the crude oil price collapsed in November of 2014. It also was where we consolidated and merged ACMP's operating numbers with us. So this is a nice, clean look at WPZ EBITDA growth. And then you can see below that our peers, you can see the peers listed down there in the footnote, and you can see the dash lines are peers that haven't reported yet, but that's their consensus EBITDA. So under any scenario here, I think it's safe to say that we have continued to perform extremely well against our peers in terms of EBITDA growth.","But if you look down on the slide below there, we don't really feel like that's being reflected in our valuation at WMB, you can see us trading there as eight out of nine peers, and in terms of the enterprise value to EBITDA. And so we really believe that if we continue to execute, continue to show this growth in EBITDA, we're going to move up that slide. I really think, if you look at the fundamental underpinning of our business plan, I don't think we should be anywhere but over towards the far left on this slide because I do think we have the most identifiable growth. I think we've got very solid financial picture underneath this now. And so we really, as a team, are very focused on moving this EV to EBITDA multiple over to the left, and we certainly think we deserve that.","So just in closing here, just to tell you, it really is hard to believe in the natural gas demand growth, and not believe in these kind of value that Williams is going to continue to generate. So we feel very strong about this natural gas fundamentals pictures. Obviously, we're continuing to double down on that through the transactions that we're taking, and we believe that even with the fairly mild winter that we've had this year, we're going to continue to see a need for natural gas market growth. We're certainly starting to see the LNG starting to pull. We're seeing supply is not really reacting yet. Certainly here through the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2016, we really haven't seen supplies react yet, but we know that they've got to, to keep up with all the tremendous amount of demand growth that's contracted for on our systems.","So we're going to be continuing to stay very focused on the strategy. We're going to continue to keep ourselves well positioned, right in between these very best supply basins, and the very best market growth. And we think that the advantage of our footprint will continue to shine over time, and the continued growth in opportunity that continues to fill in our pipeline of opportunities is going to continue for some time to come.","So with that, we thank you very much for your attention this morning. And we'll turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We'll go first to Brandon Blossman, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good morning, everyone.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","I guess, let's start at Atlantic Sunrise, Alan. What determines, or what's the timeline look like from here? Is there a risk that the project slips from current in-service targets, and what would drive that risk?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Sure. Thank you for the question. Really, the primary risk at this point really remain around the permitting risk from the State of Pennsylvania. We've been working very closely with the state. They've been very cooperative, and they very much understand that we're going to do things right, and they are really doing a great job of keeping things on schedule on their side. So we're feeling very good about the work going on there with the State of Pennsylvania. Certainly, the Manor East 2 and the PennEast approvals this last week are good evidence of them continuing to execute on their side. So we're very thankful for the work that's going on with the pay depth there. They've got a lot of work on their plate, but they've continued to keep pace with us on our work.","So that's probably the next big step, if you will, for us is to get that 102 and 105 permits from State of Pennsylvania. We still need to get the 404 permit from the Corps of Engineers as well, but feel like that's moving along very handily as well. And of course, they've been heavily involved in the FDIS (35:28) all along. So that's all part of moving that permit ahead. So really don't see any major risk on those two, but that is probably the risk that I would point to in terms of timing risk at this point.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","So base case, it sounds like you still think that you can hit the in service targets that you set out there.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I think, of course, we still have it risked in our model. We still have it pushed out six months from that target date. But I would tell you, obviously, as we continue to click off things like the FERC Certificate, we continue to reduce the risk and the contingency that's built into that schedule. But right now, we still have it in there. But obviously, every permit we check off will start to pull that back. So I feel very comfortable about where we are, I would say, and feel good about being able to reach that target. But we all know that building pipelines these days is difficult, and we don't want to forget that as we lay out a financial forecast.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Fair enough. And then a follow on related to the Bradford system. How should we think of that as it evolves with Atlantic Sunrise coming online? Is there more capital to be spent? Has it been fully capitalized? What do volume trajectories look like over the next two years call it? And then earnings flat as the cost of service system, I believe, or should we expect uplift there?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. You know it well, the very little incremental capital required because most of the big systems have been out, so it's really just well-connect capital, there will have to be activity to keep up with that, but the capital there, load, is very small. And it is, you are correct, it is a cost of service system. And so even though we may see some volume increase and pick up and some incremental capital, the base systems are cost of capital. I will say however though, that the positioning of those assets, and the opening up of those markets does allow us to bring in third parties to those systems. And so we do think that that will provide an opportunity for us out there to continue to expand our presence in the area. But generally, fairly moderate growth in earnings because of the rate base nature of those assets.","Brandon Blossman - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Perfect. Good color. Thank you, Alan. That's all for me.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We go next to Jean Ann Salisbury, Bernstein.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Good morning. I wanted to ask more about the Southeastern trail project, Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast are interconnecting to Transco. Is this targeting those volumes, and how much capacity do you have down there that could go south bound, like maybe 3 Bcf\/d or so?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I would tell you that the amount of volume is \u2013 I mean, we can build and build and build, where we get \u2013 have to get beyond the existing right of way and the existing capabilities of the pipeline the more expensive it gets. And so the first 400 million, 500 million cubic feet a day of capacity is fairly inexpensive. And as we get beyond that gets more expensive.","And so we're trying to make sure that we get the very best value for that, and that we know what the right size to build is. I think the biggest challenge we have, frankly, is really picking that right size. It's not whether or not there is a project there, it's a question of making sure we pick the exact right size, and we get the very highest return available to us based on that. So said another way, the larger the project may get, the lower our return may get. And so we've got to pick, really, what the perfect project is there.","In terms of who those volumes are coming from, I would tell you the market will decide that. And certainly, that would be an area that could pick it up, but it's looking like there's demand well in excess of that in terms of the market demand. So I'm not going to get real specific on that, and the open season, of course, will tell who's going to pick up that incremental capacity. But that's, of course, the purpose of the open season.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got it. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then secondly, you've had kind of talk to a lot of investors about the IDR transaction last month. I'm just wondering if there's anything in hindsight that you would have done differently or anything that you think investors may not have necessarily seen the same way that you and the board did.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Thank you. Well, I would just say, I think we really are focused on the long-term benefit of sustaining growth in the business. And getting the IDR put away, I think, what was going to continue to be a level of uncertainty about whether or not that IDR could be met, how much waiver was going to be. So we felt like there's a lot of market inefficiency that was going to come with that. We also felt like we needed to move quickly to both take down debt. And importantly, I think probably this is the piece that you can have varying opinions on, is getting ourselves in a position where we're not having to be reliant on access to the markets over time and the volatility of those markets. We certainly saw that, that really damaged us last year as we had a lot of growth obligations, a lot of capital obligation, and yet we were having to issue debt at a very high cost, and the equity markets were extremely expensive as well. And so we feel like getting that risk out in a way that we can fund all this great capital in front of us is a really nice way to lock in margin between our cost of capital and these great projects that we have. So I would say, it's probably a delta and thinking about the risks that are out in the markets long term, and very much a focus on a sustainable model that can grow dividend for years and years to come.","Jean Ann Salisbury - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Thanks for that. That's all from me.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Next is Shneur Gershuni with UBS Financial.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Good morning.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","I was wondering if we can sort of shift focus a little bit here and talk about the sales process that you have ongoing. I kind of guess I have a two-part question here. You've had a couple of recent asset sales. Is there anything left besides just Geismar in that process? And then has the sales exceeded or they in line with your expectations. And I guess, what I'm really asking is how should we think about that $2 billion target that you put out there? Could you be above that number at this stage with how you perceive it thus far?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah, Shneur, thanks for the question. First of all, one thing I want to remind people is, is that target that we put out there is a $2 billion after-tax number. And so I think we've been pretty clear on that. But that is what we've said and will continue to say. And I would just say that the Geismar process is going very well, and gaining confidence as the days go by on that. And so I feel very good about that. In terms of other assets, I would tell you that there are some other assets in and around Geismar. For instance, some of the pipeline, the NGL and Petchem pipeline systems in the Gulf Coast, that will not be all that strategic to us. And so I think we're going to be kind of in a mode, Scheur, of looking at opportunistic purchases of assets.","And so whether there are players that have great synergies with some of our assets and are willing to put some of those synergies on the table to be the right buyer, then I think that's going to be the kind of sales that we're going see, and whether that's Mid-Continent, the stuff that's in the central region today in the Mid-Continent area, or whether it's the NGL and Petchem liquids line, it's really going to be a matter of somebody that might be a better buyer for those assets. So I don't think we're going to be in a must-sell mode at all. I think we're going to be very much in an opportunistic mode, and looking to see if somebody can make better use out of the asset than what see it. And so I think that's kind of the two areas you should think about. And to whether or not we'll blow pass that $2 billion number is very dependent on how hungry the market is and how nice the pricing we could get.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And just a couple of follow up. Once Geismar is sold, I believe you've talked about your commodity exposure would be around 3% going forward. So kind of the recent spike in NGL prices shouldn't necessarily have much of an impact. But when you think about the impact on your producer customers, are you seeing economics improving in some regions as a result, are there some green shoots where customers are starting to step up? And maybe in some specific areas, possibly the Eagle Ford and the Northeast, I was wondering if you can sort of give us the land as to where you see opportunities and where things are going to roll from here?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I think it's very interesting to me right now looking at the natural gas picture. And we continue to see U.S. production continuing to fall. And yet, the market doesn't seem to be responding all much that yet. That is going to come home to roost. But I will say that when we did see some length in the market in 2017, we did see some activities in the west. We start to see a few rigs come back in the west. Walt and his team has done a great job of capturing business out there as that's occurred. And we also saw quite a bit of activity in the northeast. I think the number of pad connections that are being requested right now in the northeast is really catching my attention, and Jim Scheel and his team have been doing a good job of capturing that business.","So I'd say it's more than green shoots in places like the Northeast because those are firm add requests. But it's going to have to come on stronger, I think, in what we're seeing so far to arrest the kind of production declines that we're seeing in the U.S. right now. And so yes we're seeing some resurgence, but I don't think it's enough, frankly, because I think we're kind of got spoiled leaning on DUCs and tie-ins with existing \u2013 of new production during 2016, and we've kind of been lulled to sleep on the fact that our productions continue to decline pretty dramatically on U.S. natural gas. So I feel, I think 2017 is going to be a very interesting year for U.S. natural gas, and I definitely think we're going to have to see some resurging activity in the Northeast, in the Rockies, and we have seen some resurgence in the Haynesville as well.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And one final question on constitution. Given the recent changes in Washington, do you see the odds of success increasing with this project? Are there things that we should be looking for out of the FERC, or should we be focused on the state in this scenario?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I'm very, very encouraged about Constitution as we sit here today. I think it's becoming very evident that it's a critical pipeline in terms of serving gas demand and power generation needs for the northeast. That issue is getting louder and louder, and it's going to continue to be because there's no way to ignore it. In addition to that, I would tell you, the labor unions who obviously have had a pretty big voice in the Trump administration are very much on our side, and I think are going to be really pressing hard on the administration on that issue. And so, I think, there's a lot of people with their hands in the air right now in DC, and trying to get attention drawn to their particular projects or their particular issues they need to resolve, and we're certainly one of those. And I think Constitution is going to be a great example of one that can bring jobs and critical infrastructure. And so, I think, it's extremely well positioned to get some attention at the Federal level, and hopefully we'll be able to work something out with the state and do that in an amicable way. But I think there are several avenues that that can be impressed at the Federal level if the state does not want to cooperate.","Shneur Z. Gershuni - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you very much. Appreciate the color.","Operator","Next is Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. If I can just talk about the \u2013 I think, in your slides in January, you talked about 20 prospective projects that are not in the backlog right now. Can you just talk about the returns you would expect to get on this? I think, you're building your current backlog at around 6 times to 7 times EBITDA build multiples. Is that kind of what you're looking at for the next wave?","And then, if you can give us some sense of the capital there, again, I think of $100 million to $200 million. So, if we get them all, are we talking $2 million to $4 million or could the number be higher than that?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. So, just few things here. First of all, as I mentioned, the Southeast trail project is a good example, the one I mentioned we have an open season on. We'll be able to \u2013 I don't need to make this sound too easy, but we basically will be making decision between size and return on that project. And so, the larger it gets, the lower our return will go. But at the smaller level, we can make a very high return.","So, obviously as we look at our cost of capital, that's a critical analysis for us to look at. But I would say, we certainly have the opportunity on that project to be in the 6 times to 7 times level, maybe even higher than that. But then, you also have projects, for instance, on \u2013 big projects up in the Northeast that are fully cost of service, so like the Rockaway Beach lateral \u2013 sorry, the Northeast Supply Enhancement project. Some of those projects are cost of service projects. Hillabee is a good example of a cost of service. We make a lower return on those projects because they are \u2013 I mean, we don't have any construction risk on those projects. And so, those are more in the 8 multiple level but, I would say, probably the mix is probably more like 80% of higher return and 20% at our fully cost of service projects that are out there.","And in terms of the size, yeah, that number is probably about right. I think, we certainly see capabilities of continuing to invest in the $2.5 billion range for quite some time on an annual basis based on these projects coming in.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's great. Very helpful. Thank you. Next question. So you've got these targets out there for leverage for 2017. I guess, I'm wondering what the targets are beyond that, if you can help us both on WPZ standalone and then WMB consolidated?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Don, do you want to take it?","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Hey, Ted. It's Don. No, we haven't disclosed the specific targets. But certainly, we want to be squarely solid within our ratings. So, I'd say, somewhere in that 4.0 to 4.5 is kind of the right zip code. And again, we're trending down, and I think that's directionally where we're heading.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","4 to 4.5 for WPZ. And then, for WMB?","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Again, we have a sort of target out there. We have disclosed that we plan to pay down some debt, $500 million this year, and we would expect some excess coverage again in 2018 that would enable us to pay down some additional debt. So, that consolidated leverage would be coming down at the same time as PZ leverage.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then, again, with the big change in the restructuring, just economically WMB is of course much more dependent on what WPZ does. I guess, again longer-term, what are your target coverage levels for WPZ? Is there any reason why you would retain excess cash flow there and not pay it up in distribution that would then come up to WMB?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I think it's prudent to maintain some excess coverage to fund your capital as well as to provide a buffer against risk, whether it's delays in projects or anything else. And we think that the market provides attractive valuation when the market doesn't worry much about coverage. So, I think, we'll plan to maintain a sufficient amount of coverage that the market doesn't worry about it, and as well to provide some level of funding for capital.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then, a last one for me. You've sort of spoken about the Northeast gathering business and kind of the uplift you could see. It looks like we've got better visibility now on Rover maybe and Rainleaf (53:51) and some other big takeaway projects. How much of an impact does that have on your volumes in the Northeast there, Southwest Pennsylvania and the Utica?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Really excited about that project pushing ahead, really excited about any and all takeaway projects just because we've got so much leverage in the Northeast in terms of our gathering systems. So, excited to see that getting off of high center. And yes, I would say, the areas that are going to be enhanced by that, certainly the dry gas Utica is going to get a nice pick-up off of that. That's where a lot of that gas will come from as well as the Southwest Marcellus area as well. And so, we're starting to see a lot of those assets fall into the hands of better capitalized and really great operators up in the basin there in the Southwest PA area. And so, we really think we're going to see some big pull when Rover comes on. We saw a little bit of improvement from REX 3. We see TETCO M2, Zone M2 trading up a little bit over the Northeast Pipeline index as that opened up. And so \u2013 but I think, with Rover coming on, we'll see a lot of people preparing to meet their obligations on Rover, and we're excited to see our volume get a lift off of that.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. I'll leave it at that. Thank you.","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll go next to Tom Abrams with Morgan Stanley.","Tom Abrams - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. Just a follow-up on that balance sheet questioning. If you could start from scratch, would you have any debt at the MB level?","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I think it's a theoretical question. So I'm not sure how to answer that, because we...","Tom Abrams - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Well, let's put it this way. As time goes by, why wouldn't you just continue to pay WMB down to towards zero?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Again, I think that's a policy question I think the board will have to take on in time. I think, right now, we're focused on paying down debt with our excess coverage. I think, beyond our guidance period. I think we'll have to wait and see what direction the board chooses to take. Just to kind of point out, we do have a revolver balance that is efficient to pay down. We don't have bonds that are due, so anything we do in the bonds would be open market purchases or tenders, which would likely be pretty inefficient. So, again, I think, the near-term focus will be paying down the WMB revolver.","Tom Abrams - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. And then, also on, I recall, a month or two ago that your taxpayer status was out \u2013 no taxes to 2025, maybe 2024 with the Geismar sale. In slide 12, you have a footnote there about \u2013 at least through 2020. I just wondered if that's the nature of your new guidance, or if something has changed in the general picture.","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","I think, our prior guidance was, we do not expect to be a cash (56:55) payer through 2020. Beyond that will be a function of future capital investment. I think, we do have significant capital opportunities to invest, which would provide a tax shield beyond 2020. But we've not provided any guidance beyond 2020.","Tom Abrams - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Next to Faisel Khan at Citi.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Now, Alan, with most of the restructuring now out of the way, and sort of the balance sheet sort of getting close to where you guys want it to be, how are you thinking about acquisitions, either bolt-on acquisitions or larger transactions or are you even thinking about these sort of opportunities at all?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Faisel, we certainly are. We're certainly looking at areas up in the Northeast where there are some great synergies between various operating systems up there. And so, we certainly have got our eyes on that. I think that the market vantage points have to come together to get to a trade there. But certainly there's a lot of operational synergies to be had up there. And as any basin does as it matures, those opportunities come together.","And so, I think, right now, we're continuing to focus on honing our unit operating costs being as low as we can where we are, but with an eye to the future for what kind of capital efficiencies can be gained between us and some of the systems that we have joint ventures in. So, pretty excited about the way the Northeast will roll up there. But I'd say, that's probably the primary area that we've got our eyes on, because we see so much operational synergy. It's not necessarily a financial transaction for us. It's really just the improvement in operating cash flows that we think we can get out of those areas.","So, we'll continue to look at those, but obviously we have to come to a meeting of the minds between the buyer and the seller to get there.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then, last question for me. Just \u2013 after the financial repositioning announcement you guys made on January 9, is there any significant change to your deferred tax asset from doing that transaction in terms of what we'll see in the 10-K when it comes out?","Donald R. Chappel - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No, but we did pick up a higher share of the depreciation deductions. So, again, depreciation deductions are now 74% claimed by Williams versus the 58% that we had previously. So, we will pick up somewhat higher shield.","Faisel H. Khan - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Understood. Thanks.","Operator","To Jeremy Tonet at JPMorgan.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for sneaking me in the end here. And just wanted to touch based on the Central segment that had stepped down a bit quarter-over-quarter. And I was just wondering if you could dive into that, maybe a little bit more granularity? And let us know if you thought that could be bouncing back a bit in the first Q, also knowing that you had sold some of those assets there?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. I think, Jeremy, probably the primary issue there was the $23 million impact that was a pretty complicated story there. But we basically were taking a charge from the fact that we booked the MVCs from prior periods. And so, once that MVC was paid down, so there's a $23 million one-time impact there in the fourth quarter that certainly impacted Central that you wouldn't see on an ongoing basis.","I don't know, Walt, do you have anything to add to that?","Walter J. Bennett - The Williams Cos., Inc.","No, I think, there were some volume declines, but I think we'll see if that's holding pretty flat going forward, additional activity will keep it \u2013 any declines at bay.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks. And then, maybe just touching on the West transaction a bit there, if you could give a little bit of color as far as how you think the volumes are trending there or any synergies that you can bring to that asset with your increased ownership or other plans you might have?","Alan S. Armstrong - The Williams Cos., Inc.","Yeah. Not a whole lot of synergies to be gained further there as we sit here today because we are the operator already on those assets. Certainly, I'd say, we're extracting all we can there today. So I don't really see a big pick-up in synergies. I think, really the big story there is, as Atlantic Sunrise and other projects and hopefully Constitution now start to open up that Northeast PA to market see volume growth outside of just the current JVs that we have that can utilize some of our presence in the area. And so, I think that will be a real positive for us as that area gets exposed to the market.","We're very convinced that that area is going to have to come alive in a big way to keep up with the market demand once the takeaway infrastructure is built. So, we're very bullish on the area. But there's not really a whole lot to be said about operational synergies that we're not capturing.","Jeremy B. Tonet - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Porter","Thanks David. Good morning and thank you for your interest in the The Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon we released our earnings press release and the presentation, that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin.","I've also mentioned that we've refined our quarterly earnings materials and our format for this call. We've adopted a clear earnings press release format and we've integrated the previous stand-alone analyst package into the earnings release documents. So we now basically have one document there rather than two.","In our presentation materials you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to generally expected accounting principles. These reconciliations schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.","And so with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan Armstrong","Great. Thanks John, and good morning and thank you for joining us this morning, as we discuss our first quarter financial performance and the key investor focus areas today. As John said we took a fresh look at the format and we're going to stay pretty brief and focused in our prepared remarks, to allow time for Q&A. So let's move right into the prep -- to the presentation and take a look at our first quarter 2019 results.","On Slide 2, we provided a clear view of our year-over-year financial performance and the results you see reflect continued steady and predictable operational performance and strong project execution from our E&C team. And the results reflect very little direct commodity exposure, in fact our first quarter 2019 gross margin reflects 98% fee-based versus only 2% in direct commodity margins. And these contracted fee-based revenues are not dependent on basis differentials or commodity buy-sell transactions, allowing for continued predictability and durability in our cash flow streams.","So taking from the top here, cash flow from operations increased 12% demonstrating significant free cash flow in the quarter when compared with the 46% reduction in the capital expenditures you see at the bottom of the slide. A much more to say about the adjusted EBITDA performance on the next couple of slides, where you can see here that it increased 7% year-over-year without adjusting for asset sales. And also you see really nice improvement of 16% for our adjusted EPS and on DCF we were up about 8% and we've also introduced DCF per share on this summary, which grew about 7% versus last year, and then lastly our very strong 1.7 times dividend coverage also increased versus the prior year. So really nice improvement on our various earning and cash flow metrics despite the impact of significant asset sales.","And now let's turn to Slide 3 and review where we finished the quarter on our leverage metrics. The leverage story of the quarter end requires some unpacking, since we have significant asset sale proceeds coming in post the quarter's end. So starting on the left-hand side of the table, if you start with the debt-to-adjusted EBITDA directly from the March 31, 2019 financial statement, you get to value of 4.92 times. However that metric includes about $727 million where the purchase of the remaining 38% interest in UEOM which we funded partially with our revolver right at the end of Q1. But we'll be refunded with proceeds reserved at the closing of the UEOM, OVM, JV that we done with CPPIB, while the latter's there.","If you adjust out that $727 million in cash we plan to receive at the closing of the JV, the leverage metric falls to 4.77 times. And then furthermore, if you account for the approximately $600 million of additional proceeds we will receive from CPPIB at the closing of the JV along with the $485 million we have now received from Crestwood, where the Jackalope Gas Gathering transaction, the leverage metric falls to just over 4.5.","So I'll discuss the strategic transactions and leverage goals in more detail later, but now let's move on to Slide 4 to discuss the main business drivers for our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth. On a year-over-year basis adjusted EBITDA increased just over 7% or 11%, if you adjust for asset sales. And so on this slide you can see a $37 million comparability adjustment, driven by asset sales including the adjusted EBITDA from the sale of Four Corners assets, the Gulf Coast purity pipeline and the Brazos JV accounting changes.","Now moving over to look at the financial performance of the continuing business, Atlantic-Gulf led the increase with an over 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA, driven by top line revenue growth from new expansion projects including Atlantic Sunrise and Gulf Connector, really very impressive growth from the Atlantic-Gulf driven primarily by continued projects that have been going into service on a regular basis on Transco.","Next up looking at the Northeast GMP area we also see just over a 20% increase in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA. This was driven by 15% higher gathering volumes and higher gathering fees associated with expansion projects. Volume increases were led by the Susquehanna Supply Hub area which grew about 25%, but we also saw a double-digit growth rates in the Marcellus South and Utica and a high-single-digit growth in the Bradford and OVM areas, so overall very nice start to the year for the Northeast GMP.","Finally, we have the West which is showing about a 7% decrease in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA after adjusting for bit share of the asset sales described earlier. And that decline is primarily driven by lower NGL margins due to a temporary surge in natural gas prices at Opal, and the effects of severe winter weather affecting one of our key customers production in the Wamsutter, Wyoming field. Importantly our operations team in the area was able to keep our facilities ready and available but upstream production freezing off was the culprit in the area.","Next, let's look at the sequential adjusted EBITDA growth where we saw about a 2% increase since last quarter. A modest increase in EBITDA for the first quarter of 2019 versus the fourth quarter of 2018, as you can see here on Slide 5. Of course it's important to note that there were two fewer days in the quarter which by itself is about $26 million or 2% of an impact. The Atlantic-Gulf was up about $30 million over fourth quarter, driven by lower O&M cost and Transco revenues were higher related to Gulf Connector, but lower due to Gulfstar One volumes caused by well maintenance.","Northeast G&P was pretty flat to the fourth quarter, where increased revenue and lower O&M expenses were offset by lower wet Utica gathering and JV EBITDA from Aux Sable for our interest -- Aux Sable and Blue Racer midstream recall that Aux Sable is an on-off interest in a processing complex in Illinois. And as we discussed in the past, the Northeast EBITDA growth in 2019 is more weighted toward the second half of 2019, and we'll be covering the outlook for the Northeast in more detail in a moment.","Finally the West is pretty stable compared to 4Q of 2018. Revenues in O&M were relatively flat sequentially and per unit NGL margins were quite a bit weaker. However on a sequential basis, those lower per unit NGL margins were more than offset by the favorable change we had in our NGL line fill evaluation margins. And as you may recall, our fourth quarter 2018 marketing margins were unfavorable impacted by the same losses in marketing inventory. So as prices move up and down, the line fill evaluation is something that swings up and down.","Lastly in the West also we did see some nice sequential double-digit growth in the Haynesville. Overall volumes were flat due to the severe weather in the first quarter of 2019, again from the Wamsutter volumes which were down in 1Q from weathers, mentioned earlier. So generally Haynesville, we had some nice growth in the Haynesville, but it's pretty well offset by the long set of volume decline in increase off there.","In summary, 1Q adjusted EBITDA was within 1% of our business plan overall. And as we've said before, we see the overall 2019 growth be weighted more toward the second half of the year, due primarily to the shape of the Northeast EBITDA growth.","So let's move to Slide 6, where we'll spend the remainder of the prepared remarks focused on our views around some of the topics we most frequently discussed with our investors. The first item we'll be discussing is our financial status update. A lot has changed since we originally issued our 2019 guidance about a year ago. From a macro perspective we've seen our producer customers pressure to pull back on capital investment and we've seen a significant downward shift in NGL margins. We've also had five important portfolio optimization transactions including the Four Corners of DJ Basin transaction, the sale of our Gulf Coast purity business, our Northeast JV that which mentioned and most recently the sale of our Niobrara business.","So lots of moving parts since we had laid out our guidance this time last year. But I'm pleased to confirm that despite these unforecasted changes, we are maintaining our guidance ranges for adjusted EBITDA DCF and dividend coverage ratio. We are actually raising our guidance for adjusted EPS to $0.95 at the midpoint due primarily to some lower depreciation expenses caused by last year's Bernard impairment and lower expected interest expense, thanks to deleveraging efforts.","If you look in the Appendix at Slide 13, you can also see that we've added a DCF per share metric and provided a bridge between DCF per share and EPS. We've had lots of discussions with investors about the very significant non-cash charges that impact our EPS, so we've given more visibility in the development. On the growth capital expenditures front, we've seen quite a bit of changes since last year associated with deleveraging efforts and new projects like the Bluestem Pipeline.","And as we'll discuss further in the moment, we are targeting a lowering of our CapEx in the Northeast G&P business, to respond to the producer activity in the region. So our teams are doing a really nice job of making sure that we bring that capital on just in time and don't get anything out in front of the drilling operation. So really nice work by our teams here, that are constantly operating in a very agile motive there. So when you net all of these changes we're revising our consolidated growth CapEx guidance to a new midpoint of $2.4 billion, down from the $2.8 billion midpoint that was provided with our fourth quarter earnings release. And when you factor in the new Northeast JV, our total contributions from JV partners this year take up another $120 million in addition to that $400 million reduction in the stated growth capital.","And when you consider the proceeds we received from the Northeast JV and Niobrara transactions along with our excess cash after dividends, we expect to fund our 2019 capital expenditure need with operating cash flows and proceeds from these transactions. The effects of our portfolio optimization transactions along with our lower capital expenditure forecast has had a favorable effect on our 2019 year-end book debt-to-adjusted EBITDA, which we now expect to be under 4.6 times.","Looking beyond 2019, we are still expecting 5% to 7% annual adjusted EBITDA growth over the long-term. So let's move on to the next topic which is an update on the Northeast growth. As you'll probably recall at our third quarter earnings call, we introduce forecasted 15% CAGR for the Northeast area gathering volumes growth for 2018 through 2021. Since then, we continue to work with our producer customers during two more forecasting cycles.","And since last fall delays in outages on Mariner East and delays on major gas takeaway pipeline like MVP have dampened the realized price expectations for producers in the area on a forecasted basis. So despite this price decline, I'm pleased to say that we are still expecting to see a 15% growth rate again this year on gathered volumes and a slightly higher EBITDA growth rate for the Northeast in 2019. Most of this is on the backs of great performers like Cabin and Southwestern. But increasingly we will see the impacts of additional investments by Encino on their new Utic acreage.","With the recent weakening of forecasted commodity prices of fewer producer customers have focused on tuning their drilling CapEx, directly to their free cash flows and therefore producer forecast at this point where 2020 and 2021 are very sensitive to forecasted pricing. And I think very important to note there, that a lot of the planning is done around forecasted pricing. And as prices change we see producers shifting that obviously. Right now, I would say with the pressure we've seen in local NGL prices in the area that has pulled some of the capital out of some of the wet Marcellus areas, and that is embedded in the forecast.","We think it is wise and good for long-term sustainability for our producer customers to take this agile and measured approach, and we applause the capital discipline. Over the long-term we believe that demand growth ultimately will drive producer volumes. Demand from converted power generation, LNG exports and new industrial loads is continuing to grow after several years of heavy capital investment and construction. And now we are seeing a second wave as the Permian gas supplies have further convinced the world that the U.S. has sustainable low gas supplies for decades to come.","As a result we don't believe that the current downturn in pricing is sustainable giving the continuous growth in natural gas demand, coupled with the discipline we have seen from the producer community. And while Permian supplies are a needed resources to help build the demand, we still have two-thirds of our gas supplies here in the U.S. being generated by gas, only directed drilling that will have to have a price signal and has become evident that we simply can't get the infrastructure build fast enough out of the Permian to keep up with the demand it continues to grow.","While those fundamentals continue to support our steady and sustainable long-term growth we do want to be transparent about the producers forecast as they relate to our near-term gathering volume and growth rate using the current detailed forecast from our producers, our gathering volumes CAGR is expected to be a very impressive 10% to 15% growth through 2021. And while our EBITDA CAGR would still come out at or above 15% through the same period.","Also on this front, I'm pleased to say that our capital programs are closely aligned with our producers, allowing us to reduce growth CapEx to more efficiently placed capital against the same amount of producible reserves. Though we are encouraged to see the level of EBITDA growth of our Northeast G&P business, can continue to generate even with reduced capital being applied and this combined with synergies from our new JV will allow us to place capital more efficiently than ever in this important basin.","Next up, let's get an update on our deleveraging efforts. With that excellent execution this year on our portfolio optimization efforts, the Northeast JV transaction with CPPIB accomplished multiple benefits for the Company. Consolidating the UEOM and the OVM systems while bringing up immediate cash for deleveraging and aligning us with long-term strategic partner who also owns and controls one of the most important customers in the area, Encino. Encino has attracted some very experiencing capable personnel and we are excited to be forming another key mutually beneficial relationship in the region, much like we have with Cabot and Southwestern today.","The Niobrara transaction allowed us to accelerate deleveraging by exiting an area that wasn't strategically connected to the rest of our business network, and this transaction was priced at the same strong mid-teens multiples, we've realized in other portfolio optimization transactions. So no changes to our long-term leverage target of 4.2, which we target to hit by the end of 2021, while maintaining the 5% to 7% annual growth targets over this period.","So let's move on to Slide 7 and start with an update on the Transco rate case. As we previously discussed, we filed for an annual rate increase in our August 2018 filing. And those new higher rates went into effect on March 1. So we're currently receiving the higher cash payments from our customers subject to refund, but you won't see that reflected in our results as we're reserving the increase pending ongoing settlement negotiations.","On the settlement progress front we've had two conferences recently and we'll have another in May. The negotiations are confidential as long as we remain in the settlement process, so I can't share where we stand at the counter parties at this time. I can tell you that the settlement negotiations are likely to continue for many months and could extend into the next year. We're hopeful that the settlement can ultimately be reached without the need for litigation and that the settlement would include the $1.2 billion emissions reduction investment opportunities.","And we continue to present any upside from the rate case -- sorry continued to not have any of that upside build from the rate case reflected in our financial guidance. And let's also touch on the status of Transco's major growth projects here. Lots of news out there these days and questions regarding the effects of the recent Presidential Executive Order might have for our projects. Obviously Williams supports efforts to foster coordination, predictability and transparency in the federal environmental reviews and the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects.","Along those lines, we were actually very impressed with the level of detail that appeared in the executive order on complex issues like the EPA's water quality certification requirements and we are appreciative of the administration's efforts and in strong support of a sustainable approach to ensuring consistent application of EPA's regulation. However, we know that any major shifts in policy is coming out, the executive order will likely be challenged by oneness of infrastructure and fossil fuels no matter how clean.","We deal with these permitting challenges on a daily basis and our project development teams consistently do great job of navigating those. And so beyond presidential orders, we continue to advance our key New York and New Jersey projects like the Northeast Supply Enhancement project, the Rivervale South expansion and our Gateway expansion by demonstrating their critical importance to the markets they serve and the quality of our execution track record, as was most recently demonstrated by our teams on Atlantic Sunrise.","Transco's large scale existing right of way and vast interconnection network are really the best way to bring clean, safe affordable and reliable natural gas with these Northeast population centers, that allow these regions to continue to lower the greenhouse gas emissions. And to that end, we continue to press on that 20-plus Transco projects we currently have in development, including the most recently announced Regional Energy Access project, the binding open season for our Regional Energy Access was extended from April 8 to May 8 to give shippers additional time to get the approvals they needed not for just the indication of interest, but for binding commitments. And we have been impressed with the interests the project has garnered. We are targeting a final investment decision in the third quarter of this year with pre-filing to follow.","And next up, I'll touch on our growth in the DJ Basin area. Since February there has been ongoing developments in Colorado as the new executive and legislative leadership of the state took action to address oil and gas development laws. Ultimately the new legislation seems to be a much more balanced approach than what we saw last fall with the sale proposition went well, with the vast majority of oil and gas activity occurring in the industry friendly wealth county area. We welcome the shift and authority to local counties and municipalities and we will continue to monitor as regulations are developed. In fact our teams are working hard right now to keep up with the growth, supported by a long backlog of currently permitted wells.","During early April, we started up our new $200 million cubic feet a day Fort Lupton III cryo and train is running very reliably and great jobs by the team getting started up safely. And construction is progressing very nicely on our teams Keenesburg I cryo that should be online in the third quarter of this year. And in February, we signed up another new pact of gas along with NGL marketing rights, right in that same area where we're continuing to develop infrastructure. So really very pleased right now with the strong demand for reliable and gathering processing services in the area, and we look forward to continued growth and support for our NGL marketing businesses including the Bluestem pipeline projects and associated upgrades at Convoy.","And next on the deep water. Last but not least, we have seen a steady increase in that, pivoting the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. For a substantial new discoveries that are being made in close proximity to our assets. This is an area where our existing assets and acreage dedications give us tremendous competitive advantages and we are thrilled to see the dramatic rebound of activity that is focused on keeping costs and cycle times low by utilizing existing infrastructure like ours.","This year we'll see EBITDA contributions from our Northwest projects including those from the purchase of the Northwest Pipeline and additions to our Mobile Bay processing complex, that we did last year and that is going to get paid for. Actually our Northwest Pipeline purchase gets paid for, once first oil begins later this year and we have line of sight to existing new potential business with likely FIDs in 2020, on several major projects that would lead to large incremental free cash flows on our existing assets base in 2022 and beyond. So as I promised on the introductory side, we'll try to keep things brief today. But we are pleased to be able to update you on the solid first quarter performance and great transactional progress that is accelerating our natural rate of deleveraging.","With that, let's continue the discussion in our Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will now take our first question from Jeremy Tonet of J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead.","Jeremy Tonet","Wanted to start-off with the Northeast G&P and I was wondering if maybe you can provide a little bit more detail with the volume growth that you're talking about. Maybe some thoughts on the cadence there how you see that kind of progressing over the next several years, based on producer conversations and also kind of CapEx specific to this area? Has that lightened up at all?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, in terms of cadence I would just say right now we've got a lot of activity, a lot of wells being and pad being turned in the line right now as we speak actually here in the last month. So a lot happening out there right now, it's all over the place both in the Northeast and the Southwest. And so what's going on that, I would say in the Utica area the Encino team there has just now taking over operations of that area, and transition from Chesapeake and that we are really working closely with them to have kind of the same kind of integrated approach to development and growth development that we have with both Cabot and Southwestern, so really excited about the team they've pulled together there at Encino and our ability to work with them.","In terms of kind of the cadence there, I would just say certainly, Cabot intending to lead the way with development with 20% kind of growth. And so I would the Northeast PA continues, they have continued to invest with or support our expansions of further expansion on our gathering systems out there. And of course we're very interested in additional takeaway capacity out of the area, given the big reserves and the low cost reserves they have in the area. But I would say in the Northeast there really hasn't been anything other than just continued steady performance by Cabot, and we're starting to see that kind of spread in to some of the other areas as well like in the Bradford area. So Northeast, so I think is very predictable and steady. The areas that have more I would say volatility in terms of ups and downs and perhaps things are little more reactive -- the prices is in the west gas areas like I mentioned earlier, both the Marcellus wet and the Utica wet. And a lot of that, I would tell you is driven by pretty sharp price -- realized price decline on NGLs that were associated with the Mariner East up and down, in the course of now hoping for expanded capacity out of their own Mariner East 2.","So I would say that the pricing forecast on NGL has been difficult to predict. And of course the gas takeaway situation particularly with the MVP has been pushed back a little bit as well. So I think those things will resolve themselves as we get in. Obviously as we get into 2020, I think those things will resolve themselves. But we are seeing those producers be very responsive and I would say very strict about living within their cash flows and their forecasted cash flows. Of course that requires them to forecast prices. But I think that's what we can look to in terms of signals there. Our drilled outflow continues to be pretty robust for both the Southwest PA and the Utica area, a lot of new capital. But we're finding ways to really trim that back, and have a capital come on just in time, as the production comes on and so that's what you see we requested in some of our capital pullback and redemption in capital, that you see here in our guidance.","Jeremy Tonet","That's helpful. Thanks for that. And turning to UEO-OMV the combination there, just wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit more detail as far as some of the synergies you see, bringing those two assets together as far as capital efficiency improvements.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. Great question. It's reeling on two fronts. First of all, the very simple front there, is on the liquids front, so we have the Moundsville fractionator sitting there, that has been running right up against its maximum capacity and we had some investments, that was going to be required there to continue to operate that facility, and to expand it. And now we're going to enjoy being able to put those liquids through our new pipeline that we're building over to the Harrison fractionator. And so, we'll be taking those liquids over to the excess capacity, big excess capacity that exists at the Kensington fractionator. And so they were sitting there a lot of the latent capacity on the fractionation side, and better markets there at the Kensington area.","So effectively allows us to shift our focus of growth for fractionation and reduce any investment required at Moundsville, and quickly take that capital out of our capital plan, so that's the simple side, on the more complex side we also are looking at ways to take advantage with the excess processing capacity that UEOM enjoys. And we're starting to run up on the capacity constraints there at OVM. And if growth continues there we'll be looking for ways to move volumes over to UEO as well. So those are kind of some of the obvious issues, obviously there is management consolidation and overhead consolidation, that's beneficial to us. But a lot of it really just has relates to being able to take capital out of our plan that would have otherwise been in there.","Jeremy Tonet","That's really helpful. Thanks. And last one if I could, it seems like NESE could really lower CO2 emissions by displacing dirtier fuels. Just wondering how that messaging is resonating in the communities that you're looking to operate in there? When do you see kind of the path forward at this point as far as permits been -- when construction could start there?","Micheal Dunn","We absolutely think that NESE is a key piece of the puzzle in the New York city and New Jersey metropolitan to reduce emissions especially CO2 emissions, it's very dramatic in regard to the emissions profile of the fuel oil. It's currently being used and converted to natural gas up there. And we're going to be a key part of that, continuing opportunity to convert. If NESE gets approved and we think it will and gets built. The permitting process is currently in the late stages here. We expect to receive a FERC certificate for that project any day now. And the 401 Certification deadline in New York was mid-May. And then the 401 Certification deadline in New Jersey is mid-June. So we would expect several of those permits to come to the forefront here in rapid fashion.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Shneur Gershuni of UBS. Please go ahead.","Shneur Gershuni","Just sort to follow up on the Northeast questions a little bit. Your first and foremost just the consolidation of UEO into Williams or the UEO transaction rather. Is that sort of change your weighted average growth rate kind of beyond 2019? And when you talked about being able to take down CapEx what you've done materially for this year, does this CapEx efficiency benefit roll into 2020 and beyond?","Alan Armstrong","And first of all on the gathering volume fees it really doesn't change that, because remember we're already operating the gathering systems that feed into UEOs, so those gathering volumes would have already been in there, so their drilling not any change on that UEO, is primarily just the fractionation of processing facilities downstream to that. So that's really no change from that. So that's really no change from that.","On the question about capital savings going forward, I would say a big chunk of the capital savings and the synergies are actually now forward-looking as we take advantage of being able to balance between the two processing complexes and the liquid. So actually a lot of the capital is even more -- lot of the gathering capital really won't change that much. If you think about, that it's really on the processing and fractionation capital, that will be able to shift volumes into areas that would not have put expansions into, I think it would --.","Shneur Gershuni","Great color. Just another follow-up kind of a bigger picture question. You sort of talked about in your prepared remarks about a longer-term growth rate of 5% to 7% for EBITDA. Can you talk about what kind of capital program would be needed to support that type of long-term growth rate? And could we assume it would be funded at least 50% from internally generated cash flows?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. And I'll maybe have John Chandler take that in terms of where we would go with that. As we said the $2.5 billion to $3 billion, assuming a little more moderated returns than we've been enjoying, generates that 5% to 7% growth rate. And so obviously as we can high-grade our investments that improves, and bring in synergies like we're doing on these JVs. But generally that $2.5 billion to $3 billion is what we think it takes to grow that 5% and 7%. And I'll let John talk about the funding.","John Chandler","I think that's fair. As we look forward in our projections today, using -- this $2.5 billion, you use that as the number, a tight expansion capital. And as we look to our forecast, we're able to fund that completely and entirely through excess cash flow. And obviously some new leverage in the future but with the growth of our EBITDA we're able to maintain and continue to lower our leverage ratio going forward. And fund that capital exports, that kind of EBITDA growth.","Shneur Gershuni","So with your -- effectively once you hit your leverage target, will there then be room to consider share repurchase business while also?","John Chandler","We had to talk about that once we get there. There is still work to do obviously between 4 -- under 4.6 to 4.2, there is still quite a bit of work for us to do. So I think we've got time to talk about that, but certainly when we get to the point where our leverage targets or where they need to be, we will be generating a significant amount of excess cash flow.","Alan Armstrong","Yes, so I would just say on that front, we'll see what the markets look like when we get to that point. But -- and so is kind of hard to answer that, because we're speculating on what the returns would be on that investment versus our other investment. But I can't tell you we're constantly allocating out capital return project, that a lot of the industry would accept. And so I think, there will be a balance there between increased capital investment opportunity, is another thing we can do with that capital. And like I said, we're constantly allocating away projects today as we continue to press on deleveraging the business.","Shneur Gershuni","Okay. And one last question if I may. Your excitement level about the Gulf of Mexico seems to be increasing. You sort of touched on your prepared remarks, but I was wondering if you can sort of expand on the opportunities that you see there and how we can -- should be thinking about it on a go-forward basis?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I would just say, the opportunities are getting to be so clinical -- that kind of get hard to keep track honestly -- but some of very certain opportunities exist around the Gulf, West, our operations around the Perdido area. Obviously, the well prospect out there is going to be a big mover for us. And Shell just announced a little bit earlier this month or sorry in April the Blacktip discovery which is also another very large discovery in that Perdido belt area.","And then to the south of that of course, the Mexico Perdido is even a much larger kind of where a magnitude opportunity, that we're extremely well-positioned for. So on the Western Gulf it's going to be a matter of maximizing our return on the investments. There is plenty of production to fill up our existing capacity and then to more. And so really important opportunities for us out there, and we're just extremely well-positioned both contractually and with the infrastructure that we have in place out here today.","If you move over to Gulf East of course, really excited about the Ballymore prospect that will likely get produced across the Blind Faith -- Chevron Blind Faith platform. And that's also a very large find there. And again just big free incremental cash flows coming our way with very little to no capital on our part, so we're excited about that. And then the Northwest prospect while we kind of thought that was almost singular as an investment. Originally, we like the returns just singularly across that one field. We've seen a lot of new development out there around the North -- not just by Shell but also by Chevron, now in that area.","And so, what's going on in the central Gulf, lots of new opportunities. The LLOG-Repsol JV will bring some promise to us in the area, and a lot of new development is going on there as well. So I'm not even getting into the multitude of the smaller projects that have been in our way. But a lot of the reason that I think we're so fortunate is that in the past, what we saw was producers really looking to add big reserves, and when oil was $80 to $90, as they were enjoying prior to '14, there wasn't so much focus on the use of existing infrastructure to keep cost down. But now with the lower prices we're seeing a huge focus on utilizing existing infrastructure. And therefore that means we're not having to build a bunch of new capital, it's just development in and around our existing assets and that is really good for us and really good for the industry as a whole. And so I would say, if I was going to describe one big change from the last time we saw the deepwater take off, that is really it. But there is this intense focus on the utilization of the existing infrastructure. And of course that, when you are -- already have a lot of the big gaps infrastructure in the deepwater that bodes very well.","Micheal Dunn","Yes, I'd like to add to that -- on the opportunity, so that was a great negotiation for us to have with Shell there where we acquired the pipeline that they build, it was pretty negotiated with the return. And we're obligated obviously to move their gas to shore through our Mobile Bay facilities, where we have percent of liquids contract with them to process that gas. But the strategic value there additionally to us is the fact that pipeline won't be full. And from day one we can go out and acquire other business to bring through that with subsea tie-backs into that Northwest pipeline, that will purchase upon first gas movement there. So a great opportunity for us to take advantage of that facility, that it's already been build, so the construction risk is taken away, as well as the timing risk has been taken away, because we don't pay for it until the gas flows.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Christine Cho of Barclays. Please go ahead.","Christine Cho","Good morning, everyone. You guys have talked about wanting to consolidate Northeast for some time. And obviously the UEOM tend to actually test you in that direction. How should we think about the potential for Blue Racer to be included under that umbrella?","Alan Armstrong","Great question, Christine as always. And I would just say the -- a lot of value in that combination, we're working through some various transactions to try to extract some of that other than through direct control of the asset. But certainly a lot of opportunity there. But I would just say we haven't been able to get there from a price standpoint, we haven't been able to get to what we thought it make sense for us on that. And so I would say lots of opportunity, but we remain patient and will remain patient with making those combinations. So, but I do see some opportunity just contractually to continue to find ways to utilize common facilities out there and I think that's a -- step in the middle if we can't reach agreement on a broader transaction.","Christine Cho","Okay. And then you guys are tracking to get to your targeted leverage faster than planned. Should we think that there are any other non-core aspects that you're contemplating selling? Or is this sort of it?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I would just say we're always -- look we continue to see this big spread between what our stock is trading for, versus what these assets are selling for. So if we can do those kind of transactions in a way that don't dilute our future and our -- and stand in a way of accomplishing our strategies then we'll continue to look through those. But we don't have anything specific on the drawing boards. And I think as we said forth, I think looking to our strategy and looking to how things link in our asset base, is not because we have some written rules, that says we have to have the downstream business for it to be a core asset. But when it comes to placing capital and new capital it's competing in this capital allocation process, that we're constantly running. If it doesn't enjoy the downstream benefits and the coupon that both from a downstream benefit, the incremental returns just don't stand out. And so, Niobrara is actually a perfect example of that.","The returns just on the stand-alone G&P basis there, just didn't stand up well within our capital allocation program. So we had both partners and customers -- frustrated with our lack of interest in investing at those return levels. And wasn't for any reason other than a distant stack up within our capital allocation process. And so that's why we are fixated on that and just because those areas that are in growth tend to drive those higher returns, and therefore make it through our capital allocation process. So I think that's about as much as I can tell you. Do we have site and then check where at this time, the answer is no.","Micheal Dunn","I would also say though there is possibly cheap money looking for opportunity out in the marketplace and very similar to our Four Corners asset. We get approached by the market all the time on asset. So again to Alan's point, well we don't have anything specific thing targeted and we're constantly being approached.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Gabriel Moreen of Mizuho.","Gabriel Moreen","I just had a quick question on the Transco rate case and some of the associated details around that. It seems like you timeline there has been extended, around settlement discussions. Can you just talk a little the decisions to kind of keep going with some discussions and having extended timeline here fairly considerably, I assume you're pretty confident in terms of your position there, so why not a move -- to maybe litigate a little bit earlier than end of 2020? And related to that, the -- emissions reductions expanded at Transco. Is there, is that going to be part of the rate cast or separated out and is that something you would spend before the rate case was concluded?","Micheal Dunn","I wouldn't say it's necessarily extended out per se, it's just a process we have to go through in front of a administrative law judge there and regards to trying to reach resettlement. So we think it's prudent to continue that process, until we reach impasse with our customers, but we certainly not there yet. So we're rapidly working with them to try to come to a settlement that both sides appreciate and like. But it certainly doesn't mean we won't be willing to litigate that, we would impasse and certainly the administrative law judge will assist us in getting there. Hopefully, quickly, so that we can don't move on to litigation path, that settlement is not, where we ultimately end up, but we would love to have a settlement with our customers there, we think it's a proper way to -- hopefully to achieve a good outcome for both sides. But, we're not afraid of litigation path as well.","Specifically on the emissions reduction, so the way we've contemplated that it would be a separate tracker as we spend the capital, we would basically change the rate upwards to accommodate the compression that's been replaced there. And it's really just allows us to do that, as if we were going through a rate case, so to speak. Without having to go for a rate case we'd be able to increase those rate, as we deploy that capital to reduce those emissions along the Transco pipeline system. And so it's ultimately we don't get the emissions tracker, that would make it more likely that we would have more rate cases coming, to be able to accommodate those emissions reductions projects within our rates.","Gabriel Moreen","And then maybe if I can just get more of an update sort of on Bluestem and how discussions are going on that? It looks there, recent oil prices has been motivating customers a little bit more. And to what extent you're looking at partners there? Where it may stack up sort of on the returns profile or within your capital backlog?","Chad Zamarin","I would just say, we continued to work on projects in the Permian to Transco markets. But we've seen recent dislocation in basis from the basin obviously to the coast. But if you look at the forward curves, I think the market has been a little slow to recognize, that might be long-term sustainable. So we're going to be really, I think cautious in ensuring that any project that we would proceed with this -- is one and that has really solid fundamentals and economics.","I think if we were to move forward it would be with partners. We are not looking to make an investment of that scale, out of the basin on our own. And ultimately I think, what's important to us is to continue to build Transco's market connectivity both on the supply and on the demand side. And so we believe those volumes ultimately wants to get to the best market and so we think Transco offers those very best market.","So again, we continue to explore participating in a project from the Permian to the Gulf coast. We have volumes, with our partnership with Brazos Midstream that we can leverage for the purpose of benefiting and improving a project. But again I think the economics that we've looked at, at least the date on the project that have gone forward and that have been contemplated haven't yet met our expectations, alongside the inventory of opportunities that we have. And so we'll continue to work it. And again, I think the most important thing for us to be -- we make sure that Permian gas has a good home to come to along our Transco market.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Colton Bean of Tudor Pickering Holt & Company. Please go ahead.","Colton Bean","Good morning. Actually, just a follow-up on the Bluebonnet discussions there. Have you seen any shift in producer willingness to flare given kind of the extreme focus on ESG for the upstream community over the last couple of months?","John Chandler","Yes, I think we continue to see quite a bit of flare, but I do think the producers are interested in getting gas to market. I think they're looking forward to release coming later in the year, when the first long-haul project comes online. We've seen significant volumes shut-in, in the alpine high area. And so we have seen, I think restrictions associated with gas prices in Waha. So I think we get a lot of questions around with this large, the basis is why we haven't seen a stronger move toward the additional project. I think what we're seeing is, it takes, as Alan mentioned in his comments, it takes a lot of time and effort to create infrastructure that can move all the way from West Texas to the market. And so, I think we'll continue to see a desire to reduce flare, but the options today are either shutting in or waiting for infrastructure to be built and it take some time.","We think another project needs to get built, but again if you look at the curve, the forward curves from basis from Waha to Henry Hub, right now, those prices don't support an investment in a long-haul pipeline. So until we see producers and end market users willing to step-up for a longer terms and better economics. And I think we'll continue to see challenges in the basin.","Colton Bean","Got it. And just circling back to the Q1 results here. So on the downtick in the Atlantic-Gulf operating expense, is that a function of timing on the maintenance spend? Or is there something more structural or nature to point too?","Micheal Dunn","Yes, this is Michael. It's not really, it's more of -- we had some one-off issues last year, that specifically in our unregulated business with turbine overhauls and things of that nature, that contributed to that higher expense in the comparable quarter in 2018. So it's not really a structural issue, it's just a timing issue of activity.","Colton Bean","Got it. And so 2018 was probably an elevated level and this maybe a better look at the go-forward rate?","Micheal Dunn","Well, I'm not going to be predictor of go-forward rates with the exception of saying that, it is lumpy, because of timing and specific terminal overhauls. They're pretty expensive, a couple of million dollars to terminal overhauls and it have to be done at certain intervals of run time hours. And so we have to accomplish those and we had the run time hours, and so it's highly dependent upon the run time of the equipment. For example, when we have to do those, and we have emerging problems, we have to go take care of. And I would also say in 2018 quarter we also did a lot of work on our reciprocating compression on the Transco system, that had to be accomplished as well. So it's just a timing of overhauls aspect and it's highly dependent upon run time.","Colton Bean","And just a quick final clarification here. For the $400 million reduction of the capital program, I think you all noted previously that around $90 million was associated with Jackalope. So is the balance of the entirety there solely attributable to the Northeast? And as we think about the Northeast, Alan I think you mentioned a just-in-time element for some of the reductions. Does that imply that any of this has shifted to 2020? Or should we think about it more in terms of the processing discussion you outlined?","Alan Armstrong","First of all, it's combination on the last part of your question. It is a combination of stuff getting pushed out, as well as ability to not have to for instance, continue to expand at Oak Grove and Moundsville. So yes it's getting pushed into '20 but you'll see some of the benefit of synergy show up in '20 would offset that. And then finally on your question of the $90 million, the Jackalope $400 million elsewhere. Well, I just say a lot of moving parts, of course we had a little bit of cost in there for getting on with the fractionation at Bellevue, as well as Bluestem, who is going in there. Some capital coming out of the Northeast and some lower capital for the year, just as these projects, we always have a lot of contingency built into these projects, and those push out and get closer, you saw we advanced one of our Transco projects in the 2020. And so we're actually seeing really good performance on that front. But for the most part, it is coming out of the Northeast, but not all.","Operator","We will now take our next question from T.J. Schultz of RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","T.J. Schultz","On the executive order, you guys highlighted what's your expectation from the DOE, is it worse to submit report just on timing to get more clarity around that? And any input you all are having on that process?","Alan Armstrong","Well, obviously on the Presidential Executive Order, first of all we were really impressed with the work that was done by the various attorneys -- staff attorneys around EPA. I think everybody recognize that the -- some of the so called guidelines and I'll use quotes around that, term guidelines had been put in place during the Obama administration, that has become treated almost like rules by the state and in fact, there never really been a regulatory process to establish that. And I think the appropriately the EPA administration is regardless of which part of the affiliation you're interested in. I think they thought, that was not proper administration and regulation and so they're trying to bring clarity to that.","And I think exactly what we've been asking for, we haven't been asking for easier regulations, we've been asking for clear and consistent regulations. And that's exactly what we thought the order tried to address without overreaching toward any one particular project. So it's something that need to be cleaned up. And if you really dig into that, it's actually a very astute and a detailed approach to it, that we really applaud. I think it's exactly big step in the right direction and it's obvious to us, and there was great experts involved in that. So well, I don't see it being a miracle tier for anyone of our particular projects that we have out there right now. I do see it as a big step in the right direction for bringing clarity and consistency between how the states and the Fed still with Clean Water Act regs within the EPA. So pretty impressed frankly with sophistication of that work.","T.J. Schultz","Okay. It makes sense. Just one more, you mentioned on Bellevue a couple of times, may be ignoring timing on end service, they've built a lot of that project. Assuming they get to Station 165, you talked about synergy, has that moved into commercializing anything at this point, if they have to wait on firmer in-service, just any color on the benefits there see you all. Thanks.","Micheal Dunn","Sorry, just to clarify you were talking about Moundsville pipeline is that correct?","T.J. Schultz","Yes, sorry about that. Moundsville pipeline.","Micheal Dunn","Okay. Yes, thank you. This is Michael. Just seeing what the Moundsville pipeline backers have said about their project, obviously they feel certainty in regard to completing their project. And we're obviously watching that very closely along with them. And ultimately we'll get Station 165 area and they're very likely should we take way opportunities for us, from that point on the Transco system, once that project gets closer to some certainty there. So we're certainly looking at that and willing to take on any customer-related projects, that would like to move that gas away from the Station 165, we certainly think there is opportunity to do that.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Hey, good morning. It looks like latest growth into Transco from the Northeast Marcellus, around 4.5 Bcf\/d including Atlantic Sunrise. Is that effectively the max capacity for Transco there? Is there anyway that you could take more gas than you paid for -- just a compression anything like that?","Micheal Dunn","Obviously say, there is -- just to remind everybody on that. Transco's capacity is fully sold, so it's consistently sold out of the [Technical Difficulty]. And so really what we're talking about is just the interrupt, just lows and how much we can physically flow during the period and that's very dependent on local loads where the gas need to be delivered to. And so there is a lot of variables that go into play there. But I would say generally, we are constantly maximizing capacity out of that basin right now, because the margin support that. But a lot of that is managed by the shippers, in other words they're the one who is dictating where they want to move the gas to and from. So a lot of that has been calculated by them. But I think that's where I would say every day we're optimizing as much as we can move that, that area.","Jean Ann Salisbury","Okay. That's helpful.","Micheal Dunn","[Indiscernible] are staying full like Atlantic Sunrise has virtually been full almost since day one. So that does bode well for the future opportunities to move additional expansion volumes out of there with new projects. So Regional Energy Access, Jean Ann, Regional Energy Access though takes advantage of a lot of existing infrastructure as does the Leidy South project, that we're working on for National Fuel Gas and for Cabot. And in so there is obviously some pretty easy expansions out of the area, relatively the project seems better working on that [Indiscernible] we got a lot of compression, we can do and a little bit of looping to do -- to add capacity out of that area.","Jean Ann Salisbury","That's really helpful. Thank you. I mean, do you still have any spare capacity in gathering in the Haynesville, I mean perhaps in the Eagle Ford or is your system pretty much maxed out there?","Micheal Dunn","I'll say in the Haynesville we bumped up against the top-end, there quite often as well pads come on. We get maximum capacity there last year and continue to find new volumes coming in there, that would try to max capacity. So we're pretty maxed out of Haynesville from time-to-time and it's highly dependent upon, from the [Indiscernible] on those wells. And then the Eagle Ford we continue to have new well connect opportunity there as well. And we continue to expand our systems there as needed for the producer customers out there. Most of that requires additional compression when we bring that online and some new well connect capital equivalent and possible looping.","So it's just highly dependent upon where the producers are drilling their pad. Yes, -- system like the Haynesville, that system actually has South and North, component to it. And so what you might see one part of the system get loaded up, the southern part, maybe more than the north sometimes or vice versa, that really dictates. So it's not like, it's a processing plant, we just have a fixed amount of capacity through the plans, the system, the capacity is very dependent on where the gas goes up. But our team has done a really nice job out there, working with other midstream operators in the area, they use up capacity to be able to cross haul between systems and they continue to do that. On the Eagle Ford we would remind you that, that is a cost of service agreement. And so that as we add capital there that gets covered in our rates where the Haynesville is not, it's not that setup.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides","I'll be quick. I know there has been a bunch on both MVP and ACP. Hypothetically is ACP and let's say even if MVP didn't go through, meaning got stuck in the court system, bogged down for a lot longer or cost creep inflated to a point making it untenable. How do you think about the solutions that Williams could offer into Virginia North and maybe in the South Carolina? And the ability the timeline to realize some of those solutions?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, Michael, obviously it's topic that's been getting a lot of discussion. We have a lot to offer, in terms of distributing the product with gas to market whether it's healthy, what would be the ACP, Eastern system or moving supplies to them. We have -- we do have a tremendous amount to offer with our existing lighter weight. MDP is more just kind of a downstream issue so to speak, because obviously they're getting across the trial with those supplies.","And so that's really struggled there. But, I would say, we have a lot more to offer ACP in terms of meeting their market distribution goals. And as the MDP, they need, they're going to need some market distribution as they do get across the trial and we're well-positioned to help them out with that. So that's how I describe that. Obviously in this environment I think it's important for all of the industry participant to try to utilize as much as existing facilities as possible, keep the cost down and that's what we're very focused on in both those cases.","Michael Lapides","But if ACP for some reason or another didn't get completed, how much new infrastructure, or new steel in the ground, how much significant new pipe would you have to build especially to get it? To get the gas into North Carolina? I'm just trying to think about the infrastructure requirements and the timeline to deliver them.","Alan Armstrong","I would say we have a lot of -- lots of [indiscernible] already into some of those markets, but it is significant in terms of the investment, it's not, it's obviously quite a bit lower cost by using the existing facilities. But it would be pretty significant investment required and it's very dependent on where the supply comes from. So a lot of variables here depending on where the supply comes from. But if you just showed up with the supplies along that 155 to 194 corridor, we have a lot of ability to help distribute that gas into the market.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Justin Jenkins of Raymond James. Please go ahead.","Justin Jenkins","Great. Thanks. Just one follow up for me. Just if you take the 1Q run rate per CapEx for a bit below the full year guide, so is it more balanced throughout the rest of the year here? Or is it back end driven? Maybe just to hop on the cadence of the CapEx if you could?","Micheal Dunn","Yes. This is Michael. Say in Q1 you can't say $10 million is the run rate because our construction projects really ramp-up in the second and third quarter of the year, that our growth projects that we're working on. So we're still within the ballpark of our guidance suggestion that we put out there, with the information that came out this week, and it will ramp-up as the summer construction season heats up.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies. Please go ahead sir.","Chris Sighinolfi","Hi everyone. Thanks for the call this morning. Alan you guys have been very active since analyst day a year ago with asset sales, JV rationalizations and clearly a focus on deleverging. I guess, I have two questions stemming from all of that. The first is to follow up on Shneur's earlier question about your longer-term 5% to 7% annual EBITDA growth guidance. Just curious how to interpret your longer-term place in for periods beyond 2019, just wondering maybe how you or John will think about the outlook versus the forecast contained in the WTZ S-4 last summer?","Alan Armstrong","Well the WTZ S-4 for last summer, I wouldn't pay much attention to the financial information. We had to do a fair amount of talking through that, that wasn't obviously meant for marketing purposes. So as we look at our forecast today, again back to our earlier point, as we look at our forecast today, over the next two to three years and we look at a capital spend of around $2.5 billion on expansion capital. Again we continue to see our deleveraging and at the same time we see this level of EBITDA growth of 5% to 7% range. So I really wouldn't put too much put much weight on the WTZ document.","John Chandler","Yes, I would just say Chris on that, we are focused on delivering on both of those ends both on the 5% to 7% growth, as well as deleveraging. And we're constantly balancing that, and obviously being able to sell assets that -- well at high multiples is pretty attractive way to get there. But we also are very focused on making sure we have plenty of reinvestment opportunity to drive that growth of 5% to 7% growth. And so far I would say, we're very comfortable about our ability to continue to face that capital. Project just continue to develop that, moving on pretty nicely. And within this period I would tell you that the one sizable project that's developed is Regional Energy Access project that's come along very nicely and with a lot of strong support all of a sudden.","So I think we're really doing pretty good about the opportunity -- the high return investment opportunity continue to come. And as we get into the 2022 timeframe the deepwater -- this isn't speculative on our part, the deepwater cash flows there are going to be pretty big, because the FIDs for those projects are moving ahead and a lot of that business will be coming through this. And so lot of that's part of the [Indiscernible] exactly the size of that and exactly how much those projects are out there and are coming on our way. So we've doing very good about the ability to see that kind of growth rate and continue deleveraging, but we are managing both of those as we think about the transaction. I mean obviously we continue to take -- even though we saw in somewhat maybe a long-term view of growth in the Northeast volumes from 15% CAGR to 10% to 15%. Again we still see robust EBITDA growth coming out of the Northeast. We've got a number of projects, if you look in our slide deck in our index, number of Transco projects coming on into this year and next year that will be adding the EBITDA. And of course those are the same as DJ Basin assets that we have had acquired last -- late last year, there is a significant ramp up in growth coming from that as well.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay, and one clarification on that John, just my own purposes, it's very clear that you omitted any Transco rate case related impact on the formal 2019 guidance. But as we think about 5% to 7% over the next couple of years is it safe to assume that if you get a positive outcome there in that period of time, that's additive to that range or maybe puts you higher up in the range?","John Chandler","It would put us higher up in the range.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. And then I guess that's very helpful. And my second question very much appreciate the reading or the presentation materials and something that we always acknowledged but illustrates clearly, I think it's Slide 13 it's just the significant non-cash items that 2% of drag to EPS. And I guess I'm just curious, are there additional transactions or impairments for restructuring, that you could do maybe trim some of those items for the benefit of EPS? Just we got a lot more questions from investors about the EPS, I'm assuming, you do to, and I'm just wondering what more could be done on that front? Thanks.","John Chandler","That's a weird commentary for a CFO to look for impairments, but it is something obviously that to the extent we could have that, it would benefit our depreciation -- by lowering our depreciation which is way out of line with our maintenance capital. There is really not a lot we can do on that front, absent to the extent we partner on assets that we consolidate today. That and to the extent we move the assets from a consolidation to a non-consolidation type approach to maybe partnering through JVs. That potentially could allow us to revalue assets and impair, and bring that depreciation level down. Anything short of that though, any of the test or impairment is based on gross cash flows, and well a lot of these assets got marked up to really high-value, back in the Access, Midstream merger, which was not a cash deal which is stock-for-stock trade but it forced us to revalue a lot of the Access assets at a very high valuation level.","While those are at a high level, the gross cash flow still exceeds those book value. So anything short of actually some system kind of partnership for JV that would force some level of deconsolidation, that's the only thing that allows really to help bring that depreciation down.","Chris Sighinolfi","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. I know, it's a line of questions for you. The focus seems to fully changed. And it seems like that the reason [indiscernible] in Northeast maybe our structure [indiscernible] as well. So, just, that was where I was --. Appreciate it.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead.","Craig Shere","Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered. I did have a quick one. Alan you commented on the weak wet gas, in Marcellus and Utica in terms of recent trends, and NGL pricing looks like Blue Racer had a pretty tough quarter. How do you see all those impacting the pace at which your new West Virginia panhandle processing might fell off over the next couple of years?","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I think Craig, the investment we have there feel pretty good about that filling up. And it is as I mentioned earlier we got a lot of pads being turned online, and so really starting to see that come off. It doesn't -- it didn't a lot, big as those patents are, to make progress on that front. And we had some contracts coming our way that are shifting volumes our way. So feel pretty good about the TXP-2, the existing base capacity plus TXP-2 and we were able as a result of this synergy and knowing we have excess processing capacity, the UEO, that takes -- puts us in a position to not have to prebuild any capacity out in front and don't grow any further.","So this energy or the -- as I mentioned earlier one of the nice things about that synergy is that, it prevents us from having to put capital in place to build out in front of those increasing volumes, because we do have alternatives that where we can ship those volumes to, but preserve the cash flows from it. And so I would just say, that gives us a lot more breathing room and allows for better capital efficiency as it relates to the OVM processing capacity. And so we intend to take full advantage of that.","Craig Shere","Sounds good. So your TXP-2 is basically contracted up -- that slowdown is not really going to impacted but your derisk, the fact that you don't need new capital because you have the ability to work between basins?","Alan Armstrong","Right. Correct.","Operator","We will now take our next question from Tim Schneider of Citi. Please go ahead.","Tim Schneider","Some -- just real quick. From my seat, I would say the biggest debate points among investors is capital allocation for companies in the midstream space. So I'm just kind of wondering how you guys look at the strategically, when you get together kind of bouncing growth, delevering and returning cash to shareholders over the longer-term and I think you said kind of the -- to leverage target, but what you think the right leverage is for a company with the asset mix of Williams? is that something that should go below 4x, are you happy kind of being in the low 4s, just interested in your thoughts here.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. I would just say our asset mix, just we don't have a lot of -- very little business that's marketing based, is not basis differential based, it's not the term optimization that gets you to often around the assets, which is trading around the assets. We don't have that kind of variability per cash flow. And I bet you can see that with the remarkable predictability to our cash flow streams, that continues to flow. So no, I don't think they ought to get -- mark all the same, but I would say that the rating agencies have told us that, on their basis, it's a 4.5x kind of number to be BBB flat, and we want to be there be confidently there, at BBB flat level. And so that for 4.2x mark on kind of a steady run-rate basis is what we are seeking that because that happens to be coincidental with that BBB flat side from the rating agencies.","Tim Schneider","I mean, I guess if you guys are getting feedback from the investment community, do you really want to see something more of 4x, is that something that you would aim for in that case? Or do you think, well let's just kind of go with what the rating agencies are saying?","Alan Armstrong","I would just say from my own personal perspective on that. I think they're tend to be fads that move through the investment community. And I think from our vantage point keeping our debt costs down and capacity to flex when we need to, is what we're targeting from the business trajectory. And I think we think that's really the smart place for us. And I think the market has to figure out, and it should figure out, who has volatility in their cash flows and who doesn't, and that ought to be driving the number, that each company should aspire to not just because somebody magically came up with a 4x number.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I would now like to hand the call over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan Armstrong","Okay. Well, great, thanks everybody. Great questions as always and we appreciate the opportunity to visit with you on this. Really excited about the continued very predictable way our business is running, and the way our teams are executing on projects. So look forward to speaking with you in the future and at the next quarterly call. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Porter","Thank you, Divona. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages; the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily; and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.","In addition to Alan, we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas present with us. Frank Billings leads our Northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area; Rory Miller leads our Atlantic Gulf area; and John Dearborn is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel, is available to respond to any questions.","In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks, and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we've reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Good morning, everyone, and thank you, John. Starting here on Slide 4. I love this cover that our IR team came up with beginning. It really depicts all the tremendous amount of activity and construction and project development that we have going on right now at the company and are currently managing. And certainly, this is what is -- will support the tremendous cash flow growth that supports our 20% dividend growth at WMB. It also -- I think it's important to note, this heavy CapEx burden also weighs heavy on our coverage during this supercycle of investment opportunities that we're thrilled to be a part of right now.","But before I get into the slide, let me just very quickly remind you of our strategy that continues to guide all of our actions and certainly our investment decisions. And so our strategy, which is to be the premier provider of large-scale infrastructure to design, to maximize the opportunities created by the vastly greater supply of natural gas and natural gas products now known to exist in North America's unconventional resource plays.","This is underpinned by our scale, which we see as a competitive advantage in all the areas that we operate. So wherever we are, you'll see us be big. And if we can't be the #1 or #2 in an area, you won't see us playing in a space like that because we think to have superior returns, you've got to have the advantages of scale that allow you to connect to your customers to the best markets.","So we want our supply connected to the best markets, and we want our markets connected to the best supplies. And we want to be the infrastructure in between that continues to fuel this tremendous opportunity here that we have here in the U.S. to take advantage of low price natural gas, natural gas liquids and the olefins, derivatives off of that.","So moving on to Slide 5 here. I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on this because it really is just a overview of this presentation. But here is what we'll cover here this morning. First of all, I'll talk a little bit about our better-than-expected third quarter performance and the drivers for that beat and also show some detail on how we're accounting for the impact of our Geismar outage.","Next, I'll also reaffirm our 20% dividend growth profile at WMB while lowering our distribution growth rate to the bottom of our earlier stated range for '14 and '15. So we're at the top end of the range here in '13, and we'll be moving to the bottom of that range, that 6% to 8% range for '14 and '15. And of course, that is designed to drive better coverage metrics at WPZ and along with something we're excited to announce and something we've been working on for a while, which is to provide you some detail on our Canadian asset dropdown. And that would be the existing assets that we plan to drop down in January of '14.","Next, we'll review some drivers of our tremendous 60% DCF growth at WPZ throughout this guidance period. And then finally, we'll review our project execution scorecard that is so critical to our success, and we continue to show you. And so it's critical, not only for this guidance period but even beyond our guidance period as we continue to develop more and more fuel for our growth beyond 2015.","So moving on to Slide 6 here. This is an overview of the third quarter, and it certainly was a good quarter and better than we expected on many metrics for the quarter. And so the thing I can tell you I am most excited about is where strategy is working. And finally, in this quarter, we saw our growth in our fee-based revenues begin to overcome the continual slide in the NGL margins. And so you can see there a $61 million increase in the fee revenues, and that's a 3Q of '13 compared to 3Q of '12. And so really thrilled to see that.","In addition to that, despite the tremendous amount of development and effort we've got going into growing our business, we are also able to control cost and continue to lower cost on that same comparison of 3Q '13 to 3Q '12. So at WPZ, our DCF was up 20% as compared to 3Q of '12. And this was driven by that $61 million increase in the fee-based revenues at PZ. Primarily, this was driven by the tremendous growth in the Northeast and on Transco.","And also, just to put that in perspective for you, that means a 9% increase in our fee-based revenues more than offset a 30% decline in our NGL margins during that period.","Also, something I'm very excited about is the $19 million reduction in our O&M and G&A, again, in the face of tremendous growth across our system. Additionally, our WPZ maintenance CapEx was down $50 million as compared to '12, and we still are spending over $310 million this year in these maintenance capital expenditures. And we certainly -- and compared to '12, one of the drivers for that in '12, we had a lot of spending in our -- the asset integrity and the Clean Air Act issues related to our gas pipelines. And so we got a lot of that out of the way in '12.","And in addition to that, our maintenance capital on our Midstream assets was actually down more significantly. And this was driven by lower well connect cost out West, and as well as we've been making some smart consolidations out West and retired some of our older higher-cost assets, like our Lybrook complex in the Four Corners area. And that allows us to obviously to then do not have to spend the money to maintain those assets over time.","We continue to invest as required to maintain these safe and reliable assets. And in fact, we will invest over 35% of our segment profit from our pipes back into the proper maintenance of our 2 major gas pipelines, Transco and Northwest Pipeline. So the negative for the quarter certainly was the lack of contribution from our Geismar facility, and it only contributed $15 million to the DCF for the quarter. And this represents about a 13-day period between the 60-day waiting period on the BI and the planned 50-day turnaround.","And we'll show here on the next slide and show some really good detail on how that works out. It's certainly fairly complex the way we're accounting for that Geismar impact. But I think it's really important to note here that even with the Geismar with this 20% growth in DCF, we only got $15 million of that 20% improvement out of Geismar for the quarter. So really truly a strong DCF for WPZ during the quarter.","And we'll show here on Slide 7 -- now moving to Slide 7. You can see what we show as the impact from Geismar. And so I'll focus your attention here to the $79 million in the bottom of the second column, and what that represents is the negative impact or the delta that we estimate we would have seen we did see in the quarter versus what we would have seen if Geismar would have been up and running on a normal basis in the pre-expansion mode.","So to keep this simple on this chart, you can think about this business as about a $1 million per day of impact to our DCF and in the pre-expansion mode. And so you can see there that if you -- the 60-day waiting period accounts to a total of $60 million of impact in 2013. And you can see the 50-day turnaround amounts to $50 million of impact, looking over there to the right column. So really only about 13 days of profit in the third quarter associated with the business interruption claim that we submitted for the third quarter. And this combined with the receipt of an actual insurance payment of $50 million related to the incident during the third quarter allowed us to record this $15 million of DCF in the third quarter.","So we also show on this slide how that has been handled in our accounting for both GAAP and adjusted numbers, and we provide some additional detail in the appendix. So anyway, fairly complex, but bottom line here is we think this hurt us. Having Geismar down for the third quarter hurt us by about a total of $94 million, offset by the $15 million of DCF that we recorded in the quarter.","Moving on to Slide 8 then. This is the -- a little more detail on our Canadian asset dropdown, and so we certainly are excited to be announcing this. This really comes at the start-up now of our last big expansion, our ethane, ethylene recovery facilities that are now in operation at Fort McMurray. And so we've got pretty big window here now between the next big tranche of assets that'll come on, which will be the Canadian -- sorry, the CNRL Horizon facilities and the PDH facilities. So this is a nice window for us to drop down these assets that are now up and cash flowing the existing assets that are up and cash flowing.","So a little bit about this business. Certainly, as we've explained before, we've got great competitive advantage in this business. And because we really are the only parties up here that are taking the off-gas and extracting these highly valuable products out of the off-gas, and we've got the right assets, the right experience and the right operating team to be able to continue that. And so we're excited about our -- that continued competitive advantage leading further growth for opportunities like Syncrude in the future.","We also are expecting about $200 million of DCF from these assets in 2014 and 2015. And one thing I think is really unique about these assets is they were quieter [ph]. Though they're a typical processing plant and fractionation, they have such a tremendous resource upstream off them that is invested by the upgraders that we really have very little capital required to keep these assets, keep the free cash flow coming out of these assets partly due to the fact we don't have any well connect cost, we don't have to go secure new supplies for these assets and partly because these assets are relatively new as we've been expanding these assets over the last 10 to 15 years.","So very excited about being able to do this, and we will be funding this through WMB taking back 100% paid-in-kind units on -- so on a transaction, this will add DCF coverage for both '14 and '15. And as the many projects come online, this will continue to support our industry-leading dividend growth beyond 2015 when the PIK units convert.","So said another way, that certainly, the PIK units give us some room on our coverage here. So we think this is a really smart transaction for WMB and Bridges to win this tremendous amount of capital investment that we're making over this period. About $8 billion really starts to kick in, in '15 and beyond.","So the planned dropdown of these currently in-service assets is subject to the successful negotiation of the transaction between Williams and Williams Partners. And because of that, we're not going to be pinning down a price, a transaction price at this time. But I will provide you a little more insight into what we're expecting here. We certainly recognize that a portion of these assets have commodity risk. And as a result of that, the multiple need to be lower than what you might normally expect. And so just to decode that a little bit at this point, we expect that multiple to be below a 7 multiple for this transaction, and so not too different than the kind of multiples, all-in multiples that we saw with the ethylene cracker. Even though I'll remind you that these assets, for instance, the ethane and ethylene business are backed by some fixed rates in terms of capital recovery for the ethane and ethylene projects.","Another really important point I would make on this slide is that our projects like the CNRL Horizon project, which is underway and we are certainly up and spending capital dollars on that, and as well as our PDH project and potentially, the Syncrude processing expansion are staying at WMB, and will be great future dropdown candidates for WPZ. And in fact, just to kind of put that all in perspective for you, WMB continues to build out a tremendous backlog of future dropdown candidates in both Canada and the Gulf Coast PetChem area that we've talked about in the past.","And so just the projects that are approved and underway. We've got more than $2 billion of additional dropdown candidates for WMB, that would be dropped down to WPZ. And in addition to that, we also have the exciting Bluegrass and Moss Lake JV with Boardwalk. So we are building out a tremendous amount of dropdown opportunity, and that doesn't even include things that we're continuing to develop like the Syncrude opportunity in Canada as well. So plenty of continued growth for WPZ as WMB continues to develop some major projects.","Moving on to Slide 9. You can see here the very impressive story of DCF growth from 2012 really as we increase $231 million from '12 up to $1.72 billion in '13, then in '14 going up $630 million to $2.35 billion and then up another $435 million in '15 versus up to $2.78 billion. So some very impressive growth going on in the space.","And I would just say a couple of key points here. First of all, the coverage ratio that you see here does assume the distribution increase of the 9% this year and 6% in '14 and '15. So the coverage is over and above that distribution growth. And importantly, in '14 and '15, we are assuming no additional IDR waivers from WMB. So really working here to get WMB -- or sorry, WPZ to a position of the coverage ratio that we're comfortable with. And certainly, the Canadian dropdown and the reduction in the growth rate are the key tools that we've employed here to accomplish that. The drivers throughout this entire period, as you can see, are the tremendous amount of portfolio projects and the one dropdown that we have built into WPZ right now.","I'm also going to make a few notes here on just there's been some confusion, I think, on the IDR waiver for 2013. And just to be a little clear on that, we are only planning on using $140 million of the $200 million that we have previously announced at the cap. And so what we did say was that we would contribute up to $200 million of waivers from WMB to WPZ as required to maintain a 0.9 coverage ratio. The good news is because of our better-than-expected performance at WPZ here in the -- about the third quarter and throughout the balance of the year that we do not think that we will need to contribute any more than another $50 million on top of the $90 million that is being put forth today. So anyway, good news on that from both the PZ side and the MB side.","Another comment I'll make here quickly is on the capital side. And you'll see in the CapEx changes as you review them you'll see we've added about $375 million or about 4.6% increase over the $8 billion of spending during this period. And there's really 2 primary drivers for that. First of all, a $200 million increase in our Gulfstar 1 project. And let me remind you that Williams Partners has a 51% share of that project, so that'd be $102 million net to our interest. And so this brings the real net increase in capital spending to about 3.5% over this $8 billion.","And in addition to that, though, to really describe what's causing that, we have 2 new Transco projects that have been added to guidance during this period as well. And so Transco just continues to see tremendous opportunity on the market and in particular, of expanding as people continue to build a demand for the very low-priced natural gas and the tremendous growth opportunities that the Eastern Seaboard represents for Transco.","And so let me move on now to Slide 10. And this is our scorecard that we continue to show you. And just a few things to highlight here in terms of changes to this. First of all, you'll see that the third quarter projects, which was the Canadian ethane recovery and Transco's Northeast supply link are now online. And so we're excited about that. The investment in ACMP, I will tell you, is not listed here, so we have a lot of capital here. But in addition, we have growth coming from the ACMP investments.","And also remind you that with the exception of the Geismar expansion project and the Canadian projects, the PDH and the CNRL upgrader, these remaining projects are all backed up by fee-based revenues. And so that is what's continuing to drive that increase in fee-based revenue. I think what's really impressive here as we continue to add -- in fact, we've added one project here, the Hillabee Expansion, to this Transco portion. But we also have a smaller project. It's not listed on here. But we continue to really build out the Transco expansion projects, and we think those are great projects for both WPZ and then ultimately flowing to WMB's cash.","So that's the picture here. We've already talked about the Gulfstar increase, and I think that's the majority of the issues you'll see in the Northeast. Our spending is actually pretty flat, a little bit of movement between the various asset areas but generally pretty flat.","Moving on to Slide 11. And this is the picture of the Northeast. Certainly, we're making a major reduction in the rate of growth for OBM. And -- but I certainly want to keep this in perspective here. We have now grown these volumes in year-to-date '13 versus year-to-date '12 by over 80%. So despite a lower projected growth rate at OBM, our growth here is tremendous. It continues to be tremendous, and we couldn't be more excited to be in what we think is the growth area in the U.S. for -- from both the Marcellus and the Utica.","And so this growth, as you know, does not depict our exposure -- economic exposure that we have to both ACMP and the Blue Racer. And it also doesn't include any growth from Three Rivers. Yet we're still showing a 73% growth in this period from '13 through '15.","So we've lowered, as you can see there, pretty significantly OBM, but the primary drivers for that being a lot of the private equity groups that were invested out here have now sold out to parties like Chevron and Statoil. And I would just say that they are more patient investors. And I think they're waiting to make sure that the infrastructure is available to get both their gas and their NGLs to market. And so we think they obviously make great customers for Bluegrass, and -- but they're going to look at these resources and make sure that they can get their products to market and to good markets before they go into more aggressive drilling programs out here.","And so that's really one of the major changes here as we shifted from more aggressive independents owning some of these resources to more patient investors like Chevron and Statoil.","Moving on to Slide 12. This is just a big list of all the various accomplishments and the things that continue to go on here. Certainly, the Bluegrass open season and the continued growth on Transco were kind of a big highlights that I would point out to you here. The Atlantic Sunrise open season was overwhelming, I guess, is the best term we have to describe it. And really very, very excited about the kind of response and how quickly we're going to be able to bring that to closure given the very strong response there. And so it's nice to be in a position of having to figure out how you're going to size a project and fit in all of the demand that we saw from that. So that's a very exciting development during the period.","Additionally, we hit a new record high in the Northeast of 2 Bcf per day on a monthly average during the third quarter. And as well, ACMP announced earlier, as I'm sure you all saw, that they were raising their LP distribution up 23% in the third quarter versus the third quarter of '12. And that is big news for us because that really accelerates the Williams GP, first into the high splits a lot quicker than we were planning on.","So that investment opportunity is proving out very well for us, and we continue to be very excited about our relationship with ACMP's management team and our ability to continue to support their tremendous growth opportunities that they have in and around their business. So couldn't be happier with the way that asset or that investment is performing and certainly thrilled to see the high quality of the ACMP management team that continues to perform very well.","Moving on here to the closing slide. Just to remind you that we are all in relative to this natural gas infrastructure supercycle. We think it's the right place to be. We like a commodity that we think is so low compared to crude oil and other commodities that it is going to continue to drive demand, and ultimately, that demand is going to drive continued supply growth. So we really are bullish on our situation where we sit, and you're going to continue to see us invest heavily into this space while this opportunity to build out this major infrastructure that will be here for many decades to come gets built. And we don't intend to back off of our heavy investment cycle while the opportunity presents itself.","We also continue to be excited about our 20% WMB cash dividend growth through '15. And I think if you really stop and look at how all of these big projects are coming on in '15 and the continued growth cycle that we see beyond that, I think you'll see that we've got good reason to continue to support a very strong dividend growth beyond 2015. And again, would just remind you that we've got over $1.1 billion of DCF growth in '13 through '15. And this is not based on acquisitions that we might speculate on. It's not based on projects that we're speculating we might win. And these are projects that we are out and developing and building right now and all identified and contacted. So very excited about where we stand today. Excited about some of the changes we made here for the third quarter and look forward to hearing your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","In last quarter's data book, you guided towards $110 million to $200 million of segment profit plus DD&A for the WMB NGL and Petchem Services in 2014. Can you help us reconcile between that number and the $200 million DCF number you gave for the dropdown? Is most of that driven by the higher propylene prices you are now using in commodity assumption?","Donald R. Chappel","Don Chapelle. Yes, it's largely an improvement in margins in Canada as well as lower expected corporate allocated costs. And that's just based on formulas that we continue to implement. So our new organization structure that we announced at the beginning of the year is, I think, bearing some fruit. And our costs are somewhat less than perhaps what we expected before in the Canadian business. It's getting a bit less of that. So I think those are the -- or the NGL Petchem Services business, excuse me in making a more broad statement, is getting a bit less of that. So those are the primary drivers.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then how should we think about the potential timing for the additional dropdown that Canada, the 2 other off-gas processing contracts, the 1 -- maybe 2 PDH facilities, maybe Bluegrass. Would you be open to drop it as soon as it's cash flow generating, which may not be a lot in the beginning? Or would you wait until it's a little more mature?","Donald R. Chappel","I think it's too soon to answer that question. I think certainly, be eligible to drop at any time quite frankly. But we think that the right answer is to build it at Williams and then drop it once it's in service. And I think we have to take a look at the cash flow profile and determine if it's right on start-up or if it's some time after start-up as the cash flows ramp up. So I think that's a question that's a ways out. It's couple of years out at the earliest, and we'll continue to study that.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then what are the tax implications for dropping the Canadian assets? Are you guys subject to any repatriation tax?","Donald R. Chappel","We expect -- and I think you'll see it on our 10-Q, to record a tax provision of just over $200 million, cash taxes of about $140 million in the near term. And so it's really an acceleration. We expected that at some point that we'd have repatriation and we'd have a tax to pay. This will accelerate those cash taxes to the tune of $140 million. We'll be able to use excess cash balances, cash balances we have on hand to pay the $140 million. And then after that, we'll have the Canadian tax. Right now the Canadian tax rate is very low, perhaps 0 because much like in the U.S., we have high capital spend and accelerated depreciation that's shielding taxes. But at some point, we'll pay Canadian taxes, and we'll get a U.S. tax credit for the taxes paid in Canada, and we'll pay the differential of U.S. tax. So fairly -- so the onetime cash tax cost is about $140 million, and then beyond that, it will be some incremental amount of U.S. tax over and above what we would typically pay in Canada. Canadian statutory rate is 25%. So again, it's factored, but it's not huge relative to the value of the assets.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, very helpful. How comfortable are you with the new numbers at OBM? Are we largely derisked here? And also the other segment costs in the Northeast segment seem to be really high. Is there anything onetime here in nature? Or is this kind of more of a run rate we should be going off of?","Francis E. Billings","Sure, this is Frank. I think on the -- relative to the Northeast in the volume, I would say that we have probably derisked that some. And really, what I would say is the primary factors. I would call 2013 kind of the lost year. I mean, we really didn't get much volume growth. And basically, what we've -- we're anticipating and what our producers are projected is kind of push, kind of what we were expecting in '13 and kind of roll in most of the drilling plans forward. On the cost side, if you look quarter-to-quarter, we did have -- looks like a pretty significant increase in quarter-to-quarter, other segment costs and expenses around $22 million. But in that number is -- some of that 9 -- the $9 million adjustment that's down below, and we had the continued liability that we booked. We also had some slip repairs that hit us in the third quarter as well as some writeoffs of some investments that we started to undertake in OBM but then did follow through with those. Or we much changed the project scopes, though we had some costs that we had to -- that we're capitalizing, we've had to take to expense. So I think going forward, we'll have a run rate that's less than what we saw in the third quarter. In OBM, we have a liquids system, a gas system, processing plant and fractionation. And we've really kind of set up our organization to have some of those assets in place in 2013. Those assets aren't place in 2013. We won't be looking at material or much staffing increases as we get into '14. So really, we're going to kind of hold and redistribute our [indiscernible] once our assets [indiscernible] and we'll have better defined after the construction and commissioning is completed. So we did have some items in Q3 that drove that number up, but our run rate should be less than that.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then last question for me. The spread between Texas and Louisiana ethylene prices have obviously been a focus given the pipeline between the 2 states that's down. How are your insurance proceeds going to account for this? I think it was initially thought that the pipeline will be down through year end, but now I'm hearing that it's going to be pushed out further than that.","Donald R. Chappel","Christine, this is Don. The insurance policies provide coverage in terms of the lost value in production. So we'll calculate the -- we know what the lost production is. We'll take a look at the market prices, and that would be the basis for our claim. With respect to the pipeline, that's something we're continuing to study to determine what effects it may or may not have. So I'll just pause there and perhaps -- I don't know if Alan or John want to add anything regarding pricing on the pipeline.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Well, just because I asked because are you going to be getting Mont Bellevue pricing or Louisiana pricing? I mean, there's like a $0.20 spread between the 2 points, last time I checked.","John R. Dearborn","Yes, and perhaps I could make some comments there. This is John Dearborn. If we look at the dynamics in the market there, right, with our plant down and Chevron's Evangeline pipeline out of service, the Texas market has got length, and Louisiana is short, right? So that's what we always see, and that's what's driving the premium between the 2 markets. As we look forward and we bring Geismar back up and we expect that some time, Evangeline will be back in service, that same market dynamic is going to diminish in its significance. But let's remember also that second quarter next year, we move into the industry's ethylene cracker turnaround season, and I believe there are about 4 crackers that go into turnaround then. And so as we take a look at all that, in total, we're looking forward at strong demand [indiscernible], which I think is going to support very strong ethylene margins into next year and through next year if we could take you into that line of reasoning, Christine.","Donald R. Chappel","Again, this is Don. And I just remind everyone that this pipeline outage is a short-term issue. And we don't expect that to extend all that long.","John R. Dearborn","And recall also that's a Chevron asset. So I think for -- the true story that you'll have to look to Chevron for that as well.","Operator","And we'll go next to Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Just maybe a high-level question on the Northeast infrastructure issues. I think you guys are probably in one of the better -- or have one of the better vantage points on the pipe side. So what are you seeing in the Northeast, what alleviates the differentials, and what's your view of the differentials going forward?","Alan S. Armstrong","Holly, I'll take that. This is Alan. First of all, I think there's been a lot of focus on just the Northeast dry area. And certainly, there is more infrastructure over in the Southwest and over in the Utica area, but we're certainly seeing continued a lot of development over there as well. And I would say a lot of pressure has come on -- came on here in the third quarter from 2 factors, one being that certain pipes were not yet opened. So Tennessee expansion wasn't online yet, and so that, we think, will help alleviate. But as well, a lot of new gas came on in the quarter that wasn't necessarily from drilling, but it was from infrastructure tie-ins, not necessarily on our systems. But some of the adjacent systems really worked off a lot of the well connects and a lot of the pending completions. So we saw a tremendous amount of gas come on -- trying to come on in the third quarter, and it was coming into the face of the market that was lower. And so the Northeast Supply Link Project is now up and running, and so -- on Transco, so that's 250. I can tell you that's hardly a drop in the bucket compared to the kind of demand that we're seeing for the infrastructure being built out of the area. But I do believe that the fall shoulders out there are going to be a little worse than the spring shoulders because this is kind of a rare situation up here where you have the Leidy Storage, which is a very large market area storage that refills in the spring but, of course, was full in the fall. And so nowhere for that gas to go either into those local markets or to the South. I think pipelines like Transco are -- now make or got plenty of support for new infrastructure to debottleneck systems to be able to carry markets to the South. And certainly, the Atlantic Sunrise open season was indicative of that. And as well, of course, the Constitution project, we think, will alleviate some of the challenges up in the Northeast area. But I will just say this. People that are not paying attention to that and not planning for their capital expansion are taking some pretty big bets, I would say, and some pretty big risk. And those that are continuing to plan and plan well, I think, will be the winners at the end of the day and will be able to access growing markets on systems like Transco to the South. And so I think we're getting after it, and as usual, the market -- we tend to wait a little too late to get the infrastructure built. And we'll probably be having the same discussion on Bluegrass here in '15 before that capacity comes on to get the NGLs out of there as well. But I certainly think the market has gotten a strong signal from the gas-on-gas competition it saw this quarter, and it seems to be responding to support continued infrastructure development out of the area.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Got it, okay. And then I guess you gave an explanation for the, I guess, weakness in the Northeast volumes compared to maybe what you'd initially forecasted. Are -- in terms of these new customers or now the majors, are -- what are you assuming for growth in '14 and '15? I guess my point, are you comfortable that your new targets have some of their plans factored in?","Alan S. Armstrong","It is. It's really kind of built from the ground up, looking at the drilling plans that we've discussed with the producers. And so we feel pretty comfortable. I would certainly -- wouldn't try to tell anybody it's not without risk because there's a lot of continued infrastructure development to be built out there. But I would tell you that we feel pretty comfortable with the schedule and the detail that we built behind the volumes at this point. And so it really is kind of a grounds-up review from each of our producers and their drilling plans out there. I do think there -- perhaps there's some opportunity to improve on that. If we saw some better pricing signals and people become convinced the Bluegrass is going to be -- get built, we might see some even better development into the '15 timeframe as people gear up for that.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then you kind of led me into my final question. Can you just maybe explain the open season for Bluegrass and how these commitments will really work on the Bluegrass pipeline and the LPG terminal?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I would just say that the open season for the pipeline is completely separate from the fractionation and the export terminal discussions. Having said that, we recognize that customers don't want a pipeline to nowhere. And so that's why we've been working so hard at developing both the storage, the terminal and the export facilities is that we've got to be able to provide customers with a comprehensive solution. And I would -- the thing I'm fairly encouraged by in that regard is with the discussions we're having on the export side, we're seeing interest in customers wanting to know where that supply is going to come from as well. And so I think the market's really starting to come together in terms of the supply side and the demand side. And we see that as one of our critical roles in the industry right now is bringing together that strong demand that we're seeing from international players back upstream to our customers on the upstream side and being the party providing the infrastructure in between.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. So it's not all comprehensive in terms of at all getting built.","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I would say that at the end of the day, people are going to want to know what their frac deal is. But that's a -- just because of regulatory process, that's a bifurcated process. So we deal with them in the open season, and we make sure that everybody has a chance to weigh in on the capacity that they want and the terms of the capacity they want on the regulated side. And so we make sure that's a nondiscriminatory process. And then second to that, then there's a discussion around what people's needs are for storage, fractionation and export capacity. But I would say that most customers are going to want to know what their deal is on both sides of that. So on one hand, they're separated for regulatory purposes, and on the other hand, people need to know what their downstream services are going to be.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Stephen Maresca from Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just sticking on Laurel Mountain and OBM for a second, and to be more specific, you took Northeast adjusted segment profit and DD&A down about 20% in '14 and '15. Can you help us understand what changed so materially in such a short period from last quarter's forecast to now? I know touched upon it, Alan. But is it as simple as just your drilling plans are off because of the change in ownership? And as a subset to that, it seems like you dropped the '16 and '17 kind of bar chart forecast you had in your slide deck in terms of gathering volumes for the Marcellus. Did -- is that a sign or do you not feel as comfortable forecasting that anymore in light of the changes in ownership from private equity to bigger majors?","Alan S. Armstrong","I would just say our -- what we're seeing from the majors is, as I said, just a more careful effort on their part to make sure they maximize the NPV of their reserves and not just to quick-drive towards IPs [ph] and volumes. And so -- sorry, IPs and reserve growth. And so I would just say that we've -- what shifted really was having -- sitting down and wanting to make sure that we weren't investing capital too far out in front of the reserve packages that we're seeing there and not taking on additional risk. And so that resulted in sitting down and getting very detailed granular analysis on what their drilling plans were. And as you know, that's a little harder to predict because the motives of the majors are more around allocating capital around, and so it's a little harder to predict than somebody who just has one resource to go develop. And so I would just say we've gotten a lot more conservative in our approach towards that forecast, and it's just built from the ground up. And that probably is -- the major shift that we made, Stephen, was moving from a resource capability play to a detailed analysis of what the producers are actually doing and their actual drilling plans.","Donald R. Chappel","And, Steve, we ceased to project '16 and '17 given the challenges we've had in projecting the next couple of years. So we've -- we're really focused on projecting '14 and '15 and just conforming the volume forecast to our guidance period and really not trying to get too far out given all the variables that we see in the Northeast.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, appreciate that. Moving to Bluegrass, I just have a couple of questions here. Alan, do you have the same level of confidence in this project getting completed as you did on the last call given the large competitor project proposal? And can you talk at all -- ballpark types of project returns you would expect? And then I have a second one just on the funding after that.","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I would say on the confidence level, I think this might surprise some people. But the confidence -- my confidence level is not really all that driven at this point by the competition, by the competing project just because we think we're so far ahead in terms of development of the project and details and how far ahead we are in terms of getting project developed. I think the -- so I would just say that's not really that big a factor frankly. I think the challenge that still remains is producers knowing their drilling plans, being committed to the drilling plans. And so I think we may get a lot of commitment, but we're going to need to be weighing how solid that those volumes will be and how much we can count on those volumes being there. And so that's what we're in the process of doing with the open season. And as I've said before, we're very excited about Bluegrass. We think it's a really key piece of infrastructure for the Marcellus and the Utica. And we think that it really, really needs to be installed at the end of 2015 to protect our investment on the upstream side and other investments or other more indirect investments that we have up there. So we think it's very important, and we think Bluegrass is the only one that can really meet that kind of time line. So that gives us a lot of confidence, but we're also -- we got a lot of projects to invest in, and we're going to make sure that it's a sensible investment for us before we plow -- start really plowing the big money into it in the first quarter of 2014.","Donald R. Chappel","And, Steve, this is Don. In terms of financing, again, we have a partner at Bluegrass. And I'd also note that we've been approached by others, industry players and financial players that would like to invest in the project, and we may or may not choose to partner with others. But beyond that will be a combination of debt and equity to maintain our credit rating goals, which we have previously consistently espoused as investment-grade ratings.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. One follow-up there. Have you thought about something at all, doing something with your Access GPL [ph] stake, to monetize that and create some liquidity? Or is that not something that's on the table right now?","Donald R. Chappel","All right. I think all of our assets are things that we evaluate all of the time, and certainly, those are assets that we continue to look at as well. So I certainly don't want to create an expectation, but we certainly look at all the levers that we have to pull as we look at potential financing.","Operator","And we'll go next to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Not to stay too much on the Northeast GMP, but we do have a pretty significant cut in EBITDA but not really any change in the CapEx forecast, from what I can tell from last quarter. So we're effectively saying we're getting lower returns on capital. I must -- I'm missing. Is there any reason why the CapEx budget may not have gone down given the slower volume ramp?","Francis E. Billings","Yes, this is Frank. What we've done is we basically cut more of the capital out in the out years. We've taken out the third train, frac train. We've pushed out the second, third and fourth processing plants. So we've kind of -- basically, we're focused on installing the -- let's say those foundational assets, the second frac expansion, the stabilization plant, the deethanizers, the ethane pipeline. Once we get all of those assets in place in by 2Q of '14, we'll -- pretty much of that, majority of those what I would say is the foundational assets in place. Some of the assets have installed costs, have gone up some, so that's part of the reason we've kind of had -- we haven't had the 2014 capital change. If you look, most of it shifted from '13 to '14, and that's the representative of the shift in in-service date. And then most of our growth capital has been pushed out to match the volumes being pushed out.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. The -- just shifting over to Geismar. Can you give us an update on where you are with some of the regulatory side of that in terms of the -- whether it's OSHA or [indiscernible]the other folks sitting there, looking at it?","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. I'll have John Dearborn answer that for us.","John R. Dearborn","Sure, and thanks very much for the question. Our relationship with both the agencies remains extremely strong and excellent. And we're committed to keeping it up certainly that way. With the government shutdown that we all witnessed here the last few weeks or so, we've suffered a bit of a delay, all right, as that shut down the CSB and the OSHA work for a bit of a while. However, prior to that shutdown, we had all the necessary protocols in place to continue our work around the propane propylene fractionator that was damaged. And so we've continued our work, and we don't expect to suffer any delay in what we're doing as a result. One of the other things, though, that I'd like to bring to your attention in order to continue to build this relationship with OSHA and CSB is, you might have noticed that we've released the findings of the Williams investigation, and we're taking care to communicate those findings to all of the important stakeholders, of course, our employees being one of them. But we took the time and effort to communicate that to OSHA and CSB, and of course, they were grateful to that -- to us for that. Bottom line is we still expect the OSHA to issue their report around the beginning of the New Year, and that's the next important milestone, I think, relative to the federal regulatory agencies.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Very helpful. And then last one for me just on the costs. You did actually take out a lot of costs, it looks like out of the West segment. And I'm just wondering if we should think of that as a sustainable new run rate? Or is there any kind of onetime lower OpEx you may have had there?","Allison G. Bridges","I think -- this is Allison Bridges. Yes, we have seen some lower cost especially as a result of some of the reorganization that Don spoke about earlier, and some are the allocated costs that we get in the plants.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Just actually a few clarifications of things that were said prior and maybe first starting on the Northeast on OBM. And, Frank, I think you mentioned this, but just to be clear that essentially, the pushout that we have seen in some of the milestones, the Moundsville fractionator, et cetera, that is all very deliberate with respect to matching up to industry activity, right? That's got nothing to do with execution, is that correct?","Francis E. Billings","I would say that the Moundsville frac train 3 is probably associated more with preserving that decision to be in line with the Bluegrass decision when we make that determination. I would say that moving the Moundsville frac train from 3 or 4Q of '13 into 2Q '14 is a function of just physical execution of the projects that we've seen in that area.","Donald R. Chappel","So to be clear on that, the demand is there for the first expansion or the Phase 2 Moundsville, and it's a matter of getting that project completed. The decision for laying down third is just because we think Bluegrass will reduce the need for local fractionation. And so we think that we're becoming more and more confident on the timing of Bluegrass such that we don't need to have both the local frac and a Bluegrass solution.","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, definitely, the second frac train at Moundsville with 30,000 barrels a day is definitely needed as well as the stabilization plants and the deethanizers. So those are all on track for completion in '14 to support the drilling programs in place.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. No, I -- that's helpful. And then, Alan, just to kind of go back to the Bluegrass and understanding the commercial sensitivity of where we are right now, but I guess, as you guys have opened the biddings -- the open season here. Is the general approach a minimum take-or-pay type of commitment? Or isn't there something where, for the right price, you're willing to take volume risk?","Donald R. Chappel","Yes, because that's a regulated asset, we offered out a, I think, very intelligent response to the market that allows us a considerably higher rate for people that are just wanting to dedicate acreage but not make volume commitments. And then a very attractive rate to the degree people are willing to make a volume commitment. And there's various steps in between that. And so we basically provided a menu for customers, and then we still -- once we get all that built into our analysis in terms of those options, then we can decide whether that we think that degree of support justifies the investment and the project. So it is a menu, and it's, like I said, a very attractive rate if you compare it to, like, an ATEX ethane where it's a pay -- ship-or-pay kind of obligation on one hand. Then on the other hand, up to a volume dedication with -- or sorry, an acreage dedication have much higher rate but one that gives producer flexibility.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay, appreciate the clarification. And then maybe just last question back on Geismar and the business interruption insurance. And I guess now that we have $50 million recorded agreed to, I guess, by the insurance companies, and I guess the number is refined a little bit more from sort of the initial preliminary estimate. Don, do you feel more comfortable around the uncertainty range, if you will, around that number today versus, say, for instance, on the second quarter call? Meaning, have there been deliberations with the insurance companies that have tightened perhaps the deviation of where that number can go to? Or is it basically, each time a new claim is filed, it's a new claim, a new process, so to speak?","Donald R. Chappel","No, I think we feel comfortable with our claim amount. Clearly, we have a good read of the policy, and we certainly know the lost production, the actual amounts to be determined based on the market prices and we would have realized. So that'll be dependent on what happens on the market over the coming quarters. But certainly, in terms of the volume, the lost production, we know that pretty darn well. So we think we've got a solid basis for our estimate here. I think the initial $50 million payment evidence is good faith on the part of the insurers. They stepped up and paid us $50 million in advance of our actual claims because our out of pocket around the physical damage was not that substantial yet and we only had 13 days of covered loss under business interruption during the month of August. So they actually, I think, made a good-faith early payment. So I think that's a good sign. Our next covered loss under business interruption would be for a partial month in October, so kind of the end of October. That's when we assume that the expanded plan will come back to service. So we'll file a claim for the month of October during the month of November, and then we would to expect it will take the insurers a month or so to respond to us. And we're -- and that will be the process every month. So partial month in October filed in November, give the insurers a bit of time to review that claim and respond to it. And then we'll have a full month loss in the month of November, file that claim in December, and again, the insurers, a bit of time to respond to that. So I think from a process standpoint, it's pretty well established. I think volumetrically, we know what our losses are, and we're mitigating the losses to the best of our ability, the economic losses. And then I think we'll see where market prices turn out. But again, we've outlined in our guidance what we expect the lost profits to be and the market price assumptions we've used there, and that's really what's guiding this claim.","Operator","And next, we'll go to Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","We saw on the Leidy Southeast project, most of the shippers on that project were downstream or LDC. Are you seeing more upstream demand as you've gone out with the open season on Atlantic Sunrise?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes. Alan, would you like me to take that?","Alan S. Armstrong","Please, Rory. Thank you.","Rory Lee Miller","Yes, Bradley, this is Rory Miller. It has been changing, and there was an earlier question about pricing in the Northeast. Of course, we're looking through a knot whole, a bit there. But certainly, what we've on the -- our current Leidy system that moves about 3 Bcf a day, there's much more gas than that trying to get into that line every day. We've got 8 Bcf a day of interconnections there. And so there's a lot of gas-on-gas competition for things that are playing in the spot market, and the prices have been at huge discounts to the Henry Hub. So I think that really is leading up to the answer to your question, and that's that we've seen a lot stronger response from the producer community. That being said, the people that made requests within the open season were fairly balanced between the market side and the supply side. But the producers were definitely stepping up in a much bigger way than what we've historically seen on Transco.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And you alluded earlier to having interest from potential partners in the Bluegrass project. And in the past, with projects like Constitution, you've obviously brought E&P partners into the project to secure volumes. Have you found so far that there are E&P shippers who are maybe making their participation in Bluegrass contingent on getting a significant equity stake in the project?","Alan S. Armstrong","No, we really haven't seen that from the key customers that we're talking to because it's such a big investment. Mostly -- usually, when we have the parties that are wanting to take equity, it's a project that's fairly specific to their needs. So for, instance, Constitution with Cabot. That project was mostly -- capacity mostly taken by Cabot, and they wanted to make sure they were involved and had a stake in making sure the project was executed well and as well enjoyed some of the economic benefit of their capacity obligations. I think in Bluegrass, we've got a variety of different shippers such that it's not enough -- nobody has a dominant position in the pipeline, like we've seen on some of those other assets. Having said that, I would tell you there's a lot of interest from more strategic players, I would say, in wanting to have an interest. But it's likely not going to be the -- from the E&P side for the reasons I stated.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Got it. And the MOU that you alluded to last year when you acquired the ACMP interest that Chesapeake would -- at least intended to commit volumes, is that still an agreement that's in place as it pertains to Bluegrass?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just jumping to the Canadian side, just in rough numbers, maybe when you think about the top line in the Canadian off-gas processing business, how much of the revenue is there? And I realized it's kind of a key polar arrangement in the off-gas processing, but what percentage of that margin is coming from the olefins side versus from just the NGL side?","Donald R. Chappel","We'll have to get back to you on that. It's -- that mix has moved a little bit just recently as now we're starting up the ethane recovery plant. And that business, as I remind you, is a floor -- has a margin on it that has a floor that we're operating at because ethane is it's based off of Bellevue ethane. And therefore, that will be a fixed fee that will not be commodity-sensitive. But we can get back to you some detail. I don't have that right off the top of my head here.","John R. Dearborn","That would -- and it is John. The precise number for the majority would be NGLs and the minority being the -- being olefins up in Canada today.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just one final one. Looking through the guidance, and there are a couple of other questions that alluded to this point, in the Western segment, you mentioned some of the things in the field that you were doing more efficiently. And certainly, it looks as though there was a big move up in 2013 full year EBITDA guidance, and fairly sizable move in '14 and then a little bit smaller move revising upwards in 2015. Maybe just qualitatively, if you could talk about why is it that the benefit from those cost-cutting or efficiency gain initiatives that you're taking gave a larger -- provided you with a larger step-up in guidance in '13 and '14 than it did in '15?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I think what you're really seeing there is just a lack of confidence in drilling volumes continuing out West is really what's driving most of that. And so the cost savings, I think, are very apparent to us there. But I would just say I think most of that is driven by an expected decline in volumes out West.","Operator","And we'll go next to Curt Launer with Deutsche Bank.","Curt N. Launer - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Two questions if I may, one more back to the Marcellus. In the 10-Q, you're referring to less favorable economics in the Western region. And I think that's been discussed a lot already in this call. But from the standpoint of the lower volumes in '13, what are the conditions, what are you seeing relative to your discussions with producers that could make that materially better in '14 and '15? Clearly, we think about it from the standpoint of NGL takeaway capacity boosting the netbacks. Or is it a question of natural gas prices needing to be higher that would spur that activity?","Francis E. Billings","Yes, this is Frank. I'm assuming you're referring to the Western part of the Marcellus...","Curt N. Launer - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's correct.","Francis E. Billings","Or our Eastern business up there? I would say that the biggest thing we see relative to the Western area and volumes is more a function of what the ultimate netback might be for those areas, especially as you get into Northwest Pennsylvania, Northeast Ohio, some of those areas that are very infrastructure-challenged. I think in the -- our area, especially in the OEM area, I think we have -- we saw an improvement in the netbacks when we brought our fractionation train on, and we're going to see continued improvement in the netbacks to the producers when we bring this stabilization plan and the next fracturing as well as rail load facility. So for us in OBM, I think it's going to be able to show its consistent ability to get the commodities sold into the market. And I think that's what's going to support in our area we're currently operating. But I do think the Western part of the Marcellus, it's going to see -- and even Ohio, it's going to see -- we'll see some -- some of us could see some of the same pinching of basis relative to net gas sales and NGL prices as supplies outstrip, being able to get those commodities out of there.","Curt N. Launer - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. And switching gears to the Canadian assets. I wanted to ask if there's anything you could tell us that will help us model that into the outlook here. You mentioned the PIK units certainly, but what would be the expectation relative to debt as being part of the financing package as the assets are dropped down?","Donald R. Chappel","Curt, this is Don. Again, I think, as Alan mentioned, we expect the multiple not to exceed 7x on the purchase price. We expect it to be all equity. That's advantageous from a tax standpoint to Williams. Again, we defer taxes on that basis other than this tax that's triggered by changing the ownership -- structure of the Canadian assets to WPZ. So that's really the driver there. I hope that responds to your question.","Operator","And we'll go next to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Is there a fine on Northeast -- I'm sorry to keep harping on it. But I think you talked in all those slides, you're deferring $200 million a day processing out of '15 into later period and 30,000 barrels a day of frac. Yet we don't see CapEx go down. Can you reconcile that?","Donald R. Chappel","Yes, I think what we've done is we need the second fractioning. If you look at our 2014 volumes, our 2015 volumes in OBM, we will need to start to put the second $200 million a day train that drove in. But a lot of that balanced plant work has been done as far as the initial work. So we don't have a significant, significant requirement. But we have pushed it out to where we may not have to spend those dollars until 2016 given the current volume forecast that we have today. So you have -- that's probably the only asset that we've kind of shoved out of the '15 into '16 relative to kind of assets that you've seen before.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","I think the frac capacity sound like 30,000 barrels a day also.","Donald R. Chappel","That's the other thing, yes, that I mentioned earlier.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","So are you saying that the CapEx -- you've already spent the dollars on that, and so that's why we don't see CapEx coming down?","Donald R. Chappel","Well, we purchased the frac train. So we have that in our inventory, wasn't going to redeploy that in either some of our other opportunities that we have going on today whether it be up to 3RM [ph]. But today, most of the CapEx -- to get the kind of the investments that you see as -- on the slide, Slide 8, most all of that capital will be deployed in 2014. We have a little bit of capital in 2015 that prepared to get the second Oak Grove facility on. That one would be in our 15 plan. But beyond that, we've pushed out frac train or processing plants 3 and 4 and some of the other things that we've had in our 15 plants.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then this is -- it's smaller in the scheme of things and I don't have all the numbers in front of me. But looking at the maintenance CapEx, in this guidance, it's down by $85 million over the 3-year period and it looks like the last -- probably the last 4 quarters, maintenance CapEx keeps coming down. In an aggregate, it's material relative to the size of maintenance CapEx. Can you talk about what is it driving that and your thoughts behind the maintenance CapEx?","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. As I mentioned earlier, we're still spending a very large amount of our profit particularly within the pipes. In fact, over 35% of our segment profit, we're putting back into maintenance CapEx if you take the 3-year maintenance CapEx and put that over the -- our segment profit. And so very significant amounts still going into that. But I would say that we invested very heavily in both '11 and '12 in catching up and beating the deadline that we had relative to some regulatory requirements for getting some of the asset integrity work done on the pipeline. So we had kind of a lot of that capital squeezed in to the '11 and '12 period. And as well, we also had things like we had some work that we had to get done for the Clean Air Act on -- so on our compression, on our major pipelines that we had to get done as well. And so again, those kind of culminated in '11 and '12. And so we've been working that hard in terms of getting done what we needed to get done for those timeframes. But it's allowed us a little bit of relaxation here in terms of that heavy capital spending in the guidance period that we have before us.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","I understand why it was higher in '11 and '12. But what I don't understand is why the guidance keeps coming down for '13 through '15 because I mean, that's past. So why would the guidance keep coming down?","Alan S. Armstrong","I don't think I can -- sorry, I didn't follow your question there. Well, a couple of things. One, with the continued decline in volumes in the West, we have less maintenance CapEx. And we've made some decisions, as I mentioned earlier, for doing things like taking the Lybrook plant out of service. So some of our older fleets out West is a result of the volume reduction, and those older plants, as you can imagine, suck up maintenance capital. And so those changes have been made to our Midstream maintenance CapEx and on the gas pipes. One thing we did do -- and I'm not sure this is a major driver, but it's certainly embedded in here, is we had some pressure-testing obligations that we were trying to get all done by '18. We took a really close look at those in terms of really where we needed to reduce risk on the system and negotiate it with FEMZA [ph] to -- and got them to understand that really, the better risk reduction was spreading out that timeframe on some of that pipeline integrity work. So that spread things out a little more versus where we had some dollar spending in there in '18. So that's a little bit of that reduction on gas pipes. But I think the major reduction you see is really on the Midstream side. And it really is the teams out West working pretty hard to reduce our maintenance capital out West, and it's resulted in reducing volume.","Rory Lee Miller","Alan?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes.","Rory Lee Miller","One other item, too, that's probably worth mentioning to Becca here, the -- with the changing flow patterns on the Transco system, where we're now getting a lot of our supply or much of our supply from the Northeast as opposed to just the Gulf Coast. The middle portion of our system is the compression on that portion of the system is running much less frequently. So we're having a lot less hours on those units. We're having a lot less maintenance there, and our turbine change-outs are being able to pushed out in the future years. So as we kind of put that whole new dynamic into the equation, that's also a bit of a significant impact.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great point. Thanks, Rory.","Allison G. Bridges","Yes, and this is Allison Bridges. And I would also just like to add to the lower sort of maintaining the facilities. We do have some pretty significant reduction in well connects than we had previously had. So at least for the next few years, that's continuing to come down.","Operator","We'll go next to Selman Akyol with Stifel.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","In terms of the Canadian assets, in your assumption there of the $200 million, what capacity utilizations have you guys assumed?","John R. Dearborn","They're flexible. There are -- there's actually 3 assets there to be thinking about. One is the -- is liquids extraction plant up in Fort McMurray. The other is the pipeline, and the other is the fractionator. In terms of our operating in the next year and future years, the fractionator is going to be running near to full capacity. We'll need some incremental expansion in order to accommodate CNRL plant and the liquid extraction plant up in Fort McMurray when the upgrader is running -- be running pretty much full out because it's a dedicated to that facility.","Alan S. Armstrong","I'll take recovery point.","John R. Dearborn","I'm sorry?","Alan S. Armstrong","I'll take recovery point. Can you do the other? Let's partner. I would also add to that. Normally, we build into that about a 97.5% run time. So in terms of how much, that's up and that's consistent with our typical capabilities. And perhaps, you can speak to the pipeline?","John R. Dearborn","Yes, the pipeline will have a little bit of excess capacity as we -- we'll have some room on it as we bring on these other projects into the future.","Selman Akyol - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Great, And then just to confirm, are you still looking for an April 1 start on Geismar?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, that is correct.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Armstrong, at this time, I'd like to turn the conference back over to for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Well, thank you very much for joining us today. We are blessed to have such a great portfolio of growth -- major growth projects to pursue, and those keep coming on. And that gives us confidence in our ability to continue to grow our WMB dividend and our distributable cash flow at WPZ for many years to come. And we certainly are excited to make the step we're making on the Canadian asset dropdown, which moves us closer to a pure play. But we also retain the benefit of some very significant dropdown candidates for WPZ in the future. So we think structurally, we're very well positioned. And we think in terms of our business opportunities, they just couldn't be more robust. And the team is very excited about continuing to execute and deliver on this tremendous cash flow growth. So thank you very much for joining us this morning and for the great questions.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. And at this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","John Porter","Thank you, Mary. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners.","Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday's press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages, the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to momentarily and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business. In addition to Alan we also have the 4 leaders of our operating areas present with us. Frank Billings leads our northeastern G&P operating area; Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area; Rory Miller leads Atlantic Gulf; and John Dearborn is here from our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to any questions.","In yesterday's presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Good morning. Thanks, John. We are excited to talk to you about our second quarter, as well as the continued progress on executing our strategy. We remain very confident that our strategy is well positioned to benefit over the long haul as we continue to see this market emerge and tremendous demand for infrastructure to take advantage of the low cost natural gas and natural resources continue to be developed in North America.","Just to level set before we get into the presentation. I want to run down a few key points that are key to our strategy and this is starting here on Slide 4. First of all, this -- the strategy really does frame our growth investments, our dividend and distribution growth strategy as we continue to use that as direction for how we manage the business. So we remain very disciplined around the strategy and it really is a very strong compass for us in the decisions we make. So it's important for you to understand it.","First of all, in the competitive advantage. Competitive advantage is created by large scale and the resulting market access and low-cost that we offer to our customers continue to be a guiding light for us. You won't find us making investments without those characteristics in our sites. Our Transco system and our West operating areas are great examples of what that looks like to us. And if you look at the Northeast, the moves we're continuing to make in this area really are all focused on getting to that scale of #1 or #2 position in that area. And certainly, we are convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt that over the long haul, this creates great opportunity and value for both our customers and our investors.","On looking to the growth side, I'm not sure it's possible really at this point to overemphasize the growth opportunities that we have available to us right now. Our Williams Partners Transco system is another great example as it relates to the growth opportunities that are in front of us. This is the nation's premier natural gas pipeline system. It's connected to the right supply and certainly the right market areas and the growth opportunities that continue to come at us day after day on this -- continue to build our confidence about the growth, not just in the supply side as we've seen around natural gas, but a strong movement towards the demand side. And as we expect, the overall market continue to expand.","The position we're in there is very enviable and we really are in a position to select not just any growth opportunity, but the very best growth opportunities available in the industry right now. Simply put, you'll see us focusing on the top layer of cream in this opportunity set and with Transco is in other areas, we're realizing our strategy and we are ensuring these benefits translate into value for our investors.","On the high dividend growth side. This is central to our value creation strategy. We've taken steps to ensure that even during a period of high investment in all these great growth opportunities that we are rewarding investors right now. We are building in the components to see this strategy run full-out as we bring on significant growth investments, many of which come online in 2015 and just beyond our current guidance period. We are investing to connect the best supply areas with the best markets, but we're also investing in ways that focus on fee-based that is largely resilient to commodity market fluctuation businesses. This is the foundation of our strategy to reward our investors with growing cash dividends and distributions, and we believe those characteristics also will produce high-value growth. It certainly, from our vantage point, is the best opportunity we have to deliver great shareholder value both now and in the future.","So let's get into the meat of the presentation today. Following a few comments from me as I go through these slides, I, along with the management team that John introduced earlier, look forward to hearing from you.","Moving on to Slide 5 here, which covers the key headline for today's earnings and guidance discussion. The big stories here.","First, the growth in our fee-based business at Williams Partners was a major driver in our second quarter results. Keep in mind that strong performance was up against even less favorable NGL margins in this quarter and the unexpected impact of our Geismar olefins plant, which was down for about 20% of the period, and obviously, related to the tragic incident that we experienced there in June.","Second, we are, again, reaffirming our strong growth guidance for our cash dividends and distributions. We continue to expect 20% per year growth in Williams' cash dividend in each of the 3 years in our guidance period. And for Williams Partners, we continue to expect strong cash distribution growth of about 9% here for 2013 and about 7% annually in each '14 and '15.","Third, we are updating our earnings and DCF guidance with the modest changes to reflect lower NGL margins and our assumptions related to Geismar, including the projected restart date in insurance proceeds. So we'll spend a little more time on that here in a moment. And I want to call out how things are developing from an investor perspective with our olefins business at Geismar.","That's where, as you know, we experienced an explosion on June 13. For all of us at Williams, it was significant, both personally and professionally, and also from an operation standpoint. During my tenure at the company, we haven't had to endure -- experience anything like that. And I can tell you, it was an event that I am very mournful of on the one hand, on the other hand, I've been very impressed at how our professionals across this business have pulled together to respond to it in a way that is keeping with our culture and now getting back and working hard to overcome from the incident.","From a financial perspective, we continue to expect that our insurance policies will significantly mitigate the financial effects of the incident. And we expect to resume operations at Geismar in April and bring -- in April of '14, and bring the expansion into operations immediately thereafter.","We have updated Williams Partners' guidance to reflect our current assumption about the financial impact of the Geismar incident. In addition to the Geismar impact, our updated guidance also reflects the expected NGL margin to deteriorate in '14. Even though we did -- we have lowered our NGL margins for '13 and '15 as well. I would tell you that we were -- we've been able to overcome that with other positives. So really the only area that we're lowering guidance on is related to NGL margins is a little bit of modest reduction for '14.","Fourth, we expect Williams Partners DCF to increase by 66% between '13 and '15 as our large inventory of projects and most of these, as you know, are fee-based, continue to come online. And what's notable here, as well is that we expect the impressive growth to come even as we see continued pressure on the NGL markets that I spoke to earlier.","Finally, we'll quickly touch on the few of the recent operational developments that support our broader strategy. One that's particularly noteworthy is the progress that we're making on the Bluegrass Pipeline project that is now included in our guidance.","Before we move to the next slide, I want to make sure that we're clear about Williams' support for Williams Partners distribution during this period of high investment in the extraordinary growth opportunities that we continue to seize. As you'll recall in May, Williams announced we would support WPZ's cash distribution coverage ratio at a level of about 0.9 by waving the $200 million in incentive distribution rights. Today, that $200 million is unused, untapped because Williams Partners' strong second quarter performance yielded a year-to-date coverage of 0.92. So great news there that due to the strong DCF at Williams Partners in the second quarter, we remain without having to use that IDR waiver. So we're very excited about that.","Let's move on to Slide 6 here. The major story here is that we're seeing the tangible benefits of our growing fee-based businesses and what it meant in the second quarter is that we delivered solid results even in an environment of weaker NGL margins and the significant impact of the downtime at Geismar.","At Williams, we had our second quarter adjusted segment profit plus DD&A was up 7% compared with the year-ago. And for Williams Partners, our second quarter distributable cash flow was almost 1\/3 higher than the year-ago levels. The primary driver of the DCF increase at PZ of course, was the strong contribution that Geismar made to the quarter prior to the June 13 incident. And of course, as you recall, that asset was dropped down in the fourth quarter of '12. And, as you know, it is producing tremendous distributable cash flow.","Also -- substantially secured as we've mentioned to you and we'll provide a little bit more detail. We know there's been quite a bit of confusion on the insurance coverage in this package that we sent out, we hope it helps to clarify that. But we're glad to say that our business interruption insurance is helping secure a significant portion of that expected DCF.","Getting this asset back in service with safe and reliable operations and expanded volumes is clearly one of our top priorities for the company right now. And we've got a great team of professionals that have got their hearts and minds into making that happen and are making great progress on that.","For WPZ, we are pleased to report that our fee-based revenue grew 9% over the second quarter of 2012. During the second quarter, we saw our Western volumes recover from the earlier winter conditions of the first quarter. And we also benefited from the continued volume growth in the Northeast, as well as the startup of some of our new facilities. Another driver of our improved DCF versus the prior year was lower maintenance CapEx and this is primarily driven by reductions in our Western segment as various projects wrapped up in 2012.","Additionally, we saw another significant drop in NGL margins of 13% from the prior quarter, so from the first quarter, which were already pretty low compared with what we've seen in recent years. And in fact, the NGL margin for the second quarter were down a full 44% from the prior year. So I think this is very significant that even despite these continued declines in NGL margins, you're seeing our business start to ramp out of being affected by that and really start to grow from the strong impact of the growth in our fee-based volumes. So our strategy is really starting to take hold in terms of those investments, and we think this is really kind of a turning point this quarter as we start to overcome those declines with the growth in that business.","We continue to be very excited as well about our Access Midstream Partners investment as they reported a strong second quarter with their adjusted EBITDA increasing about 71% over the prior year second quarter. And for our second quarter equity earnings, we recorded $18 million in our adjusted segment profit plus DD&A column.","In Williams NGL & Petchem Services business, we saw higher volumes lead strong growth, up nearly 50% in adjusted segment profit plus DD&A versus the prior year.","So with that good news, let's move on to Slide 7 and review the Williams Partners guidance. So now, we're looking forward here a bit. In addition to the strong second quarter, we remain very optimistic about our business for the balance of the year, despite the fact that we're lowering the margins on the heavies a little bit because we just haven't been able to see that increase that we've been hoping to see in the propanes and butanes and so we did lower that a little bit. But the fact that our fee-based business has been growing and we've been able to do such a good job around managing our cost, is allowing us to hold guidance. On that basis, what really is impacting guidance here in '13 was the impact of the Geismar incident.","So the big story here is we continue to expect tremendous growth in the PZ distributable cash flow. And in fact, we're expecting DCF to grow by 66%, increasing over $1 billion in just this 2-year period from end of '13 to end of '15. This growth is driven by WPZ's end guidance CapEx, which is averaging about $3 billion per year right now. And our latest guidance for WPZ's DCF includes modest reductions for this year and next year.","For 2013, the effect of the Geismar incident is the key driver. And if not for that, we would have seen, hopefully, actually a raised guidance because we've been able to reduce costs and continue to grow our volumes at a pace that is even better than we were hoping for.","For 2014, our expectation of NGL frac spreads is remaining very low. And due primarily to the lower assumed values for the heavy part of the barrels I mentioned earlier, and this really is the key driver in the change here for 2014. There are a number of other moving parts in there. But including in some of our projects and first flow dates on some of these projects that are backing up. But for the most part, we're -- again, we were able to offset that through other improvements, so it really is just boiling down to the NGL margin reduction there and we think we moved this down to a fairly conservative level.","I know there's a lot of interest now we're thinking about the Geismar effect in our financial forecast. We have a slide in the appendix of this presentation that shows what we've included for business interruption insurance and how it is recorded in our financials for both the GAAP and the non-GAAP measures. Our 2015 distributable cash flow guidance continues to be strong. And importantly, does not incorporate any support via IDR waivers from Williams and with more than 3\/4 of our gross margin coming from fee-based business by 2015, we have created a cash flow stream that is more resilient to changes in commodity prices and our 2015 forecast it does, and include an expectation of lower commodity margins, yet we were able to hold it where it was again due to improvements on some other piece of our business.","I do want to make 1 point on guidance within the segments of Williams Partners. You'll note that the Northeast gathering and processing segment profit guidance is lower throughout the guidance period. It's important to understand that this change is really driven as a result of a reallocation of support costs among our WPZ segments. It's not an actual increase in WPZ's overall cost structure, again just an allocation amongst the various regions. So bottom line, our guidance now more actively reflects support cost that are being increasingly allocated to support the tremendous growth that we're experiencing in the Northeast and this accounted for about $30 million of lower segment profit for '14 and '15 and a little less than that for '13.","So that's a good overview of our guidance changes for WPZ, which, of course, is a major driver for WMD's earnings and cash flows.","So let's move on to Slide 8 to review Williams and Williams Partners CapEx and investment guidance. First, just focusing on WPZ's capital, I point out that we did have a number of movements among the 3 guidance years. But in the aggregate, CapEx is consistent with our prior guidance. And of course, we have lots of additional information about CapEx guidance at the project and reportable segment levels in our data book, which you can find on our website. Outside of WPZ, we have a couple of major developments to discuss.","First, and most significantly, our current guidance now takes into account the Bluegrass Pipeline project. Our board recently approved the project and we continue to be encouraged by the support we are seeing from the shippers who recognize tremendous value that Bluegrass has to offer these very large-scale, rich gas drilling programs, and I can tell you that the producer community out there sees this as a great resource. But frankly, they really are dependent and really extremely interested in making sure that these kind of large-scale solutions for clearing these products in advantaged markets are going to be in service. And so I would just tell you, we've been thrilled with the response and the interest in the capacity that we have available for this project. And frankly, I suspect that we'll look back in the not-too-distant future and wish that we had more capacity to have available for the area.","We are basing our expected investment on a 50% ownership of the pipeline and related frac-ing storage facilities. And we also included a few notes on how we think about the financing of the project. We've updated our current guidance to reflect ongoing changes to our Canadian PDH project as well. We have increased our estimated cost of this project as we've seen similar projects in our sector experiencing some overruns and so we've always got our ear to the ground and really trying to gain intelligence on what's going on in the space and we've certainly noted that some overruns exist out there. And so we're now looking at pushing the in-service date into 2017, primarily to allow for the codevelopment of the derivative plants that would be designed to take advantage of geographically advantaged propylene supply. We're in the process of negotiating offtake agreements that will dramatically reduce our commodity exposure on the projects and I'll just tell you, the interest that we've seen has been tremendous, and we're very excited about this project and our ability to really convert this into more of a fee-based kind of opportunity for us and at a very minimum, really reducing our commodity exposure on the project. So still extremely excited about the project and frankly, one of the advantages we're trying to make sure we capture is to make sure that we get full advantage for the geographic advantage that producing propylene and propylene derivatives in this area has to offer.","Let's move on to Slide 9. As we review the second quarter and the first month of the third quarter, it's rewarding to see how we are executing on our business objectives, bringing new projects into service, setting volume records and adding new growth projects. These achievements all serve to support our strategy of developing and operating large-scale energy infrastructure that is connecting the very best producing areas to the very best markets. And as I mentioned, the growing demand that we're seeing in really all areas that are really positioning themselves to take advantage of these great low-cost products that we have here in the U.S.","As previously mentioned, our Bluegrass Pipeline project and the related frac-ing storage facilities are a major development. We executed a joint venture agreement with Boardwalk Pipeline Partners to continue developing this project and we've designed Bluegrass to transport natural gas liquids from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays to the rapidly expanding petrochemical and export complexes on the U.S. Gulf Coast. And, as well as the developing petchem market in the Northeast U.S. Williams board approved the project in June and we are now actively engaged in the development work, which includes surveying, environmental studies and permitting activities that are required to really keep this project on schedule.","I can tell you from the shipper's perspective, maintaining that schedule is very important and a lot of people really have their eyes on that. We do have an aggressive schedule out there. And as a result, we've got to move quickly on the permitting and environmental stage. Of course the beauty of this project, one of them is the ability to use the Texas gas line, which greatly reduces the exposure we have to permitting activities along the large portion of the route.","In our Atlantic Gulf business, we made significant progress on various fronts during the last 3 months. As I mentioned earlier, tremendous amount of growth going on, on Transco, but as well in the deepwater. We're pleased to have reached an agreement in principle, settling all issues in our Transco rate case during the second quarter and the agreement is in line with the new rates that we started booking the first quarter of this year. And as you would expect, the new rates are reflected in the current and the most recent guidance that we've provided in May. So in other words, steady as she goes on that front. Team did a great job of getting that settled quickly and in line with our expectations. So we're very excited to have that behind us and have that piece of our execution strategy checked off.","In the deepwater gulf, we executed another tie-back agreement for our Devils Tower prospect. And we believe there's strong potential for another tie-back agreement as well in the area. These tiebacks are very powerful because of the very limited amount of capital required to bring these tiebacks on. And as you know, they produce a very meaningful amount of free cash flow. And certainly, this latest tie-back that we've reached agreement on is no exception.","New projects coming into service are key drivers in the strong performance in our Atlantic Gulf operating area. On our Transco system, those expansions largely are in support of growing power generation load. We recently placed our Mid-South Expansion into service, this added about 130,000 dekatherms per day of fully contracted, long-term capacity connecting Transco Station 85 to serve power generators in the North Carolina and Alabama markets, as well as a local distribution company in Georgia.","Just a note on that to remind you, last fall, we placed the first phase of this, which is about 95,000 dekatherms per day into service in -- same time last year. So we just keep clicking off these base hits. They continue to grow the firm revenues and firm service on Transco.","Another important note for this period, I'm sure there's -- be a lot of questions around this. Because of our -- the Transco's positioning in the southeastern United States, we really are uniquely positioned to help meet the growing demand in Florida. As a result, we work with the Spectra to develop a winning solution to serve this large-scale growth opportunity as the FPL went out for an RFP for service in the area as you're all very well aware of. So as a result of that, Transco will be expanding its system from Station 85 up to an interconnecting point with Sabal trail and the near our Station 105 and the Sabal trail partners will then lease this capacity from Transco's on a long-term and cost-of-service basis. And in addition, Williams Partners has an option to acquire a meaningful, but a minority interest in the Sabal trails project. The option gives us a chance to better understand -- because of the timing of the auction, it gives us a chance to better understand the construction risk and the volume risk that ultimately will be associated with this bold project.","We also took an important step on pace with our schedule for the Constitution Pipeline. In June, we filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to seek approval and build and operate this 124-mile pipeline that by 2015, will connect Marcellus gas production around our Susquehanna Supply Hub in Northeast Pennsylvania with key Northeast markets. And of course, these markets are continuing to grow mostly from power generation as well, and of course from the benefits of low cost natural gas. And that does interconnect into the Iroquois and Tennessee Gas Pipeline in upstate New York. The Constitution design supports transportation of about 650,000 dekatherms of natural gas per day. In the Northeast gathering and processing business, we're seeing important progress in putting the infrastructure in place to meet the demand of growth from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays and we're continuing to steadily increase gathering volumes in the Northeast. Keep in mind that we have exposure to this terrific growth through both assets that we operate and those investments for us that are operated by ACMP and our Blue Racer joint venture with Caiman and Dominion.","Now on our operated assets, we set record monthly average volumes for June. And where we eclipse more than 1.8 Bcf per day of gas, not bad considering where we started just a few years ago there. And for the quarter, we gathered 76% more gas on our operated assets in the Northeast than we did in the second quarter of last year. So tremendous growth pace that we're on there. And I think, you'll continue to see tremendous record set there. And in fact, here in July, our team in the Northeast there topped their June record by gathering over 2 Bcf a day on our operated assets in the area.","So our team just keeps expanding that. And so we're very excited to see the kind of volume growth we've got there. And also on the Susquehanna Supply Hub expansions, we're working very hard to keep pace with Cabot's rapid growth up there, team is doing a great job of working with Cabot and they are a formidable group to try to keep up with, with their very successful drilling program. And we are as excited as anyone to see them add their 6th rig coming up here in August.","So a lot going on up there and great example of how infrastructure and drilling programs need to be coordinated well together. In our Ohio Valley Midstream franchise, we added another train there, so this will be the third train to our Fort Beeler facility. So continuing to execute on the buildout of our infrastructure there. And as planned, we placed into service 3 condensate pump stations in the second quarter to maximize liquids to Moundsville and to make sure that we're getting the liquids, the vast amount of liquids to continue to grow rapidly in that field. And so as Frank Billings laid out for you at our Analyst Call, he laid out several milestones that we need to execute on and we are clipping those off on schedule.","On Slide 10, we'll review the array of growth CapEx spending and the timeline when to expect these projects to begin generating revenue. So if you look here at the large CapEx platform we're managing on the slide, you can see all of our major projects that will be coming online here extending into 2017 with our Canadian PDH project.","Fundamentally, this is the same way we presented our CapEx by project outlook at our Analyst Day in May and in addition to marking a couple of projects that are now complete, including the Fort Beeler TXP III project. The most significant updates relate to the inclusion of the Bluegrass Pipeline project in the Canadian PDH project as we've just discussed. A few things to point out on this as well. First, the investment WMB made in ACMP is above and beyond what you see listed here, and we expect all of their strong growth prospects will be self-funded.","Second, with the exception of the WPZ Geismar expansion and the WNB Canadian projects, all the remaining projects are backed by fee-based revenues. And finally, I would just highlight that this page concisely summarizes what we must execute on in order to achieve sustainable growth in cash dividend and cash distributions. These are projects that are well-known and well understood. Many are well into the construction phase. Our growth is highly dependent on our ability to execute on this vast array of value creating projects and not so much directly on NGL margins has been in the past. It also is obvious from looking at the slide that it will be 2015 before we begin realizing the full value potential of most of these investments and thus that 66% growth we see in DCF occurring in 2015 from our 2013 expected results.","So moving here to the close. Before we move to the Q&A session, I'll just provide a few closing comments here.","First of all, our fee-based business continues to grow and the second quarter results are a strong indication of the success of that strategy and our fast-growing resilience to commodity market fluctuations. In fact, when you think about it, in a quarter where were lost our single-largest commodity margin generator in the name of the Geismar plant for 20% of the period, we still had a very good quarter. We continue to make significant investments in areas where we can realize large-scale and lower cost of operations. And we are absolutely committed to focusing on areas where we can achieve our #1 or #2 position, not because we want that for bragging rights, but because we think that puts us in the position to have sustainable, long-term dividend growth of the kind you've come to expect from us.","We've seen that in our Transco system and the west operating area and we're making similar investments in the Northeast to drive this additional growth, not just through this guidance period, but well beyond this guidance period. Williams is working to connect the very best supplier areas with the very best market areas and we've assembled a very strong management team in our operating areas and in our E&C areas and so we're very committed to helping deliver this growth and profitability that we know is -- that we can achieve as we execute against this strategy. The strategy is providing us with so many great investment opportunities that we are in the envious position of picking the very best risk-adjusted return projects that the market has to offer, and we think over the long haul, of course, that is going to provide superior shareholder returns over and above our peers, both in the near-term, but especially over the long haul and we certainly look forward to sharing our success with our investors as we move forward.","Thank you for your interest in our company and we'll be happy to take questions now.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Stephen Maresca with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Alan, I want to talk first on Bluegrass. You seem pretty confident in the project obviously, it's now in guidance. What's your view on what sort of commitments you expect to move forward on it? What are the next steps we should hear about in terms of permitting? You mentioned getting commercial agreements later this year and then finally on that, do you expect this own -- just 50% of this or more or less as the project plays out?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, it's kind of hard to speculate on the ownership interest towards that. It's going to be up to Boardwalk and their decisions there. But I think as things stand we're so confident in the market demand right now on the asset that I would expect that they would carry through with their plans just because I think the returns are going to be very attractive relative to other options in the market. I would say from a volume commitment standpoint, remember that we have a number of opportunities that came to us through the Caiman acquisition in terms of the liquids there, at that facility, as well as we have the dedication that we receive from Chesapeake and we also have other parties that -- where we had the processing rights on various gas streams out there as well that give us pretty nice base, frankly, volumes to build off of and while we wouldn't be going forward on the project if we thought we could only get to that 200,000 barrels a day or so of production, I would just tell you that we're seeing very strong interest from some of the larger players out there that really recognize how much value this is going to mean to the acreage out there and perhaps even see it as a strategic advantage in terms of being able to acquire acreage in the area. So I would just tell you, the excitement has been pretty, pretty big on this from the customer base. These are very long term commitments that we're looking for and of course, those take some time to gain corporate approval on. But I would just tell you that I'm not sure we could be asking for any better response than we've received today from the shipper community.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And do you -- just a final on that in terms of the ownership. Is it something where you have an option to increase if you want, or is it again something where you both have to agree to change that ownership percent?","Alan S. Armstrong","I'm going to have Jim Scheel who's been right in the thick of that answer the point.","James E. Scheel","Williams and Boardwalk negotiated an agreement where they have an option to be a 50% partner. However, if they choose not exercise that right, Williams has the option to go ahead with the pipeline unilaterally.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful, appreciate that. And then moving, Alan, you talked about the opportunities at the Florida market for Transco has on the expansion side, but also you mentioned about potential ownership of Sabal. Would that be something again at your option you could purchase? Would it be from Spectra or would it be from the next terra portion of it or any sort of color on that?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, sure. It would be from the project as a whole from the Sabal trail project as a whole is what our option would be on. And again, just to make it clear, we will be supplying basically the volumes in a phased approach on the front end of that project via Transco. So we're basically the supply source by expanding to a point that reduce the amount of construction -- the greenfield construction, required for Sabal trail. So we're kind of the front end of that. And Sabal trail is going to lease that capacity with a return that's consistent with our cost of service returns. So eliminates our construction and volume risk on that. And so we have that as investment, which we found very attractive. And in addition to that, when have an option down the road to invest in Sabal trails and of course, we really like that because it gives us a chance to see how the construction costs look like when they come out and the volumes will have a much better picture on what the volume commitments look like at that point.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Can you say a what percent you could potentially own of it?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. I would just say it's meaningful. But it is a minority position.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Final one for me. You mentioned as -- I was going to ask you about the reduction in Northeast G&P at Williams WPZ in terms of the segment profit and DD&A. I think you mentioned that was -- so this is just higher cost that's what brought that down the $55 million in 2014 and $30 million in 2015? I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding it.","Alan S. Armstrong","It's primarily just an allocation. We have things like our engineering construction costs, our technical support for operations, accounting, all those things that we allocate as a corporation out against our various operating areas and because we've got so much growth in the area and we're applying so many resources it, we studied our cost across those areas and applied those more appropriately to the real expenses. So it's not really a shift in our overall cost against the company. That's just a reallocation of overhead cost to that area.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. So not a new cost or a higher cost, just taking it from where it was accounted or allocated before and putting it into this segment.","Alan S. Armstrong","That's exactly right.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","CapEx looks like it went up by $2.7 billion across 2013 to '15. Assuming some sort of increase over the $1 billion cost number that I think you originally gave us for the PDH facility, is the remaining mostly tied to Bluegrass or are there other large ticket items in there that were either included or taken out, of out of the 3-year guidance.","Donald R. Chappel","Christine, it's Don Chappel, it's mostly entirely Bluegrass. There's some other moves as you mentioned, but it's largely Bluegrass.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then would you be able to give us, I guess, some sort of idea on what the cost increase is looking like for the PDH facility, is it materially over or like 20%?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. I would just say, again, we kind of came at that with an initial estimate that was very rough and the return was so attractive on it that we decided to proceed because even at an overrun, that would have been -- or an increase in our estimate, that would have been much higher which still would make sense. And I would just say, that cost did not go outside of that range. It was higher than what we early had in our guidance. But more importantly I think, the point to be captured there is that as we look at the project, we realized one of the fundamental benefits and what I would call industrial logic that underpins the project is the fact that we have got the ability to transport propylene derivatives rather than propylene itself into markets that are much closer than transporting the propylene all the way to the Gulf Coast and then turn around and transporting the propylene derivatives back to the Midwest markets and to the -- particularly in the Northern Midwest markets. And so by getting the propylene derivative business built there, we're getting -- we are positioning ourselves to be able to capture some of that transport and logistics advantage. And so we want to build that complex in concert with those derivative plant and there may be some optimization opportunity between the propylene plant and the derivative plant. Now having said that, don't hear us say that we're going into the propylene derivative business because that's not at all what we're doing here. And in fact we're going to do this in a way that's going to reduce our commodity exposure to propylene. But it does allow us to optimize the construction of the facilities. And again, to enjoy some of the benefits of the logistics through the pricing structure.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I see. So net-net, would you say that your returns overall look better than when you originally looked at it? Or do they kind of just off -- does everything just offset each other?","Alan S. Armstrong","I would say that our returns -- I would say our returns will be lower than what we originally thought. But I would also tell you that they're going to be a lot lower risk because you are converted to more fee-based business.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then in your presentation slide, when you talk about equity funding for Bluegrass, you say WPZ investment and then you wrote WMB and\/or third parties. Can you just clarify, when you say third parties, do you mean that you're willing to sell a portion of your interest in the Bluegrass project or sell your interest in some of your other assets like we've seen you do with Constitution, I don't know, maybe with some of your assets in Canada, et cetera to raise the cash?","Donald R. Chappel","Christine, this is Don Chappel. I'd just say we have a lot of options. WPZ is our preferred funding source. So to the extent that we need equity, our preference would be for WPZ to fund that versus Williams. But there are a number of other sources we expect that other parties will have interest in equity in Bluegrass. We may not choose to give any of it up, but it's really -- what you see there on the slide is just an expression of we've got quite a few options. And in the near term to the balance of this year and into next year, at least, early next year, we'll be funding this with excess cash at Williams, and beyond that, we'll have some choices to make. But for the next couple of quarters, 2 or 3 quarters, it's really funding with excess cash flow at Williams.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then lastly, for me. In the Northeast, it looked like OBM volumes were slightly revised down in '14 and '15 while Susquehanna was raised. Can you verify that's the case and can you also provide a number for what volumes are today at OBM?","Francis E. Billings","Sure, this is Frank Billings. I would say that we did revise the volumes down a little bit. The majority of that is, as we actually have derisked a little bit it to the OBM volume forecast because we had a customer identified in our forecast and we've actually executed an agreement to have them become a true customer versus a forecasted customer. And with that, we've got a revised drilling program -- drilling schedule from them and we basically included that in our forecast, as well as one of our existing customers revised slightly their drilling program for '13 and '14. So that's the main driver for the volume adjustments, I would say, in OBM.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then can you provide a number for what volumes are today at Williams?","Francis E. Billings","Yes. Right now we're moving around $200 million today, kind of we're moving around $250 million to $260 million, but we do have some volumes that are not moving. We've hit a peak volume in excess of $300 million a day in OBM. And right now, what is happening is we have a couple of customers, one is drilling and frac-ing a new well, so they've shut in some production around that well frac so that they don't -- or for whatever reason, I guess they want to protect or manage that activity. And then we have another customer that is having some permitting issues on one of their well pad, so they had to shut in production as well. But I can tell you that we're also -- we have multiple producers out there that are in the process of completing some wells and I think -- we see the activity that we expected to see from the producers in OBM this summer as they're trying to get some work done before the fall and winter season hits. So I think we're on the right trajectory and I just think what we have is -- when we lose 30% of our volume or 10% of our volume, $30 million a day for producer activity, it shows up at this point. But I can tell you that in OBM today, we are operating well mechanically. All of our mechanical and operational issues are few at this time. And I think, we're in a good position to move the volume that's behind the system today. And when we complete the work for -- that we had talked about in the second -- the first quarter call around the CR -- or the facilities that we're going to get in place, I think we're going to be in great shape for the rest of the year.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Bradley Olsen with Tudor Pickering.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","My first question is on Transco and some of the opportunities you're seeing around that asset. We've seen Leidy pricing and just pricing around the dry gas pricing area, the Marcellus come under a lot of pressure. Is that adding to kind of inbound producer demand and maybe even some inbound demand side or utility demand for capacity on projects to get out of the Northern PA and Northern New Jersey markets like Leidy Southeast and Constitution?","Rory Lee Miller","Bradley, this is Rory Miller. Good question. In fact, when we closed out our Leidy Southeast project, we had very robust demand. But we've had a number of producers that have called back saying if they could get in to see if it was not too late to open the door and get on the project. So I think we've got over 8 BCF a day of pipeline, interconnects and capacity connected to bring gas into Leidy. And as those new connections see additional wells drilled behind our system and behind those interconnects, people are finding they need to get a way out. So we think there's an excellent chance for additional expansion up there, somewhere down the road. But very much a supply push situation. We've talked a lot about the quality of the Cabot reserves, the quality of their wells up there. But we're seeing that sweet spot extend west of there as well. So even though it's a dry gas area, the EURs on those wells are so robust that the economics of the current gas prices are very compelling. So we see a big supply push coming out of that area and we're looking at number of opportunities to help satisfy that demand from producers. Likewise, we talked a lot at Analyst Day about all the power generation opportunities up and down the system. We continue to see those opportunities roll in the door. So there's a fantastic opportunity for us to match up demand pull with the supply push, and we think that's going to keep new projects coming for years into the future.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","But no plans today on the table to expand either the Leidy Southeast or the Constitution project?","Rory Lee Miller","Right now, we're probably focused on the Leidy opportunity and I would just say, we're early on in that, but something could be coming out here in the near future.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And on the Bluegrass project. As you look at the pipeline fractionation storage, integrated nature of that project, is the 2.7, give or take, that you discussed as being largely Bluegrass related in your CapEx budgeting, does that include an export facility? And do you think that you would need to enter into a JV or some kind of economic sharing agreement with someone who has an existing export facility or existing acreage on the Gulf Coast in order to get that done?","James E. Scheel","Bradley, this is Jim Scheel. We have not included in the guidance number the export facility. We're still defining that at this point. We have seen a great amount of interest from our customers for that, they do view the international markets as the logical destination for many of the propanes and butanes. We have identified the site and we're moving forward to acquire that. As it relates to the cost of that, we're still defining it. We'll include that in future guidance.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just a follow-up on some of the PDH questions from earlier. The PDH, as well as the ethane recovery costs appear to have increased since the Analyst Day. Is that, in the case of the PDH something related to kind of overall labor and cost trends in Western Canada? Or are those 2 separate issues? And on PDH, Alan, you mentioned that you would kind of rule out entering the propylene derivative business. Is there any reason, specifically, that you ruled out providing your own polypropylene facility just to expedite that process?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, I'll take the last half of that and then I'll ask Fred Pace, who runs our engineering construction, to answer your question on the fundamentals in the construction cost in Alberta. On the derivatives side, I would just say that as you move further and further downstream, that starts to become more and more knowledge that is outside the base of our operations today. And I would just say, we have so many opportunities that are right down our fairway of knowledge that it doesn't really entice us to move outside of the area that we have strong knowledge in. And so we're excited to partner with others that have both the marketing expertise and the operations expertise that can help bring the value to that. So said another way, we're not really all that motivated to learn some new lessons when have such great opportunities in front of us right now. And so that's really driving that decision. And I'll ask Fred to answer the questions around the cost pressures in Alberta.","Fred Pace","Yes, on the PDH cost outlook kind of playing on Alan's earlier comment about our observance of other projects, having cost pressures, we've analyzed that. And did a much better job of also analyzing all of our other risks around availability of labor and contract personnel and materials, our entire supply chain around that. So that's just our best current thinking and guidance around our current risk analysis to come up with our current outlook.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And just one more and I'll get out of your hair. The Atlantic Gulf segment, you reduced kind of 2013 and 2014 guidance fairly significantly after the first quarter call. Now you've kind of printed 2 strong quarters in a row in the Atlantic Gulf segment, really the kind of Transco-related seasonality really wasn't visible on those results. And so you've kind of printed $300 million of segment profit in the first half of the year and you've kind of guided towards a full year segment profit in the low $500 million range. Is that -- is it correct to imply a decline in the second half of the year? Or is that just a segment that has, I guess, outperformed since the first quarter reporting?","Rory Lee Miller","This is Rory Miller again. I think the guidance that we included in the book showed us outperforming guidance, maybe $30 million on a full year basis. And I -- so I think we're going to be able to hold on to some of that, about 2\/3 of that revision is attributable to lower O&M and G&A and we've been working hard I think as Alan mentioned earlier to control expenses. And I think a lot of that is -- will be sustainable improvements. We also had some other minor issues that are helping out. We did have an increase on our liquid transportation rates on Transco for condensate and retrograde. That combined with a little higher DD&A and then a reimbursement for some engineering cost from Gulfstream accounted for about 1\/3 of that $30 million. So that's a lot of detail. But a number of those are sustainable type items. Of course, the engineering reimbursement would be a one-time event.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","A couple of quick questions. Does the business interruption insurance in the 2014, say, for the first quarter cover the delayed startup of the expansion on Geismar?","Donald R. Chappel","Craig, this is Don. I think answer is yes. Basically the policy covers our losses. So it's a comparison of what we would have made had the event not occurred to what we did or didn't make as a result of the loss. And obviously, we have a responsibility to minimize the loss and we would do that with or without insurance. So we're interested in getting the facility back up and running safely as quickly as possible, including the expansion. But the repairs are really the critical path item and the expansion will be complete along with the recovery and the turnaround. And we expect that to be covered.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And Don, while I have you on the line, there was little uptick at least, for the quarter in the tax rate, but I don't think the full year has changed in terms of guidance. Can you give us some color around that?","Donald R. Chappel","I think the full year is down a little bit because of some additional bonus depreciation we were able to identify. And then just a function of continuing to refine the numbers, I think, the quarterly numbers are -- tend to move around a little bit, depending on the profitability and where that profitability is.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And then finally, I wonder if you all could just give a little more color because I think there were some prepared comments regarding it and then also just recently some comments about attacking L&M and G&A that's helping the Atlantic Gulf segment. But could you all discuss in a little more detail the success you seem to be having with cost containment, especially in 2013 to offset some of the headwinds we're seeing?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well I would just say, we've all made a concerted effort on that front. As you know, we went through some very significant organizational restructure post the spin-off of WPX and I would just say that we are positioned and we reorganized ourselves in a way that we can really focus and bring some transparency to our cost structures and understand the areas of opportunity we have to put pressure on that and the team is doing a great job of doing that. So I would just say it's kind of the old-fashioned way. The good news I would tell you is I think it's very sustainable. And I think we have opportunities to continue to improve even more so as we kind of explore new opportunities in a much more integrated company. And so for instance, we're seeing areas of opportunity between gas pipes and midstream where previously, we operated as separate -- completely separate business units and now, we're seeing opportunities to save money because we're operating in a much more integrated fashion than we have previously. So more to come on that, but the team is doing a terrific job and very proud of the focus they've put on that.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Three, perhaps, cleanup questions. The first actually on -- just with respect to the insurance of Geismar. Obviously, you laid out the expectations and I guess with potentially only a 60-day lag that kind of implies a pretty smooth process. Has there been any contention or friction from the insurers at this point that would give you pause at all or is this -- do you expect to be a pretty smooth process?","Alan S. Armstrong","Carl, its too early to tell. We've not yet filed our first claim. But this is something where we'll be able to: one, we can present our forecast. The forecast we had before the incident and that was prepared without any knowledge of the incident coming, so I think that's pure. There's no bias in that forecast. We can present that to the insurers now. We would have our first insurer loss in the month of August. That would have been after the 60-day waiting period, but before the planned turnaround. So there's a small period that's insured. Just a couple of weeks of operation between that 60-day waiting period and when the turnaround would have happened. So we'll be able to submit that at the end of August, early September, and get response from the insurers on that payment, and that really set the stage for the balance and then we'd be in 50-day turnaround and so then in October, we would have a partial month again where we would have another partial month claim. We'd submit that claim at the end of October and then we'd submit a claim update every month. So we think that the 60-day lag is reasonable. It's possible we could get paid earlier or somewhat later. But right now, that's our best estimate.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Appreciate the color on that. The second and not to, perhaps, beat a dead horse on the PDH facility. But just given all the cost inflation that we have seen in Alberta and seem happening in such a quick period of time. When you look out with the major spend on when the PDH would actually happen. Is there any possibility of locking something up turnkey with someone in order to stem any possible future labor inflation?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, again, I think by stretching our schedule out, we give ourselves a lot more opportunity around that. And as you'll recall and I think we mentioned this in our announcement -- original announcement with PDH facility that we were going with a little bit different design than some on the industry had because -- and a little bit smaller, so that we can build that business on a more modular basis. And so that allows us to bid out that modular construction on a fixed fee. And so the remaining portion would be the in the field construction. The good news about this project aside from some of the other projects we've seen a lot of cost pressures is this work is at Redwater, which is near Edmonton. A lot of the areas we really had a lot of struggle with in terms of low productivity and cost pressures has been in the Fort McMurray area where labor is more constrained, particularly skilled labor is more constrained. So I would just say, we're taking -- we're working hard to contract this in a way that really eliminates a lot of that build construction labor risk and productivity risk and stretching the schedule out gives us even more opportunity to do that.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Fair enough. And then last question if I could. Just on Bluegrass and if you could just refresh -- I think, you probably addressed this in prior conversations. But as you look out at sort of this large material investment, are you expecting from -- the feedback you've heard from shippers, are you expecting a return profile in line with other sort of large, almost, call it, FERC allowed type of traditional infrastructure returns? Or is it the uniqueness of the NGL solution would allow something higher more indicative of Midstream infrastructure?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I would say a couple of things allow us with a -- and remember, only a portion of this is regulated. The frac and storage business downstream of that is not regulated, so we have that opportunity, if you will, in terms of better than FERC return and I would just tell you, we have plenty of regulated cost of service returns available to us. And so we wouldn't take any additional risk or development cost like this if we didn't expect higher returns than that. So the answer to your question is, we do expect higher overall returns on the project. And one of the things that helps us achieve that obviously, is the benefit of the Texas Gas line and which provides us with a better solution than the market would otherwise had to offer. And gets us in schedule. Importantly, I can tell you from the shipper's perspective, this timing issue probably can't overstate that in terms of importance because people have all this acreage up there. They're very anxious to go drill, but they're seeing NGL prices continue to collapse up there in a very oversupplied market. Their only option is to transport out by rail and that -- even that is getting pretty congested. So I would just say that the market is very anxious for this solution and the return we're making is -- reaps the benefits of some of the things I mentioned.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just wondering if you could maybe talk about the risk to achieving that April resumption date for you Geismar? Is it really just mainly, I guess, the pace of the repairs? Or does the status of the investigation play a part at all?","John R. Dearborn","A very insightful question. This is a John Dearborn, on the answer to that, if you take a look at it, we've got a few investigations underway, 1 by OSHA, 1 by CSB, and of course, the Williams' own investigation. We're collaborating there in a very open and transparent way with OSHA and CSB. And as a result of that, over time, over the last few weeks, OSHA and CSB have been, I'll say, giving back more and more of that plant so that the effective plant now that's still under the control of OSHA is a very small area around the fractionator itself. And so that's allowing us now to begin to, I won't say demolish, but begin to take apart the impacted part of the plant. So pretty quickly here, we think that the investigation is going to become a less of a risk to our path of rebuild. Then the question becomes, how quickly can we get the equipment and the necessary materials to plant and construct it and that in fact sets our timeline. Though it's not without risk, we feel pretty confident about the April 1 date, that's why we've been out with it.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just another follow-up. In terms of the business interruption insurance, does that, like, cover, I guess, any obligations or contracts with your supply or sales?","Alan S. Armstrong","I'll let John take the question on the sales contracts. I don't think we expect to have any significant losses in that area. But yes, it would cover.","John R. Dearborn","Yes, and again, very insightful because of course, our customers are a very important stakeholder base for us right -- but we're going out to continue to build our relationships with our customers. All of our customers essentially are on force majeure at the moment and will be over time. We want to continue to preserve those relationships, so that they'll be there when the plant comes back up. So all these information is actually fresh for our customers in the coming weeks. We're going to be going out and speaking personally with our important customers out there so that they are with us on the other end of the startup.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And this also applies for any supply sources in terms of ethane?","John R. Dearborn","We really don't have a concern about the ethane. Essentially, the ethane goes back into the market and probably get used and consumed by others so it's not really an issue for us in our business.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to understand the -- kind of picking up off of Sharon's question, sort of the range of outcomes if we're plus or minus the April 1 date on financials relative to kind of where you are with the insurance and the deductible let's say we push another quarter out, what does that do in terms of -- kind of the financial impact?","Donald R. Chappel","Ted, I think as John mentioned, we have a plan to get us started back up in April. If we push that back at some point, we would run out of potentially, or hypothetically, we'd run out of insurance -- business interruption insurance and the coverages combined $500 million for both business interruption and property damage. We have a current estimate on the property damage of $102 million, less a $10 million deductible. So that's $92 million of assumed coverage at this point. And then as you saw, we disclosed an estimate of $384 million on the business interruption coverage. So certainly, significant delays would expose us.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. But at that point then, it's just a matter of sort of the loss -- what's called the loss margin of the downtime from that perspective? And obviously, assuming the repair costs were the same. Is that fair?","Donald R. Chappel","Yes. Again, we have no reason to believe that the downtime will extend past April at this point, but certainly as you think about risk, I think you understand it well.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. Okay. And then just in terms of the distribution growth here at WPZ. It looks like you're still comfortable running a little below 1x in 2014. You've kept the idea wherever is the same. But again, there's some flex here in terms of what happens with Geismar. I was just wondering how we should think about what you'll target for coverage if the IDR waivers get increased from WMB or do we lower distribution growth, say, at WPZ, kind of how those all interplay?","Alan S. Armstrong","Those are, I would say, speculative questions at this point. But clearly, WPZ -- Williams enjoys about 75% of WPZ's distribution, so we have a big stake in it. WPZ is our primary equity funding vehicle and funding vehicle generally. So obviously it's very important to Williams. We did waive the $200 million of IDRs. We did not see any point to step forward further on that at this point. But certainly, we'll consider potential waivers, additional waivers if and when needed. So I would just say, we'll stay tuned here. If we execute as we had put forth in our plan here today, we don't believe any additional waivers are required. We look at 2014 at getting closer to 1x coverage again with a lot of fee-based growth. And by 2015, getting back to that 1x coverage number. So we're comfortable running where we are. And at Williams we'll continue to monitor the situation and see if WPZ needs any additional support and make the decision accordingly.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","My question is with regards to the Western segment, seems like in the west, results were better than we anticipated and going nicely in the first half of the year. I was just curious as far as in 2014, you have a bit of a stepdown there as far as what you're looking for segment profit in DD&A, it was only marginally increased. I'm just wondering, is that a bit of conservatism or what's kind of driving the year-over-year step down in guidance there?","Allison G. Bridges","Well, partly because we do have some contracts that had changed in 2014. So that is some of the reduction.","Jeremy Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then last one for me. I was just curious, with this guidance revision, I think some of the other recent ones, it seems like maintenance CapEx has been ticking down a little bit for 2014, 2015. I was just wondering if you could touch on the drivers for that?","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. One of the things is we had some, as we mentioned earlier, we have some time pressures on getting some of our asset integrity work done towards the end of 2012. We completed a lot of that work as we've laid out in the past so we kind of add an accelerated effort there to complete some of that work. And as well, we're continuing to take advantage where we can of the integrated nature of our business and looking to really invest that maintenance capital in the ways that reduce risk very best for this company overall. And so I would just say, we're continuing to really analyze that. Obviously, the thing we're going to spend our dollars on first is keeping the system safe and reliable and we certainly won't back off on the cost that it takes to do that and we'll continue to do that. But there are other areas that we can find ways to improve cost, purchasing power across a lot of our assets, which we -- when we combine our gas pipes and our midstream efforts, we got a lot of purchasing power. And so we're continuing to find ways to improve on that.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Just some follow-ups. On the PDH facility, if it's going to be in service in 2017 is most of the CapEx going to take place in 2016 with maybe a little bit in '15? I just wanted to know how we should think about the timing of the spending.","Fred Pace","This is Fred Pace responding. That's exactly right, wrapping up in '15, but the majority occurring in '16.","Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then this is just an accounting question. But are you going to be consolidating your 50% interest in GulfStar and your 41% interest in Constitution? I wasn't clear if you guys -- how you guys are accounting for it in your segment profit guidance?","Alan S. Armstrong","John is going to take this one.","John Porter","This is John Porter. Yes, those 2 assets are shown on a consolidated basis with a non-controlling interest presented below segment profit.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong","Okay, great. Well, thank you, all, very much. This is Alan Armstrong again, thank you all for joining us and we remain very excited about the future that we have ahead of us. And our showing of starting to really turn the corner on the fee-based projects really starting to kick in so thanks for joining us.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference.

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Porter","Thank you Rochelle. Good morning and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams and Williams Partners. Yesterday afternoon, we released our financial results and posted several important items on our websites, williams.com and williamslp.com. These items include yesterday\u2019s press releases with related schedules and the accompanying analyst packages, the slide deck that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong, will speak to you momentarily and an update to our data books, which contain detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.","In addition to Alan, we also have the four leaders of our operating areas with us, Jim Scheel leads our Northeastern G&P operating area, Allison Bridges leads our Western operating area, Rory Miller leads our Atlantic Gulf area and John Dearborn leads our NGL & Petchem Services operating area. Additionally, our CFO, Don Chappel is available to respond to any questions.","In yesterday\u2019s presentation and also in our data books, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that we\u2019ve reconciled to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan Armstrong","Great. Good morning John and good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us. Certainly the second quarter was very exciting for Williams as we seized the opportunity to make an important acquisition that moved us closer to fulfilling our vision of being a premier provider of reliable large scale infrastructure that really has become very clear to everybody that this kind of large scale infrastructure is going to be absolutely critical to allow North America to take advantage of its fast natural gas resources. We also rapidly accelerated our earlier stated plans of establishing WMB as a pure-play G&P hold-co and continue to lead the space and dividend growth by very wide margin.","At WPZ, we had another strong quarter with operation performance being in line with our expectations and driving a 30% increase in distributable cash flow at WPZ. We also enjoyed great progress in execution on a number of very important projects in the second quarter, a tremendous amount of work going on in the organization on this front and just to name a few and you really only hear about the very largest projects, but a tremendous amount of efforts going on across the organization, but just to name a few Gulfstar, Keathley Canyon, the condensate stabilizer at Oak Grove and Ohio Valley Midstream area, the new ethane line which is being completed in the OVM area and we also started construction finally on the Rockaway Beach Lateral after a very long and drawn out permitting process.","So for those of you there in the New York you look at see some of that work going on in fact on the front of our slide you see some picture of that. So that\u2019s going to allow us to bring that project in on schedule as well. So a lot of very big projects that we made tremendous progress on and remain on schedule on some of those major projects.","We also saw continued strong demand for our services with two significant new market pull projects on Transco that were fully contracted and I think it\u2019s becoming pretty evident that Transco discontinues to line up these hits and I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s not slowing down in terms of continued business development opportunities just keep coming at us in that business line.","The Marcellus area volumes continued their rapid growth as well with a 31% increase in gathered volumes as compared to last year\u2019s 2Q volumes and we are on track once again to lead the industry on volume growth in the Marcellus this year.","Our Geismar E&C efforts were in line with plan and our rebuild was completed last week. Our final efforts on the expansion will be done by the end of next week. So our E&C team, our engineering and construction team is wrapping up and moving out as we now are turning that important solely over to our operations team.","Unfortunately and certainly this is something we\u2019re all very disappointed around here with, but unfortunately did find a new concern there at Geismar that is going to require enhancement to our safety systems that we expect to cause about a six to eight week delay in the first sale at that point at Geismar.","As I mentioned this is certainly disappointing to us but as difficult as this is, I\u2019ll tell you, I am proud of the fact that our organization will always put a safety of our people first and this is certainly just our organization following those words with action by having the courage to pause and do the right thing in terms of making sure that, that plan is as safe as possible.","So even though this is an out of the norm situation here, I know this is such a big issue, I really would like to take you back to the appendix and if you look back on, I believe it is slide 14 in this deck and we\u2019ll move that on our webcast even though it is out of order here.","You will see that on slide 14, we show the incredible progress that has been made on the expansion and the rebuild and the pre-commissioning efforts which were all but complete and will be complete at the end of next week in terms of getting all of our systems turned over to operations. So what does that mean, it basically means systems like our steam systems, all of our auxiliary systems and we break those down in to about 62 different systems and as those are mechanically complete, we turn them over to our operations team for them to take control of those facilities.","And so we were finalizing some of the release valve study that was required as a result of the event of June 13th, we determined and were frankly a bit surprised but determined that there was another scenario that we needed to be prepared for in the event of a blow down or the event of an error at the plant and the malfunction of the plant.","And that assumption that we embedded has required us to do go back and study the press release system and we determine as we did that that we actually had to make some further modification to the relief valve system again certainly a tough decision to do that, but again I think absolutely the right line when it comes putting a safety ahead of anything else in our business.","So you can see here in July 31, we are started on that relief valve system and modifications, we had a lot of this, the plant already buttoned up and in many cases lot of the systems were dried out, we haven\u2019t open the system back up now and so that introduces moisture into the system.","So when you see that plant dry up, it\u2019s basically backing up on some of the systems that we had already turned over. And so we think the relief valve system modifications will take about seven weeks and in parallel that as we start to complete, button up some of those systems will start to dry out and will start tuning up some of the cracking furnaces there and so that\u2019s the second blue part that you see they are called plant dry out and hydrocarbon introduction.","And then finally moving us to a first week in October as we start to get into ethylene production and so one of the things I would like to clear here that is certainly our target. We think that is a very achievable target, but in terms of our financial projections, just given the number of issues we face there we have spread that contingency up and basically we have the range in our financials now just basically starting with that first ethylene production running through the end of the year and so that\u2019s the range of outcomes that we\u2019ve got to built into guidance now.","So we are building ourselves some additional contingencies in there beyond what our targeted date is there. So that\u2019s our detail and we\u2019ll be happy to take any questions on that later John Dearborn will be here to help address in that as well.","Moving on now to the rest of the presentation and on the Slide seven, it\u2019s really a impressive growth numbers continue to be posted were both WPZ and ACMP and that continues to drive very impressive cash flow growth at Williams and this is especially impressive when you consider that in the second quarter, we only recognize about two months of business interruption coverage there Geismar.","And so our fee-based revenues in the quarter continue to steady march up into the right and despite a very mild second quarter in terms of any weather on our pipeline systems, we still continue to move that up about 7% over 2Q of last year on our fee-based revenues and I think also important were well over 80% of our reported net revenues were coming from fee-based services.","It also should be understood much of the big capital investments that we\u2019ve been making here really over last two and half, three years, don\u2019t start producing cash flow until the third quarter and fourth quarter of the year as Gulfstar, Keathley Canyon and our OVM or Ohio Valley Midstream investment really began to generate significant cash flow and earnings here in the last half of the year.","And then of course ACMP continues, it\u2019s very steady progress up into the right as this group continues to benefit from its very tight focus on growing the gathering the compressions business in the nations very best natural gas basins. So I\u2019m very pleased with the way the business is continuing to expand and we\u2019ve got a really exciting last half of the year in front of it.","Now looking at some of these important growth drivers that we continue to focus on and report to our investors. One item of significance been added to this was you will see there at the bottom is the ACMP acquisition and in terms of results, pretty impressive work by our finance and legal teams this last second quarter moving from price agreement with GIP all the way to closure within a matter about five or six weeks. So very impressive work by that team and just continues to shine light on the kind of town we have around here and our commitment to continue to drive shareholder value here at Williams.","And so this was, the half year represents a tremendous amount of effort really across the whole organization and with the exception of Geismar we are very pleased with the results on the store card here as we pause here in first part of third quarter. Now there is certainly many E&C projects that are nearly complete and now we are beginning to turn our attention on the next waiver projects that just keep coming, things are very well positioned assets and the competitive advantages that we constantly focus on developing.","I\u2019ll tell you that\u2019s a very natural part of the way we run the business here at Williams and a lot of these major large scale projects that we take on and the challenges that we take on really are in support of making sure we maintain strong competitive advantages in our business.","So moving onto Slide nine and looking forward here to this next waiver project, we see that this list is long and it just keeps coming. The bulk of the large projects in 2015 come from our Atlantic Gulf region that continue to perform very well, Atlantic Gulf region continues to execute and continues to hit this number on a regular basis.","And we certainly are, as we look here at the projects in \u201815, many of these are really in the major projects are expansions of our Transco and our gas pipeline system in the Atlantic Gulf area, projects like Kodiak for instance really are capital led to tie back to an existing facility and we do have continued what we call program capital as we continue to build up northeast GMP but a bulk of our major projects have really in the northeast, a lot of that is getting out of the way this year and we\u2019ve really set ourselves up for a lot of big fundamental growth looking forward beyond 2014 in the northeast.","The major projects in 2017 really come on light in the year but our backlog of projects beyond 2017 just keeps building and you really should expect this to continue for some time as we bring the combined strength of both WPZ and ACMP now and bring those resources together and the opportunities that they combination brings really is going to be critical as the nation here tries to get up on a 100 Bcf natural gas market. We think Williams and the combined entity is going to be very much at the forefront of reaching that 100 Bcf today gas market here in the U.S.","So moving to Slide 10, I\u2019m kind of looking at the big picture of what this new MLP would be, we are, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about, not only the size, the scale of this MLP, but the very consistent focus on being the player in the natural gas phase and natural gas products and derivatives they are coming out of this big road to natural gas and we think the combination of Williams access just continues to load us towards more and more growth, just some important things to note on here that are very impressive in 2015 and expected EBITDA of about $5 billion and in addition to that continued best in class growth distribution of 10% to 12%, which is really impressive when you consider the scale and what it takes to grow the cash distribution in this business and something of this scale.","And so continuing to be able to do that through 2017 and maintain strong coverage really provide an investment vehicle that we think is absolutely unmatched and is going to continue to give us the kind of firepower to continue to expand this business larger and larger.","So, couldn\u2019t be more excited about the combination of this business and if you look on slide 11, this really conveys the breadth here that Williams has but it also shows really what ACMP is doing for us in the upstream piece of our business and if you think about the way, we have genuinely grown a lot of our businesses over the year, we basically have linked and levered either the market back into the upstream or we have taken the upstream and the gathering & processing business and move those opportunities downstream certainly nothing is more obvious about how we have done that in recent times, you know many times over the years nothing is more obviously than the way that\u2019s is going for us up in the Susquehanna supply area and the ability that we have generated may large projects off of about brig upstream growing volumes there.","So, if you look at that and think about ACMP today on a operated gathering volumes PZ and ACMP are every close to the same number and if you look it on a capacity basis WPZ is larger part of that just because of the legacy large scale assets that we have had out in the Western basins.","But nevertheless very impressive position in the gathering space upstream and our ability continue to deliver services and link that to service opportunities for our customers downstream this basically just reloads our set of opportunities in continuing to grow that, I can tell you didn\u2019t feel like we needed a lot of that but nevertheless I have got a lot of confidence in not just the assets but the combination of the people of ACMP and Williams, there is some incredible strengths at ACMP that frankly we are very excited to have hitched to our wagon and a lot we can learn frankly from expanding the upstream gathering business and a great job they have done there and what PZ brings to that of course is the ability to continue to expand opportunities beyond that. So, tremendous strategic fit as well as a great financial for Williams and WPZ.","So, moving on to slide 12 here, really couldn\u2019t be more excited about how we are positioned strategically right now and thrilled to see the ACMP piece come along, it further fills our hand out and this scale and the opportunity set that we have and the growth that we have, we think is unmatched.","And we have a very fired up organization I can tell you right now, very excited to take on these new opportunities both at the ACMP level and at the Williams level. So, very excited about the quarter, disappointed with Geismar but extremely excited about the second half of this year and the kind of growth we are going to get to witness here in the second half of the year.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And first we\u2019ll hear from Christine Cho with Barclays.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Good morning everyone.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning Christine.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Your other fee revenues in the Northeast doubled quarter-over-quarter even though NGL production didn\u2019t change that much. I am assuming that this is the condensate handling that came on during the quarter. When did that come on and how much of the 6,000 barrels per day capacity are you using currently?","Alan Armstrong","Jim can you take that please?","James Scheel","Sure, Christine good to talk to you again. That\u2019s correct, that\u2019s the stabilizer fee revenue and the stabilizer came on, it was 50% of the stabilizer I should say came on you can see we have the first phase of 6,000 barrels a day come on in April of this year.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","And that how much of that capacity are you currently using?","James Scheel","We are using about half of that today and that\u2019s growing as additional wells come online. We have got about 73 wells coming online for the balance of the year.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","And then if you\u2019re GPM of the gas is 8 or something like that how much of that is condensate is 10% is a fair assumption?","James Scheel","I am not 100% sure on that Christine I had to get back with you but I think that\u2019s pretty close, it is probably in the 8% to 12% but I don\u2019t know exactly that number.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, that\u2019s fine. Also the de-ethanizer getting moved up by a quarter. Did this impact volumes in second quarter at all meaning did anyone have to shut in wells because the gas wouldn\u2019t meet pipeline respect with ethane in it?","James Scheel","No, we haven\u2019t had any of those issues right now although that continues to be concern a Christine. The de-ethanizer had no impact in the second quarter, actually even if it had been online we wouldn\u2019t have had the opportunity to move ethane because of some other downstream issues, we are right now working to commission that asset and it should be up during the third quarter.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, great. And then Alan or Don I think you have told in on a prior call that you guys have \u2013 your first refusal came into \u2013 it came in energy too JV position but what about on the ACMP side you know there are some partners who are backed by private equity in E&P companies who may or may not want to a minority owner in such assets in the longer term and I would think that they would want to monetize at some point with the combined ACMP\/WPZ MLP have any first rates there?","Alan Armstrong","You know I am not sure what the confidentially terms are for ACMP on that issue. So, we\u2019d rather not comment on what their rights are there I would just simply say that we do feel like we are very well positioned to consolidate a lot of those assets in the Utica there I am pretty excited about Blue Racer \u2013 what our opportunities to consolidate look like there?","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, great. And then while I think its consensus opinion that the first part of the deal of ACMP is accretive I think there is some confusion in the market as to whether or not the second part of the deal adds to that accretion or chips away a little from that accretion is there any clarification you can provide?","Donald Chappel","Christine its Don. Since the merger is currently being negotiated or about to be negotiated between the two partnerships I don\u2019t want to go too far on this. But certainly the way we styled it Williams would take reduced cash flow in the early period and enjoy higher cash flows, higher growth beyond so, likely mildly dilutive initially and then turning around pretty quickly.","Christine Cho \u2013 Barclays Capital","Okay, perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll next move to Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS","Hi, good morning guys.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS","Alan in your prepared remarks you talked about market pull of projects and so forth it seems to have come to fruition during the quarter. I think in your slides you had said that you got about a backlog of 25 billion at WPZ and another 4 billion at Access. Any sense on how large this backlog could potentially grow in terms of order of magnitude, are we talking in the neighborhood of 10% to 20% or are we talking to something significantly higher assuming you are able to commercially negotiate some projects and so forth?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, you know I think a couple of thoughts on that. One, we may actually see a lot of opportunities that come to us that require less capital so, higher earnings and better return but less capital as we look at opportunities between the two. So I would just say the opportunities may not be measured in capital and will be measured in earnings growth.","But I will just tell you that the number of opportunities that just keep coming at us along the Transco system and on the northwest pipeline system as the market continues on the demand side to try to figure out how to take advantage of all this low cost gas and continued confidence in low cost gas is pretty impressive that given what a deficit we had in storage this year and we are sitting in sub 4 gas price really tells you the confidence that the demand side has and the supply capabilities, the long-term supply capabilities of the gas basins. But what that\u2019s developing is a lot major downstream project","And so I would tell you, I think a lot of our growth is actually going to come from that and our ability to connect the supplies into those opportunities and of course all of that new gas supply leads in to both natural gas liquids and olefins as well as we produce that gas we got to something with the liquids and find market to those liquid.","So, I would tell you rather than the ACMP combination driving a lot of capital increases, I would say it\u2019s slightly going to drive in the northeast, it will drive some higher earnings but perhaps I don\u2019t know that it will reduce our capital but I would say a lot of it would be just higher earnings in here.","Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS","Great a couple of quick follow ups, we saw some ramps in volumes in the northeast and you didn\u2019t have any change to your 2015 guidance, is it fair to say that the way the northeast acted in the second quarter is exactly the way you wanted it to, it is running according your plan and you would expect to see a significant acceleration in 3Q and 4Q. I was wondering if you can sort of walk us through the ramp as to how we go from 1Q and 2Q of this year as to how we end up with kind of the guidance for 2015 in terms of where you expect the big pick up in ramp acceleration to\u2026?","Alan Armstrong","That\u2019s an excellent question and I\u2019ll tell you I am very excited what we are seeing there in the engagement I\u2019m going to ask Jim Scheel to provide a little more color on that, thank you for asking the question.","James Scheel","Yeah I\u2019ll answer that in a couple of phases. I think we are very excited about the progress we are making in the Susquehanna supply hub or ABA area. We are right on target and actually probably a little bit ahead of where we wanted to be. We have a lot of projects coming online during the third and fourth quarters of this year, they will be on time-on budget. We\u2019re growing those volumes by about 34% versus prior year as we come out of the year and quarter-over-quarter this year we\u2019re up 8%.","So obviously we\u2019ve always wanted to do better up there and smash more gas in to the system but we\u2019re right on target with where we want to be. OBM has been a bit of a different story, it\u2019s very consistent with the last analyst day in the last earnings call.","You can actually see on page 20 of the book that we\u2019ve lowered our average volumes for the year, that\u2019s primarily due to a number of producers having some challenges at the front end of the year and so we are seeing the way on wells coming online.","But we will actually end the year higher, we adjusted the number for the year end at 420 and again as I\u2019d mentioned a bit earlier, we have a number of wells, we have lots of visibility on getting ready to come online.","We have 73 wet Marcellus and in addition to that some dry Utica wells that\u2019s not included in that overall number that could actually add to some of the volume but obviously that will be at a bit of a lower rate. Our biggest issues right now as we look into the third quarter are commissioning the assets that will drive some incremental fee revenue, you\u2019ll see our fee revenues increasing and then just seeing when the producers tie those lines in.","L&M is on target with where we expect for the most part and will end the year about 25% higher than last year as well. So, although there are challenges in the northeast that we\u2019ve been seeing around OVM on the producer side; the good news is unlike past discussions the assets seem to have the reliability in order to move the gas and we\u2019ll be able to meet our customers\u2019 needs as we go through the third and fourth quarter with the incremental processing options for them.","Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS","Great one last question if I may. Just if we can turn the Geismar obviously a disappointment that it wasn\u2019t able to start up on time so forth. I was just wondering if you can sort of elaborate a little bit on the safety issues, did it come up in the inspection process and sort of prevent a permit from being issued or is this something that you\u2019ve just decided to do over and above the process in all permits and everything is in place. I was just wondering if you can give us a little bit of color around the safety measures that are being enhanced?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah let me have John Dearborn take that, he\u2019s been right, square in the middle of that.","John Dearborn","And thanks for the question, very insightful question the way you ask it. And to take on the first part of your question as to whether it had something to do with the permits. I would say no not at all it rather to put it into some context for you, the overall \u2013 and in the overall plant there were more than 750 pressure safety valves throughout that plant and on a regular basis you go through and you study all the pressure scenarios on these various pieces the equipment and how these valves are expected to control over pressure circumstances and prior to the incident and then of course as a result of the incident we were doing over pressure studies and they were being done in a very prioritized way and a very careful way as well.","We have to be very deliberate, very disciplined in how we go about doing this work. And the work, it progressed extremely well, some of the valves just to give you an idea, some of the valves get studied and we said okay the valve is fine and you put the documentation to the file about how the valve has been restudied and no further work was needed.","In the prioritization we left several studied valves towards the end of the study and it until early in July as the study was finishing up the team came to learn of a particular scenario that truly required mitigation.","So as we came to learn of that, the team considered several strategies that could have potentially worked in the circumstance and determine that the best solution we could have applied was to install several new PSVs and just so you understand the number of several is really about 12 PSVs are being installed and to replace several sections of piping.","Now it happens that the full impact of this essentially new work on our schedule is not known until earlier this week and frankly it\u2019s what resulted in this disappointing disclosure today but I just want to reiterate once again that we\u2019re taking this extra precaution here to enhance the safety of our workers and the public and I hope that provides some adequate colors everyone on the phone about this entire issue that we\u2019re grappling with as we move forward toward the safe and sustainable restart the plant.","Shneur Gershuni \u2013 UBS","Great that was extremely helpful. Thank you very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move next to Brian Lasky with Morgan Stanley.","Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi good morning. Just kind of following up on Geismar there really quick. I was just wondering if you guys can discuss a little more at length kind of what the drivers of your range is in terms of for first ethylene production and what could possibly delay this further?","John Dearborn","Sure glad to bring some color to that. So let\u2019s reflect again about what happened at the time of the incident, this plant went down in a very unusual and a hard way right. We had to take some unusual precautions and go through certain procedures in order to clean it out.","And so certainly there could be some potential risks related to some of the equipment as a result of way it had gone down. Secondarily I would say there\u2019s always a concern that exists around restart of a plant especially when it\u2019s been extended.","Now as to whether the systems as designed and as reinstalled work, take for instance rotating equipments, sometimes you have to go in and look at the rotating equipment a second time. Now that\u2019s historically happened to us, from time to time it doesn\u2019t, we don\u2019t know anything today that says we should have an unusual worries on the startup, so I have nothing that I know of at the moment but with an abundance of caution we thought it was appropriate to guide that, that the start-up is not risk free once we are through this next round of installation of pressure safety release valves and that\u2019s the entirety of the story behind the contingency range that we put around that start-up.","Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Got it, and Don I was just wondering if you could just update us on your discussions with the insurance companies and your recovery expectations and kind of once we get into this outer period where you be above your business interruption, insurance, how you are kind of thinking about that and how that\u2019s kind of baked into guidance?","Donald Chappel","Let\u2019s say that now that the plant is substantially complete from a construction standpoint and we\u2019re moving very quickly and toward the start-up most the facts are now very well-known and obviously we\u2019ll continue to update our claim as we move through start-up.","We\u2019ve retained some expert consultants, if you will that are doing studies to support our claim. We plan to present those studies and conclusions to the insurers in the fall and we would be hopeful that, that would then start the next round of settlement discussions.","Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And in terms of I think you mentioned previously that you expected to use your ATM kind of in 2014 to be largely at the equity markets and \u201815 at PZ I mean you put out kind of share count applying some meaningful equity issuance in the back half of the year. I just want to make sure that was kind of still your expectation that you do any incremental equity on the ATM this year and you\u2019d be largely out of the markets at PZ next year?","John Dearborn","Brian that in fact is the case again our car financing plans is pretty well unchanged obviously the drop down of the Williams owned assets is another factor and we\u2019re looking to do that ideally post merger in the late \u201814 early \u201815.","Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And then finally just I mean I think Cabot mentioned on their call some infrastructure issues that they were having which impacted their production in the quarter. I was wondering if you guys could just elaborate from your perspective what some of the issues were and kind of how the event resolves going forward?","James Scheel","This is Jim Scheel I\u2019ll comment on that again I listen to the earnings call too and I want to just reiterate, our performance quarter-over-quarter were 8% more than we were previous quarter and first quarter\u2019s 4% more than the year end.","So we\u2019ve been continuing to grow volumes obviously, we have to do a fantastic job in coordinating volumes into this system. I think Cabot is probably relating more to the opportunities missed just by some coordination on scheduling gas because actually we were moving more than we have and again as the additional horsepower comes online during the third and fourth quarter this year, we\u2019re going to see a rather rapid ramp up so that we finish the year about 34% more. So again I appreciate the concerns of the shippers but we continue to put some more gas through that system and are only accelerating that as we end the year.","Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley","And just finally from me, in terms of any update in terms of timing on the ACMP\/WPZ negotiations, is there any update from most recent disclosure?","Alan Armstrong","Nothing new I would just tell you, the complex companies are working hard and have got, are very well advised and I think everybody understands the importance of moving ahead with it and with some diligence and that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on right now.","Brian Lasky \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thank you gentlemen.","Operator","And next we\u2019ll move on to Abhi Rajnandan with Credit Suisse.","Abhiram Rajendran \u2013 Credit Suisse","Hi good morning guys.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning Abhi.","Abhiram Rajendran \u2013 Credit Suisse","In your data book outlook for WMB you show a revised outlook at the excess cash flow available you went after the dividend step up which is around 28% for year through 2016. And it sounds like the remaining part of the deal will be may be modestly dilutive upfront and accretive beyond that so I guess how should we think about the current and potentially more excess coverage being brought down overtime once the entire deal is done?","Alan Armstrong","Abhi again yes, we would expect some of that excess coverage to come off because one of the big considerations that Williams is making here is moving the distributions we received really took the ACMP schedule in terms of those ISR. So Williams is making I\u2019d call a concession there to enable the merger and we think that that\u2019s going to drive significant value long-term but certainly with some near term reduction in cash flows. However by \u201817 that really turns around we would expect to have a nice increase in accretion if you will, cash flow accretion on a per share basis. I hope that answers your question.","Abhiram Rajendran \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yeah I know, that helps. And then just a couple of other quick ones, at WPZ you have a shortfall this year of about 400 million between the DCF and distribution. So I guess how should we think about how you make this up is this just with capital raises or do you need any sort of support from WMB, any color there would be helpful?","Alan Armstrong","We expect that WPZ\u2019s financing plan is largely intact. I think at midpoint here, we moved the cash flow about $150 million and as well we do have, and anticipate the litigation settlement that we would expect would largely offset that in terms of cash so we think not a lot of change there.","Going back to the cash flow, your first question, I would point out that our 2017 to 2019 cash tax guidance is an assumed rate of 14% and we would expect that to come down somewhat as we continue to add to our capital spending, as you can see our capital spending is about $4 billion this year and it declines to 2 billion unchanged by 2016, it\u2019s because what we have in guidance is really sanctioned projects and we have a lot of projects, organic projects that we\u2019re working on, those are added to guidance and those projects are placed in service that will continue to press that cash tax rate down somewhat, so just consider that as building your models.","Right now, our run rate seems to be about in the $4 billion range and if you take that 25 billion and divide it by the six years you get about $4 billion a year and that\u2019s pre-ACMP and they have been spending about $1 billion a year. So you can think about that as you think about our cash tax rate and while the rate looks to be fairly low remember that, that\u2019s based on cash distributions received and if you look at it on a percent of pre-tax income which is more conventional, you\u2019ll see the rates quite a bit higher.","Abhiram Rajendran \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay got it that\u2019s helpful and then just last quick one from me. On the Canadian projects, can you talk a little bit about what\u2019s driving the shift back in CapEx and this is at the WMB and Petchem segment level, are these delays in locking down customers or just a slower than expected construction schedule, any color there would be helpful.","Alan Armstrong","Yeah great question and particularly the PDH project is what I assume you\u2019re referring to primarily and the other being the Syncrude and I would just tell you that, given the kind of increases that we are seeing in the Petchem space on engineering and construction side and the kind of demand we\u2019re seeing on labor and we expect to continue to press forward we are working very hard to not get ourselves in a difficult situation relative to schedule and to make sure that we are pushing away from that risk as much as possible in terms of overruns because we do, as we look forward we see a lot of pressure on the skilled labor that it\u2019s going to take the build out this infrastructure and so I would just tell you that we are making sure as we move forward in that we don\u2019t get ourselves in a position where we\u2019re relying upon thinner and thinner resources and lower and lower productivity and so that\u2019s the primary cause.","Abhiram Rajendran \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay got it thanks very much.","Operator","And we\u2019ll move on to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc","Thanks. Just sticking with sort of Petchem and I guess bigger picture, do you see being in the petrochemical business as a core competence for you or do you think it is maybe distracting you from some of the maybe bigger midstream activities that you have, should we read in6to this PDH, maybe delay something around there, there\u2019s some questions around what constitutes qualifying income I am just wondering if you can just talk about the value chain a bit more?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah sure. We continue to see the petrochem business as not, for William not being in the petrochem business for the sake of being in the petchem business frankly but really as a pull through and the market outlook for these NGL supplies and so certainly I would say it\u2019s a little bit different between Canada and the Geismar facility because in Canada really we pursued that many years ago because mostly that\u2019s a processing business we\u2019re not actually reforming any molecules there that\u2019s being done that the upgrades were simply above extracting that through typical cryogenic processing and then fractionating it just like we do in other sectors of our business.","So in Canada I would tell you the competencies if you will are not very different and we have certainly got very strong competitive advantage there. But in both cases, Geismar and as we would move in the PDH, we continue to look at that as an outlook for products in a way for us to continue to provide market access for our customers that otherwise isn\u2019t showing up.","So I would tell you that\u2019s how we think about it, and we certainly think about it in terms of being more fee based business. I think it is a very good question that you raised and certainly given the great number of opportunities that we have in front of us that\u2019s always an issue of capital allocation for us.","And as part of the reason that as I just answered before, part of the reasons that we\u2019re making sure we don\u2019t get ourselves into a difficult spot there in that piece of business because we do see a lot of pressure in getting that business built out particularly on the PDH facility.","So in the end I would just tell you we continue to look at it as a place for us to expand market for us and for our customers I think it\u2019s very nice complement to the ethane link that we\u2019ve had for years and it\u2019s a good place to provide market for our customers. And that\u2019s kind of the extent of it in terms of how we look at it, we don\u2019t look it at as being in the petchem business to be a petchem player.","Theodore Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc","Understood that\u2019s very helpful. If I can just shift back to the Northeast, I am just wondering if you\u2019re seeing any reaction by the producers to some of the gas price volatility and sort of that the price decline that you have seen recently. And especially some of the regional basis issues that clearly people are still have in there. It sounds like the issues have been more sort of physical and tie-in challenges and what not, but is there any sort of bigger reaction from producers from the gas we are seeing in the Northeast.","Alan Armstrong","Yeah, no and to be fair I would say that given the kind of recent push down in price that\u2019s just really just happened here, we\u2019ve had we\u2019ve doubts with it but it\u2019s really just push down here over the last month or so I would say it\u2019s a little bit early to call that frankly, but certainly the activities that we saw in the first half of the year are just now coming to fruition and there has been quite a flurry of activity on the drilling side both in the wet Marcellus to the dry Marcellus up in the North East and now starting with some of the dry Utica in the OVM area.","And so in the first half of the year I would tell you that that\u2019s been pretty strong. I think it\u2019s a little bit early to call with this more recent weakness in natural gas if that\u2019s going to slow much of that down. But so far we certainly haven\u2019t seen any signs of that. And I would tell you I think the producers are getting, particularly in their OVM area are getting better and better at understanding what they\u2019ve got there and are more and more excited about it. So we\u2019ll see what happens, but I think it\u2019s a little bit early to say we have seen any kind of reaction at this point.","Theodore Durbin \u2013 Goldman Sachs Group Inc","Okay. And then just last one from me on constitution, any update on sort of the regulatory and permitting process there?","Alan Armstrong","Not much to add there. I think we are very pleased with the way the FERC has continued to press forward on that and we are working hard to work with the New York DEC and communicate to them the importance of this infrastructure and the need to deal with the some of the water quality excuse me water crossing permits that the New York DEC has in their hands. So really kind a remains focused on that issue and I would say we\u2019ve made progress but we haven\u2019t solved that problem.","Alan Armstrong","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s it from me.","Operator","And next we move onto Carl Kirst with BMO Capital.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Thanks good morning everybody. I think I\u2019ve just got two questions left and then now on understanding and appreciating your comments around the Canadian PDH facility and labor inflation like. I think prior we were thinking that maybe this could come to a hit by year end and so just trying to kind of getting a little bit more color on what you were saying earlier. Is this something that we should just kind a think of now as more just on the back burner more of kind of on hold or is that still progressing?","Alan Armstrong","Yeah not at all. There is tremendous amount of work, we have made great progress with the polypropylene take contract if you will that takes a quite a bit of price risk out of it. And I would just say both parties, both us and the party that have the polypropylene take are working diligently to make sure that we\u2019ve got great confidence in our estimates and the work plan it would take constructed in a low risk manner.","But I\u2019ll tell you the work is probably at all-time high in terms of making sure that we are very confident of where we stand with the estimate and we do very much expect to conclude and have it pinned down by the end of the year. And so in no way you should consider it\u2019s on the back turn or it\u2019s just us absolutely making sure we de-risk it is as much as possible before we move forward.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Understood. Appreciate the clarification. And then just last question and maybe this is on Geismar with respect to the pressure scenarios that were studied. Clearly ethylene plants are not like processing plans. So I guess it\u2019s not exactly a cookie-cutter approach here and what I am wondering is, is that to the extent that this plant has been rebuilt or perhaps studied now maybe with all the different scenarios that are out there from the safety standpoint, does this in anyway make Geismar, I hesitate to call it best-in-class because of what we have gone through, but as we kind of look forward from this point today, does that anyway help you distinguish yourself from other plants and then how ultimately does that perhaps help our hinder Geismar 2?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, Carl good question. I would say we certainly are coming out of this much stronger than we went into it both from an operational focus and reliability and we have worked hard to really improve the older plant as well as making sure that those learnings were built into the new plant as well.","I would tell you that probably the fact that we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s been a right in the middle of a major construction project like this that\u2019s also looking at Geismar 2. And so it\u2019s not some distant memory of the lessons learned it\u2019s kind of real and available, puts us in a very knowledgeable position to push forward with Geismar 2 if that\u2019s what we choose to do.","So I would say I am very thankful that we\u2019ve got a team that is, and this has been a really tough project if you think about it, if you\u2019re managing this major expansion project in the first place in and around a plant and then have the major explosion that isolates us from being able to complete the plant right in the middle of a project, that\u2019s a project managers worse nightmare. And yet they have hung with it.","So I would just say we\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s very schooled on what it takes to be successful as we look forward into Geismar 2 and certainly we all have a lot of confidence in pushing forward as we look to Geismar 2 opportunity.","Carl Kirst \u2013 BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Great, appreciate the comments. Thanks guys.","Operator","And next we move onto Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Hi good morning.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning Sharon.","Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","John I guess with regards to the dividend illustration you provided. Those tax rates do you anticipate those cash tax rates to change materially if the ACMP\/WPZ transaction occurs?","Alan Armstrong","No Sharon, we do not. So we don\u2019t expect that to change. The distributions will change somewhat so there will be some effect. But we wouldn\u2019t expect any material change in those tax rates as a result of that. I think right now they are driven largely by the placing assets and service.","And we are in the middle of appraisal for both accounting and tax purposes. So there will be some adjustment of estimates along the way as we conclude both the accounting and tax appraisals to really key in this process.","Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. And then I guess just trying to gauge the potential for the exchange ratio to be renegotiated. Maybe if you could provide some color on some of the key factors, management considers when you determine the proposed exchange ratio?","Alan Armstrong","Sharon we did some extensive modeling and really trying to come to a transaction that we thing was value adding both ACMP and WPZ unit holders for let trying to balance the considerations there. So obviously a lot goes into it, but that really was the design criteria we wanted it to be a transaction that we thought would be beneficial to both partnerships, really trying to strike that balance and that\u2019s really what we put forth in our proposal.","Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay. And just the last question. I guess given the IRS\u2019s scrutiny on some of the non-core \u2013 activities in PLRs. At this juncture, is there any concern regarding the PLR for Geismar?","Alan Armstrong","Not here, not at all.","Sharon Lui \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities, LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Alan Armstrong","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","And we\u2019ll we move on to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Good morning guys.","Alan Armstrong","Good morning.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","So back to Geismar 2 prospects. Any further updates around the markets capacity to provide long-term fixed return contracting versus commodity exposed returns?","Alan Armstrong","Don you want to take that.","Donald Chappel","Yeah. I am glad to take that. Thanks very much. Not much has changed since Analyst Day, so just to reiterate where we are there we\u2019ve got a very warm reception when we put our RFP out to the marketplace and our interest was oversubscribed quite significantly. What we are doing with this particular investment is we\u2019re essentially trading off that commodity margin to the buyer of gasoline to our joint venture partner in exchange for a fee for service opportunity for WPZ in total concert with our strategy. And certainly the markets appetite given recent and current ethylene prices is quite warm to a provider that\u2019s willing to provide on a fee per service basis. So we\u2019re seeing very, very warm reception both on the JV side and on the ethylene purchase side or fee-for-service type arrangements.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Great. When do you see that, is that like a 2015 really 2015 period to try to true up some of those negotiations?","Donald Chappel","Yeah, we\u2019re going to work those negotiations through this year and into the early part of the next year I am sure. But I think the bigger emphasis here is very much aligned with Alan\u2019s comments earlier about the PDH unit at the strategic level. So until we\u2019re absolutely that we\u2019ve got the right commercial deals lined up here and until we\u2019re absolutely certain we know how we\u2019re going to execute and derisk the capital project on an investment of this magnitude, we\u2019re going to hesitate to rush our way into a sanction if I could call it that. So we will sanction only when we\u2019re absolutely ready for both commercial and the project side.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Got it. And Don if I could return to the insurance recovery question. If I remember when I asked at the Analyst Day the comment was made that debates about recoveries has less to do with debates about what true commodity price should be versus taking best care in not only being safe but also being appropriately efficient and starting up again. Could the fact that you are now delaying start-up comfortably beyond the recovery period basically obviate that issue a little bit and make it to easier to achieve recoveries since you are kind of taking some of the dime on your own accord?","Donald Chappel","Craig good question. Certainly the claim \u2013 our claim continues to get somewhat larger because we believe we\u2019ve worked prudently to bring the plant back into service. Obviously insurers who have the money in their pockets argue against that but we think we have a very solid claim, we think that our outside experts will help us present our claim in a way that is compelling and we\u2019re optimistic that we will receive a very substantial additional payments perhaps as early as late third and fourth quarter.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Okay. So you think that much of those could be resolved by the time the plant is actually up and running?","Donald Chappel","No I think more likely it\u2019s fourth quarter.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Okay.","Donald Chappel","Yes the plant being up and running in the fourth quarter but with the target of October date it could take a bit longer than that is I guess my comment.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","I got you. And last question kind of a little broad spectrum and big picture. But we\u2019ve got a couple of things going on with potentially a competing NGL line from the northeast to Belvieu maybe looking a little better prospect at the moment and also condensate exports looking more realistic than ever before. There is obviously competitive pressures for new business opportunities from all these types of events across your system I wonder if you all could just comment on any net positives or negatives from these types of events?","Alan Armstrong","Well I guess if you are just asking generally about the competitive environment that we see out there I think we continue to see not see much impact from competition frankly we just have so many opportunities coming at us that, that\u2019s probably why I want to say it\u2019s the least of our worries, it\u2019s certainly low on the list. And really if you think about some of the larger risk to the business it\u2019s more around the macro environment and one thing we do compete for frankly we\u2019ve become very aware obviously we comment for rigs from one basin to the next. And so I think having ACMP alongside gives us a little bit better diversification to that in terms of being exposed on big gas basins.","But I would say that really the issue that keeps us focused on getting great market access for our customers and keeps us aligned with them frankly is that we desperately want to see good market access for the basins we\u2019ve invested in and that\u2019s obviously a service we would like to provide as well and providing better market access and better long-term markets for their products and so that\u2019s how we\u2019re continuing to go about that. But I would say on the competitive front that we\u2019ve just got our hands so full with the opportunities that are coming to us and we\u2019re uniquely positioned to win that we\u2019re not having to stretch very far beyond that.","Craig Shere \u2013 Tuohy Brothers","Great. I appreciate it.","Alan Armstrong","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question we will hear from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies.","Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies","Hey guys thanks a lot for taking my question. Don just curious I\u2019d see the guidance for WMB effectively DCF but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s something that you reported along with quarter reports, so I am just curious if you could either for the second quarter sort of provide on the same schedule of how you would guide it. What the DCF or WMB entity was and is that something that on a go forward you are plan to report as part of the financial.","Donald Chappel","Chris great question. We have not done that yet but we certainly expect to, so you can look for that next quarter.","Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies","And any broad framework as to what it might have been for the quarter?","Donald Chappel","I don\u2019t have that number off hand and I don\u2019t know if John has it but we can get it to you or we could post it on our website.","Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, great. That would be helpful. Thanks guys.","Donald Chappel","I\u2019ll just comment here again we\u2019re going through a transition here with ACMP and that our acquisition of the additional interest will know cause us to consolidated ACMP beginning in the third quarter which will create some differences in reporting. Obviously we\u2019ve done reporting on equity basis will be fully consolidated, we will be looking to gain significant gain in the third quarter to revalue our initial investment in ACMP, we will be looking some substantial and tangible assets and we will have some additional depreciation, amortization related to those assets as well.","So just kind of a heads up and look forward to quite a bit different presentation you still get to the same bottom-line here in terms of cash flow but from a balance sheet than earning standpoint there will be some changes in the basis of presentation.","Christopher Sighinolfi \u2013 Jefferies","Okay. Great, thanks Don.","Donald Chappel","Welcome.","Operator","And our last question today will come from Bradley Olsen with TPH.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for fitting me in I know we\u2019re running a little bit late, so I really only got one question. Now that you\u2019ve closed the ACMP general partner acquisition, can you comment on any ongoing efforts to retain key personnel from Access and kind of broadly speaking how successful those efforts have been?","Alan Armstrong","Sure. That\u2019s certainly something we very much value that organization and their capabilities and that was high on our list of things to accomplish. And so we did move swiftly and aggressively to do so and I think we\u2019re with comfortable with where we\u2019re right now on that front. And so what a great work by our teams here at Williams and the team at Access to really address where any of those issues might be and take care of them swiftly. So, I\u2019d say we feel very good about where we stand today and I am you know particularly proud of both the organization coming together and work that so quickly.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Okay, great. So, broadly speaking I guess it\u2019s fair to say that in the Utica and the northeast where Access is maybe most their capital is being deployed that he team is kind of largely in fact for a post acquisition?","Alan Armstrong","That is correct.","Bradley Olsen \u2013 Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co.","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","And will conclude today\u2019s question and answer session I would like to turn the call back to Alan Armstrong for any additional or closing remarks.","Alan Armstrong","Great, thank you. Thank you for all the great questions. As you can see, we are very excited about the future we have got in front of us and this team as you know I think just continues to generate momentum towards this vision that we have of really being de-premier player in this natural gas super cycle and very excited about the opportunities that keep coming at us and we keep executing on to accomplish that and we look forward to reporting to you in the third quarter with great continued progress and certainly at the balance of the year. Thanks for joining us today.","Operator","And that will conclude today\u2019s call. We thank you for your participation."],"23117":["Williams Companies (NYSE:WMB) Q2 2012 Earnings Call August  2, 2012  9:30 AM ET","Executives","John Porter","Alan S.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. John Porter, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","John Porter","Thank you. Good morning, and welcome. As always, we thank you for your interest in Williams. As you know, yesterday afternoon we released our financial results and posted several important items on our website, williams.com. These items include the press release of our results with related schedules and our analyst package; a presentation on our results and growth opportunities with related audio commentary from our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong; and an update to our quarterly data book, which contains detailed information regarding various aspects of our business.","This morning, Alan will make a few brief comments and then we will open the discussion for Q&A. Rory Miller is here from our Midstream business; Randy Barnard is here from our Gas Pipeline business; and our CFO, Don Chappel, is also available to respond to any questions.","In yesterday's presentation and also in the quarterly data book, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are various non-GAAP measures that have been reconciled back to generally excepted accounting principles. Those reconciliation schedules appear at the back of the presentation materials.","So with that, I'll turn it over to Alan.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Thanks, John, and good morning. Thanks for joining us and it's a busy time right now, and so we appreciate you being able to take the time out for us. Well certainly, despite a very disappointing financial performance in the second quarter and significantly lower margin forecast for the balance of '12 and '13, we're very pleased that despite that, we're able to continue to remain confident in our very well-supported dividend growth, which is still at 55% here in 2012 and 20% both in '13 and '14. So a lot of our confidence on that continues to come from the degree of coverage that we've had built into our model, as well as the extraordinary maintenance costs or maintenance capital we have built into PZ right now, and as well a lot of continued strong growth coming from our fee-based business.","Our second quarter performance was certainly impacted by a rapid decline in NGL prices, but a few things as well. There\u2019s one thing, I think, that isn't always obvious in the way we report is that we also have a pretty significant amount of product that's in transit that is held in pipelines. And of course, that gets remarked each quarter based on the pricing decline. So in fact in this period, we had about $22 million impact on that over and above what you would see in your typical pricing model. So whenever we see prices move down, that gets somewhat accelerated. And when we see it move back the other way, it comes back to us.","But there were certainly were other factors as well beyond pricing. Some growing pains, the Boreal Pipeline line fill. The high start-up O&M cost associated with the Caiman pipeline -- or sorry, the Caiman acquisition that we now refer to as Ohio Valley and as well, quite a bit of depreciation expense going on with that as well. But we also had higher maintenance costs, which we accelerated some of our work on a lot of our Western plants as we had a third-party fractionator being out during the second quarter that required us to take some of our plants down, so we took advantage of that and accelerated things like a lot of turbine overhauls, embezzled maintenance during the period.","The good news for the quarter, a 19% increase in our fee-based businesses within our midstream portion of WPZ. And we certainly had great progress on our major project execution going on during the quarter as well. So we remain very confident in the way our model is growing, particularly on the fee-based business side.","Just commenting quickly on prices. Certainly the second quarter drop that we had from the first and second quarter was over 20% on our NGL margins, and the balance of the year is forecasted to be approximately 30% lower than what we recognized in the first quarter of '12. So we certainly have, in this model we have taken it down to what we're seeing and certainly we expect for prices, particularly on the light-end products, ethane and propane, to be very choppy as we see a lot of new infrastructure and supply coming on of the NGL side, but a bit ahead of a lot of the Petrochemical build out and some of the export build out on the propane side.","The NGL crude ratios are really what drove us. A lot of folks have thought about this from a crude standpoint, but really the crude price had very little to do with this. And we've got in our forecast, we've got NGL to crude ratio is running at about 40% here through the balance of the year versus historical average of 60% and the almost 57% that we realized in 2011. So certainly that disconnect that we saw on the ethane and propane side is what really damaged the second quarter from a pricing standpoint, and we expect that to continue as the market needs to be balanced on the supply side on both ethane and propane.","The good news, of course, for Williams is with the Geismar facility. As we're expanding that, we moved away from a lot of the risk on the ethane choppiness. We're not all buried long term on NGLs as much as we are realizing that there's going to be a lot of infrastructure changes going on as this market tries to build out and we think there will be quite a bit of volatility associated with that.","On the project news, a lot of great efforts going on around the company right now in terms of building out our $9 billion that's in our guidance for CapEx through 2014. The Boreal Pipeline we brought on, this certainly in the second quarter and that was brought on below budget -- below our planned budget, excuse me. And as well, brought in a little ahead of schedule. Our ethane extraction project in Canada is also going very well and that project has been very well executed. So this will really be the third project, the ethane extraction project that we've managed up there, the first being the BB splitter, the Boreal Pipeline and now the ethane extraction project. And our Canadian team continues to do a great job of executing on those projects.","Likewise in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico, our GulfStar project is going ahead very nicely, the Keathley Canyon project is doing very well. And I'll tell you, we remain very bullish on the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico as an oil province and we really think that we're very well positioned to provide a lot of the service as the Deepwater comes back.","The Caiman or Ohio Valley efforts, a lot of effort going on in the build out, people from really all over our systems up there trying to assist with getting that business built out and the tremendous amount of activity going on, a lot of promise. And we're very excited about the way things are going so far on that acquisition.","The Laurel Mountain Midstream build out, we're getting to the point where we're almost, I can say that we're not constraining production there with the infrastructure. We have, for sometime, a lot of that volume\u2019s been limited by our infrastructure up there as Chevron continues to drill out that acreage. And we're about to get to the point where we'll be out in front of them a little bit with the expansion, so we're excited about that. And then of course, the Geismar expansion continues to go very well and it's well contracted at this point. And the gas pipeline space, the Northeast Supply Link project continues ahead, and as well our Rockway lateral. We are hopeful that we can get a positive response.  That is waiting on a bill in front of Congress, and so we're looking forward to that.","In addition, we also have a lot of new projects that have been recently announced, the Canadian propane dehydrogenation project, which would be there at our Redwater facility. We think we're extremely well positioned for that project and it's a very nice compliment to our propylene production that we have there today in Canada already. And then the Utica JV that we announced, we're excited about the promise of that, a little early to comment too much on that today, but that JV is completed and we're excited about the promises there. And you'll see in our capital guidance, you'll see that we've added in capital for that JV in terms of our expectation for that.","We just announced Leidy expansion and really excited about the way that's gone. That project winds up being a very nice project for us in terms of being able to expand along our Leidy system and we think that\u2019ll be both a lower-risk project for us in the immediate term but also provides, we think, a great value to producers and to our markets in giving them great access to the supplies up there. So we're very excited about that. And we certainly haven't shut the door in any way, shape or form on the Atlantic access, but we're not about to go ahead with a very risky build like that without very strong support from the producer community and in terms of contracts that make sense for the kind of return that's allowed in the pipeline basis.","Finally, the Dalton lateral Mobile Bay South are also projects that are gaining steam here in the second quarter and into the third quarter. And so our backlog continues to mount as does our confidence in our strategy, in our growth, in our dividend. And so with that, I'll turn it over for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Kevin Smith with Raymond James.","Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Can you speak on the Boreal Pipeline, how much that lowered your NGL volumes by this quarter when you started up and to fill it?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes. That was about a $9 million hit to us with the fill.","Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Got you. No reason that any of that should impact 3Q, right? It's all behind?","Rory Lee Miller","I'm sorry, I didn't catch that. Could you repeat that question.","Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","He ask if it would effect third quarter at all.","Rory Lee Miller","I don't think so. The line is full now and so we'll be gearing that, but there shouldn't be any additional hit after that.","Kevin A. Smith - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then my second question on the Geismar plant, can you kind of talk a little bit about how much EBITDA and cash flow that\u2019s generating right now? And I guess where you are in your CapEx plans for it?","Rory Lee Miller","We typically haven't released individual numbers for Geismar. The second part of your question on the CapEx plans. We've got a couple of capital projects going on there right now. We're upgrading some of our furnaces. I think we've got -- that project is partially completed, but is ongoing. And then of course, we've got our major expansion, the plant being serviced in the third quarter of '13. Those are the main CapEx plans for Geismar at this point.","Operator","And Bradley Olson with Tudor, Pickering has our next question.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions on the Atlantic Access and Leidy announcements. I assume it's safe to say that given that Leidy is kind of running along the existing lateral, that's going to be a higher return project than building out the new laterals to Butler and Natrium would have been.","Frank J. Ferazzi","Alan, is that something you\u2019d like me to take?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, Frank, please.","Frank J. Ferazzi","Yes. I think as Alan said, the fact that we have existing Leidy Line already there, that the execution risk associated with the new build would be less than a greenfield project. The economics of each of the pieces are going to be a function of the kind of shipper commitments that you get. And so as Alan also said, we're going to continue to monitor the interest along that new greenfield build, and we will proceed with that when we get enough interest from producers to support an economic project. We're just not there for in-service day of 2015, but based on the projections that we've seen on the production in the area, we think at sometime that will make economic sense.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And as far as the Natrium lateral that was canceled, so that moves -- that was kind of designed to move gas out of Southwest PA and Northern West Virginia. Should we view the cancellation or at least the delay of Natrium as having any read throughs for your production forecasts in the part of the Marcellus, where the Ohio Valley assets are also operating?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes, I'll take that. No, that is not in any way, shape or form the case. We're very confident in the volumes there and the drilling activity that continues there. I think the producers are fairly confident in the area and are happy to take the prices that they can get on some of the systems that are further to the east over there. And so time will tell if that will hold up in terms of those net backs. But today, I think they are confident that there's adequate takeaway there today. And again, that becomes crowded. Once it becomes crowded, the price will decline. But I think today, as evidenced by the interest, they're pretty comfortable with the current gas markets coming out of that space today.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That's really helpful. Another one on Transco operations. Looking at -- and I understand that most Transco revenue is firm, but there is a variable component that can move around quarter-to-quarter. And I know that this is a seasonally weaker quarter historically for Transco, but it looks as though there's -- that revenue or EBITDA per Mcf on Transco this quarter was kind of lower than it had been on a year-over-year and a quarter-over-quarter basis. Is that just because the nature of the volumes are just increasingly short haul? And so on a kind of per unit basis, you're seeing revenues decline or was there something operationally with Transco this quarter that made the results a little bit softer there?","Frank J. Ferazzi","This is Frank Ferrazi. As you indicated, we do have some costs allocated interruptible transportation and we tend to -- if that can be impacted by changes in seasons. Obviously we're going to do better in the winter there than we're going to do in the summer. There really were no operational issues that occurred in the second quarter that would have resulted in lower earnings.","Bradley Olsen - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one last one. I guess from an accounting perspective, why was it that the accelerated maintenance that you talked about in the Rockies, why did that show up in higher midstream OpEx as opposed to capital? And as a result of that accelerated maintenance, would it be reasonable to expect that maybe the run rate OpEx for the remainder of 2012 would be lower in the midstream segment?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes. That wasn't maintenance capital, it was just O&M that was accelerated. And mainly, we were moving forward from what would otherwise be spent in the third and fourth quarter. So we should see some moderation forward-looking for the rest of the year based on that work that we did.","Operator","Moving next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","A couple of questions here. First, a follow-on to Kevin's Boreal question. Was that $9 million hit all expected just for packing the new line or was that inclusive of some impact from the Suncor plant being done?","Alan S. Armstrong","No. That was just from the line pack.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","And what was the impact from the Suncor plant?","Alan S. Armstrong","Hang on just a second, let me pull that up.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","While that's being looked for, on the prepared comments or the recorded comments, I was a little unclear on what the time frame was, the duration for the underwater ethylene supply contracts that kind of have margins at Geismar versus what the market opportunities really were in the first half?","Alan S. Armstrong","Those basically timeout pretty well at the end of this year, a little bit of run into '13. But by the end of '13, there's not any residual impact from that. So mostly by the end of '12, most of those contracts runout.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Great. And then if you're still looking up that Boreal question from Suncor, I had one last follow up here.","Rory Lee Miller","Craig, I do have that if you want me to interject that there.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Sure, go ahead.","Rory Lee Miller","Yes. It looks like it's a little over $4 million for Q2 that was related that Suncor outage.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Okay. So the $9 million was naturally expected because you knew you had to finish the pipeline to fill it. The $4 million is the unexpected, is that a fair statement?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes, that is. And a part of that lapped into Q1 and then part into Q2.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Are now you're talking about the line packing?","Rory Lee Miller","I'm talking about the Suncor outage. They had 1 unit for about 15 days and another unit was operating about 75% load. So the $4 million is related just strictly to the Q2 outage and then the $9 million is isolated to just the impact the Boreal Pipeline.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","Got you. And the last question, Alan, how do you avoid the issues regarding nonqualified income at PZ with a potential drop-down of Geismar. Because that seemed to be the logical thing all along, somehow that a contractor dropped down to make a true internal operating hedge rather than just a consolidated accounting hedge. But there's always this question of nonqualified income at the MLP. Did you find a way around that?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I would just say that -- I would say we took it head-on and I would say that we're very confident in how we're handling that and time will tell in terms of what gets exposed there about what supports that confidence.","Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.","As far as details on any drop-down, I mean, how eminent do you think that could be?","Donald R. Chappel","Craig, this is Don. I think we'd be working through the process with the WPZ complex committee and their advisers, probably expect the closing in the fourth quarter.","Operator","Moving on to Carl Kirst with BMO.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","This is actually just a follow-on to Craig's about the qualifying income and recognizing was only limited, maybe you can say. But I guess regardless of how this is approached, just since this is somewhat of a precedent. Will there be some type of private letter ruling or some clarification from the IRS that kind of sets it in stone?","Alan S. Armstrong","Again, I would just say that we are very confident in how that's going to be treated and that's really all we want to say about it at this point.","Donald R. Chappel","This is Don. I'd just add that again, we think that it's some information that provides a competitive advantage for us, so that's the reason that we're not more clear in terms of the basis for our confidence.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. That latter statement is very helpful, so I appreciate that. And maybe just a couple of follow-ups, one, going back to the accelerated maintenance that was done on the midstream side. Did that actually, in the third-party fractionator outage, did that have an impact on the equity sales volumes for the quarter? And if so, by how much?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes. It did. We had a total production related kind of directly to the bush and frac outage was about 25 million gallons. And of that, about 15 million was related to our own equity account.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Then one other question just on Geismar, this just goes to the utilization, the 74% utilization kind of on par with second quarter last year, but down sequentially. Was that just normal maintenance for this time of year or was something else going on there?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes. We did in Q2 have a determined issue there that had us down, I believe it was 7 days. One of those days was actually in Q1, and then the remaining 6 days was in Q2. And we were, I think that was related to about 28 million pounds total being down about $24 a day.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. Yes, that would explain the difference. Great. And then last question, and this really is just Caiman, Ohio Valley, I guess, just trying to set the baseline for where we are today. Is it possible to break out what the volumes were for the second quarter?","Rory Lee Miller","Let me see, I've got the right-hand man looking that up right now. But I will say in general, Alan mentioned a little bit about what's going on there from a producer input standpoint. In general, I would say the volume situation has been very positive and we've got producers waiting on pipeline, waiting on infrastructure, results are looking very favorable. I think all of the movement that we've heard on volumes from producers has been to the upside, if anything. So the area and the quality of the reserves was fantastic it. Let's see, yes, for second quarter we're right around 182 Bbtu, and about 20 million gallons of NGL production.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","I apologize, can you repeat those numbers.","Rory Lee Miller","182 Bbtu per day.","Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And you said 20 million gallons?","Rory Lee Miller","20 million gallons, yes.","Alan S. Armstrong","And that's just 2 months of production.","Operator","Moving on to Steve Maresca with Morgan Stanley.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just some follow-ups on the Geismar proposed drop-down you mentioned in the release of taking units back. Is the idea that this would potentially be solely WPZ units going up the WMB to fund this?","Donald R. Chappel","Steve, this is Don. Yes, and that's really tax-driven. If we take cash, we'll pay taxes. And tax basis is fairly modest, so we're inclined to take the units to be tax efficient and have as little value loss to taxes as possible.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that you haven't released individual numbers on Geismar's cash generating ability, but did you put a chart in there that shows ethylene produced and the margin. Is there something else to it other than that arithmetic for us to figure out?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, I would say that's the bulk of it. You also have propylene production and butadiene production as well. And so that and the operating costs are the other elements you'd have to get to, to see an [indiscernible]","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Final thing on the Geismar. Is there a thought as to what -- right now you're forecasting 1.03 coverage next year at WPZ. Is there an idea of what this would take PZs coverage to where you'd like to see it after this?","Donald R. Chappel","Steve, I don't think we want to put any numbers out. We're in discussions with the complex committee at this point. So I think as we reach that agreement with the complex committee, we'll announce the transaction and provide updated guidance for both WPZ and Williams at that time.","Alan S. Armstrong","I would say, obviously we recognize that business is not a fee-based business. And so our coverage needs to be higher than, certainly higher than normal in terms of how that would impact.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then you talked about, I think, an ethylene margin rebound is part of the '14 earnings going up. Can you talk just a little bit about what the thoughts are behind the drivers for that?","Alan S. Armstrong","Sure. We certainly feel like that the U.S. continues to be the advantage in North America. In general, I would say, it continues to be the advantaged place to produce ethylene. And we see that demand continuing to come up on a global basis through the period. And so pretty confident in the general fundamentals around ethylene. And if you think about somebody trying to build ethylene capacity somewhere else in the face of this very low-cost natural gas, I think that drives our confidence and certainty we have a pretty good picture of what's going on in the ethylene capacity here in the U.S. Very fortunate to have Geismar on the front end of any these capacity expansions, but there's really not very much other coming on in the near term -- or sorry, in the near term to 2014. So we see a great promise coming on, a lot of NGL supplies coming on, but it just takes a while to build that cracking capacity to meet that increased demand that's coming on. And so that builds our confidence there.","Stephen J. Maresca - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. Finally, on the proposed PDH facility. A couple of things, you talked about, I guess transporting, I think, the propylene to the U.S. Gulf Coast. How would that happen? And then is that going to be funded with -- is there enough cash on hand to fund all that?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes. That will be railed, is the plan. And I think our belief is that with our current international funds offshore accounts and the cash flow from the existing business, that is growing along with our ethylene project that, that should be fairly well self-contained.","Alan S. Armstrong","We do rail, today, a tremendous amount of propylene out of Redwater already today. And so this would be just additive which is, again, a nice feature that a lot of the infrastructure in terms the storage of propylene and railing and loading of propylene, we already got all that in place. So this is just additive and I think that's why we feel very confident about us being the right builder of that PDH facility in Canada.","Rory Lee Miller","We've also got the BB splitter up there, which is going to help us with the products. We've also got a very unique situation with our sale to NOVA of the ethane\/ethylene mix. And so those are advantages that we think we uniquely hold. And so it appears to be kind of an advantaged opportunity for us.","Operator","Moving on to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Sticking with the PDH unit here. Have you given any thought to actually contracting up the propylene volumes or do you want to kind of keep that price risk on the propylene side as well?","Alan S. Armstrong","We're looking at kind of all of our options right now. I would say right now, our main focus is on scoping, getting some of the initial engineering work done and we're looking at all the options and certainly, this decision of the propylene is one of the big decisions that we'll be making before we sanction the project. But that's an ongoing exercise.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then I appreciate the slides on ethylene crack. It looks like you're forecasting in 2014 that you won't quite get to the industry benchmark. I'm just wondering what would cause you to be short of that, plus or minus to hit it or try to be short of it?","Alan S. Armstrong","When you say industry benchmark, are you talking about the spot with the crack spread?","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes. That ethylene spread that you show in 2014, it looks like you realized margin might be short of that. I'm just wondering is there something with Geismar that you wouldn't hit the industry margin or is there just a difference in the definition there?","Alan S. Armstrong","There are couple of things that work there. And one is that even though I think we flagged earlier that in early '13 we'll have an opportunity to re-contract almost our entire portfolio, we still have a legacy contract out there that won't be fully exposed to the spot market. So that's one piece of the story. I think the other piece of the story is just a little bit of conservatism that's built into how we're able to execute in terms of putting those spot contracts into place. And at times, there is some give-and-take between a true spot market deal and a term deal that's tied in the spot market.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","But your intention is to pretty much be spot, in other words, to not do term deals with Geismar?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes.","Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then just coming back a little bit to the questions on the ethylene margin. Do you care to share what your actual ethane price forecasts are that gets to that ethylene margin in 2014?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. $0.55 a gallon.","Operator","Moving on to Holly Stewart with Howard Weil.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Lots of questions on Geismar this morning, so just maybe trying to tie the bow there. In the slides, you point out the shift in mix to spot pricing. Previously, we had talked about kind of a half based on fee, half based on exposure to the spread. I'm assuming kind of addressing Craig's question earlier by the end of 2012, we'll be all based on the spread. Is that how to think about?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. I think that's accurate. Of course, a lot can happen between now and then. But certainly, our goal there will be balanced against our ethane exposure.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then you kind of give the chart here. Can you just tell us what your margin was that you realized on the spread in 2Q?","Rory Lee Miller","Stand by, Holly.","Alan S. Armstrong","That's $0.20.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Say that again, I'm sorry.","Rory Lee Miller","$0.20 balance.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","$0.20, okay.","Alan S. Armstrong","And that was down from $0.40 in the first quarter of '12.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","$0.40 in 1Q, that's perfect. And then lastly...","Rory Lee Miller","Thinking about the portfolio mix, like Alan's referencing, the crack spread out there as opposed to our realized margins. So Q1 was $0.18 and 2Q was $0.20. That $0.40 which was first half '12, that's really what the broad market crack spread was. And so that's basically what we got built into our 2014 pricing is at that $0.40 level.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Perfect. And then last quarter, you gave some nice commentary on kind of the different rig counts that you were seeing across each of your areas. Is anything on the rig count side changed since last call that might impact things here moving throughout the year?","Rory Lee Miller","This is Rory. I think in general, that kind of step down in activity out West that we flag for you is still pretty consistent. I don't think there are any material changes to that level of activity.","Holly Stewart - Howard Weil Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then finally, just one kind of follow-up on the macro side of things. You're hearing commentary that most of those ethylene plants that were down for maintenance in the first half of the year are back up and running. Is there anything else that's kind of still weighing on that?","Rory Lee Miller","Yes. Right now, if you think about ethane supply and that's always a challenge to measure that accurately, but about 1 million barrels a day right now on the supply side, this is where we think it's at. All of the crackers are up and running now. Thank goodness. And that's about 1 million barrels a day of demand. So we see supply and demand very much in balance. I think in Q4, there are 2 crackers that are scheduled to go down temporarily. So that's all we see for the remainder of the year. So the situation should be a little more stable than what we saw in the first half.","Operator","Moving on to Sharon Lui with Wells Fargo.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","It looks like for your MC&O business, the guidance refers to a coverage of 1.3x. I guess Geismar is dropped down to WPZ level. Do you think that type of coverage on the cash flow is appropriate or are you comfortable with something a bit lower given the natural hedge?","Donald R. Chappel","Sharon, I think you have to stay tuned for that, but clearly yes, it does sharply reduce ethane exposure or eliminates the long ethane position after the expansion of WPZ. So we certainly reduce that, but we'll have ethylene exposure and we'll need to make sure that coverage is sufficient to account for that. Again, if ethylene prices are very high, it is expected to have relatively high coverage on that part of the business. And that if ethylene prices are lower, we would expect less coverage just like our NGLs today. If you look at Slide #83, I think we tried to indicate that somewhat, but we'll be tuning that up as we go through discussions with the complex committee, as well as continue to look at our view of the forward market.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And I guess also related to the Geismar drop-down, should we just assume that it would be structured so that WPZ would not be paying, I guess, taxes on that cash flow?","Donald R. Chappel","Yes.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, I guess on the PDH potential project, do you have like a potential in-service timing of that facility, the 2015 project?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. I don't think we've released anything on that yet. And it is, as we noted, kind of in the scoping phase right now. So that's probably something we'll be able to give a little more color on in the coming quarters. But I think right now it's a little preliminary to drive a stake in the ground.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess in terms of feeling comfortable to proceed with that comp -- with that project, would you be looking to secure minimum volume commitments or like a fixed propylene margin?","Alan S. Armstrong","Yes. I think that kind of gets back to the earlier answer that I gave around disposition of propylene and we're looking at all the options. Of course, if you do lock something in fixed, you're probably giving away some upside. And those are decisions that we'll be making as the projects get fully bedded and pulled together. So we should have a good line of sight on that by the time that project is sanctioned.","Sharon Lui - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then I guess the last question, in terms of the Leidy announcement, has that CapEx been included in your budget yet?","Donald R. Chappel","Sharon, it has not. So when we come forward again with guidance, we'll update to include that, assuming that the open season is concluded. And we've got all the contracts tied down so we know the size of that.","Operator","And moving on to the Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisers.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Sorry, still one more question on Geismar. I respect your desire for the competitive advantage but when you do the drop since it is very significant, will you provide investors the basis for why you think that you will not pay taxes on the income.","Donald R. Chappel","Becca, I think you have to stay tuned for that. I think we'll have to see if that's something that is required or we feel is something that we need to author. Again, I think we believe that we have something that is unique at this point and we want to make sure we take full advantage of it without necessarily offering the roadmap for others.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the PDH facility, as I understand that you'll need about 20,000 barrels a day or 20 million barrels a day of propane, is that correct? And you would have 7,000. So where will the incremental come from to source that PDH facility?","Alan S. Armstrong","Well, as you're probably aware from previous calls, we do have other projects we\u2019re working on out there. So over time we do expect our equity propane to increase. But there are plenty of places between now and then to buy propane in Canada. So we don't see the supply side as any particular challenge for us right now, and we're very comfortable with that. Whether we're going out on the open market and buying it or whether we\u2019re just building it over time with our internal equity barrels.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then the rail cost to get it down to the Gulf Coast, what kind of delta in propane prices do you need relative to the Gulf Coast in order to make up for that $0.05 a pound rail cost.","Alan S. Armstrong","I don\u2019t think we want to get into, probably, that level of detail yet. We've got ongoing analysis on that. And I would say let's leave that for future call, but we do think the situation is very favorable and are supportive of that project. But we have some continued analysis that is ongoing on that.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And then finally on Marcellus. If my memory serves me well, you guys were expecting gathered volumes from the Susquehanna Hub of about 1 Bcf a day this year and Laurel Mountain about 250 million a day. Is that still the case?","Alan S. Armstrong","Those are generally in the neighborhood. I think on Laurel Mountain, we're probably already over that. I think we're over at 280, if I'm not mistaken, on Laurel Mountain. And I think our target on Susquehanna Hub is just shy of 1 Bcf a day by the end of the year.","Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division","And where are you guys now on Susquehanna?","Alan S. Armstrong","Let's see. Hang on just a second, Becca, let me just track that down.","Unknown Analyst","I can get it offline if you want. I'll just follow-up offline to get that one.","Alan S. Armstrong","All right.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Nathan Copicar [ph] from Viking Global Investors.","Unknown Analyst","Actually, Igan [ph]. I had a similar question about the Geismar cracker, so we can move on.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn things back over to Mr. Armstrong for closing remarks.","Alan S. Armstrong","Great. Well, thank you again for joining us. And we look forward to continuing to share our growth with you in the future. Thanks for your interest.","Operator","And this does conclude our conference call for today. We'd like to thank you for your participation."],"22916":["The Williams Companies, Inc.

Today's conference is being recorded.","At this time for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Brett Krieg, Head of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Brett Krieg","Thanks Britney. Good morning and thank you for your interest in the Williams Companies. Yesterday afternoon we released our earnings press release and the presentation that our President and CEO, Alan Armstrong will speak to momentarily. Joining us today is our Chief Operating Officer, Micheal Dunn; our CFO, John Chandler, our General Counsel, Lane Wilson; and our Senior Vice President of Corporate Strategic Development, Chad Zamarin.","In our presentation materials, you will find an important disclaimer related to forward-looking statements. This disclaimer is important and integral to all of our remarks and you should review it. Also included in our presentation materials are non-GAAP measures that we reconcile to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. And these reconciliation schedules appear at the back of today's presentation materials.","And so with that, I'll turn it over to Alan Armstrong.","Alan Armstrong","Great, thanks Brett. And good morning to everyone and thank you for joining us.","And as we discuss our third quarter financial performance and we also will hit on the key investor focus areas of the day as we usually do. So let's move right into the presentation and take a look at our third quarter results.","On Slide 2, we provided clear view of our year-over-year financial performance and as you can see, we continue to enjoy steady growth in our key measures despite the asset sales that we continue to execute on and in fact I'm very pleased to say that our third quarter records for our fee-based revenues, our adjusted EBITDA and of course these were driven by record operated gathering volumes which exceeded 13 Bcf per day in the period and as well record contracted capacity on a regulated gas pipeline and these combined overwhelm the small amount of remaining NGL-margin exposure that was certainly low and in fact about as low as I can remember that we've seen in terms of margin contribution from the quarter.","So really nice to see our strategy of focusing on fee-based revenues and growing that are, coming through at a time where we had a low cycle on commodities but again, we powered through that with the growth in fee-based revenues.","So, taking it from the top and see here our cash flow from operations, which increased 15% for the quarter and 16% year-to-date and this continues to outpace our CapEx and as you can see on a year-to-date basis our CFFO has exceeded our CapEx by over $630 million.","On the next line, we show 7% and 8% year-to-date growth for adjusted EBITDA and I'll have more to say about adjusted EBITDA performance in the next couple of slides and then as you can see, we posted continued growth in adjusted earnings per share of 8% for the third quarter and 23% year-to-date even stronger than our adjusted EBITDA increases.","And on DCF, we were up about 8% and 16% year to date with growth in the per share calculation and continued strong dividend coverage ratio of 1.79 which continues to exceed both our 2018 coverage ratio as well as our guidance for 2019.","And you can see our ending leverage metric for the quarter was 4.47 demonstrating that we are on target with the four or five guidance that we have for the year-end. So overall, nice improvement in our various earnings and cash flow metrics despite the impact of almost $2 billion in asset sales affecting the comparison and much lower commodity price environment that we had in 2018.","So now let's move on to Slide 3 to discuss the main business drivers of our year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth. Here on Slide 3 where we compare 3Q '19 to 3Q '18. The adjusted EBITDA increased about 7% or almost 10% if you adjust for the bigger transactions that affect the year-over-year comparison.","On the left side of the slide, you can see in gray that we have unfavorable $47 million comparability adjustment which includes removing the adjusted EBITDA from the various asset sale transactions completed during the last 12 months and then netting out the $13 million favorable item reflecting the addition of the incremental 38% UEOM ownership interest.","And so that's the additional interest that were not consolidating in the Utica East Ohio Midstream business. And so normalizing for those items, you see adjusted EBITDA growing $112 million or almost 10% on this comparison.","So now moving over to look at the financial performance of our continuing business, similar to the first two quarters of this year. Atlantic Gulf led with a 28% increase in adjusted EBITDA driven by topline Transco revenue growth from new expansion projects, of course the Atlantic Sunrise and Gulf Connector were two that were powerful in this comparison and additionally our third quarter 2019 Transco results reflect about $44 million of adjustments related to the settlement were breached in our Transco rate case and of course this recorded through both revenue and other income and expenses. I know there's a lot of questions on that. We look forward to being able to shed more light on that at our upcoming Analyst Day but I will have a little more to say here as we hit slide 5.","Lastly, we did see a temporary drop in our Deepwater volumes associated with tropical storms and producers maintenance activities but Deepwater production is back to normal for most producers now in the fourth quarter and in fact growing in the Gulf East due to new production from Hudak to Northwood ramp up that continues.","So we continue to be very impressed with the activity in the deal flow around our assets in the deepwater and that's another item that of course will spend quite a bit of time at our upcoming Analyst Day on.","Next up, looking at the Northeast G&P area. We see a 17% increase in year-over-year adjusted EBITDA driven by an increase of about 1.3 Bcf a day were 17% higher gathering volumes and higher gathering fees associated with expansion projects.","Volume increases were led by the Susquehanna Supply Hub and the Bradford areas which grew about 850 million cubic feet per day and we also saw double-digit growth rate in all of our other operated Northeast franchises. So overall, our operated assets in the Northeast continue to see very strong growth in volumes across the board.","And finally in the West, we saw about a 16% decline driven by about a $29 million decrease in revenues for our Barnett gathering business. This decrease was associated with the end of some minimum volume commitments in that area and a related step down in deferred revenue amortization.","So that was a one-time step down that was associated with some cash that we had received earlier and that cash was being amortized according to the revenues that we were receiving and so once that MVC step down, it kind of compounded that step down.","The Barnett MVC expired at the end of June '19. And so once that did happen the revenue recognition rate of the fixed payments, we have previously recorded began to be based on actual volumes rather than MVC levels. So this was an expected step down and Barnett revenue recognition for this area and we have been forecasting it but we also saw a $32 million of lower NGL margins in the West as unit margins in the Rockies were down by almost 50%.","Partially offsetting these impacts was a strong growth in the Haynesville, the Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain Midstream franchise and the DJ Basin and in fact adjusted for the four Corners area in 2018, our West gathering volumes actually increased by about 2% on this comparison.","And finally, I want to mention our Conway frac and storage business which continues to see strong year-over-year fee revenue growth on the back of the NGL productions in the surrounding areas like the DJ and the Bakken.","So next, let's take a quick look at the adjusted EBITDA growth year-to-date and so now on Slide 4, we show the year-to-date comparison, adjusted EBITDA increased about 8% or about 12% if you adjust for the bigger transactions that affect the year-over-year comparison, pretty similar story year-to-date as you heard. For the third quarter so I won't drag you back through that.","On year-to-date drivers, we see Atlantic Gulf up 24% and the Northeast up about 19% driven by the same factors as we discussed. The West is down about 8% reflecting much lower NGL margins and again the step down in the Barnett revenue that we just discussed and the effects of severe winter weather this year on our Wyoming volumes during the first quarter of '19.","As with the third quarter comparison, our full year West results actually reflect strong growth in the Haynesville, Eagle Ford and the Rocky Mountain Midstream franchise in the DJ as well as our Conway storage and frac business.","So, very happy with the growth we've continue to show in the Atlantic Gulf and Northeast this year and the stability of our volumes in the West and strong revenue growth all leading to an 8% growth in adjusted EBITDA even considering the significant asset sales and low NGL margins and the one-time step down in the Barnett revenue recognition. So overall, operationally really strong performance overcoming a lot of those other structural issues.","As you look over the sequential comparison to the second quarter of 2019 here on Slide 5, I'd point out that overall gathering volumes increased sequentially just over 0.5 Bcf a day to now over 13 Bcf per day for the first time and this was led by a 5% second quarter to third quarter increase in the Northeast and with somewhat negatively impacted by the Deepwater production outages that we previously discussed but the biggest driver 2Q to 3Q in the Atlantic Gulf was a favorable impact of reaching settlement terms with shippers on Transco.","With respect to the lower West results, the one-time step down in Barnett revenue recognition amortization and the MVC expiration drove the decrease from the second quarter and the one-time Barnett step down overshadows what was actually about 4% improvement in gathering volume sequentially in the West.","In fact, our West gathering volume trend continues to hold up well in a very tough commodity price environment and now that we're past the revenue recognition transitions and the MVC expiration, the steady nature of our West operations will become increasingly more visible. The operational cash flows are holding up in the West and the CapEx requirements are coming down, generating significant free cash flow from our West assets.","So overall, we're pleased with our operational performance in the third quarter and it's very encouraging to see the kind of volume growth we continue to generate in the Northeast and the West G&P businesses and in fact is the first time that I can recall our fee-based business growth being able to overwhelm such a substantial decline in commodity prices showing that our move towards a more sustainable and predictable cash flow is now really paying off for our long-term investors.","Now I'm going to move on to Slide 6 and take a look real quickly here at the key investor focus areas. First, on financial guidance. We are reaffirming our current financial guidance for 2019. It's definitely been a challenging commodity price environment for natural gas and NGLs versus the market's original expectations and our own for 2019. But I am pleased to say that it looks like we'll be able to deliver on our financial guidance once again this year in spite of this negative impact.","As this is reflected in our year-to-date results through September 2019 has been a year of strong free cash flow generation and I'm pleased with the way our teams have kept us on track with our original business plan from a year ago and how they continue to exceed expectations on project delivery on generating new business, all while spending less capital than we planned. In fact, despite losing about $100 million of our planned direct commodity margins, we are still on track proving up the diversity of our cash flows and the power of crisp execution by our teams.","Also growth CapEx could easily come in under the low end of our $2.3 billion to $2.5 billion guidance range which as you know has already been reduced once this year and our dividend coverage ratio continues to be better than our $1.7 billion guidance.","Our 2019 results illustrate the steady and strong cash flow growth profile of our large-scale diversified natural gas focused business and the excellent security of our dividend even in a very tough commodity price environment.","Moving on now to 2020 guidance, we're currently working through our 2020 operating and capital plan and intend to provide the 2020 financial guidance at are upcoming Analyst Day on December 5.","At this event, we will also provide our latest views on the sustainability of our natural gas focused strategy and our unique positioning to grow alongside to continue expansion of natural gas as a preferred and vital fuel around the world.","Although we have great confidence in the long-term sustainability of our business strategy, the current low natural gas and NGL prices which are exceeding the long-term growth of natural gas demand have had a pretty significant impact on the forecasted near-term growth from our G&P business, particularly in the Northeast.","And clearly our producer forecasted cash flow that they have available to drill with has been heavily impacted by much lower strip prices for gas and NGLs. And as a result, our 2020 Northeast gathering volume growth forecast has steadily drifted downward.","As we said earlier in the year, we are committed to keeping our guidance up to date with our changes in our producer plans and so we've continued as those forecasts have come in, we've continued to make those changes.","However, as we've said before, confidence in low-cost U.S. natural gas reserves will continue and is continuing to drive strong natural gas demand growth over the long term and there will have to be a call on natural gas focused supply areas given the continuous growth in demand and the stronger than ever capital discipline from the producer community and of course we will be extremely well positioned and are well positioned for the upside associated with that.","As a result, we believe that as long as we continue to see natural gas demand growth that we should see the volume and capacity demand growth necessary to generate the 5% to 7% adjusted EBITDA CAGR that we continue to talk about over the long term to be clear this is not mean that every year we will be exactly in that range, some could be slightly lower and others like this year will be above.","The 2020 financial guidance, we provide in early December will be built off of low strip prices for natural gas and NGLs and because of this we view the guidance is having significant upside as the gas market rebalances. However, we're pleased to say that we have been taking measures to mitigate this risk and our 2020 plan will show the discipline and resulting improvement that we've been putting on our cost structure so realizing we were going to have some risk associated with this, we've taken a big swipe at our cost and team has been extremely effective on doing that.","And so the benefit of that as well as some other continued growth, we believe, will continue to offset the reduction that we continue to see in the Northeast. We will see reduced capital expenditures in the Northeast but we also are very focused on the very strong dividend coverage that that's providing us.","So speaking of growth capital, our 2020 capital budget will be dominated by our regulated pipeline expansions as much of the major build out of our GMP systems will be completed by the end of this year driving even higher levels of free cash flow growth and we had earlier expected.","One of the areas that is beginning to be a big driver of free cash flow growth is the Northeast operating area and we have been working hard to stay on top of the producer forecast changes in the Northeast. Our previous guidance for the Northeast G&P for 2019 remains intact where we are currently forecasting gathering volume growth of about 13%.","And this should result in adjusted EBITDA growth of 19% for a total of about $1.3 billion, so not a bad year given all the much more negative forecast provided by Research and others. So, year-to-date through the third quarter, we've generated about 17% gathering volume growth but we do expect that overall annual growth to moderate here in the fourth quarter since our fourth quarter comparison will be up against the volumes that grew rapidly right after Atlantic Sunrise came online last October.","Looking towards 2020, our latest forecast informed by our planned producer activity shows about 3.5% gathering volume growth versus our previous expectation of 5.5%. The decline in expected G&P volume growth was driven primarily by lower customer forecasted volume growth in the Bradford Utica and Susquehanna areas as producers continue to react to lower forecasted 2020 natural gas and NGL prices and based on this forecast, we would still expect adjusted EBITDA growth of about 8% to get to about $1.4 billion, so $50 million is lower than what we had for our second quarter expectations for '20, but still $100 million of growth here in 2019 to 2020.","So the decrease in expected adjusted EBITDA also includes a pretty significant reduction from the Blue Racer investment. So part of that $50 million reduction comes from the non-operating investment we have in Blue Racer.","And then beyond 2020, we continue to see an opportunity for a stronger growth rate to resume in 2020-2021 in the Northeast and that of course would be dependent on better balance in the natural gas market but we remain excited about how well we are positioned for that call on natural gas.","So overall, we remain encouraged to see the level of EBITDA growth. Our Northeast G&P business can continue to generate in a very weak natural gas and NGL price environment and we remain very focused on cost reduction and capital discipline as we await long-term fundamentals to balance. We believe it won't take a large price recovery to quickly restore growth rates above 8% for our Northeast G&P footprint.","So now let's move on to discuss our Transco growth projects. First, I'll provide an update on the rate case, very pleased that we have reached an agreement on the terms of the settlement and as a result, we've reduced the reserve we established against the cash and the receiving from the filed rates that went effective in March of this year which along with other related accounting entries results in about $44 million in favorable adjustments.","The agreement will resolve all issues in the rate case with no need for any hearings. Of course, final resolution of the rate case is subject to a filing for us to file a formal stipulation, an agreement with the FERC and final approval by the FERC.","So a lot of process still in front of us to get final resolution on that rate case but we're very pleased with way that came out. The terms of the settlement are non-public until the stipulation and agreement has been filed with FERC. We will provide an overview of the key terms of the settlement following the FERC filing.","For now, I'll just say we're pleased that we were able to reach agreement on the key terms with our customers and related regulators and we await the final FERC approval of the settlement. But I want to make it really clear on one point here, I would caution you from thinking that this reserve adjustment provides you with a clear picture of the annual run rate impact for 2020. And we certainly look forward to being able to show you the full impact once those filings are completed.","So let's touch on the status of Transco's major growth projects, starting with the Northeast Supply Enhancement project. Lots of headlines out there related to this very important project for the residents and businesses of New York City. We are still awaiting the State Water Quality Certification permits required for the project from both the New York DEC and the New Jersey DEP.","At this point, the risk to our targeted in-service date is increasing although we are going to do everything we can to meet our targeted in-service date for the fourth quarter of 2020, it is quite challenging to bring the onshore compression facility, a portion of the project which is there in New Jersey really challenging to get that done within a year's time frame and that is the current critical path that will be up against but currently we still feel that we can help support the peak load for the '20 and '21 winter.","So a lot of great work by our team that's been going on that. I can tell you there's been an impressive amount of work in a working with the various agencies and the various stakeholders on that and I remain confident in our ability to bring that one across the line.","So next, I'm very pleased that we're able to place our Rivervale South to Market project in the full service ahead of schedule. The project is a Transco expansion of 190 million cubic feet per day to service additional customers in New Jersey and New York City. We also received FERC approval for our important Southeastern Trail expansion. The Southeastern Trail project adds about 295 million cubic feet per day to the Transco pipeline system and this is designed to serve growing markets in both the Mid-Atlantic and Southeastern states by November of 2020.","In fact, all of our Transco projects that have been permitted for construction are progressing well. And finally, our most recently announced Transco project the Regional Energy Access project is now headed for approval at our upcoming November Board meeting, so great work by the teams in pulling that project together as well. And I'll remind you that one of the chief benefits of that project is being able to utilize our existing right of ways for that project.","Now moving on to Slide 7. Here just to conclude, taking a quick look at our third quarter performance and our high-level review of our key investor topics, we look forward to our upcoming Analyst Day on December 5th and this is going to give us an opportunity to dive deeper into a lot of the really key issues that are out in front of us right now and a lot of the drivers for growth that we are really excited to share about with you both for 2020 and beyond 2020.","So just in closing, I'll remind you we do live in a world that will continue to need more energy, there is a growing need for that energy to be as clean burning as possible. Renewables are certainly going to play an increasingly important role but their growth requires a partnership with natural gas to meet the energy needs of the world while also reducing emissions over time.","Natural gas does have the lowest CO2 emissions to heat content ratio when compared to other fuels and provide superior economics versus other fuel types and as an example between 2005 and 2018 CO2 emissions from electricity fell 27% due to replacing coal and oil and natural gas power generation. So while low cost natural gas also facilitates costly investments in renewables, it is paving the way around the world to be the fuel of choice.","Williams benefits from having ideally situated existing pipes in the ground and we continue to see demand for expansion for the long for both the near term and the long term and despite a pretty tough current commodity price and regulatory permitting environment the future remains very bright for Williams as we demonstrated here in the third quarter and for strategically placed natural gas focus assets like we are so fortunate to operate and we look forward to discussing that future with you in December.","So with that, let's go ahead and transition to our Q&A session. And thank you again for your time today.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering Holt & Company.","Colton Bean","It sounds like Haynesville volume growth was fairly robust through Q3, can you use off your thoughts on how that's progressing here in Q4 and maybe what the outlook looks like for 2020?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I think there's obviously been a lot of focus on Chesapeake, in the Haynesville and certainly they've had a strong year of growth. But our teams have been out contracting with other customers and have been very successful with other customers in the area. And likely we will start to see some reduction in the growth we've enjoyed from Chesapeake volumes, we're now starting to see that picked up by third parties and we're really excited to be working with some of those and we've got some very collaborative ideas about the way to grow the Haynesville volumes out there.","So we're actually pretty encouraged about what we've been able to work with other producers that surround and integrate with the Chesapeake acreage.","Colton Bean","And in terms of those agreements, are those consistent with maybe some of the legacy terms or should we think about those as newly cut the agreements that are more current market?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I would say there's a combination there. Obviously, it depends on what the market is in the area and so I'm not going to comment on specifically what those rates are but obviously it just depends on what kind of market apparently, we have in there.","Colton Bean","And then just maybe transitioning over to the West, can you characterize some of your discussions with producers around the Piceance and Southwest Wyoming footprints and maybe more specifically have the reductions to bank commodity there, so those having an impact at all for the private producers there?","Alan Armstrong","That's a great question. I would say we've seen very steady volumes there in the Piceance and so that's been a real positive. And it and it is mostly private money driving that. A lot of those folks as you know put hedges out in front and so they're just drilling up against those hedges. And then in Wyoming, in place like the Wamsutter, we have seen some slowing of what was some very robust growth but we are still seeing some nice growth there and the Wamsutter.","Probably the area that I would expect to see more decline on volumes would be the gathering upstream of our old power processing plant would be the area. So a lot of that gas we don't gather, that is gathered by third parties but we do the processing on it so that's probably the biggest decline we are seeing in the Rockies right now is pullback in that area.","Operator","Our next question comes from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho.","Gabe Moreen","Just had a quick question on the Northeast capital spend and I know you'll probably get into this at the Analyst Day quite a bit but relative to what looks like to be in Northeast G&P run rate spend about $550 million is plus or minus this year, can you maybe talk about just how low that could potentially go next year order of magnitude and to what degree there might be some mandatory capital spend you still have to finish up next year?","Micheal Dunn","Gabe, this is Micheal Dunn. We will have a capital program up there. We have expansions that are ongoing in the Bradford that will continue to spend money on that are coming online in the second quarter. So we do still have a pretty significant program there and also some well connect activity as well. So I don't think you would see as robust as what we're spending this year by any means but we will still have some capital investment going on in the Northeast.","Gabe Moreen","And then. Alan, let me if I could ask just bigger picture in terms of the EBITDA growth trajectory. I appreciate that some years will be up some of those will be little lower EBITDA growth but to what extent you think dividend growth may need to move in lockstep or not in lockstep with projected EBITDA growth just your latest thoughts around that.","Alan Armstrong","That's an excellent question, Gabe. And I would just tell you that the free cash flow growth as you can see by the increase in coverage that we've got this year against it, we don't see any change in getting outside of that range that steady 5% to 7% range that we've talked about for dividend growth because the cash flow growth in a year where the capital spending might be lower, is just that much stronger.","And obviously, we can see the growth coming because most of our capital despite we will have some capital in most of our capital, next year is going as I mentioned in my notes, most of our capital is going into regulated projects and therefore that cash flow growth is highly predictable to us in terms of when that's coming on. And so, we're not having to guess about what that growth in the prior years will be around that.","Gabe Moreen","And I appreciate you will get more on the Transco rate case settlement with FERC approval but can you at all speak to where they're not the emissions tracker, reduction tracker wasn't approved as part of the settlement?","Alan Armstrong","We cannot speak to that at this point. So I would just say there's a number of trade-offs around that but we cannot speak to that at this point.","Operator","Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse.","Spiro Dounis","Maybe just starting off or going around with the 2020 CapEx. Alan, it sounds like you've indicated a little bit this on directionality year-over-year but you also mentioned 2019 coming in potentially below the low end. So just curious with that bar sort of getting even lower, how should we think about the magnitude and direction of CapEx coming down next year? Obviously, you mentioned G&P skewing towards the low end of course but you also talked about regulated asset spending and I guess that's where maybe I'm unsure. Do we assume flat higher year-over-year, does that offset a lot of the GP decline?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, I would just say certain projects like for instance the Regional Energy Access project which will be taken to the board. So we'll see increase perhaps from what we had forecasted earlier on the regulated side but decrease in particularly in the G&P area and as we've talked about a lot of the growth that we have in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico doesn't require much capital relative to its growth and so we're going to enjoy some pretty attractive. There is one project in particular there that is going to require some capital and that started to get very clear for us in terms of what that's going to require in the Deepwater but a lot of the projects that we're working on there that the producer is providing the capital for.","So I would just say for '20 as I mentioned, the '20 CapEx is definitely going to be dominated between the regulated gas pipeline and the long haul NGL pipeline that we're doing the Bluestone Pipeline that's going to dominate the 2020 CapEx.","As Micheal mentioned, there is some cost of service capital still going into place in places like Bradford but majority in 2020 is going to be on the transmission side and it looks like based on the continued demand for the regulated pipe that we're going to continue to see some growth there and then as we get into '21 and '22, we will start to see the some of the impact of - one of the deepwater projects that I talked about start to impact our capital for '21 and '22. So I think that's about all I can give you right now sort of what we're going to show you at the Analyst Day.","Spiro Dounis","Yes, and I can appreciate that. And then just on NESE, you mentioned the headlines and certainly I want to put too much emphasis on those but I guess what we're struggling with is, just given what some of the government officials have said, it just seems like some of those statements or maybe hard to walk back to get them to a point where they can improve the pipeline. So maybe just extra color on what we're not appreciating in that dynamic and to the extent that NYSE does get at the letter or may be mothball from here. Is there another regulated project out there that you can sort of fast track to get to the front of the stack? And as a replacement and then ultimately, what does that do to CapEx in '20 got I think that NESE is a big part of that right now.","Micheal Dunn","I will take that. This is Micheal. We're still confident the NESE is going to have some approvals this fall that allow us to start construction in order for us to meet that winter of 2021 timeframe and why we're confident is because of the significant emissions reduction opportunities that the project allows our customer and the customers of our customer in their service territory in Brooklyn and Long island but also the economic development impact is a very significant if this project does not get built.","And so that's why it gives us a lot of confidence that this will happen and obviously you see the headline and we have been very responsive to the regulators in regard to what their concerns were with our permitting applications that we've remedy those we believe and we do have full expectations that we will have permits in place so that we can start construction this fall.","And our teams do a great job of getting projects done on time and we certainly have developed contingency plans to accelerate construction if we get crunched on our schedule but we certainly believe we can make the December of '20 timeframe so that our customer can meet their peak load requirements that are occurring in the next winter season after this winter.","Other projects in the queue, I would just tell you we have about $3 billion of capital that we're actively working that's just on the Transco system including NESE and Regional Energy Access and the other projects that we've talked about and certainly will provide a lot more information on this at Analyst Day but we have great confidence in this $3 billion of CapEx, it's about 2.5% Bcf of capacity increase alone on the Transco system.","And these are the ones that we have very high confidence and I can tell you we're working on another couple of billion dollars capital investment just for the Transco system now that certainly out into the future, we're talking maybe a 2020-2024 timeframe as to when those projects will be in service but there is a long runway of projects just on the Transco system that we're actively working now. We have high confidence in it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein.","Jean Ann Salisbury","What if anything would cause Williams to renegotiate contracts with shippers? Are their win-win outcomes that you could see via contract extensions or new dedications?","Alan Armstrong","Sorry Jean, are you talking about gathering contracts I assume?","Jean Ann Salisbury","Yes, definitely.","Micheal Dunn","Yes. Because I wouldn't think of anything that would bring anything on the pipeline side, a very standard tariff and obviously you have to treat everybody the same on the regulated pipelines. On the gathering stuff, I would just say, we always have our eyes open to ways we can add value on that but there is really not anything we're aware of out there that would motivate us to lower any rates that are out there other than on a short-term basis to increment volumes in an area to spur drilling. But I really don't know of anything that would motivate us to lower rates from our existing rates out there other than for the increment sometimes that we do to incent drilling in the area.","Jean Ann Salisbury","And then just one more on SEM. If it does not go forward with the ultimate outcome of that from New York's perspective be more oil burning to meet demand or is there anything else out there that they've kind of proposed as an alternate solution?","Alan Armstrong","I think the only thing else we've heard is trucking LNG or bringing in propane. So I think that's the options other than more oil burning. I mean it is interesting because there is so much growth going on it surprises us I think when we realized how much real demand growth there is going and how fast the growth is going on in the Brooklyn and Bronx area there and that is what's really putting pressure on this issue is not just the conversion but as well the growth that's going on there.","So it's pretty overwhelming as we studied it, what's really driving the growth there. And so, as Micheal said, I think that really gives us a lot of confidence both the ability to help reduce emissions in the area, but to also there's got to be support for economic development there in a sustainable way and therefore that gives us a lot of confidence.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan.","Jeremy Tonet","I just wanted to start off with 2020 EBITDA guidance and recognize that this is something for the Analyst Day and don't want to parse your words too much here but when you talk about 2020 the headwinds you noted growth could be a bit less that year than the normal five to seven range and when you say a little bit less, Just trying to get a feeling for that is that mean growth could be zero, could it be negative or is it just below five or is there any other color that you can provide on what you mean by a little bit less there?","Alan Armstrong","Jeremy, thank you. And I'm really glad you brought that question forward because I think there might be some confusion brewing on this issue. We really, we're just trying to remind people because we do have so much growth going on across the business and particularly with this Transco rate case which again we can't lay out the details on that but we really are trying to remind people as they start to see all these positives that they don't pile that on to the level that it gets inappropriately high growth rate but we certainly expect significant growth next year.","We just want to make sure people don't get too far ahead of us and that they're taking those issues into account because people are really starting to form their model for 2020 and we just want to make sure that they're taking all these other variables into account because I think if you start piling all these positive things on top of each other, you would actually get to a pretty high growth rate, if you're not taking into account things like the Barnett in the Gulfstar step down, so that's really what we're trying to do there is just remind people to build that into our model. And so, perhaps our conservatism on that over did that a little bit but that was what we were trying to accomplish now.","Jeremy Tonet","And just want to go back a topic that's been talked about in prior calls and you guys have taken strong actions in the capital discipline side, as far as portfolio optimization is concerned do you still see opportunities to take actions there or any way to thoughts you could provide?","Alan Armstrong","Well, I would just say the thing that we've really done well and I call credit Micheal and his very engaged oversight on this is we have just been making sure that we're not putting capital out in front the growth and so we have really reign that end and so we've really made sure that any growth capital that we're investing in most of these areas comes with some either an MVC or rate increase that supports it so that we're not out on a limb building out in front of a bunch of growth and so that's the discipline and as a result of that people are not willing to make those commitments were pulling in the capital that. And so that is really what provide a lot of opportunity as well in UIO the synergies there is with the UEOM is a great example there where we had capital expansions, we were going to have to make for fractionation there.","And by doing that deal, we were able to eliminate that we also have been able to work with some of the other processors in the area and take overflow volumes rather than seeing capital being invested in the areas. So we really, and it's nice to see the whole industry really trying to bring that capital discipline across the space, because I think that makes us all healthier and so we're seeing a lot of discipline that is showing up as higher returns and better free cash flow for us here in 2020 and beyond.","Jeremy Tonet","It is good to see you guys kind of swim in their lanes there. I think that's good for the industry but I was also just curious I guess on the joint venture side or asset sale side if there are any other thoughts on potential future actions there that you guys could share?","Alan Armstrong","I would just say we are, we still see very significant opportunity along those fronts. And we're really excited. I think one of the things that we have going for us is that where our assets are, we tend to have very well-positioned assets with very strong contract behind them and very long-lived contracts behind them and as a result of that, that gives a lot of security of the cash flows that we have.","And that's exactly what the private side investor, not necessarily typical private equity but the private funds, pension funds and so forth is that's exactly what they're looking for and so we make a great joint venture partner with those folks because we're a safe, reliable and conservative minded operator. And so, we make a great partner for those folks. And so, yes to answer your question we see some pretty significant opportunity there and we are working that angle pretty hard.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research.","Alex Kania","Just a question on your thoughts around the mid pipeline sale and that was not certainly at this fall, I believe you guys had a right of first refusal on the transaction. So I'm just wondering what your thoughts were with respect to not going forward to exercise that, was it price? Were there any other benefits or something like that with respect to the leased at them, that that may have kind of made you sort of okay with not exercising that option, just curious.","Alan Armstrong","Yes, I mean part of it certainly was price. If you look at the cash flow relative to the price paid and kind of ignore the structuring around that, it's pretty low return and so that was certainly a piece of it and then there was some consideration that we received in exchange for that and we're not going to discuss the details of that. So we certainly took a look at it but it just didn't make sense really for our given our other investment opportunities that we have. It really just been stack up against our other investment opportunities.","John Chandler","This is John Chandler, if you think about that in many ways would be something like debt on our books and we're paying lease payments against that meet interest. We looked at that long and hard to actually buy that interest in what we would have incurred an additional $400 million in debt. Basically, to do that and that's taking our leverage the wrong way. So our leverage focus came into play in that decision as well.","Alex Kania","Just again respecting that you can't really say much on the settlement. Just I'm thinking about how the accounting and then necessarily would work when you're able to give more details on that. Would it end up you recognizing kind of revenue for this year and with that already be included in the guidance that you've reaffirmed or would that be kind of another variable that that might affect that going into the end of the year.","Alan Armstrong","Yes. It's a great question. I would just say that our performance or our guidance certainly takes in that into account and it's just one of those things that just like we've seen the negative impact of low cycle NGL margins is one of those things that offsets that - the beauty of having a big diversified business to be able to see some positives and some negatives during the year. So, but it definitely is considered as we think about the guidance affirmation for the year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo.","Praneeth Satish","I just have one question I guess one of your large utility customers is proposed a large offshore wind farm near Virginia. So I'm just curious how you think about renewables in general and then whether you've thought about investing jointly in these type of projects?","Alan Armstrong","It's good question. I would just say we have so much investment opportunity already that are at higher returns than what we've seen of - then realized in those projects that given our continued focus on balance sheet as well as the higher return investment opportunities that we have that just wouldn't make sense right now and obviously there is always learnings when you venture into something new and we think there's risk obviously associated with that and bottom line is sticking to our knitting right now we think is going to add a lot of value and is the right approach for us.","Having said that, there are things like our right of ways and things like that that can be very valuable when it comes to renewables but we are very convinced after studying this issue a lot that the natural gas generation that has to go along with the renewables effort is going to continue to be a big driver of growth for us and it is showing up in very real ways in terms of RFPs and negotiations with customers even beyond the visibility that we provided to date on that. And so until that word in or we can start to see that starting and I just don't think we've got capital or risk appetite to venture into something new given the opportunities in front of us today.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.","Craig Shere","If the 2020 strip remains below 250 and Cabot another customer moved maintenance only investment, would it be reasonable to use the third quarter, Northeast G&P run rate as a steady-state level?","Alan Armstrong","I don't really think so just because there is some MVCs and so forth that are getting built into some of the capital it's going in right now. So I really don't think that would be a real good assumption, it is a good question but I don't think-- it's certainly might be for certain areas as we get towards the end of the year here. I mean we have already seeing volumes obviously here in the fourth quarter that show us continued growth.","So on an actual basis here so I don't know that would be a very fair assessment given what we're seeing here in October and then there is other areas that like in the Bradford where we have real capital but it is going into place in the cost of service will step up as a result of that. So good question, but I would tell you right now I kind of doubt that would be the case.","Craig Shere","And one last question, apologies if I missed it, it looks like some good clarification about the impact of the Barnett MVC step down in the third quarter, was there any specific figures around the Gulfstar One deferred revenue recognition in fact as we head into 2020?","John Chandler","This is John Chandler. As you think about 2020, actually there is a small additional, Barnett step that I think about it this year. We've had two quarters of higher levels of deferred revenue that step down in the third quarter, so we have about $20 million to $30 million of additional step down in the Barnett amortization next year just because you've got four quarters of that step down in 2020. And in addition somewhere around that $70 million to $80 million of up around $7 million step down in the at Gulfstar amortization. As we come out at the end of the exclusivity period that for that platform.","Craig Shere","And is that 70 plus million for Gulfstar in 2020 does that impact the full year or does some of that.","John Chandler","That's a full year number because that exclusivity period in the November the last payments of this year.","Operator","Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS.","Shneur Gershuni","One of my questions have been asked and answered but I was wondering if we could just circle back a little bit on the rate case, a little bit. First, just to confirm, one of the comments you made in the prepared remarks that we can't really on any of the reserve adjustments, should we just think of it is, it's an accounting movement from a reserve to the income statement and it's just a journaling entry and that really has no tell about what is going on with the rate case, is that an accurate reflection?","Alan Armstrong","Yes I mean obviously if you think about the way that works, we have to record our best available information that come through in that but the rate case has a lot of complex issues to be dealt with and I would just say that not all of those are reflected in that change that you saw. And so that's why I know everybody wants to jump ahead, we would rather have not had to show anything on that honestly but from an accounting rule standpoint, we have too but it is not the whole picture and we look forward to be able to share that whole picture there.","Shneur Gershuni","And I realize you can't sort of talk about the case itself. But I was wondering if you can talk about the back and forth between you and the counterparties in the negotiations, do you feel that both sides concluded that they got some of what they wanted?","Micheal Dunn","Yes, this is Micheal. I would say it was actually a very good negotiation with our shippers as we always have with the Transco organization and we have a great relationship there with the shippers and the regulators over those customers as well. And there is always contentious issue that somebody wants to make sure that they have success on and I would say both sides walked away from that pleased with the outcome.","And we are happy to get it behind us and able to go through the litigation of the of the rate case and so there's always some issue that it can be contentious. But I think both sides dealt with it very professionally.","Shneur Gershuni","And then one final question, I know there's been a lot of back and forth about NESE and when it comes to the regulators and so forth but in a scenario where NESE is delayed longer and you have to move the in-service date by at least a year let's say, do you see an opportunity to potentially deploy kind of the budgeted CapEx towards buybacks, do you feel that's an option or an arrow in the quiver at this point that you can, potentially use just given where your stock is trading at?","Alan Armstrong","Yes, I would just say that first of all, we remain confident on that. And so really don't see that as something that we'd be looking at the trade up. I think as we get further out and we get below down to the credit metrics that we want to, I definitely think that will be on the table as a debate but right now the I know that we see a big hole in our capital coming up just because while there might be little changes here and there in the grander scheme of things, I don't really see a big change come in there and any anything that would present itself here in the very near term as a surprise, excess cash available would just go out and be to taken the credit metric down very quickly.","Operator","Our next question comes from Derek Walker with Bank of America Securities.","Derek Walker","Just a quick, just a quick one on the leverage and I believe you said you're expecting to hit kind of four five by the end of the year. And there is a long-term target of the four two number. Can you just talk about, I think you said you're evaluating some opportunistic transactions to improve leverage metrics further, is that what's needed to hit the four two or is that mostly just coming from an EBITDA ramp and are you still looking to make transaction to go below that four two number?","Alan Armstrong","Great question. Well, certainly the path we're on gets us to the four two. It's a question of, if there is additional value added transactions that we could do in other words that would add value to the equity side as well rather than just taking down the debt and so some of the transactions that we've done to date, we think a very valuable to shareholders where we've been able to sell assets at 14 to 15 times and redeploy that capital into higher return investment opportunities.","And so we think as long as that continues to be available to us so that's really good value for our shareholders and we'll continue to pursue that, but the first thing we would do, it's just a matter of how fast we get there, really the first thing we would do with excess cash would be to take it down four two.","And I'll just remind you in terms of the '19, we are already below the four five here for or '19 and so we're making great progress towards that. But it really just a question of rate or acceleration of that goal. But we certainly are on that trajectory is just that it's a big number and we can move it a lot quicker, if we were to do some transaction.","Derek Walker","And maybe just one on the operational side, I believe you just commissioned the Keenesburg one facility processing facility. I think as capacity of 225, can just talk about the utilization on that plant and I believe you are also targeting second Keenesburg plan in '21. And you mentioned sort of the step down a CapEx for next year. Can you talk about how you're thinking about that that like a plan as well?","Micheal Dunn","This is Micheal. I will take the question on the Keansburg plant. We commission that on time and on budget. Our team did a great job following up our Fort Lupton plant $200 million a day plant that we commissioned back in April. And we're able to balance volumes between those two plants and right now we're doing so and catching a lot of additional volume from spillover customers that have other arrangements and aren't being met with our competitor peer group in the DJ Basin and so we're actually tracking a lot of additional business there.","Our Fort Lupton plant was at full capacity already and our Keansburg plant was at about 50% capacity pretty darn quick there and right now we're balancing between those two plants based on deliverability of NGLs off the plants as well as residue gas. So pretty good load factor on both those plants right now considering just came online this year.","Operator","Thank you, everyone. This concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Alan Armstrong for closing remarks.","Alan Armstrong","Okay. Well, great, thank you all for the really good questions. And we really look forward to sharing the growth that we've got ahead of us within the Analyst Day. So we look forward to seeing you there. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you, everyone, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect."]}}
