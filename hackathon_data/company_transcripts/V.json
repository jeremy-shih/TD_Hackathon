All participants are in listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Jenny. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa, Inc.\u2019s fiscal third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s call have been posted to our IR website.","Let me also remind you this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s website and in the Investor Relations section of Visa\u2019s website.","For historical non-GAAP pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today\u2019s press release.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Al.","Al Kelly","Jack, thank you, and good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us today. We had another strong quarter of business results much like the first half of our fiscal year we saw a consistently solid trends in our operating metrics with very good growth in payments volume, process transactions and cross border revenue.","Our global business benefitted from an overall healthy economy as payments volume grew in every major region. In the United States we saw strong consumer confidence continue to drive spending growth.","After three quarters here at Visa, I\u2019m quite pleased with our business progress and our high level of execution. It\u2019s a real testimony to our talented and dedicated employees around the world for creating a strong culture focussed on leadership development, operational excellence and driving results.","As I move to the highlights of the quarter, I do want to thank everybody for joining us at our recent Investor Day both in person and via the webcast. As the leadership team we enjoyed the opportunity to meet and spend time with our shareholders and the financial community. We hope that you find the information and discussions to be useful. We were pleased to have received quite positive and helpful feedback from the event, given the fact that we did provide a significant amount of information just a couple of weeks ago my prepared remarks today will be relatively brief.","In Q3 our business continued to perform well against our operating plan and our strategic priorities for the year. We saw healthy growth in our key metrics for payments, volume and process transaction. Payment volume was solid across all five regions. Growth was particularly strong in India, the United States, Russia, Mexico and Australia.","China payments volume growth remained low in the quarter driven by the dual currency, dual badged card run-off. But I should note that China\u2019s cross border volumes growth continued to be strong. This was reflective of the overall trend as cross border growth was robust around the globe. In addition to China, Latin America, the U.S. Japan, Russia and parts of Europe were among the areas of real strength. Looking closer at process transactions growth was driven by Asia Pacific, Europe and the North America regions.","Client incentives came in lower than expected primarily driven by timing delays and variances relative to our European clients. This translated to financial performance ahead of our expectations for the quarter as we grew both net revenue and EPS by 26% versus last year\u2019s comparable results. Vasant will go into greater financial detail and cover some of the normalized comparisons to last year.","As we mentioned during Investor Day the integration of our European business is progressing well and is on track. More specific to the technology side of the integration we are focussed on migrating the European systems to our global authorisation clearing and settlement system as well as deploying our global data platform and other corporate systems into Europe.","We are well underway in that effort and we have just completed the upgrade of our U.K. data center is on schedule. We expect that client migrations to the new systems will begin by the end of full year 2018.","In moving our European clients to VisaNet we confirm pride enhanced network capabilities greater scale, resilience and additional levels of cyber security that will benefit our clients and certainly be more efficient in the long term.","We are also making significant progress in strengthening our partnerships and building digital capabilities to drive growth. Earlier this week, we extended our partnership with PayPal to include Europe. We were already collaborating with them in the United States and Asia Pacific to provide a better online experience and this now extends the benefits to European consumers and businesses.","Additionally, they have joined the Visa network of clients, financial institutions and will be able to offer Visa accounts in Europe enabling consumers in businesses to use their PayPal funds to spend wherever Visa is accepted. The partnership makes it easier for financial institutions to offer their Visa account holders the ability to check out anywhere PayPal is accepted online by offering greater consumer choice.","We also announced a strategic investment and planned partnership with Klarna, one of Europe\u2019s leading payment providers. Our planned investment is part of the global strategy to open up our ecosystem and support a broad range of new partners or helping to redefine and enhance the purchase experience for consumers online and in mobile environment.","Klarna develops products that address changing consumer preferences giving them the flexibility and seamless experience that they expect and hope for when shopping online.","In June, we signed 13 new partners to participate in our token service provider program in all major regions. With the expected increase in digital payments embedded in a growing number of devices we continue to build out a global network of partners to offer secure, digital payment token services in creating a more secure commerce platform.","We launched the Visa Ready Program for Business Solutions. This is a strategic framework in solidification [ph] program to help technology companies that integrate with our B2B payment services to ensure that they meet standards and are market ready.","Five initial partners in the U.S. have become Visa Ready as this program will help accelerate growth and enable new used cased for B2B payments.","Turning to the international markets, let me first make a couple of comments on China. Yesterday we filed an application with the People\u2019s Bank of China in order to participate in the China domestic market as a bank card clearing institution. China is one of the world\u2019s fastest growing payments markets and is leading the way in payments innovation. Our commitment to this market is long term. We look forward to bringing our capabilities to the industry by stepping up our engagement with all the ecosystem partners to open a constructive collaboration aiming to create added value and introduce innovative products as well as reliable and safe payment experiences for Chinese consumers.","We expect that the PDOC will consider our application inline with the publicly released measures and guidelines for PCCI applicants. India represents a large opportunity and we provided some thoughts during Investor Day on how we are approaching the market. We are seeing steady progress with digital payments despite the recent remonetisation of cash, currency and circulation is stabilizing as remonetisation comes to an end.","The transition to the digital economy has been broad based across several categories including everyday spend and suggests wide societal participation. This past quarter we saw payments volume increase over 80% and process transactions more than double versus last year.","In a couple of weeks I\u2019ll be in India for the first time since joining Visa and I look forward to seeing firsthand the opportunity that we have in meeting with local partners, officials and our team mates in India.","Once again we delivered on our commitment to drive value for our shareholders in the quarter in maintaining a prudent capital allocation plan. We invested in support of the growth in our core business through capital spending and expenses. In fiscal Q3, we returned approximately $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders consisting of $1.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly $400 million through dividends. We continue to accelerate our share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction.","In closing, we continue to see strong momentum in the business and we are excited about the long term growth prospects to Visa. As we highlighted during Investor Day there is a significant opportunity to displace cash and cheque of $17 trillion in front of us. We will continue to focus on partnering strategically and driving digital innovation to substantially grow our business into the future.","With that, let me now turn the call over to Vasant for some more on the financials.","Vasant Prabhu","Thank you, Al. Business momentum stayed strong globally through our third quarter. Net revenue and EPS once again exceeded our expectations. Fiscal third quarter net revenue of $4.6 million was up 26%.","Net income for the quarter was $2.1 billion or $0.86 per share. Adjusting last year\u2019s results were several special items related to the acquisition of Visa Europe, both net income and EPS were up 26%.","Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted net revenue growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points and EPS by approximately 2 percentage points. A few points to note, global growth rates and payment volumes processed transactions and cross border volumes remain strong and stable. Exchange rate headwinds moderated, though currency volatilities remained below the long term mean.","Timing of client incentives added almost $0.02 to third quarter results due to delays primarily in Europe, more on this later. We brought back 17.8 million shares of Class A common stock for $1.7 billion in the third quarter at an average price of $93.82. Year-to-date in fiscal 2017 we\u2019ve bought back 59.2 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $86.82 per share.","A quick review of our key business drivers in the third quarter. U.S. payments volume grew 12% with credit growing 19% and debit 5%. The slowdown in credit growth from the prior quarter reflects the start of COFCO and U.S. AA Credit conversion in the third quarter of fiscal 2016.","Excluding Interlink, debit grew 9%. Declining gas prices negatively impacted payment volume by half a point. Adjusted for conversion and gas prices, underlying credit and debit growth rates have been stable all year.","As reported, international payment volume grew 72% in constant dollars. On a comparable and normalized basis, robust payment volume growth continued across the globe. Asia sustained double digit growth rate excluding China. Domestic payment volume growth in China was impacted by the decline in active dual branded cards.","Strong growth was sustained across EMEA and Latin America business picked up modestly. In Europe, excluding core batch payment volumes growth was 9% with strength across most markets.","ON a constant dollar basis, cross border volumes grew 147% driven by the inclusion of Europe. Adding Europe to prior results, constant dollar cross border growth was up over 11%. Through the quarter the dollar weakened and the pound strengthened moderately. Despite these shifts outbound commerce from the U.S. and inbound commerce into the U.K. remained very strong.","U.S. cross border growth accelerated in the third quarter largely driven by out-bound commerce. The cross international markets particularly strong corridors were inbound into Canada, Japan and Australia and outbound from Latin America the Middle East, South and Southeast Asia.","Reported cross border volume growth rates were negatively impacted by over three percentage points by an e-commerce payments platform shifting acquiring of U.K. cardholder volume to the U.K. from another yield location.","While this shift impacted our reported cross border growth rates, it has a minor effect on revenue since this is an intra EU move the platform made to optimize the European business. As reported, process transactions grew 44% due to the inclusion of Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis which includes Europe in prior results global process transactions grew 13%.","U.S. growth rates were stable, international growth rates were helped by India and some new business in Europe. India process transaction growth stayed above 100%. Through July 14, U.S. payment volumes are up 10%, global constant dollar across border volumes grew 12%, and process transaction growth was 14%.","A brief review of fiscal third quarter financial results. With strong momentum in the key business drivers and helped by some moderation in exchange rate headwinds, growth rates on all key revenue lines stepped up in Q3. Service revenues grew 19%, data processing revenues grew 29%, international revenues grew 45% even as currency volatility stayed below the long term mean","As I mentioned earlier, client incentives came in lower than expected and added almost $0.02 to the third quarter EPS. This was primarily due to delays in Europe. We are making good progress in resetting our commercial terms for key clients post removal of rebids [ph]. We are pushing hard to get most of the deals we want it done before the end of this fiscal year.","Our current expectation is we will get 75% to 80% of the way there by September. At this point, we expect the remaining 20% to 25% to shift into fiscal 2018 largely due to client preferences and time tables. This shift in Europe is the primary reason why we now expect client incentive as a percent of gross revenues to come in below the low end of our original outlook range of 20.5% to 21.5%.","After adjusting for various special items in last year\u2019s results, expenses grew 31%. As expected expense growth ramped up from the first half levels as we stepped up technology as well as Europe integration spending.","Our tax rate was 29.3% driven by the geographic mix of our global learning and the benefits of the legal entity re-organization we completed last quarter. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, it\u2019s important to remind you of three events that occurred in June 2016 which will significantly impact our reported growth rates on key metrics going forward.","First and foremost and the most important is the closing of the Visa Europe transaction. Starting with the fourth quarter, reported growth rates will include Visa Europe and all prior year numbers. Second is the COFCO conversion.","Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 our U.S. credit growth rates will include COFCO in prior year numbers. In addition, the U.S. AA Credit conversion was completed in September and the debit conversion was finished by October last year.","Third is the 2016 Brexit vote followed by sharp declines in the Pound and later the Euro. This will reduce the exchange rate drag we have experienced so far this year. This also drove the sharp increase of cross border commerce into the U.K. Also of note, the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 was the first time cross border growth rates globally hit double digits in almost three years. Starting in the fourth quarter we will begin to lap the global cross border recovery.","We have factored all this into our updated outlook for the year. We are raising nominal net revenue growth expectations for the year to approximately 20%. This is a result of the strong growth we have reported to date, lower client incentives at 20% to 20.5% of gross revenues and moderation in the exchange rate drag to approximately 2 percentage points.","With higher revenue growth we are also raising a nominal adjusted EPS growth outlook to approximately 20% with a 2.5 percentage point exchange rate drag. Included in this outlook is a reduction in European integration cost of $60 million. Margin and tax rate expectation remain unchanged.","Finally, a couple of updates on cash and debt. We returned more cash to the U.S. in the third quarter. Year-to-date we have returned approximately $4 billion back to the U.S. As you know in December 2016 we issued $16 billion of debt. The first tranche of this debt $1.7 billion matures in December this year.","Between Labor Day and December, we plan to access debt markets to refinance maturing debt and an additional amount to fund the completion of stock buybacks that neutralize the impact of stock issued in connection with the Visa Europe acquisition.","Before I finish, I have one more topic. A couple of weeks back, Jack informed me of his intention to retire at the end of this year. On behalf of Visa\u2019s management I want to thank Jack for his decade of contributions to Visa. As most of you know Jack was Visa\u2019s first IR leader as the public company. Jack built our investor relations department from the ground up establishing and nurturing relationships with all of you over the years and he has been a key advocate for Visa.","We [Indiscernible] which he tells me may include running the town chairlift and Park city next winter. Not surprisingly he has picked November 30th as his last day. I guess he does not want to miss a single day skiing. With that, let me turn this back to Jack.","Jack Carsky","Thanks Vasant. And before we start the Q&A, let me just add to Vasant\u2019s very nice comments there. It\u2019s been a real honor and privilege working for this organization and the people in it for the last 10 years. But it\u2019s always good to go out on top. I\u2019d known a lot of you for as ten years and some of you for as many as 20. And it\u2019s been a great ride and I really enjoy the interactions with each and every one of you. And so with that, Jenny we are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Your line is open.","Bob Napoli","Jack I know that Visa stock has gone up too much and you are too rich, so it\u2019s not a big surprise here, so I hope to take the ski lift that you\u2019ll be running. But....","Jack Carsky","[Indiscernible] he doesn\u2019t need a lift.","Bob Napoli","No it\u2019s great, congratulations. But just, I guess I mean the numbers have been very good obviously to Investor Day I think the company seem pretty upbeat. I just wanted if there is a way that as you look at your numbers if you can split out the growth and tell has there been acceleration in the secular shift away from cash and cheques to electronic payments. I know there\u2019s a lot going on with market share in COFCO and different things, but I just wanted if you look at that, if there is a way if you think there\u2019s been in some acceleration in secular trends.","Al Kelly","Yes, if you \u2013 I think as I said in my comments if you start to take out the conversions and adjust for gas prices and volatile things like that, the underlying trend of credit growth in the U.S. for the last three quarters has been very steady and stable in the high single-digit, and debt growth have also been very steady and stable.","If you look at our payments volumes through the first three quarters of this year, again strong and stable. We have been converting cash to digital at a pretty hefty clip for the past five years and I would said there is no \u2013 there\u2019s really no change in that trend. Global economies recovering have clearly helped of this year, so if you remember on Investor Day we talked about PCE penetration and PCE growth, the PCE growth component certainly has been helpful. And then the last thing of course is the recovery on the cross-border side. And Al I don\u2019t know if you want to add.","Al Kelly","Now I think the other aspect -- all what Vasant said is obviously correct. I think that while we\u2019ve seen a real adoption of digital we\u2019re still in the early innings. And I think that, as we pointed out in Investor Day when we get into E&M commerce we neutralize our largest competitor which is cash, and I think that's going to continue to be a real engine of growth for us as we look ahead.","Bob Napoli","Great. Thank you. Appreciate it.","Al Kelly","Thanks, Bob.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Moshe Katri from Wedbush Securities. Your line is open.","Moshe Katri","Hey, thanks. So another quarter of very strong results internationally. It seems that Visa Europe has been exceeding at least our expectations to almost every quarter since the transaction kind of took place. Is there any way to kind of get us some color in terms of where you seeing the upside coming from versus original expectations? And then, on top of that I think you've indicated that the yields from renewing some of that book of business has been better than expected, maybe some more color on that as well. Thank you.","Al Kelly","I think we\u2019ve been very pleased with Europe on a number of fronts, and especially given the fact that there's been a fair amount of disruption for the people who work in that business between the integration as well as the regulatory requirement to split scheme and processing in the marketplace. Our employees have remained incredibly resilient. And I think in general the European economy has been frankly better than we thought.","As you know where our largest presence by quite a large measure is in the UK and the UK is held up well and as Vasant said in his remarks, benefited -- benefited from the lower value of the pound driving lots of inbound traffic into the UK, that certainly has helped. And when we look around the rest of Europe, our largest presences are in France and Spain which have also held up well. And then we\u2019re seeing countries like the Nordics continue to do well.","In terms of the yield side of it we\u2019re still working our way through redoing of these contracts, as both of us alluded to in our remarks, its just a bit more of a slog to get there than we might have thought or hoped in the in the first place. But we are making good progress. I think we\u2019ll continue to make good progress as we proceed through into the fourth quarter and to the degree that we've got good incentives built in place and we\u2019re getting good volume growth, all boats rise, which is a good thing for everybody.","Moshe Katri","And Vasant indicated -- pointed to some new business in Europe? Is there anything substantial there?","Vasant Prabhu","No. I had said that on the process transaction side, yes, we\u2019ve been saying for a couple of quarters that we had some gains in Europe on the process transaction side. But overall as Al said, I mean, we\u2019re very pleased with the way the \u2013 the vast majority of our business in Europe is under contract, and we have been for a certain portion of that working with clients to reset commercial terms once rebates went away and that's gone well longer than we would have liked, but it's going well.","So, on all fronts Europe has done, as we\u2019ve said before equal to or better than we expected. And from an accretion standpoint certainly has been performing better than we expected and we\u2019ll give you a little more about that once we are through with the year and can give you a full sense of the year.","Moshe Katri","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Jim Schneider","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and good luck to you Jack in your future endeavors. I guess, my question really comes down to the cross-border, obviously the volume is holding in there, but at least by our calculations it looks like the cross-border yield improved somewhat. So, can you maybe give us a sense of whether that's correct and if so what drove it? Was it regional mix? Was there some pricing impact or was it one of wins you just referred to?","Al Kelly","No. I don't think you should conclude that there was an improvement in yield necessarily. I mean, clearly from quarter to quarter there are some changes in mix and so on. Some of it could be as you see the exchange rate had been moderating a bit certainly that helps our reported cross-border dollar numbers. But there was nothing -- there was no real change that would drive a big change in yields in the cross-border business.","Jim Schneider","And maybe you could also just kind of address the incentive levels and you talked about being almost 80% of the way there by the time you finish this fiscal year. Can you maybe just address directionally where those incentive levels would go in terms of normalizing as we headed into 2018?","Al Kelly","Yes. We\u2019ll talk about that when we talk about 2018. We\u2019re not \u2013 I mean, if your question was what\u2019s the likely range of incentives or the percent of gross revenues and all that next year. I think we can get into all that when we talk about 2018, so its little too early to talk about all that right now.","I think all we were signaling was that there is going to be some shift in Europe of incentives from what we thought we would get done this year into next year. And I want to emphasize that is driven more by client preferences and timetables and their desire to do things on a certain timetable than ours, and we\u2019re adapting to their requirements.","Jim Schneider","Fair enough. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thank you, Jack. Congrats my friend. It\u2019s been fun. I guess a question I don\u2019t want to ask \u2013 should I think which one to ask. Okay. So, the -- maybe just the change in guidance. Can you just walk us through the change in guidance? How much of it is incentives versus some other factors. And the change to the incentive outlook, is at all timing or do you anticipate paying little bit less than what you previously forecast?","Al Kelly","Well, there\u2019s a little bit of let's call it better than expected execution, a little bit of it in Europe, but you should think of it as almost all timing and almost all Europe. So that's one contributor. The three factors that went into sort of the change in the outlook is the performance we\u2019ve had to-date, some moderation in the exchange rate headwind, some reduction in the original expectation on incentive. And on the EPS side it reflects the benefits we\u2019re getting from the tax rate we now have which we talked about last quarter, as well as the revenue being stronger than we had thought at the beginning of the year. So, there's no \u2013 there\u2019s nothing unusual other than the actual results and the trends we\u2019re seeing.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Got it. Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Ramsey El-Assal","Hi, guys and congratulations Jack, we\u2019re going to miss your special sense of humor. I was -- I had a follow-up question also on incentives kind going on Tien-Tsin question which is simply that as we sort of \u2013 as incentives -- the expected level kind of get pushed out, does it increase the chances of sort of incremental volatility and outline? Will there be a quarter coming up where we get a sort of a snapback there and it catches folks by surprise or should you do just they sort of push out and imply kind of a gradual slope?","Jack Carsky","Again, I\u2019d just remind everybody that this -- there are at least three factors that go into this that make this somewhat difficult to predict. And I think we\u2019ve shown how difficult it is to predict, because we haven\u2019t hit the number in the last couple quarters, but it\u2019s the -- when is the deal going to actually come to pass? What are going to be the terms of the deal as you actually get in to the last bits of negotiation?","And then, what actually volumes are you going to get against those negotiated terms. So, the reality is, in this particular case it just that the period of time to get through over a 100 client contract is just taking longer than we thought. I don't think we want to get into predicting business or forecasting business or what it would look like quarter by quarter, but I think this is just simply a matter of a process that we have to get through and as Vasant said we\u2019re hoping to get through at about 80% of it by the end of the fiscal year.","Vasant Prabhu","And as we\u2019ve told you before, I mean, its not something we think should be focused on to the extent it is on a quarter by quarter basis. And as you know we explicitly don't try to get deals done based on quarterly timetables and so on. So the short answer to your question is that a snapback kind of thing? No. But is there likely to be a quarter where incentives run higher than we might have expected. Of course, I means just as they\u2019ve run lower than we expected in some quarters and some quarters they could run higher than we expected. But that isn\u2019t any snapback kind of reasons that you should expect. We typically look ahead and give you our better sense of what might get done in the quarter coming up.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Vasant Prabhu","Thanks, Ramsey.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","Nice guys. Just first of all, Jack, congrats again. We\u2019ll catch up soon, but we\u2019re going to miss obviously. Just on the higher level now, if you can just touch again, I mean on the pricing environment a bit more you know again you commented on yields coming in better in Europe since the deal, and we've seen a number of years were obviously incentives and rebates have been higher both as a percentage of gross revenues on a year-to-year basis.","It feels like at some point on the gross yield side it's going higher, but the rebate side is keeping up pace to some extent that you would see a bit of a divergence between the two. I mean, is there anything you can comment on conceptually and what you're seeing in your conversations with clients? Has there been more of a realization that the value add you guys provide has reached the level where pricing is at a point where we don't need to keep providing higher and higher incentives and rebates. This is about the right points. Just a little more color on that would be great?","And then just a quick comment on Q4, I know you're saying some of the Europeans stuff is pushed and there\u2019s been a lot of questions on incentives, but it looks like calculating what you're guiding would be about $200 million sequential increasing in your incentive and rebate line, which is kind of lot. I mean it just hard to envision why that would all be in one quarter unless there\u2019s I think someone else has other things going on. So that\u2019s really just the thought of the question. Thanks guys.","Al Kelly","One the first question Darrin, when you look at the overall numbers, it's a result of hundreds of deals around the world, and they all take on different flavors. I think in general people bet many of our clients and a testament to that is the longevity of many of our relationships that are very deep and have lasted decades that people value plenty of aspects what Visa brings to the table from our global scale to our risk and fraud prevention tools to our brand et cetera.","That said, all of that stuff is valued when it comes to negotiation people negotiate a card as do we and you end up, everybody ends up, compromising and end up in a certain place. But I think I haven't seen nor as I\u2019ve talked to our clients around the world, any view that the value that we\u2019re bringing into the table is any less than it's been in fact. I think as we move into a digital world and we continue to try to be a leader in terms of thinking about digital tools and solutions that I think that many issuers particularly when you get beyond the very top issuers who also had the funds and wherewithal to be investing in some of these kinds of capabilities that are -- what we bring to the table is very valued. Vasant, you want to add to that.","Vasant Prabhu","The only thing was that there was a specific question on why client incentive if you derived the fourth quarter might look the way they do. I would say a couple of things. There is the fiscal fourth quarter effect to some degree in that. We have been talking to people especially in Europe for several months now in and it back and forth on finalizing agreements and the documentation and so on and there\u2019s a fair amount of that is happening in the fourth quarter and as we get it done in the fourth quarter since these discussions have been underway for a few months.","As happens in many cases the incentives you pay reflect when the deal was either agreed to or initially discuss. So there\u2019s an element of retro-attractiveness to it all of which is captured in the incentives you would probably recognize in the fourth quarter. So some elements of all that that flow into it, and then as Al said, I mean, we have fairly rigorous process and we do the best we can to give you the best sense, but in the end we won't sign a deal because quarterly deadline is approaching, but we\u2019ll do our very best to get done everything we are setting out to do right now.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Darrin. Next question.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is open.","Craig Maurer","Hi. Jack, it\u2019s been pleasure over the better part of 15 years, hopefully we can meet up in Tahoe one day. Regarding the business can you first comment on what your success rate has been in Asia and China specifically in converting dual brand cards into a single brand companion card for cross-border? And secondly, was there any benefit in service fees from the restructuring of contracts around the breakup of scheme and processing in Europe? Thanks.","Vasant Prabhu","On service fees in Europe really sort of it\u2019s \u2013 the breakup of scheme and processing. We\u2019ll se over time what the impact is. But in the short run it really has no impact on the fee structure that was in place. But it will evolve over time, I\u2019m sure. In China you know\u2026","Al Kelly","I think in China we have I think we have 55 banks and 42 of them only issue the single branded card. The remaining 14, 13 do the dual branded. We\u2019ve had some success, frankly not as good as we would like it be and its going to continue to be a real focus of ours and something that given the importance of the cross-border volume from China something that we\u2019re working closely with the banks on. I\u2019m going be in India and China in three weeks and that is something that I will be talking to both our team there as well as our Chinese client.","Vasant Prabhu","Yes. Just in terms of the trend in that business over the last couple of quarters we highlighted issue last quarter. I want you to know as we said earlier that if you adjust for China, Asia was growing double-digit. The domestic dual branded card volumes in China were relatively stable quarter to quarter, so we didn\u2019t see a sequential decline. And the cross-border business coming out of China as Al said in his comments has been strong and stable. How it all plays out in the next few months, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.","Craig Maurer","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you and congratulation Jack, it\u2019s bittersweet. I guess I have another question on incentives and specific to Europe through the commercialization of the contract there, understanding there some -- the timing-related impacts that are causing lower incentives this year. Are there any specific pricing impact as well that happen in conjunction with the commercialization of those contracts? Or should we expect those to sort of happen at the same time? Thanks.","Al Kelly","We made -- in the year that we've owned Visa Europe. We have made a few pricing changes and there are number pricing changes that we\u2019re continuing to look at it in addition to obviously the commercialization of as you said of the contracts to do away with rebates and put incentives in place.","Sanjay Sakhrani","But do those happen at the same time at points like when you renew them and put in new incentive agreements. Does that come with the revised price schedule?","Al Kelly","So the price schedule as you know we have our price schedule and then the incentives then are tailored by client. So when we make price adjustments we make them for the system as a whole typically and then the commercial \u2013 the commercialization of some of these contracts is something we do client by client. And just to emphasize, I mean the vast majority of our business in Europe has been and remains under contract. This is something we\u2019re doing ourselves proactively to adjust some of the terms in the contracts to make them more commercial in a world where rebates no longer existed. But the pricing itself is that's related to our normal course what we call rack rates or list prices or whatever you want to call it.","Jack Carsky","Okay. Thanks Sanjay. Next question.","Operator","Yes. Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. And Jack, I can only say one thing, jealous but congratulations. Well deserved, I'm sure. A lot was said at the Analyst Day around Visa Direct, and I wanted to just kind of hone in on the partnership you have now with PayPal, this collaboration you guys are doing. I guess one is are those cards -- the debit cards that are going to be issued, are you going to actually route those through Visa Direct? And then secondly, do you think that, that partnership will help insulate you guys from some of the risks associated with PSD2? Thanks.","Jack Carsky","Well, first of all we\u2019re very pleased to extent our deals that we have with PayPal in North America and Asia into Europe. And particularly the fact that we\u2019re operating full consumer choice, and obviously part of the deal is the ability to use Visa Direct to push PayPal account balance to bank accounts. And it's a fairly extensive deal because there\u2019s also an enablement of Visa Checkout relative to the Braintree Gateway.","And in Europe in particular given the fact that PayPal has a banking license we\u2019re obviously licensing them as a full-fledged issuer where they'll issue PayPal\u2019s debit cards in Europe. So it's an extensive agreement that absolutely covers Visa Direct, but it also covers the very important aspect of the prior deals centered around full consumer choice as well as then working closely with us in enabling Visa Checkout as well.","Dan Perlin","And do you think that helps in that partnership to protect you guys from PSD2 as that regulation rolls within 2018?","Al Kelly","I think that everywhere that we can further embed a Visa card into the payment stream and build the loyalty of the consumer certainly helps us. I mean, I think that at the end of the day PSD2 is going to generate a requirement that everybody focuses really hard on consumers and trying to make sure that they're providing the best possible consumer value propositions and the best possible consumer experiences. So to the degree that we could help further solidify the relationship that our issuers have with their customers, all that can only go to help fortify the issuers against the against PSD2 and the competition that can come from their accounts happening to be opened.","Dan Perlin","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane from Deutsche. Your line is open.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Wanted to just ask what percentage of the European contracts are done today? I know you said 75% to 80% is the goal for the end of the year, but just looking for a mark for today. And then secondly at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition I think the deal was to be EPS accretive in low single digits for fiscal year 2017 and then high single-digit percentage points range by fiscal year 2020. There\u2019s been a lot of moving pieces here. I'm just looking for an update now on if those goals will stand?","Al Kelly","Well, the question number one, Bryan, and I\u2019ll let Vasant answer question number two. We don\u2019t want to get into a daily tally sheet on this, but again we\u2019re not probably going to disappoint by not quantifying exactly where we are, but I think you can assume that we\u2019re somewhere below 80, but above a fairly decent number since that we are confident in being able to say we think we can get to 80% by the end of the fourth quarter, but we don't really want to get into setting a precedent of providing that kind of update. Vasant, in term of accretion.","Vasant Prabhu","Yes. In terms of accretion as you all know, volumes, European economies have been stronger than we expected, so our volumes as you\u2019ve seen have been running better than we might have expected at the beginning of the year. All when we did the acquisition model that valued Visa Europe. Certainly the weak pound and the euro have helped the cross-border business, frankly the weak pound has caused a massive amount of cross-border into the UK.","In addition to that you know that we have taken some pricing and our yields have run a little better than we expected. And so far things are well in terms of renewals and retaining contracts and business and so on. So when you put it all together clearly Visa Europe is doing better than we expected this year and accretion is running ahead of the low single-digits we have told you. But the year isn't over yet, so we\u2019ll till the end of the year and give you an update in October as to whether accretion was in the first year and whether we have a different perspective on the longer term outlook on accretion. But its early days and things are going well.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Bryan.","Bryan Keane","Right. Thanks. Congrats Jack as well.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Bryan.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Vasu Govil","Hi. This is Vasu Govil for James. Thanks for taking my question and Jack, congratulations.","Jack Carsky","Thank you.","Vasu Govil","Just quick question, first one to Vasant, you talked about \u2013 you sort of mentioned that cross-border volumes would kind of lap the double-digit growth rate next quarter. So just want to get a sense for what\u2019s baked into guidance? Are we assuming that this double-digit growth rate is sustainable or do you think that it could decelerate back into the sort of high single-digit range?","And then a question for Al on India, Visa is clearly benefiting from the government push towards non-cash form of payment there, but there are local mobile wallet players that seem to be making a big portion there fast getting traction. So can you talk about the competitive dynamic and potential for India -- the Indian market to kind of leapfrog card payments and go straight to mobile? And how is Visa position on the ground do sort of preserve and grew their within electronic payments in India?","Vasant Prabhu","So, on the cross-border growth rate, real quick, we like what we see on the cross-border trend. We\u2019ve seen the pound strengthen a bit, but that didn\u2019t change the strength of the cross-border business into the UK. We saw the dollar weaken a bit, but that didn\u2019t seem to change the trend so far of cross-border business outside going, leaving the U.S. So overall the cross-border business seems to have pretty good momentum. And yes, the comparison get tougher, but we feel pretty optimistic about it. So we\u2019ll wait and see how it goes. When you lap big increases of course you have to \u2013 it\u2019s a little harder to forecast, but we like what we see a lot.","Al Kelly","In terms of India, its such an exciting market and there's a lot going on obviously because it's an exciting market and a lot going on, there\u2019s a number of players trying to get into the market. We\u2019ve been there for a long time. We believe that as we think about growing our network and in particular merchant acceptance that we have to have different plans in emerging market versus a developed market and in the case of India we clearly have to have a way that's low cost, low hassle, low friction to enable merchants to sign up and that is why we initially went with a QR code and now we have worked closely with some of our network colleagues on an interoperable QR code that works with our mVisa application and allows a quick and easy and will have to setup for merchants and a relatively easy experience for the India consumer.","It is very very early in the payments maturation curve for India. There is years of to still play out here and we\u2019re going to do everything we can to take advantage of our heritage and tradition, our brand, our different products that are our security, the globality of our network as well as our digital tools to make sure that we\u2019re winning at least our fair share if not more of the business in India as it grows recognizing clearly that we've got competitors that go beyond the -- just the traditional players that we competed with over the last number of decades.","Vasu Govil","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Al Kelly","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paulo Ribeiro from BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Paulo Ribeiro","Thank you. Good evening. When you talk about the impact on expenses from tech investing, could you give us some color on where you\u2019re investing? I assume part of it is China and where else in terms of either geography or products have you guys focused your dollars on?","Al Kelly","I\u2019m sorry, you\u2019re talking about technology?","Paulo Ribeiro","Yes. Your technology, because you guys mentioned that what's driving expense is technology and Visa Europe integration? What is in technology? Where are you spending the money in terms of....","Al Kelly","Well I\u2019ll start and Vasant can add to what I have to say. Clearly China is one where we\u2019ve stated a number of times that we are investing ahead of the process of you\u2019ve been able to actually operate there not knowing exactly when that will be. I would say the other categories that come immediately to mind are open VisaNet.","We talked a bit about that at Investor Day that we are looking as we have begun the process of building a more open architecture world and a more modularized version of VisaNet to meet the needs that we have going forward and allow us the flexibility to actually we have necessary put processing right in a country without it being a big deal where a data center could be in a small closet as opposed to a large facility that has to have all of the accompanying electronics and cooling and etcetera fairly digital.","And all of the digital tools that we are building is an area that we are spending a lot of time and effort on research. We opened up a -- I think we talked about this at some point in the past that in February we opened up a new facility in [Indiscernible] focussed on research and we are doing a whole number of things around looking at applications of block chain and all official intelligence and different other ways to build a data and our analytics capabilities.","And I guess the fifth category I would say would be security and cyber security given how important security and trust in the payments ecosystem is we continue to look at every possible offering that\u2019s out there related to physical and cyber security and make sure that we are being leading edge and investing appropriately to make sure that given the role that we play in the ecosystem that we are doing everything we possibly can help make sure that transactions as they are flowing through the system and transactions as when they are at rest are all protected to the maximum degree possible. So those will be the things I would say. Would you add anything Vasant?","Vasant Prabhu","Yes, I think the other things Al went through I think a very comprehensive list. I mean a few other things just to highlight would be continued investment in the Visa developer platform. Investments and now rolling our Visa checkout and Visa Token Service and mVisa around the world. Big push on mVisa in places like India and parts of Africa. Investments in our innovation centers, you heard about the London Innovation center and how significant it has become. Investments in co-development around our innovation centers with our clients. So that\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of areas where the things we have developed are now in the process of being deployed.","Paulo Ribeiro","Great. Just a quick clarification. PayPal, the roll out of the PayPal partnerships around the world they are not a big investment, they are not in that number then that we are spending.","Al Kelly","There is a little bit of work there, but the essences of those agreements are not a major workload for us, it\u2019s more a matter of, actually more change actually on the part of PayPal and it is on part of us. And I\u2019d say \u2013 I\u2019d add that they have been a really terrific partner.","Paulo Ribeiro","Thanks.","Al Kelly","Jenny, at this point we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis, Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa Ellis","Hey guys and Jack you will be next one final congrats from me. Visa Checkout related question from me, one, do you have any updated stats to give us on Visa checkout and then little bit of a more strategic question, you know you continue to kind of fight head to head with Visa Checkout with these more staged wallets around the world whether that\u2019s with PayPal or with [Indiscernible] payor now some of the models inside of Amazon, would you contemplate adding more of that capability within Visa Checkout meaning via prepaid vehicle the ability to keep a store balance Visa Direct, using Visa Direct to be able to enable P2P and why enrol or why not?","Al Kelly","Hi Lisa. And answer to your first question, we are nearing 23 million users who have signed, you know actually signed up for Visa Checkout. I think we talked a little bit about this. The whole wallet [ph] thing is a bit of a mixed bag of activity around the industry and I think not necessarily the most user friendly thing for consumers because there are so many options. We think of these Checkout more as a platform that we necessarily think about it as wallet and but that said strategically I think anything that supports the four party model that makes sense in terms of integration or capability we\u2019re going to be open to look at as we go forward, because ultimately we want to be part of a solution of coming up with a smaller number of easy, convenient and wallet that have the type of functionality that consumers would want and expect and hope that help brings some of what I think is a bit of confusion around wallets and Checkout in the e-commerce world, bring a bit more order to it overtime.","Lisa Ellis","Perfect. Thank you.","Al Kelly","Thanks, Lisa.","Jack Carsky","And thank you all for joining us today.

Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal fourth quarter and full-year 2018 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer, and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.","Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.","Historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call to related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.","Mike, thank you and good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us today.","Our performance remained strong in fiscal fourth quarter. Revenue growth was 12%, as all our key business drivers remained robust despite the stronger dollar. Payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis of 11% was right in line with last quarter, with strength in the U.S. offsetting a slowdown in dual-branded card volume in China. Excluding China, our payment volume growth would have modestly accelerated versus the last quarter.","Cross-border on a constant dollar basis was 10%, same as the prior quarter. Processed transaction growth was consistent with last quarter at 12%. Expense growth, adjusted for a donation of available-for-sale investment securities to the Visa Foundation, was 12%, primarily driven by personnel-related investments.","Adjusted EPS growth was 34%.","We also returned approximately $2.1 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter, consisting of $1.6 billion of share repurchases and $500 million through dividends.","Looking back on this entire fiscal year of 2018, our global leading network connecting issuers and merchants got stronger on a number of dimensions. The number of cards, including virtual cards, increased by about 80 million to 3.3 billion. Total Visa volume surpassed a record $11 trillion, driven by 182 billion transactions, or an average of 500 million transactions every single day during fiscal 2018.","Payments volume totaled over $8.2 trillion, increasing by almost $900 billion year over year. Our payments volume growth was strong across the globe, with double-digit growth in constant dollars in all regions except Europe, which grew at 9.2%. And with our payments volume growing twice as fast as global PCE, Visa's penetration of global purchased PCE increased by 0.5 point to over 16% this year. Transactions processed totaled $124 billion, up 12%, lifting our processing penetration by 1 point globally.","A very important part of measuring the health of our network is found in the activity and results relative to merchants and issuers. In 2018, merchant locations increased by 7 million or 15%, reaching a total of 54 million locations globally. And relative to issuers, deal activity picked up in Q4, particularly in Europe, where we completed the shift to commercial client contracts. Beyond Europe, during the full year we completed new agreements with clients, driving roughly 15% of our total payments volume.","By the way, in fiscal 2019, we're expecting more deal activity with new agreements for clients who drive roughly 20% of our global payments volume, including Europe. The fact that 20% of our volume is up for renewal is not surprising given that our typical contract length is five years.","Now let me talk about how we've expanded our breadth and reach in 2018, which has set us up well for the future. I will share a few highlights from across the globe and then provide insights into how we are driving growth into our digital solutions, accelerating adoption of our acceptance technology, and expanding into new key segments.","So let me start with some regional highlights, starting in Europe. The technical migration to our global VisaNet platform was completed in late September, with the authorizations components finished following the clearing and settlement migration, which completed in the first quarter. Our European clients have now access to all our global capabilities. In fact, more than 60 clients are already utilizing at least one of our advanced risk services, having just completed the migration. This was a very large effort that required sustained vigilance on our part to ensure there was no disruption to our clients. So we really couldn't be happier about the execution, and we're now moving forward with one global platform.","Our European clients also now enjoy the highest level of security and protection from our global cybersecurity systems and processes. In fact, earlier today we inaugurated our Cyber Fusion center in London, making it our second fusion center globally.","The conversion of the European client contracts to commercial incentives is now officially complete, as we signed the last remaining deals during the quarter after agreeing to terms earlier in the year. We are very pleased with the outcome of this effort, as there was a lot of risk in opening well over 100 client contracts in such a short period of time. As we have said previously, the amount of business we retained was better than we expected at the time of the acquisition.","As we get past the integration, one of our priorities in Europe is gaining momentum with FinTechs by moving faster, being more flexible, and establishing an investment fund to provide financial support. This quarter, we are beginning to have more success with FinTechs both in terms of signings but also agreements still to be contracted. We signed agreements this quarter with Revolut, YAYA in the UK, Solaris in Germany, and G2A in Central Eastern Europe.","Let me now move to Asia-Pacific, where Q4 was an active quarter for deal renewals and wins across the region. A few examples include NTUC FairPrice co-brand, which is Singapore's largest supermarket chain, The Mall Group co-brand, one of Thailand's largest retailers, and the AirAsia co-brand in Malaysia.","In New Zealand, Kiwi Bank selected Visa as its long-term exclusive partner for all its payments products, which brings us to four of the top five issuers now exclusive long-term Visa partners in that market.","In China, we renewed the dual-brand card relationships with China Construction Bank and CITIC Bank, as well as we won the new prepaid deal with Ctrip.","Building a new debit business in Japan continues to be one of our top priorities for the region given the size of the opportunity. We now have over 8 million debit cards in the Japanese market, up over 40% since last year, across 23 different issuers.","In India, we renewed deals with many of the leading banks in the market, including the State Bank of India, HDFC, ICICI, Axis Bank, and Kotak Mahindra. And we are confident that these deals will contribute to further strengthening of our market leadership position across debit and credit products.","Regarding the India data localization mandate, over the last six months Visa has been working towards implementing a solution to comply with the RBI's requirements. As of October 15, we are storing data locally, where we can also facilitate the RBI's requirement of access to Indian cardholder payment transaction data. We have submitted a detailed status update and action plan to the RBI, including how we will re-architect our existing global processing systems to fully comply with the data only-in-India requirement. Our technology teams are working virtually around the clock to complete our solution with minimal impact to our clients and our cardholders.","In Latin America, we also had several co-brand wins, including Decolar in Brazil, which is the largest online travel agency in Latin America, with an affluent customer base. Also in Brazil, we signed 10-year agreements with Bradesco, one of our largest issuers in the market, and CREDZ, a processor and local private label brand that will convert about 1 million cards to Visa contactless.","In Argentina, one of our largest markets in Latin America, we will begin processing 100% of our domestic transactions in January of 2019. This enables us to provide all of the value-added services, cyber capabilities, and network reliability to our clients in addition to future innovations that we will add to our global platform. Adding all of Argentina to VisaNet will increase our processing penetration of domestic transactions in Latin America by more than 10 percentage points.","And finally, one quick but important point on CEMEA, airline co-brands are an important portfolios in the Middle East to capture the travel of the most affluent consumers. This quarter we had a number of wins, including Emirates in the UAE and Saudi Arabia, as well as the HBL Qatar Airways portfolio in Pakistan.","Now let me turn away from the regional updates and give some insights into how we're driving growth in our network using our digital solutions. Let me start with Visa Direct, which is one of the key ways we're capturing new incremental payment flows. Global growth continues to be over 100% this quarter, fueled by increased activities by end users as well as continued expansion of our reach and our scale. Our 2 billion-plus Visa debit credentials globally enabled us to execute Visa Direct transactions in more than 150 countries this fiscal year.","But it's also important to note that the speed of funds within our total reach is very important, with payment originators automatically leveraged when issuers move their credentials to Fast Funds. We are quickly increasing the number of issuers moving to real-time, adding Spain and Ireland this quarter, for a total of over 70 countries where Fast Funds are enabled. In the UK, Barclays moved to Fast Funds, allowing participating Barclays cardholders in Visa Direct programs access to money real time.","In our goal to expand our reach, we will continue to look for opportunities to access accounts not directly linked to a Visa credential. To that end, our most recent expansion is with our Plus interbank ATM network, which is leveraged by many non-Visa bank issued ATM cards.","TD Bank Canada was the first bank to enable its Plus debit credentials to receive Visa Direct deposits on non-Visa credentials. This is a great first step. As other Canadian issuers enable this expanded reach, we can serve most of the Canadian bank population of consumers and small businesses.","We are then building upon Visa Direct's unique reach by rapidly scaling solutions through use case expansion and large platform enablement. We continue to deepen our penetration of existing verticals, including property and casualty insurance, where our clients enhance their customers' experiences. This category represents $330 billion in claims payments, approximately 45% of which are paid by check today in the United States. This past quarter we signed new partnerships with a couple of insurance companies to enable more real-time disbursements to their customers.","There are also many use cases that support the gig economy. For example, we partnered with PayActiv, one of the largest gig economy earned wage access providers, to incorporate Visa Direct as a real-time payroll option. Given the growth in the number of workers participating in the gig economy, we believe this is a big opportunity, since many employees in the gig economy want access to their wages as they are earned.","Visa Direct's distribution model also scales quickly in partnership with platform providers around the world. As you probably know, Visa Direct is powering many of the P2P solutions globally. And another new example is Samsung's recent launch of P2P payments in partnership with VTB Bank in Russia, providing a seamless customer experience for making payments as well as sending and receiving money.","Another example of platform partners is in India, with Paytm and PhonePe, both leading mobile payment apps, who have activated credit card bill payments on the Visa Direct platform, enabling over 100 million mobile app customers.","We recently announced the commercial expansion of the Visa Token Service for 20 credential-on-file token requesters, which we believe is a significant step in further securing customer payments in the digital channel. These leading acquirer gateway and technology partners include Adyen, Braintree, PayPal, CyberSource, Elavon, Square, Stripe, and Worldpay, just to name a few. And they will tokenize credential-on-file digital payments on behalf of their merchant and payment clients.","In addition to reducing fraud risk by not exposing cardholders' more sensitive account information, we're focused on improving card-not-present authorization rates that, frankly, continue to be too low. Visa tokens also allow issuers around the world to push dynamic updates on lost, stolen, or expired credentials to enable a frictionless merchant and customer experience. So Visa now has over 60 global token requesters across 40 markets on our token platform.","Last week, a significant milestone was reached for secure remote commerce after EMVco published a draft of the technical specifications. This now enables the ecosystem to begin building to the standard while also allowing merchants and issuers a feedback period before the final specifications are published in about two months' time. The specifications for branding and the user experience are still expected to be published in early 2019. We again are working closely with partners such as Adyen, Braintree, CyberSource, Stripe, and Worldpay to activate the ecosystem for the initial launch of secure remote commerce in mid to late 2019.","Now a few quick updates on the adoption of our acceptance technologies, including contactless and scan-to-pay. Let me start with contactless or tap-and-pay adoption, which continues to grow rapidly, as it is a better consumer and merchant experience than paying with a dip, swipe, or scan. One in four domestic face-to-face transactions that run over our network globally are now contactless. If you exclude the United States, domestic contactless penetration is over 40%, which is up over 12 percentage points in the last year and up almost 4 points versus the last quarter.","More than 20 countries have increased their domestic contactless penetration by more than 20 points since last year, led by Russia, which is up 38 points to over 50%. During the FIFA World Cup, contactless payments accounted for 45% of all Visa purchases across the 11 host cities in Russia.","The U.S. market is poised for significant contactless growth over the coming year. There are a few facts to note. Number one, on the acceptance side, in the past three months several of the largest merchants have enabled contactless in their stores, including 7-Eleven, CVS Pharmacy stores, and Costco. Over 70 of the top 100 merchants by transactions now accept contactless, an increase of more than 20 in the past year. Additionally, over half of all face-to-face transactions now occur at a contactless-enabled merchant, up from over a little bit around one-third of all merchants a year ago.","On the issuing side, several of our largest clients will begin issuing contactless cards over the next few quarters. We expect that there will be over 100 million Visa contactless cards issued in the United States by the end of 2019.","Costco is a good example of the potential impact when both the issuing and acceptance come together, since the Citi-Costco co-brand card is contactless-enabled. Over half of in-store payments at Costco on their co-brand card are now paid with a tap after Costco enabled contactless payments just in mid-August of this year.","Establishing scan-to-pay acceptance and cardholder usage is progressing very well. As we discussed in prior quarters, India is our largest market, where we now have over 700,000 scan-to-pay acceptance points.","But we're also seeing momentum in a number of markets in the CEMEA region. In Tanzania, this quarter we signed a deal with Halotel, a leading mobile network operator, to put Visa credentials into their mobile phone wallets. We also launched scan-to-pay in Pakistan with HBL, the country's largest issuer and acquirer, with 50,000 consumers being enabled in the first few days. And they have plans to make the solution available to almost 1 million customers and thousands of merchants in the coming months. In Kazakhstan, we partnered with a leading mobile network operator to introduce cashless ticketing in 3,000 public transport buses across four cities.","Lastly, we continue to expand into new segments, and B2B is our top priority. Specifically, we continue to innovate and grow our B2B payment offerings across both core card solutions and expanding to new payment flows. In terms of core card solutions, we remain the global leader, but there still is tremendous opportunity for growth. Our B2B payments volume was $950 billion, or over 11% of our total payments volume this fiscal year, and the growth has been accelerating into the mid-teens in the past two quarters.","Let me also share three examples of new payment flow opportunities we're capitalizing on in the B2B space. One, we continue to expand our virtual card business, including a partnership with Nexus to enable their clients, who are typically real estate property managers, to pay suppliers more quickly, safely, and conveniently by using Visa virtual cards.","In Russia, we signed a new partnership agreement with Sberbank to support their growth in the small business and enterprise segments and maintain their leadership position in B2B in Russia. This is an example of partners seeing the value in differentiating to small businesses rather than just offering them a consumer card option.","We continue to enhance and scale our B2B Connect solution. In addition to Visa virtual card being a payment option that are offered to Bottom Line's clients, we've extended our partnership with Bottom Line to enable B2B Connect as a payment option for large-ticket cross-border payables. We're also launching a digital identity solution that tokenizes an organization's sensitive business information, such as bank account numbers, giving them a unique identifier that could be utilized for their B2B Connect transactions.","There were two other notable events in the quarter. The first, we reached a settlement with the damages class on the U.S. MDL lawsuit in September and have submitted it to the court for preliminary approval, which we expect to take a few months. There will be a period for merchants to opt out or object. But assuming the court assesses the settlement to be fair and reasonable, we expect formal approval to take at least a year to be in place. This settlement does not resolve the injunctive relief class claims seeking modifications to network rules. We are certainly pleased to be making progress, but it's hard to say when the MDL litigation will actually conclude.","For more than 30 years, Visa has been a proud sponsor of the Olympic Games, and this quarter we renewed our partnership through the 2032 games, which includes the upcoming venues of Tokyo, Beijing, Paris, and Los Angeles. The Olympic Games provides an unparalleled opportunity to promote the Visa brand at a regional and global level while also facilitating partnerships and joint business initiatives with clients that come to life through cobranding and\/or client usage of Olympic IP. The world's largest sporting event also provides a unique platform for showcasing product innovation and launching new business initiatives.","So fiscal 2018 was a great year where we delivered strong business driver and financial performance while also advancing key initiatives that will drive future growth such as Visa Direct, B2B, contactless, and digital solutions. We also successfully concluded the major aspects of the Visa Europe integration with the completion of the platform migration and the shift to commercial client contracts.","However, fiscal 2018 is behind us now, and we are totally focused on 2019. Our financial outlook for fiscal 2019 includes annual net revenue growth of low double digits on a nominal basis, with approximately 1 percentage point of negative foreign currency impact, and a de minimis impact from the new revenue accounting standard. And we look for mid-teens earnings per share growth on a non-GAAP nominal dollar basis, also including approximately 1 percentage point of negative foreign currency impact.","To share more of our details on our results and more on our 2019 outlook, I'll now turn it over to Vasant.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Thank you, Al, and good morning, everyone. Good afternoon, everyone.","We had a strong finish to fiscal year 2018. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter net revenues were up 12%, and EPS was up 37%. Adjusted to exclude a special item, EPS grew 34%, which includes a 10 percentage point benefit from the impact of U.S. tax reform. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year were a drag on net revenue growth of almost 50 basis points and EPS growth of approximately 1 percentage point.","Full-year net revenues of $20.6 billion were up 12%. Net income on a GAAP basis was $10.3 billion, and EPS was $4.42.","On an adjusted basis, net income for the full year was $10.7 billion, up 29%, and EPS was $4.61, up 32%. The adjustments for each quarter are described in our earnings release.","On a full-year basis, U.S. tax reform contributed 10 percentage points to net income and EPS growth. For the full year, exchange rate shifts added 1 percentage point to net revenue growth and 1.5 percentage points to EPS growth.","A few other points to note, in the fourth quarter, we donated available-for-sale investment securities to the Visa Foundation. Our adjusted results exclude this special item, which is $195 million of non-cash G&A expense as well as the realized gain in non-operating income\/expense and the tax benefit associated with the charitable contribution.","Growth remained steady across business drivers, with little change relative to the third quarter. On a constant dollar basis, payments volume grew 11% and processed transactions grew 12%.","Cross-border volume grew 10%. As a reminder, Q3 cross-border volume growth of 10% was reduced by 1 percentage point due to lapping a settlement delay in Europe last year. As the dollar strengthened, cross-border growth decelerated through the fourth quarter in some corridors, particularly commerce inbound to the U.S.","As the dollar rose, the currency translation impact on net revenue growth swung from the 150 basis point tailwind we enjoyed in the third quarter to an almost 50 basis point headwind in the fourth quarter, contributing a 200 basis point slowdown in reported net revenue growth trend. In addition to a strong dollar, this significant shift was driven by a sharp weakening in many emerging market currencies, in particular the Argentinian peso, the Turkish lira, and the Brazilian real.","For the full year, exchange rates increased net revenue growth by approximately 100 basis points. However, based on current exchange rates and the forward curve, the currency translation impact is expected to be a 100 basis point headwind in fiscal year 2019.","At the end of the second full year of our ownership of Visa Europe, results are tracking well ahead of our acquisition model. Cumulative EPS accretion is over 10% two years ahead of expectations. We have also completed the two most significant and complex aspects of the integration, the technology platform migration and the restructuring of major client contracts to competitive commercial terms.","In Q4, we repurchased 11.5 million shares of Visa stock for $1.6 billion, at an average price of $142.84. For the full year we repurchased a total of 57.5 million shares for $7.2 billion, at an average price of $124.25.","In addition, in June 2018 we funded the litigation escrow account with an additional $600 million. As a reminder, funding of the escrow triggers a conversion rate adjustment of Class B common stock to shares of Class A common stock, which has the same effect on EPS as repurchasing $600 million of Class A common stock.","In fiscal year 2018, we paid $1.9 billion in dividends. Our board has authorized an increase of 19% in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 per share per quarter.","Moving on to the quarter's business drivers and our financial results, I'll keep my comments on fiscal year 2018 brief and spend most of my time on our outlook for fiscal year 2019. Payments volume momentum continued, with 11% growth in the third quarter for the third quarter in a row. U.S. payment volumes grew 12%, fueled by 12% debit growth. Debit growth was driven by Visa Direct as well as robust consumer spending across most retail categories.","International payment volumes in constant dollars grew 11%, with 1 point of deceleration primarily due to the runoff of dual-brand portfolios in China. In addition, acceleration in India and southern Europe was offset by slower growth in the UK and Australia.","Global cross-border volumes grew 10% on a constant dollar basis. Inbound commerce to the U.S. slowed with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, falling to mid-single digits after two quarters of double-digit growth. Cross-border commerce growth in Europe remained strong and stable. Outbound commerce from the U.S. accelerated, while growth in outbound commerce from Canada, Latin America, and China slowed.","Transactions processed through VisaNet grew 12%, in line with the prior three quarters. Through October 21, U.S. payments volume growth was 11%, with U.S. credit growing 11% and debit 12%. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis was up 11%, and processed transactions grew 12%.","Net revenues in the fourth quarter grew 12%. Data processing revenue benefited from the pricing which went into effect in the third quarter, growing 16%. International revenue grew 10%, with benefits from Q3 pricing actions offset by the impact of shifting exchange rates and lower currency volatility.","Service revenues grew 10%. As a reminder, service revenues are recognized with a one quarter lag and reflect third quarter exchange rates. Other revenues grew 13%.","Client incentives stepped up from 20.8% of gross revenue in the third quarter to 21.7%, as we signed several large deals. However, client incentives were lower than we had anticipated due to some contract signing delays. This delay was due to complex deals where the terms were agreed but multiple contracts needed to be finalized and signed in order to recognize the incentives. As a reminder, Q4 last year was a very active quarter of contract renewals in Europe, China, and Russia. As a result, year-over-year growth in client incentives is lower this quarter than in prior quarters of fiscal year 2018.","Moving to expenses, GAAP operating expenses were up 23%. Adjusted to exclude the special item previously noted, operating expenses in the fourth quarter grew 12%, largely driven by personnel costs. As we have mentioned in prior quarters, personnel increases were driven by higher head count dedicated to our investment initiatives as well as higher incentive compensation resulting from our operating performance in fiscal year 2018. Also, as you know, we increased our contribution to employee 401(k) plans in the U.S. and acquired Fraedom earlier this year. In addition, we recorded a severance charge in the fourth quarter for adjustments we are making in various parts of our global organization structure.","Expense growth in other categories was higher than our prior outlook, as we made additional marketing investments, primarily around the very successful FIFA World Cup finals in Russia and also had several non-recurring items in the quarter, including a litigation settlement.","Our fourth quarter tax rate was 19.6% on a GAAP basis and 21% adjusted to exclude the tax benefit associated with our contribution to the Visa Foundation. Adjusted EPS was $1.21, up 34%. Exchange rate shifts reduced reported Q4 EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point.","For the full year of fiscal 2018, net revenues were $20.6 billion, up 12%, including approximately 1 percentage point positive currency impact. Full-year adjusted EPS was $4.61, up 32%, with a currency tailwind of approximately 1.5 percentage points. As mentioned, U.S. tax reform contributed 10 percentage points to EPS growth.","With that, I'll move to our outlook for fiscal 2019. Overall, our net revenue outlook for fiscal year 2019 assumes current trends and key business drivers remain largely intact through the year, with the currency translation impact shifting from a tailwind to a headwind. Double-digits payment volume growth is assumed to continue in most parts of the world.","In North America, growth rates are expected to slow down in the second half as we lap strong debit growth in fiscal year 2018 as well as the higher gas prices. International payments volume growth is forecast to stay strong and stable. Share gains in several markets are offset by slowing dual-brand issuance in China.","As always, cross-border growth is harder to forecast as we look four quarters out. Exchange rates, geopolitical factors, and macroeconomic shifts will drive variability. Assuming current exchange rate expectations and no significant changes on other fronts, our outlook forecasts a continuation of double-digit growth rates. There is an expectation that the dollar will weaken in the second half, driving an improvement in cross-border commerce inbound to the U.S. Pricing actions which become effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 will also help drive second half international revenue growth rates higher than the first half.","Processed transaction growth remained stable and healthy throughout fiscal 2018. Our outlook assumes that steady growth will continue through fiscal year 2019. Data processing revenue growth rates are expected to be higher during the first half due to the pricing actions in fiscal year 2018, with a dip in Q3 as we lap these actions.","On the client incentive front, we ended the year with incentives in the fourth quarter as a percent of gross revenues at 21.7%. Our outlook for fiscal 2019 is a range of 22% to 23%. The step up in incentives as a percent of gross revenue is driven by the full-year impact of renewals and new deals signed in fiscal 2018 as well as renewals and new deals that we anticipate signing in fiscal year 2019. Globally, we have a large number of renewals. As Al indicated, around 20% of our global payments volume is slated for this coming fiscal year.","Based on our current expectation for the timing of client renewals, incentive growth rates are expected to be higher in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2019 and lower than the full-year growth trend in the first and fourth quarters. We will, of course, provide updates as the year progresses. As you know, we make our best estimates for the terms and timing of renewals for the upcoming year, but client-specific considerations will determine actual outcomes.","In terms of the currency translation impact, based on current rates and forward expectations, we project a 100 basis point net revenue headwind for fiscal 2019. This drag will be greater in the second and third quarters as we lap the tailwinds we enjoyed in fiscal year 2018. And if forward curves are to be believed, the drag will be the lowest in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.","When you put all this together, our outlook is for low double-digit nominal net revenue growth in fiscal year 2019. We currently anticipate the impact of the new accounting standard on net revenue to be de minimis.","If you incorporate what I just walked through, it becomes evident that the cadence of net revenue growth is not steady through the year. The highest growth for the year is likely in the fourth quarter and the lowest growth rate in the second quarter. In the second quarter, net revenue growth could be in the high single digits, impacted by higher incentive growth, a larger exchange rate drag, as well as lapping higher currency volatility in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. The fourth quarter benefits from fiscal year 2019 pricing actions as well as a lower drag from both incentives and exchange rates.","On the expense front, we continue to invest in our business, partially funding these investments by shifting resources from lower priority areas and from savings we derive from better purchasing as well as other efficiency programs. In aggregate, fiscal year 2019 operating expense growth adjusted for special items in fiscal year 2018 is projected to be in the mid to high single-digit range. This includes approximately 1.5 to 2 percentage points of additional reported expenses from adopting the new accounting standard.","Expense growth cadence through the year will also fluctuate. Adjusted expense growth will be in the double digits in the first quarter, in line with recent trends, and then step down to mid-single digits for the remainder of the year.","In fiscal year 2018, expenses were lower in the first quarter for several reasons. Personnel expenses ramped up through the year, as we added resources to drive our investment initiatives. Incentive compensation accruals also stepped up through the year, in line with our operating performance. Also, the additional 401(k) contribution and Fraedom expenses started in the second quarter of fiscal 2018.","We had higher marketing expenses in the second to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 related to the Winter Olympics and the FIFA World Cup finals. In fiscal year 2019, marketing expenses are expected to be higher in the first quarter.","Network and processing growth rates were elevated during the second half of fiscal year 2018, as we ran parallel Europe technology systems. This will continue into the first half of fiscal 2019 and will be lower in the second half as we complete the shutdown of the legacy Visa Europe platform. Based on all of these factors, the adjusted expense growth rate is expected to be highest in the first quarter and lowest in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.","Some color on how the adoption of the new accounting standard, ASC 606, will impact our reported fiscal year 2019 P&L. Based on our assessment of existing contracts through September 30, 2018, we will re-amortize some upfront payments that we expensed in prior years. This increases client incentives and reduces reported net revenues. Offsetting this reduction is an increase to gross revenues related to certain programs like market development funds, almost all on the other revenues line.","Operating expenses related to market development funds will increase by the same amount, almost all on the marketing expense line, with no net impact on operating earnings.","Other effects that we have estimated are the amortization of upfront payments we might make for fiscal year 2019 renewals and new deals, which would have been expensed immediately under the old rules, which reduces client incentives. Finally, there are some client marketing expenses that will be recorded in the incentives line and no longer in marketing expenses.","Our best estimate of the net of all this is a de minimis impact on net revenues, higher other revenues offset by higher client incentives, and a 1.5 to 2 point increase in operating expenses, almost all on the marketing expense line. As we have said many times before, this has no impact on the cash flow or economic value of our business. As required, we will report each quarter what the impact of ASC 606 was on our income statement.","Our adjusted tax rate for 2018 was 20%. This includes three quarters of impact of a lower statutory tax rate as a result of U.S. tax reform. Our FY 2018 tax rate also benefited from an audit settlement and the successful resolution of several state tax initiatives we have been working on for many years. Resolution of these items resulted in recording some benefits related to prior years, which will not recur. These non-recurring benefits lowered our tax rate in fiscal 2018 by 1.5 to 2 points. In fiscal year 2019, we will have a full year of lower U.S. corporate tax rate. We're awaiting final guidance from the Department of Treasury for the new provisions that go into effect in 2019, also known as the GILTI and FDII rules.","In fiscal year 2019, our tax rate will be lower by 1.5 to 2 points from a full year of the lower U.S. corporate tax rate and our best estimate for the impact of the new provisions. This will offset the loss of non-recurring benefits that were included in our fiscal year 2018 results. Hence, our outlook projects a fiscal year 2019 tax rate in the 20% to 20.5% range.","Putting all these components together, our outlook is for nominal EPS growth in the mid-teens on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis. This includes approximately 1 point of negative foreign currency translation impact. With net revenue and operating expense growth rates fluctuating from quarter to quarter, EPS growth rates will too. EPS growth rate based on a combination of these assumptions will be in the low teens range in the second and third quarters and well above the mid-teens levels in the fourth quarter.","For the first quarter of fiscal 2019, our outlook is for nominal net revenue growth in the low double digits, double-digit operating expense growth in line with recent trends, and mid-teens adjusted EPS growth. As always, there are risks to monitor: exchange rate shifts of course; the possibility of a hard Brexit; economic dislocations like we had in Argentina and Turkey; geopolitical changes like trade wars, et cetera. As we normally do, we will update our outlook when we talk to you each quarter.","Moving on to capital, cash flow, dividends, and buybacks, capital spending in fiscal 2019 is likely to be around $800 million. This includes capital associated with hardware, support growth, resiliency and cybersecurity, an upgrade of our data center in the UK, investments in other facilities, as well as capitalization of software from our technology development projects.","Based on our earnings outlook and capital spending plans, free cash flow from operations is anticipated to be in excess of $13 billion. Most of this free cash flow will be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. In fiscal 2019, we anticipate returning at least $11 billion to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks. The Visa board has authorized a 19% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.25 for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, in line with our dividend policy. This puts our payout ratio in the 20% to 25% range.","In fiscal 2018, we completed additional buybacks to neutralize the impacts from stock issued to Visa Europe owners as part of the acquisition. In fiscal year 2019, we anticipate buying back at least $8.5 billion of Visa stock.","As a reminder, we will hit the three-year anniversary of the Visa Europe acquisition in June 2019. In June we will be making a cash payment of a little over \u20ac1.1 billion to the former owners of Visa Europe, as per the terms of our acquisition agreement.","We should also point out that as interest rates have risen, we are earning more investment income from our cash balances, which offsets some of our interest expense. Both interest income and expense are recorded in non-operating income\/expense.","In summary, as Al described with facts and figures, the Visa system continues to expand and thrive in a fast-changing payments landscape. As evidenced by our growth in fiscal year 2018, the opportunity to digitize cash in new and different ways has never been better. With a tailwind of strong global economies and robust consumer spending enhanced by the growth strategies that Al outlined, we look forward once again to delivering on the revenue and earnings growth you have come to expect from us.","With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Okay. We're willing to run 10 minutes long, so we have more time for questions. So with that, we're ready to get started with questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you Our first question today comes from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi, thanks for taking the time today, two questions. First, what gives you confidence that the U.S. dollar will start to retreat in the back half of the year next year to put that in the guidance?","And secondly, can you talk about yields on Visa Direct and push payments, as we hear a lot of Fast growth in that area going on globally from all networks? Thank you.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.","Craig, it's Al. I'll take the second question and I'll let Vasant take the first. We initially guided to Visa Direct heavily in the P2P space, where frankly, there's not a lot of economics. Our yields there tend to be less than we would get on normal Visa transactions. But as we move into some of these new use cases, we aren't expected to get yields that are similar to what we get in the typical pull transactions that we do today. Let me ask Vasant to talk about what our view is on the retreating U.S. dollar in back end of the year.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","I don't think our crystal ball is any better than anybody else's, and so we don't really try to predict those things. We just look at forward curves and make some assumptions based on that. But the thing that happens, if in fact the dollar begins to weaken, let's say, in the second half, it will help us in certain corridors and it will hurt us in other corridors, and there's a net effect of that.","So even if it doesn't happen as might be projected by forward curves, there are normal balancing effects in the business. So it's not a one-way bet in a sense. So if the dollar weakens, clearly we benefit from a translation standpoint. We have given you our best guess of about 100 basis points of impact in net revenue. On the cross-border side, we would benefit with the inbound corridor to the U.S. But on the other hand, we will benefit in other parts of the world from the dollar weakening. So there's a lot of offsetting factors.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks a lot. You covered a lot of ground in the prepared remarks, it's useful. I wanted to ask on the revenue outlook. You're calling for low double-digit for fiscal 2019. At this time last year, you guided to high single-digit growth, I believe, and you landed at 12%. So I'm curious why you're more optimistic this year versus last year. Is your visibility perhaps a little bit better? Is there a different level of conservatism maybe that you're baking in? Just curious to compare where you stand this year on your outlook versus this time last year. Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Sure, Tien-Tsin. As we normally do, we give you our best sense of the upcoming year based on the facts we have available at this point in time. And if you looked at where we were at the end of last year, clearly the strength of the U.S. consumer in particular ended up being stronger than we expected. As you saw, our debit growth was mid-single digits for quite a few quarters leading up to the year. And then starting in the second fiscal quarter of 2018, we jumped into the double digits and have stayed there.","So there were various elements of the business that clearly changed their growth trajectory after we gave you the outlook for the year. So you could say that things happened that were stronger than we expected. The global economy was stronger than we expected. In the second quarter and the third quarter in particular, the exchange rate tailwinds were stronger than we might have expected when we went into the year. So these things happen, and we update you as we learn them.","As we look ahead, again, we're doing the same thing. We're giving you the best sense we have of the business as we enter the year. And therefore, we give you as much color as we did as to what our assumptions are. Obviously, we'll update you as the year progresses.","I know some people try to read into what we say, things like oh, they're being conservative. They want to leave room to raise it in the future and all that. And as we've told you all along, we give you our best sense at any point in time. We are not trying to be overly conservative or otherwise, and this is our best sense as we stand today.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Al, so it's pretty interesting to see double-digit revenue growth coming again this year for a company with a $300 billion market cap. As you look out over the intermediate term and you think about revenue growth, the model, do you still see the same secular contribution coming through as payments move away from cash? Because sometimes it's hard for us to see when we might at a tipping point given a lot of new technologies and payment initiatives coming in.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.","Don, as you might guess, I'm not going to give a long-term forecast on revenue. We just explained how we got to the number for just this year and the assumptions in that. That said, I'm quite confident in the business over a long period of time, and we've got lots of different vectors on which I think we can continue to grow this business, whether it's by penetrating new payment flows, penetrating new segments, penetrating new geographies, bringing more of the unbanked around the world into the mainstream financial system.","I think some of these capabilities that we are developing in terms of things like Visa Direct, some of the technologies that I think are enabling a better user experience at the actual moment when a user uses a card, whether that's contactless or QR, and hopefully, in 2019, the big change in e-commerce as we move to secure remote commerce.","So I think that there are just a good number of growth vectors for this business that give me a good deal of confidence in our ability to continue to grow our volumes. And as we grow our volumes, obviously revenues should come along. And so I remain confident about the future of Visa in terms of the volumes we can deliver.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","And just adding to that, we've historically talked a lot about you might call our traditional payment flows, which is the B2C \u2013 B2B business \u2013 I'm sorry, the consumer-to-merchant business, C2B. And as you know, we believe there's a lot of opportunity there to continue to digitize cash and increase PC penetration. But increasingly, as Al said, it's these new payment flows as we call them that are enabled by things like Visa Direct, which would be P2P, and disbursements, which is a B2C, that we're getting increasingly excited about.","And then of course, Visa Direct also enables many elements of B2B and G2C, government-to-consumer. And then B2B remains a huge opportunity. We are already close to $1 trillion in payment volume there, and we would like to see it grow much faster than let's call it our core consumer to \u2013 C2B business.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat. Your line is now open.","Harshita Rawat - AllianceBernstein L.P.","Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about emerging markets. There appears to be a lot happening underground in some of these markets that government involvement needs domestic schemes in certain instances, almost a new Fast ACH and API infrastructure. So my question for you is how should we think about your ability to quickly adapt in these very rapidly evolving markets? And is there anything you need to do on the pricing partnerships on the technology front?","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.","Harshita, many of these emerging markets which are \u2013 where there's clearly lots of dynamics, as you talked about, Visa has been on the ground in these markets for in many cases multiple decades, and we've got experienced teams in those markets. And I think if I put China aside, where we actually still don't have a domestic license, but we look at some of the countries in Asia, some of the countries in South America, some of the countries in Africa, we I think have had a market leadership position, and we I think will continue to look to forge both good partnerships with people where it makes sense. The reality is the payments ecosystem is hugely about partnerships already. And I think as I look forward, there will be even more partnerships as some of the FinTechs really take hold and provide various value-added services.","We are committed to VisaNet. We think it is the best network in the world in addition to being the biggest in the world. We continue to invest in it in big ways and will continue to invest in it. That said, we are very pragmatic people. And to the degree that there are other rails that Visa transactions might \u2013 or Visa credentials might be used on where we can do something in partnership, where perhaps there are various value-added services we might be able to still provide, even if a transaction isn't running on our rails, we'll be committed to do that.","So I think that we are going down multiple paths where we're both trying to continue to strengthen the assets we have today, starting with our network, but also the investment in lots of capabilities we're doing. But we're also going to be smart about partnering where partnering makes sense. We're committed to try to be in the middle of as many payment flows as possible. And if we can control \u2013 if we can have the full control of that payment flow, great. If in some cases we're participating in it as a partial player, that's also fine as well.","So I think that we are well-positioned. If you look at India as one case study, that's a market we've been in for 35 years. We've got a big team on the ground there. And we continue to be the market leader even though there's lots of activity going on there in terms of both government intervention, as you talk about, as well as new players that are emerging.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, thanks, guys. Look, I know there are some pricing initiatives at the company, and you touched on the anniversary of some in 2019. But maybe you could just help us understand from a cadence standpoint what kind of benefit we could have through the year.","And then, Al, just higher level, between Europe and other areas, do you see similar pricing opportunities in 2019 and 2020 that you saw in 2018? Especially on the back of Europe front-end integration being done now, do you have some room there? Thanks.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.","So, Darrin, I'd say two things. One is both Vasant and I have been clear about what we see in terms of pricing in Europe. The second thing I'd say is that we have had a longstanding policy of not getting involved, for many reasons, including competitive reasons, in forecasting specific pricing actions that we would take and where we would take them geographically and in terms of on the network. And I think we're going to revert back to not commenting on specific pricing plans on a going-forward basis. But obviously, that said, we recognize that it's an important lever.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","And our plans for 2019 include pricing. There's carryover pricing from 2018 that flows into the first half of 2019. And as I said in the comments earlier, we have some pricing coming in, in 2019. And so order of magnitude, across the whole business, there's about similar kinds of pricing between the two years.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Lisa?","Lisa Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Sorry, good afternoon, guys. My question is about Visa Direct. I like to see the strong metrics there year on year. Can you give an idea of \u2013 so you highlighted use cases associated with P2P disbursements, some B2B use cases. Can you give a sense for is there a pathway and what does it look like to using Visa Direct for things like bill pay or even more traditional merchant transactions, particularly in geographies where there is incumbent Fast ACH networks, where that type of push payment is already heavily in use for those types of transactions? Is that a focus area, and can you give a sense for what that timeline or that pathway looks like?","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.","So we already do, Lisa, have some bill pay use cases that are happening in different geographies around the world. And again, our view is that by reversing the typical way that our network works that we have lots of opportunity in lots of different use cases. And we've got a dedicated team that's spending a lot of time thinking about bill pay, P2P, disbursements, and faster payments to merchants. I think those are the four primary businesses that at the moment that we can see ourselves playing in in terms of Visa Direct. And specifically on bill pay, I know both in Singapore and in India we have use cases going on right now.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great, thank you very much. I just wanted to ask a point of clarification first on \u2013 I think, Vasant, you mentioned that there's 20% of your total volume that's up for renewal in 2018. You touched on its impact on incentives, but as a dull roar (1:02:12), how does that compare to previous years? Or at least what has been in the last few years by comparison, just to contextualize it a little bit?","And then, Al, I wanted to follow up on the questions related to \u2013 on new technologies and partnerships. When you look at some of the things that you've rolled out like the recent announcement of B2B Connect, et cetera, how close are you working with your partners to visualize and then push the boundaries on new initiatives? And I'm wondering how much is like being pulled from your partners as they look for opportunities. I'm just trying to get a sense as to how receptive the market may be to some of these new initiatives. Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","I'll take the first one, and Al I think is going to answer the second one. In terms of the renewal tempo, FY 2017, fiscal year 2017 and 2018 was heavy in Europe. As Al was even saying, we opened up 100 contracts, more than 100 contracts and redid them, and you saw that in some of the client incentive movements. 2016, 2017, and 2018 in the rest of the world were somewhat lower than the 20% pace. So 20% inclusive of Europe is probably more of \u2013 a little higher than the last couple of years on a global basis, but 2015 was a bigger year from a renewal standpoint. So that gives you some flavor for it. Our average contracts run from three to seven years typically, so about five years is a decent estimate. The 20% is getting more to par for the course.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.","James, on the second question related to new technologies, first of all, I'd say that we try to be very client and consumer\/business owner-centric in all we do. We don't just try to come up with capabilities and technologies for the sake of having them. We want and are only interested in creating capabilities and products that we think solve a particular problem or fill a particular need in the payment ecosystem.","That said, there are cases where we are sometimes being pushed by our clients to move faster, and there are cases where we're pushing or pulling our clients along, asking them to come along more quickly. And by the way, for the same capability or the same product, we can have each of those cases at different clients. So we could have some clients who we have to pull along and some who are pushing for us to move faster. So constant communication and an open stream of dialogue is critical in these cases.","And we try to sit with clients, particularly our biggest clients, and give them a sense of what's in our product pipeline, what are we thinking about over the next year or two, so that they have some transparency into what we're thinking. Because often we need them to come along, because often one of the things that is on the critical path of progress is them opening up their tech queues and making sure that they're doing whatever changes they need to make to accommodate some capability or product that we're putting into the marketplace.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks, a quick question on the China dual-card spending volumes. I was under the impression that the conversion to two cards had stopped. Is that not the case anymore because you guys mentioned that weakness?","And then secondly, on these tokenization partnerships, I guess when we think about what the longer-term or even intermediate-term benefits are, are there specific pilots that you will launch around those partnerships or any economic benefits?","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.","On the first question, Sanjay, there are definitely a good number of our Chinese bank partners. I don't know how many. We have 55, I think 56 China bank issuer partners, and a good number of them are still issuing dual-badged cards. So yes, that's still happening.","On the tokenization partnerships, look, this is something we're very committed to. We have always taken a lead in trying to make sure the payment ecosystem is as secure as it possibly can be. And getting to a point where payment credentials are codified in a different way using tokens versus the actual card number we believe is critical for the infrastructure.","My personal belief, by getting these large token requesters on board now and getting to the point where we have 60 very strong token requesters in 40 markets around the world is going to start triggering some key merchants to start moving to tokenizing their card-on-file pans from today. And I think like everything in life that this is one of those things that if we can build some momentum, which I think we can, that it will really start to take off.","But clearly, like everything, again, you need some tipping point where the momentum really starts to take off and you move from pushing an initiative uphill to watching it roll downhill. And I think in the case of tokenization, we're probably still trying to push it uphill a little bit, but I feel like we're close to the top of the hill, and we'll start seeing it roll down the hill as key merchants get enabled by these token requesters that we've recently signed.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Okay, last question, Katie.","Operator","Our final question today comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great, thanks. Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered. But, Al, maybe you could just elaborate a little bit on the last point. What are the types of transactions that you wouldn't see running over the network today because of not having the tokenization partnership, and how would you see that developing over the next year or two?","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr - Visa, Inc.","I think they're two unrelated things. Look, as big and as broad and as large as our network is, we are not connected to every single bank account around the world. And so I think that there could be cases, certainly as it relates to the movement in certain markets towards real-time payments, where we're doing something in partnership with another set of rails.","I think as we do that, one of the things we will bring to the party, among many capabilities that we uniquely have on our network, will be tokens. But there will be other capabilities that we bring along as well, including the fact that we're global, including the fact that we have rules that handle things like disputes and chargebacks, including the fact that we've got a great array of risk and fraud tools that we can bring to the party. So that's how I think about it, Moshe.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","We'd like to thank you for joining us today.

I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Jamie. Good afternoon everyone, and welcome to Visa, Inc's fiscal third quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's CEO, and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's CFO. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet, and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today's commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.","For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant.","Vasant Prabhu","Thank you, Jack. We reported another solid quarter of financial results, with strong revenue and earnings growth against an economic backdrop that continues to be uncertain. Most of our results were in line with our expectations going into the quarter, with a few highlights and exceptions. Let me speak to those first.","First, we recognized a tax benefit of $280 million. When we last talked to you in April, we had estimated that this would be a fiscal fourth quarter event, so this is essentially a change in timing. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 22% in Q3, and shifted $0.12 of EPS into the third quarter from the fourth. Based on this shift, we now expect our tax rate in the fourth quarter to approximate 34%, and for the full year we are now anticipating a rate between 29% and 30%.","Second, revenue growth of 12% on a nominal basis was significantly higher than we anticipated, in spite of continuing foreign exchange rate headwinds of approximately 3 points in the quarter. Revenue growth out-performance was driven by sustained high currency volatility that substantially offset the foreign exchange rate headwinds, as well as low client incentive levels than previously presumed.","Third, our expectation for higher client incentive levels in the third quarter did not come to pass due to lower payment volumes and performance adjustments in specific geographies, as well as the timing and impact of certain issuer deal renewals. Some of these client incentives are shifting to the fourth quarter as these deals are signed. As a result, client incentives will be higher in the fourth quarter, both in dollars and as a percent of gross revenue. Despite this, we now expect client incentives for the full fiscal year at the low end of the 17.5% to 18.5% range.","Finally, we revalued the Visa Europe put option, taking $110 million non-cash, non-operating expense. The increase in value of this liability was a result of an increase in estimated Visa Europe adjusted sustainable income. As a reminder, US GAAP requires us to estimate the put option liability each quarter.","Moving on to the quarter\u2019s business drivers and our financial results. Global payments volume growth in constant dollars for the June quarter continue to be solid at 11%, in line with the March quarter. The US grew 9% and international grew 14%. In the June quarter, US credit grew 12%, flat compared to the March quarter, as the effects of the Chase conversion begin to wane. ","US debit grew at 6% in the June quarter, down about 0.5 point compared to the March quarter. Gasoline prices continue to have a significant negative impact, reducing growth in aggregate US payment volumes by approximately 3 percentage points. We continue to see the largest share of these savings going to debt repayment and stronger consumer balance sheet.","International payments volume growth of 14% was powered by China, the Middle East, southeastern Europe, and South Asia. The modest uptick in growth rates versus last quarter was driven by the initiation of domestic payments volume reporting by a large Chinese bank. More recently through July 21, US payments volume growth was 10%, with US credit growing 12%, and debit 8%, not materially different from Q3 trends.","Global cross border volumes registered their third consecutive quarter of 8% constant dollar growth, though the international component declined 1 point to 9% compared to the March quarter. As has been the case all year, out-bound corridors of Russia, Canada and Brazil remain challenged. Brazil, in particular, was hurt both by a weak currency on issuing, and lapping the FIFA World Cup on acquiring. The strong dollar has continued to depress in-bound commerce into the US.","As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we're monitoring travel into South Korea due to the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus, also known as MERS, and the impact on out-bound Chinese travel from the recent equity market correction.","In Venezuela, currency controls have effectively shut down the cross border business for private banks. The bolivar continues to depreciate, and we have moved to local currency collection. All this will significantly reduce revenues from our Venezuelan business for the foreseeable future.","On the positive front, out-bound US spending remains robust, as well as cross border trends across the rest of Latin America, Asia-Pacific, and the Middle East. Through July 21, cross border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 8%, with a US growth rate of 7%, and an international growth rate of 8%.","Transactions processed through Visa\u2019s network totaled $18 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period, but down 3% from the March quarter. The US grew 8%, while international delivered 7% growth.","As most of you know, in Russia, we transferred domestic processing to the new national processor NSPK in April. This resulted in an aggregate 2 point decline in process transaction growth in the June quarter. We expect this drag on process transaction growth to continue for the next three quarters, approaching almost 3 percentage points each quarter. Through July 21, process transaction growth was 8%, with a US growth rate of 10%, and an international growth rate of 1%. The international growth rate, of course, being impacted by Russia.","Now to financial results. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.5 billion, a 12% year-over-year increase, and was driven by solid results across all revenue line items. Strong global payments volume drove service revenue to $1.6 billion, up 9% over the prior year. The quarter also benefited from previously announced pricing actions. Data processing revenue was $1.4 billion, and grew 6% over the prior year's quarter based on continued strong growth rates in Visa-processed transactions, both in the US and internationally.","While on the subject of data processing revenue, let me call out a dynamic associated with the transition of Russia domestic processing to the NSPK. While we are no longer processing these domestic transactions, we continue to own the issuer-client relationships. For this reason, we will continue to recognize the associated processing revenue in our data processing revenue line. This will be offset by payments to NSPK for the actual processing, which will flow through our network and processing expense line. In short, the revenues stay the same as before, but our expenses will increase.","International transaction revenue grew 21% to $1 billion as the impact from the previously announced pricing actions and higher currency volatility offset soft cross border volume growth. As expected, total operating expenses for the quarter were up 11% over the prior year. Higher personnel costs were the key driver, impacted by above normal employee incentive accruals, tied to better than expected year-to-date performance.","In terms of the fiscal fourth quarter, we still expect net revenue growth to approach double digits, despite continuing foreign exchange rate head winds, and higher client incentives than we had in the third quarter. Expense growth rates will moderate from Q3 levels, with the full-year growth rate coming in as we expected in the mid single-digit range, which is a couple of points higher than current consensus. For fiscal 2015, we now expect to end with double-digit constant dollar net revenue growth, and mid-teens adjusted EPS growth.","We were active in the market in the quarter, repurchasing a total of 15.5 million shares at an average price of just over $68. Fiscal year-to-date, we have purchased 44.1 million shares at a price of just under $66 per share for a total of $2.9 billion. We currently have authorization to repurchase up to $2.8 billion of stock.","Finally, some early observations on fiscal 2016. As we look ahead, currency volatility could moderate from record levels, reducing the revenue contribution of cross border transaction. We will lose the benefit of recent conversions, and absorb the full-year impact of large deal renewals happening in the fourth quarter. Also, China startup costs remain unclear at this time.","On the positive front, we're heartened that despite an uncertain global economic environment, payment volume growth has remained steady and healthy. We hope that as the dollar stabilizes, cross border growth rates will accelerate. And in the US, we will lap the sharp declines in gas prices. We're working through the details of these and other headwinds and tailwinds, and how they might impact us next year. As we always do, we will provide a more comprehensive point of view when talk to you again after the fiscal fourth quarter.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.","Charlie Scharf","Thank you very much, Vasant. And good afternoon to everyone, and thank you all for joining us. I guess, let me start by just reiterating how pleased we are with our quarterly results. As Vasant mentioned, revenue growth of 12% was better than we anticipated, especially given the FX impact of about negative 3 points. Adjusted net income growth was 33% as our anticipated tax benefit was accelerated to the fiscal third quarter from a previously expected fourth quarter.","Adjusted earnings per share of $0.74, excluding the revaluation of the Visa Europe put option, and including $0.12 from the tax benefit I just mentioned. Payments volume growth of 11% on a constant-dollar basis, the effect of a strong US dollar and lower gasoline prices continued to negatively impact growth by three points. And processed transactions and cross-border volume both grew at 8%.","Overall, our results were especially pleasing given that we continue to see very little change in the overall global economy, with a few exceptions. We are hopeful, but not counting on an improvement in the US economy, but we see very little improvement with the US consumer in our numbers thus far, if any. There are positive signs in employment and housing, and the accumulated savings from lower gas prices should help, but we'll have to wait and see. Internationally, we see continued weakness in Brazil and Russia, but we see strength in southeastern Europe and parts of Asia-Pacific.","I'd like for a second to just address the topic of Visa Europe for a moment. As you may have read in our earnings press release and 10-Q filing, we've updated our language regarding the put option valuation, which Vasant just covered. Separately, we announced that we're in discussions with Visa Europe about a potential business combination. I've said many times that we believe there is compelling logic for both Visa, Inc., and Visa Europe to merge, and is something we would like to pursue. So this should not be a surprise to anyone.","We\u2019re targeting to resolve these discussions quickly, certainly by the end of October, and we'll provide an update during the fourth quarter earnings call, if not sooner. Given these discussions, we may be restricted from buying back our stock. There's also no assurance that any transaction will ultimately be agreed or implemented. At this time, there's really nothing more we can add, and won't comment beyond what I've said here, or disclosed in our 10-Q. Rest assured that when there is an update to be made, we'll do so in a public forum.","Let me move on now and talk about our business, and let me start with our client-related activity, which I feel great about. Starting with our issuing co-brands, we renewed our co-brand credit card partnership with Southwest Airlines in the United States. Visa will continue to be the exclusive payment network for Southwest's terrific co-brand credit card. This renewal is an extension of our 15-year-long standing partnership with Southwest Airlines. It represents one of our largest and fastest-growing co-brand partnerships in the world.","We renewed an important co-brand partnership with Avios, the loyalty program for British Airways and Iberia, a partnership with Visa covering the United States, Canada, Bermuda, and the Caribbean. AAA extended our longstanding 37-year credit card partnership agreement. We also renewed the credit card portfolio for Wyndham Rewards, the loyalty program for Wyndham Hotel Group, the world's largest hotel company based on number of hotels.","And turning to our business internationally, we renewed our strategic credit partnership with Shinhan Card, the largest issuer in Korea, and Lotte, another top-10 issuer in Korea for debit and credit. Softbank SB, Japan's third-largest mobile carrier has partnered with Visa to launch a new pre-paid card offering to their 37 million subscribers. And Gazprombank, one of Russia's largest financial institutions, renewed a multi-year debit and credit agreement.","Let me make a couple of comments about China. I don't have very much to add since we last talked about it last quarter, but I want to reiterate a couple of things. We continue to move forward with our work to enter the domestic Chinese payments market, and look forward to growing our investment within China. ","Our business model, as you all know, is about partnership with banks, retailers, governments, and technology companies. We believe our ability to help them grow will help accelerate broader economic growth within China, both in the cities as well as the rural areas. And we continue to view this as a significant and important opportunity, and one which is very long term in nature.","Vasant talked a little bit about Russia. Here we completed the full migration of our domestic transaction processing to the NSPK in accordance with the law. As Vasant said, Visa is now only processing cross-border transactions into and out of Russia.","And our work to transform commerce and build out digital payment platforms to support our clients continues. First on Visa Checkout, we continue to gain momentum. We have over 270 financial institution partners globally. We have over 160,000 merchants who are currently live globally, with over $50 billion in total addressable volume. New merchant partners include US companies such as Under Armour, Taco Bell, Dunkin' Donuts, Williams-Sonoma, Eddie Bauer, Living Social in Canada, and Starbucks in Australia.","To date we have over 5 million registered users, and we\u2019ve launched Visa Checkout in 16 markets around the world. New markets include China, Hong Kong, New Zealand, Singapore, Brazil, Colombia, the UAE, and South Africa, to name a few. We continue to see great reactions from our merchant clients, and have launched several new global marketing campaigns, including with Dunkin' Donuts, Zulily, and Fandango in the US; and Cineplex theaters and Indigo Books and Music in Canada.","Second, we continue to expand the Visa token service. More than 2,300 financial institutions and banking partners are participating. In addition, Apple Pay in the US and Google globally. International expansion of our token service will begin later in the fall within our US, Canada, and Asia-Pacific regions, and allows us to begin tokenizing Visa Checkout.","Third, we continue to build out our capabilities to support our merchant partners. We are partnering with Verifone in a way that enables merchants to offer their customers a more streamlined secured purchase experience across digital and face-to-face commerce environments. Verifone will connect its point-of-sale gateway to Visa's CyberSource global merchant payment management platform, providing merchants with a single platform to protect customer payment data, mitigate fraud, and integrate digital and off-line payment systems.","Last, but equally important, is payment security. Obviously, this is an area which is evolving, and for us we're doing everything we can to differentiate ourselves through innovation. Given the current cyber-threat landscape, especially facing merchants, we're committed to developing solutions to help the industry better detect and respond to data breaches.","We announced a partnership with FireEye to bring the first of its kind cyber-security capabilities to the payments industry, and extend our combined expertise and intelligence to acquirers, merchants, and issuers of all size. The Visa and FireEye community threat intelligence system will bring together threat information from both companies, allowing merchants and Visa clients to easily access our leading knowledge of cyber-attack data to quickly detect and respond to the attacks. These new solutions will focus on minimizing risks and vulnerabilities, and detecting and responding to breaches faster.","On a final note, regarding FIFA and football, for our investors, but also our clients and all of our partners. We view the stewardship of our company, our brand, and our clients with the utmost importance, and try to hold ourselves to the highest standards. We seek to partner with those who think and act like us. I don't believe that FIFA is living up to these standards. Furthermore, their subsequent responses, in my opinion, are wholly inadequate, and continue to show lack of awareness of the seriousness of the changes which are needed.","To this end, we believe two things need to happen to ensure credible reform. First, an independent third-party commission, led by one or more impartial leaders is critical to formulate reforms. Second, we believe no meaningful progress can be made under FIFA's existing leadership. Football itself is a great sport for which we are proud to be associated, and we want to be proud to be associated with FIFA, and hope and look forward to working with them to that end.","To close, I just want to reiterate that we are pleased with our financial performance to date. Although we will provide full-year 2016 metrics next quarter, we feel good about our business, our performance, and our innovation initiatives, which should drive our success in the future. And as a reminder, we have nothing incremental to say about our discussions with Visa Europe.","With that, Vasant and I are ready to take your questions.","Jack Carsky","Jamie, we\u2019re ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Togut, Evercore ISI. Sir, your line is now open.","David Togut","Thank you, good afternoon. Charlie?","Charlie Scharf","How are you?","David Togut","Very good, thanks. Could you talk about your strategic options in Europe in the event that you don't consummate an agreement with Visa Europe? In particular, have you looked at possibly acquiring some of the domestic payment networks in Europe?","Charlie Scharf","Listen, we have and I have talked about this broadly, as well. We have a terrific relationship with Visa Europe today. We have been operating in the fashion that we have been operating now since we\u2019ve gone public. We work closely together on a day in and day out basis. And they have responsibility for the business and the brand in Europe, and we do everything we can to enable them, and vice versa. And that's the relationship that we would see continuing if these conversations didn't move forward.","David Togut","Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Jamie, next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Chris Brendler","Hi. Thanks, good evening. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to talk about the strong growth in cross-border revenue this quarter, how sustainable that is, and whether or not you see additional opportunities for pricing down the road? Thanks.","Vasant Prabhu","Yes we had, as you saw, good growth in cross-border. It's a few things. We talked about the geographies that are doing well, and some -- we were helped on cross-border revenue growth by two other things, as you know, pricing and also by currency volatility, so we got spread revenues that flow through that line. As we look ahead, I think if the dollar starts to moderate, a big chunk of our business is somewhat depressed right now, which is the commerce into the US, and several corridors are soft, like Brazil, which was hurt in a couple of different ways, Russia, et cetera. ","So there is hope as we go into next year that with some of those things now lapping and the dollar hopefully stabilizing, that things could ramp up in terms of volume. On the other hand, volatilities may go back to more normal levels and would reduce that line. So a couple of different trends there, but all in all we feel good about it.","Chris Brendler","Excellent, fantastic results. Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Jamie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smitti S., Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","Smitti Srethapramote","I know it's early days so far, but I was wondering if you could share with us qualitatively if the transactions that you're seeing taking place on Apple Pay and other mobile payment systems starting to take share away from cash transactions from consumers who use it, or is it mainly just a basic substitution of classic for mobile at the moment?","Charlie Scharf","I honestly don't think we have enough real data yet to talk intelligently about it. All I can talk about is my own experience, which is I've been using it for both. But, I mean, when we have more acceptance, and we start to see more transactions, we'll have a much better feel and we'll make sure we share that.","Smitti Srethapramote","That\u2019s fair enough. Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Jamie?","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, guys. Can you talk a little bit about your competitive strategy against PayPal now that they are independent, and to what degree you view them as a competitor, and what sort of specific competitive initiatives you have in place?","Charlie Scharf","Sure. I've talked about our relationship with PayPal in the past. I'm not sure it changes vary dramatically, whether they're owned as part of a broader company or they're independent. Something like half the transactions that go through eBay wallets are on general purpose cards, of which we are roughly half, and that's important. But they also have a very big business that they then use our transactions to mine from, to disintermediate our clients' relationship with us, and the client's relationship with our clients, ultimately which are their banks. And so that's something which is -- which has to evolve, and is not something that we think is sustainable for the long term. ","Our view is when we think about what we have got to do in the market place, we actually don't spend a lot of time thinking about what PayPal is doing or what we're doing any more or less than we look at all the interesting people \u2013 things that people are doing in the world of digital commerce. What we're focused on is the fact that we're lucky enough to have a platform and have a client base where we're the leader in the payments business globally. Commerce is moving to digital platforms. ","Forget about all of our competitors or people who want to compete with us. We're doing everything that we can to ensure that we're going to be as successful in the world of digital commerce as we have been face to face. And so to that end, you see our solutions in the marketplace such as Visa Checkout, which I obviously covered here and I've talked about elsewhere. But it also relates to all the other mobile solutions and digital solutions that you've heard us talk about, everything from our token service to the digital enablement program, as well as even more broadly opening up APIs and access, and allowing others to access our services in a way that inserts us as the payments network into experiences that people are building. So that's what we're focused on, and it's very much focused on the opportunity that exists in the world, and not any one individual company out there.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific, thanks.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Lisa.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Napoli, William Blair. Your line is now open.","Bob Napoli","Thank you. I know you said nothing on Visa Europe, but maybe this is something you could answer. When you did change the valuation on the put option, can you tell us what you're looking at, like what information you're looking at to change that? And then I know there was a formula out there, put call for buying it, is that \u2013 if the transaction happens, would it be under that previous contract formula?","Vasant Prabhu","Yes, I'll talk about how we go about the put valuation. And in general, I think we're not commenting anything on the transaction discussions themselves, but we do have to revalue the puts every quarter, and it has to be done on the basis of updated information, the most up to date information we have. And based on that, we did that again this quarter and as a result of that, we came up with a value that is reflected in our Q. And that is the formula that we\u2019ve used, I believe for the entire eight years that the put has been in place and it relates to making estimates of what a sustainable net income would be and then there is a multiple applied to that, all of which is described some detail. ","So when you run through that based on the information \u2013 the best information we now have to estimate sustainable net income for Visa Europe, and you look at the multiples you have to apply, methodology being exactly the same as what we've used before, you get to the value we laid out in our 10-Q. So that's pretty much all there is to it. There really isn't anything different than we've done before.","Charlie Scharf","The only thing that I would add to that is that and as I referenced, we spend a lot of time with Visa Europe because we're connected at the hip. And it's very clear that with their change in leadership over the last year and a half, they have moved to a more commercial model, and increased what they would view as the economic that they are providing for their clients. And that translates through to this view of sustainable income that we've been able to observe that Vasant just referenced. ","Jack Carsky","Jamie, next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig from Autonomous, your line is now open.","Charlie Scharf","Craig, are you there?","Craig Maurer","Yes, can you hear me?","Charlie Scharf","Hi, Craig. We got you. How are you?","Craig Maurer","Okay. I have a question on commercial card. We've been seeing weakening trends across several issuers, including AMEX and USB, and I was hoping that you could comment on what you're seeing in that segment?","Vasant Prabhu","Yes, in general we had a good quarter on the commercial card. Volume growth in the US for commercial payments \u2013 volume is 10% in the June quarter. It continues to perform well. We renewed several multi-year US and Canadian clients. There's a lot of interest from non-financial institution participants who want to provide value-added services within the payments and commercial payments industry. These would be things like technology providers or health care entities and B2B programs, entertainment verticals, and so on. So all in all, we feel pretty good.","Charlie Scharf","The only thing I would add to it is that when we look at the detail behind the numbers, you actually do see a fair amount of divergence based on the type of clients that you have. So clients that are focused on the oil industry, and it's a long list of them, you do see fairly significant weakness, which is to be expected. But on a portfolio basis, there are other types of businesses that are performing much better. So overall, we do get here in the US that 10% number, but a lot more differentiation than at least we've seen recently.","Craig Maurer","And is virtual card starting to play a big role in commercial payments?","Charlie Scharf","Honestly, it's still very small, but obviously something we're focused on and growing.","Craig Maurer","Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Jamie?","Operator","One moment. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani, KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Hey, just philosophically, I was wondering if you could rehash, Charlie, how you would think about a large M&A transaction and the criteria you would use to assess its value, and kind of go forward with the deal? Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","Sure. What we've said consistently is first of all, we would start with \u2013 our first preference would be to grow organically. We've got facing assets and we've got amazing people here that have built great things without having to rely a lot on acquisitions. And that really \u2013 and it genuinely is our first and foremost way that we want to go about building things. Having said that, there are certainly times when it makes sense to buy things. I always like to point back to the three things that we've done so far, as the type of things that we think could continue to make sense.","CyberSource was the most significant acquisition that we've done in the payment space, and we're not looking to get outside the payment space. Things that we do want to strengthen the benefits that our clients get of running transactions over our core network. And CyberSource allowed us to broaden the capabilities that we had in the online space. So just in the core of the business, but made tremendous sense for us.","We then bought a company called PlaySpan, which at the core of what we from PlaySpan was technology and people. And those people and that technology is what built and powers Visa Checkout today. It wasn't for the rest of the business at PlaySpan; the rest of it was actually very small. And then the Fundamo business, which got us far more engaged and understanding, and brought us some capabilities in the mobile payment space in the emerging markets.","And so, as we look at the type of transactions that we're looking at, what we've said is, there is -- Europe is the big one that could be on our radar screen because that put exists, and because of this compelling logic and beyond that we're mostly focused on smaller things that again would add to the capabilities of the existing network that we have.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Is there a specific financial criteria that you would look at?","Charlie Scharf","No, I think every one of these deals were different. I mean, take the deal that I just described. You evaluate them differently, including what it would cost you to go build something versus acquiring it, and how much time it would take to get to market, and what that would be.","I did not talk about a fourth company because it's small, but very important that we just acquired called TrialPay, which inserts us into the merchant to merchant offers business. We bought that because we thought it was important to get in the market sooner, and the time it would take to build it would be much longer than that. So, each one of these I think would have a very different rationale, and if it was a big enough transaction that we would talk about the economics, we know we would have to have compelling logic, both strategically and financially for you all.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller, Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.","Darrin Peller","Straightforward, but just one question. I mean, it looks like -- I think we saw a shelf was filed. So, whether or not something actually happens with Visa Europe, can you just remind us again how you think about balance sheet flexibility or debt leverage possibilities? And then really, just in terms of capital structure and use of cash, I think you mentioned there could be restrictions on buybacks. Is that included in your guidance for the year? Thanks, guys.","Vasant Prabhu","Yes, I\u2019ll. In terms of a Visa Europe transaction -- if it happen, should it happen, when it happens -- we've always said that we would be viewing that transaction as an opportunity to do two things at one time. Clearly, it's a great transaction in terms of reuniting the Visa family, but beyond that we would also use that as the trigger to put in place a long-term capital structure. I don't think our views on that have changed much. In terms of the second question, Jack, was there another question on that one?","Darrin Peller","It was around buybacks, and whether or not \u2013","Vasant Prabhu","Oh, on buybacks, yes. As you know, I mean, there are certain rules under which companies can and cannot buy back stock depending on the information that is either available or not, and how material it is, and all that. It is our sort of sense at this point that we might not be able to buy back stock in the quarter, but things can change.","Darrin Peller","Is that in your guidance already?","Vasant Prabhu","In terms of our -- its impact on our guidance, if we end up not buying back stock for the entire quarter that's what happens. It will have some modest impact on this year. It will certainly have some impact on next year, depending on whether we catch up later on and so on. So, there's a fair number of variables there. It depends on how long we're not buying, and how fast we catch up all those kinds of things.","Charlie Scharf","For one quarter it's not that significant.","Vasant Prabhu","Yeah, for one quarter, as you can run the numbers yourselves, it won't be that significant. But it is certainly different than what we might have expected when we last talked to you. So, you should definitely factor that in.","Darrin Peller","All right. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Perlin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Perlin","I want to revisit a comment you made earlier about -- let's just say competitors who use your information to mine data to ultimately change behavior away from your bank partners. I'm just wondering would the operating rules that you set forth in VDEP be a means with which to preclude that practice from happening?","Charlie Scharf","Well, in VDEP -- VDEP does address the usage of our clients' data. So, the answer to the question is absolutely and I think the reality is we sit between a series of people that participate in payment systems. It used to be just the issuers and the acquirers and the merchants.","Now there are additional parties being introduced to that. And we do think it is our responsibility to all of our clients to ensure that data is being used appropriately and the way they want and that's two ways. So, whether it's issuer data that passes over our network, the issuer should be comfortable with and if it's merchant data that happens to pass over our network, the same is true there. So, VDEP is one means, but it's a broader concept that we do take very seriously.","Dan Perlin","Okay, thank you.","Vasant Prabhu","I just want to clarify, if I wasn't clear earlier, that when we talked about our full-year mid-teens, that does envision the possibility that we might not be buyers of our stock in the fourth quarter.","Jack Carsky","Jamie, next question?","Operator","Our next questions comes from Jason from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks, guys. Just a clarification and a question. Clarification is just on the revenue guidance for the year. Is there any minor tweak up here at all, because I know you're still saying kind of low-double digits, but I think you had been saying the low end of low-double digits previously? I'm not sure if I heard that same language on today's call. Or is the only change in the revenue outlook just the extra half point of currency headwind?","Vasant Prabhu","Yeah, we were sort of rounding down to 2% last quarter. We're rounding up to 2.5%. So, the currency effect is -- has been growing through the year. I think the only thing we would say is the third quarter came in clearly better than we expected, because currency volatilities were higher. The incentive piece moved some into the fourth quarter. So, I think, as we said earlier, incentive levels both in dollar and rate terms, percent terms, will be higher in the fourth quarter. So, we said last time that we would expect revenue to approach double-digits in the fourth quarter, and that is still our best estimate for the fourth quarter.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay. And then just a clarification is on the incentive adjustments in certain geographies that I think you mentioned is one of the reasons why the incentive line came in lower than expected. What exactly was that? Did some issuers have to pay back some incentives to Visa?","Vasant Prabhu","No, it's a couple of situations that varies depending on the geography. Volumes don't come in as expected, so they don't earn the incentives that we or they might have expected, so it hits you both on the gross revenue line and the net revenue line and on the incentive line. And then in a particular few situations, there are unique things in contracts that are resolved within the quarter. ","Charlie Scharf","It's also just flat-out timing of when things get signed. Remember, when we -- that's a little bit of -- I like to talk about this internally. Just we have to do budgets and we give you guidance, but we really don't know as we look out in the future what the timing of our clients are going to be, and how different negotiations will actually take place. So, when we come to an agreement with a client, it then needs to be documented. The processes and the timing is usually driven by them.","Very often they need to go through their own approvals and it's very, very easy for these things to slip by weeks or even a month, if not more, depending on how far out we're looking and so, that's just a very natural thing that happens, which is hard for us to predict and hard for us to control.","Vasant Prabhu","Yeah, in this quarter we had a few of those -- a few international banks that moved into the fourth quarter, and will get done in the fourth quarter and that's the timing issue.","Jason Kupferberg","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Vasant, I just wanted to ask -- can you help us quantify the impact price changes had on the quarter, and maybe what percentage of the price changes have showed up in the third, and do we expect the full impact in the fourth?","Vasant Prabhu","Yeah, as I told you last time, there will be some modest additional impact in the fourth quarter. One of the price changes and that was coming in with a little bit of a lag, so there will be a modest -- it's a small uptick in price impact. But yeah, I don't think we specifically quantified the price impact in total, but it hits two lines, the service revenue line and the international line.","And it's those two prices increases we took -- just to remind everybody, it's the increase in the US acquirer service fee on all credit products, which went up by two basis points, and the international service assessment fee, which increased 40 bps for transactions in US dollars and 80 bps for transactions not in US dollars. And there will be a little more impact in the fourth quarter than there was in the third.","Bryan Keane","Okay, helpful. Just one quick one. Will the intangibles associated if there is an acquisition of Visa Europe will be amortized or will it be long-lived?","Vasant Prabhu","Well, that is getting very far ahead of things right now. If there is a transaction, if and when, and once the details are clear, we can talk about all that.","Bryan Keane","All right, super. Thanks, guys.","Jack Carsky","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Greene, I\u2019m sorry, from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Glenn Greene","Thank you. Just wanted to go back to the incentives conversation. Obviously it was lower than I think most of us thought in the quarter, and it sounded like it was timing. Does some of that timing kind of bleed into next year and I don't know, Vasant, if you're trying to call out that incentives as a percentage of gross revenue increase going into FY16? Just to clarify, did you have incentives meaningful for Costco, or does that kind of happen when the volumes come on?","Vasant Prabhu","Yeah, I think it's too early to give you any particular point of view on 2016. We'll do that when we talk to you in October and we'll also talk about Costco and its impact on 2016 and so on. As it stands today, the incentives -- the deals we were thinking we would get done this year are still looks -- still look like they're going to get done this year. So, we'll probably see the full-year impact of them next year, but it doesn't seem like any of them are moving into next year at this point.","Charlie Scharf","The only thing I would add is just on Costco for a second is Costco -- the impact to us of Costco is next year for us fiscally. So, that\u2019s -- whether it's incentives, whether it's volume, revenue associated with it, that's when you'll see the impact of Costco. And then the other thing I would add is, because we've -- those of you that have been covering us for a long time know this, we do view our incentives going up as a good thing. Incentives go up when we're driving more business through the system and so, that wouldn't be a surprise to us.","Glenn Greene","Okay, great. Thanks for the clarification.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Jamie?","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin from Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Kevin McVeigh","Great, thank you. I wonder, is there any type of sensitivity to think about relative to the FX volatility, in terms of a certain band of volatility, how it impacts the revenue because obviously, you've seen a nice pick-up and not to get '16 specific, but just any band in terms of how it impacts that revenue?","Vasant Prabhu","Yes, I mean there's two dimensions here. And in this quarter, you probably saw both dimensions at play. One, I believe there's publicly available information on currency volatilities and different metrics you can look at, so at least you can get a relative sense of how currency volatility is doing versus last year or prior quarter, or on a multi-year basis and so on, and it's been high.","The other thing that also had an impact on this quarter was the year-over-year comparison. This was a quarter, where not only were volatilities high in this quarter this year, but they were unusually low or lower than they've been recently in the third quarter of last year. So we sort of benefited from both things, when you look at a year-over-year comparison. But you can look at external data to track some of this.","Jack Carsky","Next question?","Operator","Next question comes from Ken Bruce of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Ken Bruce","Thank you. Good evening. My question relates to the co-brand partnerships and just general issuing partnerships. It's really is independent of any one. But I guess if you could step back and look at there's been a lot of discussion about the increasing competitiveness on some of these deals. I'm hoping you might be willing to share some observations from your position at the table as to how the balance of power, if you will, is shifting -- if there's any clear direction of who's kind of capturing more of the economics, or just how things have evolved over the last couple of years?","Charlie Scharf","Sure. Listen, I think it's a -- co-brands are certainly a very competitive part of the business, especially here in the United States. We've been lucky enough to have a significant number of the large and successful ones. And so when you're the big incumbent and they come up for renewal, they're always on your mind, and you're very tuned to what's going on in the competitive environment.","But just as we talk about on the issuer side, people ask about well, is the issuer side getting more competitive in terms of the way networks think about it? And I think the reality is since we've gone public, there's been an extraordinary amount of competition between us and our competitors on these deals. And you see that competition embedded in the numbers that we've all been printing for years now. So the answer is yes, you see it in the co-brand space. But I also think that the co-brand business and the issuing side of the business, there has been more concentration that has developed.","The other thing, which I think is becoming quite important now, is with the evolving nature of payments and things that are going on, whether it's issuers or co-brands, I think what we wind up seeing is that our clients are making very significant strategic decisions at this point relative to who they want their payments partner to be.","They're not talking about this as a commodity. They're not talking about just network services is something you need to look at in terms of just what the price is. They're sitting there saying payments is an important part of my business, whether I'm a co-brand partner, because these are my most important clients; or on the issuing side, where they say payments is core to what I do. I need someone that's going to help me navigate and be successful in this brave new world of digital commerce and evolving payments that we live in, and I need to pick the very best partner to do that.","We're thrilled with the success that we've had -- not just with Costco, but Southwest as you've seen, is a terrific partner, and other conversations that we have ongoing. So the answer is yes, financially they are competitive. Again, we've seen that. That's to be expected. But there are two parts to the conversation.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Jamie?","Operator","Our next question comes from James Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider","Good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. Charlie, I was wondering if you could give us any more color on China in terms of -- and understanding that it's still early days and you have limited visibility -- but do you have any sense in terms of the restrictions you might be subject to when you do eventually enter that market? And if not, can you give us any kind of road map for when you expect to see greater clarity on those rules?","Charlie Scharf","So on the first piece the answer is no. What has been published is helpful relative to what we need to do in order to do the work to apply for licenses to start establishing the functions that have to reside in China. So those have been very, very helpful. Relative to how regulations evolve, and what the actual business would look like in China, that's a ways off. We do not have a tremendous amount of clarity on that yet. And I'm sorry, what was the second part of the question?","James Schneider","The timing for when you get more clarity?","Charlie Scharf","I don't know. No one knows. We live here in the United States and so we know our own system quite well, and we never know what timing looks like in this country. Listen, but listen, I think they -- the Chinese government has been -- the state council issued its decision. They've come out with some more information, which is certainly helpful. At this point, we've got -- we have plenty of information to do the work that we need to do to be in a position to apply for a license and to do the work. And honestly, that's what we're focused on. I mean, there's a lot of work for us to do, both to make the application, but also be in a position to be able to operate, if we're lucky enough to be issued one of those licenses. And that's what we're focused on.","As I've said, when we talk about this being a long-term opportunity, it's for some of these reasons you point out. We don't know exactly what the regulatory climate will ultimately be. We don't know exactly the role we will play until we actually get there. But we do believe that there is great value for all the participants in the market place for us to be helpful. So we feel very good about what we can do in the country, and what it means for us in the long-term. But again, it will likely be long term and not short term.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Jamie?","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great, thanks. Good quarter here. I want to ask on the delta from your reported 12% revenue growth and the 6% to 7% you expected. Can you break it down for us by component what each driver was, in terms of how big it was? I heard FX volatility, lower incentives. Did pricing stick maybe better than expected -- things like that?","Vasant Prabhu","No, I would say you got them. Volatility is, normally going into a quarter we don't assume that volatilities will stay at sort of the high levels they were last quarter because we assume things may settle down a bit, which they actually might in the fourth quarter, given things are settling down in Greece, and settling down in China and places like that. So it was the spread revenues from volatility. It was somewhat lower incentives. It was offset by exchange rates. So you got all the factors. The pricing didn't have an impact relative to what our expectations were. It was as we expected. So, I think you've said it.","Tien-tsin Huang","Okay. [indiscernible] the FX volatility and how big that was? Also separately on OpEx, were there any one timers that drove up the OpEx, or was that really just personnel? Thanks for taking the questions.","Vasant Prabhu","Yes on the OpEx, as we said, I mean, the year is progressing better than we might have expected, and so we made some adjustments as we normally do this time of the year in accruals for incentive compensation, that would probably be the single-biggest item that shows up in the expense growth. Other than that, the only thing I said in my comments was that we had exchange rate impacts of up to three points. And fortunately, the currency volatilities here are levels that offset a significant portion of that.","Tien-tsin Huang","Offset. Okay, both of that. Got it. Thanks so much.","Charlie Scharf","Jamie, at this point we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our last question will be coming from David from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open.","David Hochstim","Thanks. I have a two-part question. Is there any update on the EU's efforts to regulate in-bound cross-border fees?","Charlie Scharf","There's no update. Par two?","David Hochstim","Yes. If you could just expand on what you said about US credit payments volume growth, and how much of the deceleration was Chase-conversion related, and what you're seeing in the way of discretionary spending relative to last quarter?","Vasant Prabhu","Really no change whatsoever in terms of what we are seeing. There's a big impact on debit from the gas pricing, because I think three to one people use debit cards rather than credit cards. And yes the Chase conversion will continue to moderate, and will mostly be gone, I think, after the next quarter or so. That will mean that our credit payment volumes will reflect whatever the gas impact is. And the gas impact will also begin to moderate as we lap it. But in terms of how people are deploying their savings from gas, there really hasn't been any change. I think Charlie referred to that in his comments. So the US consumer remains okay, not great.","Jack Carsky","Well, thank you all very much for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up, feel free to call Investor Relations.

I just want to start by letting everyone know how excited I\u2019m to be part of Visa. After 10 years as some combination of an issue or a member of the Board, its great to be part of a team that I\u2019ve known for 10 years or so. And especially Byron and his team, whom I\u2019m going to embarrass him a little bit, he is even more impressive from inside the Company than he was from outside the Company as well as the team.","I do feel lucky to be part of what clearly is a growth Company and a growth industry. These times are exciting. We got some great competition out there, both from traditional players and from new players. But as I\u2019m going to talk a little bit here in the call, we love our position.","Well first, we\u2019re going to go through the quarter, which as you saw was very, very strong. And then even more importantly, I think once we go beyond that I\u2019m going to talk a little bit more about our continued strong investment in the future of the Company. And it's our confidence in that you can see is exhibited by the additional share repurchase authorization that\u2019s in today\u2019s announcement.","So Byron, going to walk through the quarter and then I\u2019ll come back and give you some more detail thoughts and leave plenty time for Q&A at the end.","Byron H. Pollitt","Thank you, Charlie. As its my practice, I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, Visa\u2019s 12% net revenue growth in the fiscal first quarter was once again broad based as we continue to see strong credit and debit growth in the U.S. and the Rest of World, as well as a return to positive growth in our worldwide debit business.","Second, client incentives for the quarter. As a percentage of growths revenue, we\u2019re 16.3% and below our full-year guidance. This was a result of both lower than expected deal activity in the quarter and timing issues associated with incentives to certain clients. We expect these payments to be realized in the coming quarters.","Third, aggregate U.S. debit payment volume posted a negative 4% growth rate in the fiscal first quarter of 2013 versus a negative 6% in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2012. Of note, Q1 Interlink payment volume growth was off 44% versus 48% in the September ending quarter.","Fourth, Visa\u2019s effective tax rate of 28.2% was positively impacted by a tax benefit recognized during the quarter as a result of new guidance issued by the State of California regarding apportionment rules. As a result we booked a credit of $76 million after tax representing about a $0.11 of EPS, which resulted in a significantly reduced tax rate for the quarter. This catch-up benefit is consistent with our full-year tax and EPS guidance.","Fifth, in wake of receiving preliminary court approval of the merchant litigation settlement agreement in December, we made a $4 billion cash payment from Visa's litigation escrow account to the Class Plaintiffs' settlement fund. This was in addition to $350 million paid out in October to the individual merchants. The net result of these payments will be to increase our free cash flow by about $1.6 billion this year, given our ability to deduct these payments from our U.S. tax return.","Lastly, we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders with a new $1.75 billion share repurchase program. To put this in perspective, during the quarter, we spent $1.3 billion to repurchase 9 million shares at an average price of about $145. At the end of fiscal Q1, we had 1.1 billion of remaining authorization to which we added the 1.75 billion bringing our total open to buy to just under $3 billion.","Our priorities for the use of this cash remain the same. First, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisitions and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the fiscal first quarter followed by our results through January 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2013.","Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 9%, up from the September quarter's 6%. More recently in the U.S. through January 28, payment volume growth was 5% compared with 3% in the December ending quarter. Both U.S. credit and debit experienced improved growth rates.","Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 11% constant dollar growth rate in the December quarter, which compares to a 10% rate in the September quarter. The U.S. grew 9%; rest of world 11%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions. Through January 28, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 12% with the U.S. growth rate of 10%, rest of world at 12%.","Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 14.2 billion in the fiscal first quarter, a 4% increase over the prior year period. A 4% decline in U.S. debit transactions was offset by a positive 21% growth in debit and credit in the rest of world. Note that as we begin to lap the impact of changes in U.S. debit regulations, we expect our U.S. debit metrics to show improved results.","Consistent with that dynamic through January 28, processed transaction growth was a positive 6% driven by an improving trajectory in U.S. processed transaction growth. Separately, CyberSource reported 1.6 billion transactions for the period, a 28% increase over the prior period.","Now let's turn to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.8 billion, a 12% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth in global payment volumes, data processing revenues, international revenues and as mentioned earlier lower than anticipated client incentives. After hedges, there was no meaningful foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter.","Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 13% over the prior year period. Revenue growth exceeded constant dollar payment volume growth of 6% largely due to the decline in Interlink, a debit product that does not generate service revenues.","Data processing revenue was $1.1 billion, up 17% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions outside the U.S., strong CyberSource transaction growth as well as strategic pricing actions taken last year related to the restructuring of our pricing in the U.S. debit market.","International transaction revenue was up 8% to $805 million, reflecting solid strength in cross-border volumes. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 16.3% lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to the timing of deals and certain incentive payments.","In future quarters we anticipate a step up in incentive levels as a percentage of gross revenue consistent with our full-year guidance expectations of 18% to 18.5%. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1 billion, up 13% from the prior-year. This was primarily due to higher personnel and professional fees associated with investments in our growth strategies.","Marketing expenses were up a modest 2% from the prior-year as the first half of the year tends to be our quietest and will ramp up over the year in line with our guidance of under $1 billion for fiscal 2013. Operating margin for the quarter was 63%, well slightly ahead of our full-year guidance of about 60, this margin level is consistent with how we planned for the year. As noted earlier, our effective tax rate for Q1 was 28.2%. The lower rate for the quarter was primarily due to a favorable clarification in the apportionment rules for the State of California. The resulting benefit was related to prior periods. That said, the Q1 tax rate is fully consistent with our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%.","Finally, capital expenditures were a $100 million in the quarter in line with our full-year expectations. The adjusted weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fiscal first quarter totaled $669 million. Other than the change in free cash flow guidance to about $6 billion, there are no other changes to our fiscal guidance.","And with that, I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Charlie.","Charles W. Scharf","Thanks a lot Byron. I thought maybe what I would do being new to the Company is start by just talking about my view of the Company, the way I think about it, and then move into priorities. And I guess, I\u2019d frame my thoughts on the Company by starting off with the fact that having been here for three months and been around the world spending time with people here, I am more bullish today about the opportunities that we have than the day I joined. And I think that\u2019s true about the short-term and the long-term, and let me just go through some reasons why.","First of all, as you all know the resiliency of the business model really is something pretty special. Everyone is aware of the global economic environment, the conditions that we have been working through. The important thing for us is that we continue to have the ability to deliver through the economic cycle.","Second of all, and I wouldn\u2019t underestimate this issue which is that, there\u2019s a clear desire and a need for our product both socially and economically. And when you travel around the world it comes through loud and clear. Our products help economies grow and they help people of all wealth levels, as well as merchants and governments of all sizes. And again especially once you leave the United States as you talk to the governments, as you talk to merchant\u2019s that is the message that we get loud and clear.","And then we also can\u2019t forget about this huge number of 2.5 billion people across the world that don\u2019t have access to the formal financial system today. And our products that we offer can bring them into it. It really is something overtime that will improve their lives and improve the economies in the countries that they live in and help advance those countries. And obviously as you\u2019ve seen from things like Rwanda and some other stuff we\u2019ll talk about those great government interest in doing that.","Third, there's a strong secular trend that's clear. This continued growth in electronification of payments which we\u2019ve been living through is going to continue. Importantly, the way we think about it here first and foremost we compete with cash and checks. After that we compete with others in the market place, but there\u2019s so much cash and check across the globe is still somewhat astonishing and even more astonishing the price getting bigger. There\u2019s more cash today than there was five years ago. And so this is just obviously a great opportunity for us in the market that we play in.","Fourth, we have an enviable competitive position. You all know the share numbers, but it's just not share. It's the relationships that we have across the globe. It's the fact that we're a trusted partner in the payments industry, because of both \u2013 what our brand is but also what we've actually delivered over a long period of time here. And again, when you go outside of the United States, the power of the brand just, it's something that people talk about over and over again.","And those opportunities outside of the United States are exciting. That's the fifth reason that I put in the bullish category because we've got huge opportunity in both developed and less developed countries outside the United States and I'll talk a little more of that in a second. The quality of the people at Visa across the globe is terrific. This company has been built by the people that have been here and it's great to be able to work even more closely with them.","And then the last thing I'll just talk about here is just our network for a second. I'm not sure we spend enough time talking about it, but it's obviously the core of who we are. But we have one global network and just a perspective of coming from outside the company very few global companies out there can say that they have one network across the globe. It's efficient, it's controlled, it's a great platform. And so to the extent we want to do things and scale them across the world, we can do them in a way that a lot of other industries would really struggle to do.","The networks been built over decades. We all know that it provides great global acceptance, clearing, authorization and settlement, but it's proven to be safe and secure. It's battletested through the years as though I think about it and we continue to invest aggressively because the world of cyber criminals is growing not shrinking, and I'd rather have our network than anyone else's at this point as we continue to build on that security. And this becomes a competitive advantage over time.","But beyond just the core capabilities of our network, the real differentiation for us is how we use it for our participants. And I think about our participants, issuers, acquirers, cardholders and merchants in this category. We have been and will continue to drive more functionality to benefit our customers. That's risk management, that's marketing, it's offers, it's things like that and we'll continue to extend access to the network and that's a big part of what our mobile activities are. And as long as we continue to do that, our network is far from a commodity.","So moving to priorities for a second, I think it's totally appropriate to be clear that my first priority is to make sure that we continue this momentum here. The quarter speaks for itself. The past few quarters \u2013 not few, the past quarters over an extended period of time here say an awful lot about the momentum that this company has. I could go through a long list of wins right now in the quarter, I'm not going to do that, I'm not sure we all get benefit from that. What I'd rather do is just focus on some examples of some interesting things that we're doing across the globe.","First example is Saral Money. It's a partnership with five leading clients, the Delhi state government and the Indian national identity system that links the national ID number with biometric information to provide instant authentication and complete a paperless process to open a bank account and issue a Visa debit or prepaid card instantly. It's terrific, it's in-market and something we're very excited about.","We also announced a strategic agreement with QIWI. QIWI is Russia's leading payment services provider. They provides digital wallet to more than 9 million active Russian customers who use them at more than hundred thousand cash kiosks. What our agreement really is all about is transitioning the wallet from a single bank model to a digital wallet with stored value account based upon Visa prepaid cards that can be issued by any Visa client bank. It will be a great product to have alongside our own product.","And then the country of Myanmar, we're bringing electronic payments to the country. We enabled the first credit card payment through Visa-branded wireless point-of-sale terminal and now credit debt in prepaid cards are able to be used in selected merchants. Another great example of the momentum that we have is V.me, our electronic wallet. I know you've heard about it, but it's actually -- it's real, it's live, it's in the market.","At the end of 2012, we had 31 merchant sites live. We have an additional 132 signed up through yesterday, I believe, and we have 63 issuers who have signed up to participate. Those issuers represent 55 million Visa cards, includes so far 12 of the top 25 U.S. banks, 51 U.S. regional banks and PNC and Bank of America have integrated V.me into their online banking websites. So I could go on about more things, but I thought I just turn out to some of the strategic priorities as I see them.","First and probably foremost is the continue to extend the electronification of payments. Its obvious, but the pie is so big here, the more we do its good for all. For us to be able to do that, we\u2019re going to have to figure out how to be more flexible. This organization got great history with great results, but if you go around and talk to issuers, acquirers, merchants, we can be a little too rules oriented and so we\u2019ve got to figure out how we become less focused on rules, while preserving what\u2019s important to keep the integrity of our network in place. By doing things like that, we can work with our customers to create more customized solutions and support issuers of all sizes. Not a small opportunity for us, its I think a big opportunity for us to partner more closely with our customers.","Next I would put the second biggest strategic priority, technology and innovation were generally. Again, my perspective here having, participated with the Company for a period of time is just great progress. Three years ago when I was still on the Board, there was very, very little going on here relative to using these new technologies to benefit us. It was still up the tail end of taking the Company public merging the entities and whatnot, and over the past three years the progress has been really terrific. I talked about V.me, again, its not an idea, its in the market today.","The work on mobile here continues, both organically and with the acquisition of Fundamo. It\u2019s a critical access point to a network and continued investment in that is absolutely critical for us. As we think about these capabilities and thinking about things that we do our \u2013 again, our focus is on extending the core network and access some capabilities of that network. We love the business we\u2019re in, we integrate business, that\u2019s the core of who we are to the network, its processing and the things that we\u2019re going to focus on will continue to be those things that support those core assets.","We\u2019re also going to continue to be completely focused on supporting our customers, and those are; it's the issuers and the acquirers and ultimately the card holders and the merchants, but it's through those \u2013 through our customers. We have no intention of disintermediating them. It's, they\u2019re too important for us and too much of an opportunity. And as we think about these technology investments and whatnot, the way, I have to think about it is, the more we work with our customers on these things, we teller our investments both with them and for them as we talk to them. We move to more of a partnership orientation as opposed to a vendor relationship.","People when you go, when you talk to people about our business, you can think about it two different ways. You can think about it as if, which we do know there are other people that do what we do with that core asset that we have. And one way to approach that from the outside is to look at it and say, who\u2019s the cheapest price out there? But in anything, no matter what you do in life there\u2019s always a cheaper price out there; and our job is to make sure that we provide more value and whether it's through the relationship building, whether it's through helping people marketing, whether it's using their data, using their information, building things like V.me, building mobile. All those things that we do create more value, and so that people look at us much more of a partner than a vendor over time.","Third priority, international growth, again not something new, you\u2019ve heard about this quite a bit. We\u2019ve got an off a lot going on. It is also, I think it's important to say. We love the United States. We love our position in the United States. We've got some really neat stuff going on here. So, it's not to say otherwise, but it's hard not to look at what the opportunity is outside the U.S. and say it's just large. It's all across the world. Here too it's booked short-term and long-term. Its large developed markets where there are big cash based economies like Japan, and there are merging market all over the world with very little acceptance as I\u2019ve referred to earlier.","We\u2019re investing aggressively here. We\u2019re opening new offices and adding people in country. In 2012 we opened six new offices, 17 expansions and more to come this year. We\u2019re growing acceptance. We\u2019re expanding cyber source globally. We're working closely with governments. It's a huge part of the effort to partner with governments, to push electronification of payments. And country by country, we've got very, very specific and very different strategies. Some parts of the world, NFC through payWave is extremely important in places like Canada and Australia and the products we have are extremely helpful to us in building our business there. Other places, its traditional debit, credit and prepaid. And other places we know the importance of mobile. So we're going to continue to invest here and take advantage of the large opportunity that we all know exists.","The next priority, number four, I would talk about merchant relationships. This is one where we provide great value for merchants. I absolutely believe that. And you've got examples like Square-type technology and pricing on those products out there which just shows you that people -- small merchants are willing to pay to electronify their world because they know how difficult and how expensive cash is.","Having said that, we also have to acknowledge that it's on us along with our issuers and acquirers that we do business with to prove to merchants day-in and day-out. Some believe it, and I've had conversations with plenty of merchants that think we do a great job partnering with them, but obviously there are an awful lot which are very vocal that don't believe that here in the United States, and again that's on us to figure out how to change the nature of that relationship.","So we need to do a whole lot more. It starts with engaging them very differently. I'm not talking about the courts through D.C., I'm talking about directly. We need to balance their issues with others in our value chain. It's just an extremely important concept that needs to permeate the way we think about our business. And most importantly, it's up to us to prove to them that we can actually help them grow.","We talk about this internally that Visa cardholders are the largest single source of potential spend in the world. And to the extent that we can work with merchants, again, through our issuers and acquirers and show them how we can add value to them in building their businesses, that's what we've got to do to change the nature of our relationship. And so we will be doing a lot more of that.","Employees, I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about employees as a priority because this is a business based upon the quality of the people that we have. We've got a great group of people here across the globe who I've gotten to know and it's my job to continue to create the most attractive environment, so we've got the best, the smartest and most vibrant thinking in this company.","Sixth, capital allocation and if you're sitting on the edge of your seat for something new, you're not going to get it. The company historically and I \u2013 I'd say first of all have great respect for the responsibility. We understand what it means and we understand what shareholders want. And as Byron has said in the past, our jobs are to put capital to use intelligently or return it to you and that's been a consistent theme since the IPO. Intelligently means investing it in our core assets, organically or through acquisitions like you've seen us do. But obviously if we don't see those opportunities, then we're going to return it to you through dividends and buybacks.","We're going to always prioritize what we're going to do based upon the returns for the shareholder and our goal is to reward shareholders that continue to own the stock. So, again, it's something that is hopefully a whole lot of consistency with my thinking and with the thinking that's been here.","And then the last priority I'll end with is the continuing open dialogue that Visa has had with the investor community. I certainly look forward to getting to know all of you. I know some of you. I look forward to getting to know many more of you, sharing my thoughts, our thoughts in more detail. And to that end, just so you know, we're working on planning of an Investor Day which we're going to firm up the timing and Jack will be back to you with the specifics relatively quickly on that.","So before we open it for Q&A, let me just start by saying a couple of things here. I hope you get the sense as I talk about how I feel about the opportunity here that the runway for growth is long and it's deep. As we think about what we do here, we've got to balance the short and the long term. And what that means is there is no long when you think about a short term, so we know we must deliver. But when people hear -- people like to ask the generic question of how you define success five years now?","To me, it's really all about -- we feel great about the opportunity for the next five years, but success is going to be that we're sitting here five years from now and we feel as good about the forward-looking growth as we do today. And if that doesn't happen, shame on us because we've got the assets and we've got the business to do that. And we are confident that we will do it.","So with that, I will stop and Byron and I are here to answer your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question will come from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Thanks and Charlie welcome abroad. I appreciate all the comments. Just wanted to pick up on one of the things you said in terms of Visa potentially becoming a little bit less rules oriented going forward. And I think you kind of elaborate on there and how soon we might see this? And then Byron, if you can just give us a quick clarification on the tax rate issue. It sounds like what you\u2019re saying is that you guys already had anticipated this tax benefit when you give the 30% to 32% full-year tax rate guidance and the high-teen VPS guidance for last quarter is that accurate?","Byron H. Pollitt","Why don\u2019t I start on the tax rate, that\u2019s correct, your tax rate is always comprised of components. This was a component that the timing of which uncertain. But this type of component was contemplated and as a result it\u2019s fully consistent with the guidance we gave at the end of last quarter.","Charles W. Scharf","And Jason I will take the question on flexibility. I think \u2013 the way to think about that one is \u2013 again, if you go around and you talk to issuers across the globe and if you talk to merchants and if you ask what is the negative quality of these, hopefully after they go the long list of positives, they will talk about that we\u2019re not as flexible as we could be, we got lots and lots of rules. And so what that means is they tend to get nervous that we can just change rules. They\u2019re not sure about how that might impact them in the future. And our goal should be that we got rules that protect the integrity and the value of our payments network. That\u2019s why they were put in place to begin with and they\u2019ve just grown over a period of time. So, what we have to do is \u2013 as the Company evolves it has become much more commercial figure, define the rules as those things that are quote \u2018who we\u2019re\u2019 and the protection of the value of our networks I described and then move other things into commercial arrangements that you would have with customers.","Operator","Our next question will come from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Hi, and let me add my congratulations on your first quarter with Visa. You talked earlier about the importance of a global network, but Visa is a separate entity from V.me \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, from Visa Europe, V.me well. Anyway Visa Europe and I wanted your thoughts on how long-term Visa Europe plays into the global strategy?","Charles W. Scharf","Yeah, listen, I mean yeah, I\u2019m sure you guys have talked for five years about the status of Visa Europe and the put and what not. I would say; we have a very close working relationship with Visa Europe. You are right to say that from a European perspective it's a separate system, but it's interoperable. But when we go to market, we work extremely closely with them, so that when customers deal with Visa, it is up to us to figure out how to coordinate with them. I\u2019ve spent time with some of our big global customers and the feedback is; it works well. There are other customers that like to deal with us as separate entities just as they would if we were one big company, would you design a company like this? No. But it's a fact of life and the puts the put and there\u2019s nothing more to say about it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research","Hi, good evening. Charlie, I look forward to working with you. I\u2019m just trying to get my hands around what Visa\u2019s strategy might look like as technology changes the industry; and Charlie how far do you think Visa might stray from it's historical role if exclusively a network in the middle, and by this I mean, developing more consumer facing initiatives like V.me. And then how would you reconcile this strategy with those of your constituent partners who often times are pursuing these same strategies so there could be some, your competitive or brand conflict there? Thank you.","Charles W. Scharf","Yeah. We\u2019re here to support the customers of our issuers and acquirers. That\u2019s the way we think about it. That\u2019s the way things are built here and that\u2019s the way things will continue to be build. So, something like V.me, we're building V.me on behalf of our customers. If you go use V.me, you will have to register for it so that your information gets in there. But from that point forward, it is completely supportive of our banks. When you pay for something using V.me, we have the ability to show the card art exactly as it exists in someone's wallet today. So, V.me is not meant to be direct to consumer to go around our issuers, it's actually just the opposite. It's meant to support them with the electronic wallet that will enable them to continue to grow commerce.","So as we think about \u2013 I want to talk about extending who we are, we love the business that we're in. Presumably, you all love the business that we're in which is why we trade the way we do. And so we're very mindful of that. And the opportunities for us to continue to figure out how to use technology whether it's our own or whether it's other peoples, to feed that network and to use our assets is what we're focused on.","Operator","Our next question will come from Dan Perlin of RBC. Your line is open.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","Thanks. So I just want to return to this issue of capital allocation and I know that you said there's not much of a change. But I was thinking more in terms of the first priority is always back into the business and I heard you mention in your kind of prepared remarks around priorities and others, outside the U.S. a number of times. So I'm wondering if you could just shed some light without being too specific, I suspect on kind of how we should be thinking about capital redeployment through this geographic mix that you guys have? Thank you.","Byron H. Pollitt","I'll start. So I would say the first call on the growth in our capital is going to be software development that underpins our new products in mobile, V.me or right on the point of the sphere with that. That would support products that were to be deployed both in the United States and in rest of world and the development of those products, the actual incurring of the capital would also actually occur both in the United States and outside.","As you build additional product capability and extension of the services we offer, that will also require investment in infrastructure. Now just the capacity to house, to operate and to process, but also new challenges like security. So VisaNet very, very formidable battletested defenses as you start moving into products that are going to start operating as an extension outside of VisaNet, but it requires additional investment in technologies in order to properly secure.","And so that is the primary source of hard dollar capital. And then as Charlie mentioned, we still have an enormous runway of growth in our base business. So we are adding offices, we are expanding, we are putting more people on the ground. We are at our best when we have people deployed in country giving personalized, tailored service to our clients, banks, acquirers, merchants. And so that reinvestment will not just be capital expenditure, it will also be operating expense with an immediate return in the core business.","Charles W. Scharf","Let me just add to what Byron said. If you just look at relative levels and just get my own view coming in from the outside is there's a lot of investment that's going on here. You see it in the expense line. You see it in the initiatives. You see \u2013 I mean you don't get to [work] with something like V.me without putting the resources into it or being able to be in the market with mobile, without having used the capital on something like Fundamo and whatnot. So, there is a significant level of investment going on with what you see and it still allows us to do what we've done with the dividend and with the repurchase program here. So, we feel like there's just plenty of room for all of those things.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Great. Charlie, so with your experience on the bank side, are there tangible steps for you to make \u2013 to help Visa improve its relationship with the banks, particularly the large banks. For instance, as you push new products like V.me, you need the large banks on board, and so far it\u2019s unclear to what extent the largest banks are fully supportive at this point. It\u2019s helpful to hear that 12 of the top 25 banks are signed up for V.me, but that could imply that 13 of 25 are not signed up at least at this point; and so that\u2019s one example. But on that example and Visa\u2019s general relationship with large banks, are there tangible steps to take to better engage with the banks? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf","Yeah, I guess, let me answer it a couple of ways. I mean, to just \u2013 listen, we can always improve relationships, so that\u2019s \u2013 I mean, but I will come back to that. I said 12 with the top 25; we have four of the top 10, who are already signed up for it. And again, when you say large banks, the Bank of America is a great partner of ours. PNC is a great partner of ours. U.S. Bank is a great partner of ours. TD Bank is great partner, I mean, I can go on through the names. We have a great list of partners that are currently signed up for it.","I spent a bunch of time myself talking to the biggest banks in this country, but just so you know I don't spend all my time thinking about the biggest banks in this country, the big banks here are important, but so are the regional banks, so are the credit unions, so are the community banks, just as the banks overseas. So, I just want to be clear about that. But listen, we have \u2013 you go through the relationships that we have with the big U.S. banks and it\u2019s hard to say you trade our position with anyone\u2019s in the marketplace. And is that something we have to earn every day? Absolutely.","Are things like V.me, things that actually solidify those relationships? Absolutely. There is a lot more that we\u2019re doing working in partnership with banks of all sizes to create that partnership orientation away from a vendor orientation. We view it as something that it's not a god given right, we got to earn it every day. But again just to end where I started is we\u2019ve got relationships with these banks. We don't take them for granted, but like anything else, we work \u2013 we come in everyday to figure out how do we make them better?","Operator","Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan","Hey, great. Thanks, Charlie. Welcome to the call. Just thinking about your initiatives being more flexible partnering and customizing. I\u2019m curious, to accomplish this do you foresee more investments required to get there or that was in place? And I also wanted to ask just about, your comment about working closer with the merchants. I know Visa has been moving closer to the merchant for some time and given your background from the issuer side. How much closer can Visa get to the merchant before you, I guess, complicate the issue of relationship, if you follow up question?","Charles W. Scharf","Let me do that one first. I\u2019m not at all worried, did I say worried, I always worry to the extent of, we all should be careful and clear. So, just assume that\u2019s the case. But in my conversations with issuers, we all agree because they\u2019re in the exact same spot. And I speak as much from where I came from as where I am, that we all need to do a better job of working with merchants. Our customers are merchants and acquirers. We\u2019ve got that. We understand that. But ultimately there\u2019s someone who uses the payment product, and there\u2019s someone that accepts the payment product. And if the person that accepts the payment product is not particularly happy, that\u2019s not a good thing for us. And that\u2019s not a good thing for the issuers either. So, we are in total alignment on changing the nature of those relationships where they\u2019re wanted. And it's something that we do -- that we\u2019re working on in partnership with them, as well as partnership with the acquirers. We've had very open conversations with the acquirers about that. I was just with them, with all the big acquirers this past weekend, and they\u2019re totally supportive of it. So, I\u2019m not -- again assuming that we do this openly, the right kind of way. I think we\u2019re all in this together. And your first \u2013 the first part of the question.","Byron H. Pollitt","Yeah, Charles I\u2019ll take the first one. So, the first question I think Tien-Tsin was more about in our effort to be -- have more tailored and flexible client relationships, do we expect this -- is that going to cost more in terms of capital? And I would say, at the current point in time, the big capital is in creating the products and in the capabilities that allow you to operate and leverage a large network, and that today, is there expense involved in tailoring? Yes. But we don\u2019t have line of sight to larger expense.","And a good example of that would be our strategy of recognizing, as Charlie said earlier, that the single largest open to buy on the planet is the Visa cardholder's access through our network. Hence, part of our strategy is to build products that can be accessed through our network with common stacked APIs that make it very easy for users or our clients to hook into the network. So, in the spirit of how we're expending our capital, I would say over the next several years its past is much more a representative of prologue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Brendler of Stiefel Nicolaus. Your line is open.","Christopher Brendler - Stiefel Nicolaus & Company Inc., Research Division","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wondered if you could just give us any color on the progress you're making with Interlink, any sense of how much success you're having with PAVD and actually getting transactions routed over that signature Visa Network on the debit side, as well as any update there may be on the FANF fee? And then maybe for Charlie along with the FANF fee, is there anything in that comment you made about being closer to the merchant and working with the merchant that would make future implementations of fees like this go a little more smoothly? Thanks.","Byron H. Pollitt","Let me take that one to start to on Interlink. If you go back to the third fiscal quarter of 2012, that was the quarter April 1, was when the dual network Durbin requirement became effective that was high tide in terms of Interlink payment volume loss. So, our growth rate in that third quarter was minus 54. If you then move to the fourth quarter, so that's the fourth fiscal September ending quarter, the growth rate for Interlink was minus 48. If you then move to Q1, so the December ending quarter, were minus 44. And so these -- clearly, we're going to have one other kind of major quarter of transaction loss through Interlink, because it takes four quarters to lap the Durbin effect, but you can see 54, 48, 44, there is progress.","Having said that, there is going to be -- as we said all along, there is going to be a significant permanent transaction loss as a result of the Durbin regulations. And so while we would expect to continue to make some progress, there is no way we're going to get back to where we were before. And then as I had mentioned in my remarks, once we get into that third fiscal quarter, then the growth rate picture should start looking very different with regards to our debit business, because we're now lapping Durbin.","With regards to PAVD, PAVD is up and operating. It's important to note that a transaction that is a PAVD transaction actually shows up in our Visa debit payment volume not Interlink. And so PAVD is up and operating. You should think about it at best contributing very modestly to our payment volume growth in U.S. debit.","And with regards to FANF, and remember FANF is one part of a much more comprehensive fee restructuring, which was combined with a lowering of our per transaction cost, in addition to the introduction of merchant incentives to encourage routing, which is still on the upward ramp. FANF has now been in place since the April quarter. And so far it seems to be going well. Charlie, do you want to add anything?","Charles W. Scharf","I guess the only thing I'd add is, listen, I think it's unfair and it's hard to try and stick yourself into the position of someone else when you're going through what this company was going through. And so, I have not personally sat and gone through exactly what happened, what was the thought, what were the options, I mean all the things that you would do to answer your question directly, I haven't done because I'm looking at the future here.","But as I said, I think as we -- and I think we're all in the same page internally on this one is just as we look forward which is the important thing here, I mean it's about balancing everyone's issues and it's balancing issuers, it's balancing those with merchants, with acquirers, with our own. And we're going to be very, very conscious of that. We're going to do the right thing whether it creates noise or not, but make sure that everyone's represented in that discussion before we make a decision.","Operator","Our next question will come from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Don Fandetti - Citigroup","Good evening. Charlie I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about how you view sort of the longer term threat from China UnionPay? And then maybe talk a bit about how you see the sort of opportunity in China playing out and what your approach will be to that market?","Charles W. Scharf","Sure. I was in China, I don\u2019t know two or three weeks ago and had the opportunity to meet with a couple of senior members in the government with some of our big clients with China UnionPay and do some, and participate in some other activities that we\u2019re involved in socially there. China is an interesting place for sure, we\u2019re over there. We make money there and we have got some great partners there. The WTO ruling speaks for itself. Over time that market will evolve and will change and we feel like it\u2019s important for us to be a good partner to people within the country to bring the benefits of Visa to China.","In my conversations with people there, they want us there. They think we can add value not just because of the brand, but because of what our network is versus maybe what China UnionPay is today. And we\u2019d hope over a period of time that we can work with China UnionPay in the context of the way the regulations exist today and as that market changes and evolves. We will figure out how we can do more inside that country, just as they look beyond that country as they develop. But again, I come back to what we have. Our network has been around for a long time. We\u2019ve got 2 billion cards? That\u2019s the number? 2 billion cards outstanding. The largest open-to-buy, the quality of the fraud tools, I mean, I can go on and on about what our network has, and if there is another competitor out there, so be it. Good competition is a good thing, not a bad thing.","Operator","Our next question will come from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Hi. Thanks. I appreciate you taking the question. Charlie, when you think about investment in the business aside from products and so forth. How do you think about market share, I think particularly in the U.S. which is the most mature market in which you operate from an electronic payment standpoint; and should we consider an effort to bolster share both on credit and debit as a central component of the investments going forward as well?","Charles W. Scharf","Yeah. So listen, I said this before, which is, our number one opportunity is cash. So, we\u2019re constantly -- the first thing we look at when we think about share is we think about the share of cash versus electronic payments. And it's our goal, it's our mission, it's what we do for a living is to move that number towards electronification. For all the reasons I talked about, it's just -- it's the right thing and it's a good thing for all the participants in the market place.","And so, I know everyone likes to always ask questions, I mean, even my old job; they used to ask how you compete against the other competitors out there? We've got great competitors. They are doing some neat things. They are smart people. So, I think first and foremost given the market we\u2019re in, there\u2019s plenty of room for a bunch of us to be successful here. And so, that is -- the enemy first and foremost is cash. When you look at how we\u2019re doing versus competitors; we looked pretty good; pretty happy with it.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.","Charles W. Scharf","Tim, if you\u2019re there; you\u2019re on mute. Can\u2019t hear you.","Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities","Sorry about that. Thanks for pointing that out. Can you hear me now?","Charles W. Scharf","Yes.","Timothy Willi - Wells Fargo Securities","Yeah. So, on the regulatory front, as you\u2019ve traveled the world, it sounds like over the last several months. Could you give us your thoughts on what kind of regulatory and political environment that you have to navigate; how you think that would impact the economics of your emerging market growth versus how your economics look in the more established markets and if you\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised or find out to be more challenging as you assess what you\u2019ve heard over the last couple of months globally?","Charles W. Scharf","Yeah, I would say -- first of all, it's very different in different parts of the world. And so, you obviously know about the U.S, you\u2019ve read about Canada, you know about Australia presumably, and really is different depending on where you are. Again, I alluded to this in lots of my remarks when we started, but I was really positively taken aback by the desire for government officials to want us to be in the market committed to helping electronify their payments.","It doesn't mean that they're not concerned about interchange or they're not concerned about figuring out what they want in country versus not. I mean different countries have different points of view on that. But they want us to be a participant. They see the value in that. And again, this is not -- this wasn't me going around the world trying to sell our services. This was me going to meet people and as part of that, the clear message to me was we want you here. And when you're in that kind of situation, that's a pretty good place to be in. Byron, anything you want to add?","Byron H. Pollitt","It is a wonderful dynamic. There are always two doors in the government. The first door is always open with an open invitation. You can't tax what you can't see. Hence, there's a very strong motivation for governments to be very interested engaged partners. And then I would say the other piece is our position and others when we get deeply involved in the electronification of payment, we become an important part of the monetary system or can be in a country.","And that's why in virtually every major market we have government relations representatives, we engage early, we educate, we lay good groundwork so that these dialogues are constructive and increase the probability of a good reinforcing regulatory environment as we lay the foundation for growing in the domestic markets of these emerging markets.","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is open.","Robert Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Thank you and welcome Charlie. Your bar is a lot higher than Joe's was. Your stock's trading at 21 times earnings, his was nowhere near that when he started. So, given that bar and given that this looks like such a great story even just why the valuation has done what it has, what do you view? What are you most worried about? What are the biggest risks? What can derail this train? Is it something like a PayPal offline and MCX, other countries like India, RuPay going the way of China UnionPay? What are you most worried about, what can derail this, what has been a great story so far?","Charles W. Scharf","So let me just go through a couple of thoughts. First of all, I would say focus, knowing -- being clear who our clients are and not isn't extremely important. We get a lot of pressure from a lot of people to use our assets to go do things and whatnot. And so my comments around knowing that our clients are the issuers and the acquirers is extremely important. We change the nature of those relationships. We put a lot of money in jeopardy at this place and potential future growth.","Regulation and legislation clearly has been a big issue for the industry. We're very, very conscious of it. You can't be here and not be. Hopefully, some of the things I talked about when I talked about the priorities, over time with things that get to those issues, because ultimately if you've got the people who are participating in the payment system wanting to do business with you, as opposed to the opposite, then you don't get some of the pressures that you see.","Again, competition is competition. I mean there's some great competition out there. I wouldn't trade our position with other people. It doesn't mean that we don't think about them, it doesn't mean that people don't do some really smart things, that we sit there and we say why them and not us, that's always the case in every business. But hopefully, they're sitting there and thinking more so of us. So, we spend a lot of time talking about both the traditional and the non-traditional people. So for sure we worry about it, but ultimately that one -- as sitting here today, we feel like we're in a good place.","Jack Carsky","Brad, at this point we have time for one more question.","Operator","Our final question will come from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Hi, guys. I just wanted to follow-up on a couple of questions. I guess, Charlie, on the strategy, how do you feel about the risk of being dis-intermediated either through ACH or through another player especially as we move into more of a mobile world? And then secondly for Byron, just the rest of world payment volumes kind of spiked in the quarter. Just curious to know if that was supplemented by some new wins that pushed that number higher. Thanks so much.","Charles W. Scharf","Sure. On dis-intermediation I talk about competitors, traditional, non-traditional and that encompasses a wide range of people. So, again we think about it. We worry about it. What we hope people would look at over a period of time, and what we think people look at over a period of time is, our assets that we have here is really hard to build. It just is. The global connectivity, the acceptance that we have, the actual network the way I described it, and other people have other assets out there that they bring to the party. And, what we should be doing, and are doing, and will do more of is engaging with that community to figure out how they can get access to our network in a way which is friendly to our customers because, ultimately it doesn\u2019t make sense for them to go build something that we already have. It doesn\u2019t mean people won't try. It doesn\u2019t mean they haven\u2019t tried in the past. But again, I keep kind of saying this; it's up to us to prove to people why our asset is as good as we think. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do.","Byron H. Pollitt","And Bryan, on the international PV up-tick in this quarter, for reasons that are not -- that aren\u2019t clear other than the tension that we had around China and Japan, and mostly in Asia Pacific around that impacted the Chinese, the Japanese, Korean cross-border travel as tensions over Island ownership spiked. And everything from the Senkakus to the Diaoyus to the Spratleys, there seemed to be a more broad-based malaise in that quarter. And the recovery, if I can call it that or the rebound was very broad-based. It's still down. And that \u2013 in that [pocket] of Asia where the \u2013 where that tension existed last quarter, but there\u2019s been more of a broad-based uptick. So, it's not win specific, it's more a broad-based uptick. And remember for us, that\u2019s the world excluding Europe.","Jack Carsky","And with that we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today.

Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal first quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s CEO; and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our Web site prior to this call.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s Web site and the Investor Relations section of ours.","For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today\u2019s press release. This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our Web site.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.","Byron Pollitt","Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, as you can see from the earnings press release, we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a four-for-one stock split, each Class A stockholder of record. At the close of business on February 13, 2015 will receive three additional shares for every share held on the Record Date. In the form of a 100% stock dividend and trading will began on a split adjusted basis on March 19, 2015.","Due to the structure of the various classes, holders of Class B and C shares will not receive a stock dividend. Instead, the conversion rate for the Class B and C shares will be adjusted after the stock split, so that the Class B and C stockholders will retain the same relative ownership percentages that they had prior to the stock split.","Second callout involves FX. Since our last earnings call, the U.S dollar has continued to strengthen against most of our key currencies. Based on the December 31, forward exchange rate, we project an incremental 50 basis points negative impact on our full-year revenue growth.","Third call out relates to cross-border activity. Cross-border volumes softened 2 percentage points in the September quarter -- in the December quarter to 8% growth in constant dollars and a further 1 percentage point to 7% through the 21st of January.","Once again, FX is an important contributor as a stronger event anticipated U.S dollar has led to substantially reduce travel into the U.S from Europe, Canada, and Latin America, notably Brazil. Beyond FX, the severe economic challenges in Russia have also been a notable drag on cross-border results.","In total, our outlook for cross-border volume driven revenue growth in fiscal 2015 is approximately a half percentage point less than when we began the year. Partially offsetting these headwinds has been a strong rebound in currency volatility versus product quarters. The improvement has sustained from September through early January and has stepped up even further due to recent Central Bank actions by the Swiss and the Canadians and was further aided by the recent elections in Greece.","Given the unpredictability of volatility, we will continue to be appropriately conservative in our outlook on how sustainable this is for the balance of the fiscal year. For full-year revenue growth, we\u2019re maintaining our guidance of low double-digit constant dollar growth with a negative two percentage points of foreign exchange impact, but would position expectations at the lower end of that range.","Looking ahead to Q2, we expect this quarter to be impacted the most by FX as well as by lower gas prices. And to therefore deliver a growth rate lower than originally anticipated, but still in the mid single-digit range. From there we expect net revenue growth rates to building Q3 reaching double-digits in Q4.","We are reaffirming client incentives in a range of 17.5% to 18.5% of gross revenue. While Q1 came in at 17.4%, we expect Q2 to Q4 to run at somewhat higher levels given the pacing of deal activity for the balance of the year.","We are also reaffirming our full-year EPS guidance of mid teens. That said, remember, when projecting Q2 results, in Q2 of last year Visa booked a sizable tax benefit which included both one-time and ongoing tax impacts. And we will be lapping an unusually low level of client incentives in the prior year.","Lastly, we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of 3.1 million shares during the December quarter at an average price per share of $259 and change. Through January 27th, we purchased an additional 2.5 million shares for a total of 5.6 million shares fiscal year-to-date at an average price of $258 leaving us with an open to buy of 4.2 million -- 4.2 billion. Of note, all share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2014 have now been completed.","Now let's turn to the numbers. I'll cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the first fiscal quarter followed by our results through January 21. I\u2019ll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter.","Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%. The U.S grew 10% and international grew 13%, both at similar levels to the September ending quarter. Drilling down further, in the December quarter U.S credit grew 14%, a 1 percentage point improvement compared to Q4.","During the quarter, we experienced account conversions and deconversions, the net effect of which positively impacted credit payment volume by a little more than 2 percentage points by the end of Q1, the vast majority of account conversions will have taken place.","Turning to U.S debit, it grew at 7% in the December quarter, flat to the September quarter. More recently through January 21st, U.S payment volume growth was 9% while U.S credit grew 12% and debit grew 6%. In terms of fuel, significantly lower gas prices had a negative 1 percentage point effect on U.S payment volume growth in the quarter with a disproportionate impact in December and with a bigger impact on debit than credit.","Global cross-border volume delivered an 8% constant dollar growth rate in the December quarter, down from the 10% rate in the September quarter. The U.S grew 4% and international grew 9% in constant dollars. Through January 21 cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% with a U.S growth rate of 6% and an international growth rate of 7%, further decelerating from the December levels.","The under performing travel corridors referenced earlier, in combination with weaker growth in Brazil, Russia, and Ukraine were the primary culprits. Travel within Asia remains strong.","Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled 17.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, a 10% increase over the prior year period. The U.S grew 9% while international delivered 14% growth. Through January 21, processed transaction growth was 10% with a U.S growth rate of 9% and an international growth rate of 13%.","Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.4 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year driven primarily by solid growth globally across all revenue categories. And as mentioned earlier, was negatively impacted by approximately two points of foreign currency headwinds.","Moving to the individual revenue line items, Services revenue was $1.5 billion, up 8% over the prior year and was driven by solid global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa transactions both in the U.S and internationally. International transaction revenue was up 9% to $970 million as increased currency volatility countered negative impacts from FX.","Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 6% from the prior year primarily related to higher personnel, marketing and other expenses which support our growth strategies and product initiatives.","Operating margin was 66% for the first quarter in line with our annual guidance of mid 60s. Our effective tax rate was 30.6% within our guidance range of low 30s. Capital expenditures were $104 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 616 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 619 million.","Finally, for completeness our full-year guidance metrics for revenue growth, client incentive, operating margin, tax rate, EPS growth and free cash flow remain unchanged.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.","Charles W. Scharf","Thank you very much, Byron, and good afternoon, everyone. First of all, I\u2019m just going to start by telling you, I think that we as a management team are quite pleased with our results. We continue to produce strong and consistent results in the global economic environment which is providing more headwinds than tailwinds.","Consumers spend continues at reasonable levels, but it is not accelerating and we expect gas prices to continue to be a near-term headwind. Geopolitical tensions are playing a more meaningful role in our results as they\u2019ve at different times during our past. Having said that, our growth is still strong and well in excess of consumer spending growth as the movement from cash to electronic payments continues regardless of economic and geopolitical events.","As most of you probably know, we\u2019ve put forth a proposal in this year\u2019s proxy to amend our corporate charter that would position us to effect a stock split at an appropriate time and at the discretion of our Board of Directors. As you can see from the announcement today the proposal did indeed pass and our Board of Directors declared a four-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend.","This action in addition to our dividend increase and our previously announced share purchase -- repurchase program are all indicators of our confidence in our future. Our long-term outlook continues to be bright as our investments in digital payments provide growing opportunities for us.","Let me make a couple of comments now about our first quarter financial results. As Byron said, it was another strong quarter driven by solid underlying payment volumes in processed transactions globally. As expected, operating revenue grew 7% nominally or 9% on a constant currency basis, while expenses increased 6% and earnings per share registered a healthy 15% growth.","Global payment volume grew 11% flat to last quarter and still robust. Solid rates in the U.S of 10% were bolstered by international at 13%, again no change from the previous quarter and still robust in spite of everything that is transpiring across the globe. U.S growth moderated slightly in the month of January driven by further declines in gas prices. And as Byron mentioned, our U.S results benefited from conversions as we converted significantly more accounts on to a platform than were converted away from us.","Let me just cover a few topical items now. First, a few words about the U.S holiday spending season. The holiday season spending patterns evolved differently than prior years. Growth was stronger going into Thanksgiving than we\u2019ve seen in the past and it tailed off through the month of December, but a significant driver was the continuing decrease in gasoline prices.","Having said that, our rate of growth was higher this year than last year including the decrease in gas prices. We also look at the rate of growth year-over-year excluding conversions and gas prices to gauge the underlying economic environment and it looks to be about flat.","On that topic, I want to talk a little bit more about gas for a second. First, to put the drop into context, U.S fuel prices are down approximately 30% since June. This drop amounts to approximately $60 per month for the average consumer. According to our surveys, approximately 50% of the savings consumers are seeing is being saved, 25% is being used to pay down debt and approximately 25% is being spent in other discretionary categories. These categories include grocery, clothing, and restaurants. This is consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in our own spend data.","As we look forward, we\u2019d anticipate the savings will accumulate and ultimately we\u2019d see more spent in the discretionary categories including higher ticket items such as home improvement, electronics, and travel and entertainment.","Third cross-border volume moderated to 8% from 10% in the prior quarter. We see the effect of geopolitical tensions here and the strong dollar and the corridors affected are not surprising as Byron pointed out.","Fourth, the rebound in currency volatility is material. It\u2019s obviously welcomed and not surprising given what's going on in the world. The moderation in cross-border continued into the current quarter, as has increased currency volatility.","On the expense front, we continue to manage expenses judiciously and while we continue to appropriately invest in all of our long-term initiatives, there are defensive measures we can and will take if needed in the face of any slowing economic scenario. We're not doing this yet, but we remain prepared.","Let me turn my attention now just to say a couple of words about our competitive position. We love our competitive position in the marketplace. We are the industry leader, but this alone doesn't give us comfort. We know that we are the target for others, traditional and non-traditional. Thus far, we\u2019re comforted by the fact that we continue to maintain our share in an intelligent way for our shareholders.","We are laser focused on investing to drive cash to electronic payments, partnering with those who will drive commerce in the digital world and creating platforms to embed ourselves in that digital commerce, Visa Checkout, Visa Token Services, Visa Digital Solutions and enabling Apple Pay. These are things that we\u2019ve done so far and there is much more to come.","Let me turn now and make a couple of comments and updates regarding the legal and regulatory front. On the domestic front, we're certainly pleased with the recent outcome of the supreme Courts decision not to hear the National Association of Convenient Stores\u2019 appeal against the Federal Reserve Board. The decision is an important step in bringing clarity to the debit interchange landscape. We are hopeful this will encourage all parties to work more closely to address areas of mutual interest.","Speaking more broadly to the merchant litigation, we made considerable progress in settling the MDL opt out cases. Through the end of the first quarter and to date in January, we paid out approximately $335 million to opt out merchants. We are optimistic that we will continue to see good progress. Additionally, we had approximately 1,100 requests from smaller retailers to opt back into the class. They will be compensated accordingly under the terms of the Class Agreement.","In Russia, we continue to work with the Central Bank of Russia and the Russian National Payment Card System to transition our domestic processing to their network. We continue to estimate that 2015 full-year impact to be $50 million.","A quick update on Visa Checkout. As I mentioned last quarter, Visa Checkout saw excellent initial traction in the early fall, which is accelerated during our first fiscal quarter, capped off by the holiday shopping season. This was driven by strong media campaign in conjunction with our NFL sponsorship as well as individual merchant media collaboration. Thus far we have conducted 24 co-marketing campaigns with some great merchant partners.","Visa Checkout now has over 240 financial institution partners across the United States, Canada and Australia, which account for almost 50% of our global e-commerce volume. Several issuers are also participating in marketing programs, including e-mail and online campaigns. To date we have over 3 million registered users and consumers can now use Visa Checkout to stop at over 110 e-commerce retailers representing over 42 billion in addressable volume.","We continue to see good success with Apple Pay, and with all involved parties actively promoting the service either independently or in concert with each other. As Apple reported yesterday, about 750 banks and credit unions have signed on to bring their customers Apple Pay. To date 43 of our issuing partners have enrolled in our tokenization services. These issuers collectively represent 75% of our aggregate U.S payment volume and over 500 of our clients have signed the Apple Pay contract and we are actively working with them to enable the service.","As importantly the token technology employed here sets the standard for other digital experiences and you will see others come to market over the course of the next year. As we gauge the success, I agree with Apple\u2019s assessment that its early days of the excitement we see is encouraging. It will take some time to build out the NFC acceptance infrastructure for Apple Pay and others. That is happening now and will continue as merchants upgrade their terminals to accept chip enabled cards. I would also note that few if any chip enabled terminals are shipped that don\u2019t also contain NFC functionality.","More specifically on EMV chip cards, we continue to work closely with all industry players and are very optimistic that the adoption of chip cards will continue to accelerate over 2015. Based on the Payment Security Task Force protection -- projections, we expect to see well over a half a billion chip cards enabled in consumer\u2019s hands by the end of 2015 and roughly half of all terminals of surveyed acquirers will be activated by year-end. We expect that by the end of 2017, roughly 70% of all cards in all terminals will be chip enabled.","Moving on to the emerging and evolving technologies like host card emulation. In the fall, we launched our sandbox environment for Visa Digital Solutions. We have several clients and partners that have been actively developing new mobile and digital services in our sandbox. Next week our Visa Digital Solutions platform will launch and be live in production. We expect that several of our clients and partners will launch the new services over the coming months.","Lastly, we are putting the finishing touches on several other initiatives that we will be announcing during the upcoming Mobile World Congress meeting in early March, so stay tuned.","Just to close, we are very pleased with the start to our fiscal year. As we indicated last quarter, while we expect volumes to remain relatively strong, we are expecting revenues to be softer in the first half of the year including the second quarter, which we expect to be the trough. The back half of the year should improve as gas prices stabilize and the effect of our previously announced pricing changes become effective.","It will continue to be a very exciting time in the payments arena and I fully believe that Visa will continue to be in a leadership position not only in terms of growing our payment volumes and processed transactions, but as importantly driving new technologies and ways to pay as we work in concert with our issuers, acquirers, merchants, and other parties.","With that, Byron and I are ready to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.","Darrin Peller","Nice job on the quarter. Just want to touch first on what you were mentioning around FX volatility levels. As I think, Byron, you mentioned earlier they clearly have increased. Just to be clear, not including that in your outlook at least you're including -- are you including the levels that we have seen recently? And just kind of going forward with that or are you including lower levels? And maybe can you give us the size and sort of magnitude of what kind of impact it could mean if you were to sort of extrapolate off the card levels of volatility for the rest of the year on your cross-border volume?","Byron Pollitt","So we\u2019ve included our forward projection of FX rates based on the December 31 forwards. So the numbers that we quoted, the guidance that we have reaffirmed, fully reflect the most current thinking and data we\u2019ve using the forward exchange rates of December 31. With regards to volatility, which is another aspect of FX, the projection assumes some continuation of what we\u2019ve seen, but we\u2019re -- as indicated in my remarks, cautious here with regards to the balance of the year and that this is an area that it is very difficult to forecast. So clearly a good start to the year with regards to volatility it is trending, it has performed above the 10 year medium which we referred to, I believe on our last earnings call. But this is an area that goes up and down, so it\u2019s unlike FX and its impacts on our translations which we\u2019ve projected using the December forwards throughout the year with volatility we\u2019re forecasting a bit closer in and taking out what we believe is a conservative posture in the second half.","Jack Carsky","Next question David?","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Kupferberg","Hi, guys. So the strong dollar obviously as you highlighted has had that negative impact on U.S inbound cross-border travel from some of the key international card. So I just wanted to get your take on whether or not you think that the 7% cross-border volume number through the first three weeks of January will prove to be the trough for the year, because I know you do have some easier comparisons coming up in the March and June quarters in particular.","Byron Pollitt","That one is really hard. We have -- we are projecting off our trending, but the dollar is continuing to strengthen and that strengthening dollar is fundamental to our forecast for the balance of the year in terms of its impact on volume and subsequent impact on revenue.","Jack Carsky","Next question David?","Operator","The next question comes from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","David Togut","Thank you. Could you provide any clarity you might have Charlie on the rules that are governing the opening of China's domestic payments market and when this might be material for Visa?","Charles W. Scharf","I guess couple of things first. First I just want to be clear; China is an important market for us today. We don't compete domestically for transactions, but we\u2019ve very close relationships with banks in China where we issue cards that are used outside of China. So to the extent and at the appropriate time when the Chinese marketplace opens we're not starting from ground Zero relative to building relationships within China. Relative to the timing of the open, we really unfortunately cannot provide any additional clarity. We know what you know, which is that the Chinese government made the statement that they will allow domestic competition that they\u2019re in the process of writing those rules and my guess is we'll see them when you see them and we continue to work with our Chinese partners and meet with the government. But relative to when the market will open, what the rules will look like and how meaningful it would be, we really don't know. I would just remind you, well I know a lot of you know this fact, but when they\u2019ve opened the market up in other industries that are industries somewhat like ours, it generally takes a period of time, sometimes quite a significant period of time before it's going to become something significant for the Company.","Jack Carsky","Next question please?","Operator","The next question comes from Bill Carcache of Nomura Securities. Please go ahead with your question.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Have you seen any notable difference in the impact of lower gas prices on affluent consumers versus the general population? And maybe on the comments that you\u2019ve made about cross-border, could you kind of address whether you're seeing any early signs of more U.S travel abroad given the strengthening of the U.S dollar and if so, is any of that factored into your outlook?","Byron Pollitt","What we see -- let me take the second one first. What we see for U.S and abroad given the strong dollar is that it has sustained. What we haven\u2019t seen is a -- any sort of spike in U.S travel abroad, which you might hypothesize what happened, given the stronger dollar. But what we\u2019ve seen is a sustaining of healthy growth rates on outbound U.S travel. With regards to gas and impact on affluent, as I mentioned in my remarks, gasoline spend is more debit rated for us than credit. We\u2019ve seen very little impact on spent at the credit level, which is where you would expect more of the affluent to participate. We have seen some impact on debit, which is where you would expect the less affluent to play in greater numbers. So as Charlie talked about, there has been a clear noticeable reduction in debit spend as it relates to gas in the U.S., a portion of which have been redistributed to other categories. But the bulk of which has been for at least for the moment based on our surveys being banked [ph] in the savings category. And just keep in mind that the average of $60 a month -- $60 a month in its own way doesn\u2019t change -- it's unlikely that people change their behavior. I mean if you boil it down to people filling up their tanks once a week, at that point you're down to $15 a week, how are you going to spend differently? So the places that we\u2019re seeing it, which I mentioned are the grocery, fast foods, QSRs especially architecture places where you would see that kind of additional dollar amount. But as I said from a survey is, we know that 50% of its being saved. That amount of money accumulates. People start to see that thy have additional money and then over a period of time we\u2019ll potentially buy higher ticket items is what we would anticipate.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Please go ahead with your question.","Don Fandetti","Yes, Charlie, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit on the rollout of tokenization for online, and when you think it could also rollout internationally around Apple Pay. And then lastly, have you seen increased discussions from other smartphone manufacturers and players post to Apple Pay?","Charles W. Scharf","Sure. On our tokenization efforts we are very actively working with issuers in other parts of the world, and would expect to see some tokenized solutions in the marketplace this calendar year. On the topic of other people whether its handset manufacturers or others there is a very, very active dialogue that\u2019s going on that was happening, but I think the work that Apple has done and winding up in-market with their solution, it certainly accelerated peoples thinking. And we\u2019ve been very, very clear relative to ourselves which is, we are very excited about what Apple is doing. We think it\u2019s a very elegant solution that we are thrilled with our participation in. But we want to enable as many scalable solutions that have wonderful customer interfaces that adhere to the highest security standards. And we would expect to see a series of those in the next couple of quarters come to market.","Jack Carsky","Next question, David.","Operator","The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Please go ahead with your questions.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I just have one more on FX. How did the hedges affect next year, I mean, did they differ some of the impact that we might have seen if you weren\u2019t hedged this year into next year. And then just one data point question, do you know that sum total of those that are still opt out in the merchant litigation? Thank you.","Byron Pollitt","With regards to the hedges, the answer is, yes. Beginning with the month of October which was, it\u2019s the beginning of our fiscal year. We start doing 12 months forecasts out and start layering in hedges 12 months out. So, January -- this is January, so the hedges we put on this month will be for -- will cover, throughout the end of January we will have the hedges in place that will cover the first four months of next years fiscal year. And I\u2019d say for better or for worse. If the dollar continues to strengthen, then the hedges will provide benefit and if it goes the other way, the opposite, and remember the objective here is to simply dampen, not eliminate. We are not insulated from FX. What we try and do with the hedges is flatten out somewhat the volatility. And I might also add, that what we solve through in hedges is not revenue, its actually operating income. So, we hedge again certain risk point levels by currency against our operating income, which means we use the expenses in other currencies as a natural hedge and then we put on our transactional hedges beyond the natural hedge of the expense we incur in the non-U.S. currencies.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","The next question is from Moshe Katri of Cowen. Please go ahead with your question.","Moshe Katri","Hey, guys. Can you talk a bit about tokenization? Where are we in terms of introducing on the service to banks, and some of the feedback, and then maybe you can talk a bit about, how should we think about this looking into next year? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf","So, those financial institutions that I referenced in my opening remarks are all using our token services for Apple Pay. And as I said, we\u2019re working with another 500 or so institutions here currently to get them involved in Apple Pay and therefore using our to tokenization service because that is a prerequisite for participating in Apple Pay. As I said before, we continue to work with issuers around the world and expect to see more tokenized solutions as time goes on. What was the second part of the question?","Byron Pollitt","There was a second part that I didn\u2019t answer to Sanjay\u2019s question. So let me just, if I could let me just add that in real quick. The question was, I believe how much opt outs remain in the MDL litigation. That number we don\u2019t have, but immediately accessible. But to be hopeful here, we think it\u2019s better to think about it in terms of the payment volume represented by the opt-outs. Charlie tell you that, to date we have settled and actually paid out of our escrow $335 million or so, out of an escrow that was $1.5 billion at the beginning of the fiscal year. Think of that as settling out a little over 20% of the payment volume represented by the opt-outs before these payments began.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","The next question is from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Please.","Robert Napoli","Thank you. Good afternoon. I just wanted to get an update on CyberSource if I could and, the trends in that business what you\u2019re doing to improve that business and, who maybe -- what competitors are you finding most difficult as far as loosing market share?","Byron Pollitt","So, on CyberSource we had a good holiday season. We grew at -- transactions grew at about 16%, that\u2019s up from 12% in the prior reporting period. We honestly is that, which we have mentioned on prior calls, we missed an investment cycle maybe to in this product, we are rapidly reinvesting, re-platforming to enable much better client service as transactions accelerate in terms of capacity utilization. And so, this is a business we\u2019re very committed to. It\u2019s been an excellent vertical extension of our business model and we remain very vested in bringing the platform to world class levels again and to accelerate the growth rates above which we have even most recently been experiencing.","Charles W. Scharf","And the only thing I would get -- just add a couple of things to it. Number one is, I mean we think about CyberSource in two different ways. We think about it as a, how is it doing as a standalone business? And we think about how is CyberSource helping the rest of Visa. As Byron mentioned on the standalone business, we\u2019ve been very clear that we did miss an investment cycle here. We had a very clear roadmap internally that both relates to customer facing improvements such as time to onboard and things like that, as well as some infrastructure changes that we\u2019re making. That\u2019s a roadmap of call it a year or so, and that\u2019s how long it will take us. So we would expect to see some volatility from the existing client base as we go through those changes but it\u2019s the right thing for us for the long-term. Separately from us and this gets to just the overall point for us with CyberSource. CyberSource is an extremely important part of the company. When we talk about leveraging merchant relationships and talk about wanting to build broader capabilities and things that, conversations that we\u2019re having in the marketplace, in order to do that CyberSource is just a wonderful addition for us to be able to be a partner to either enable those conversations or to be part of those conversations. And quite frankly for us to start from scratch on merchant relationships is very, very different than to be able to start with a CyberSource inside the company.","Jack Carsky","Next question, David.","Operator","The next question is from Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","James Schneider","Thanks. Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Relative to your commentary on incentives, I believe last time you had talked about incentives being front half loaded in the first part of the fiscal year. And I think today you said that you now expect them to be, to trend upwards as we go through the year. Has something changed in terms of deals pushed out or additional deals signed. Maybe give us some color on the cadence of those incentives as we go through the year?","Byron Pollitt","One of the things we\u2019ve learned over the past seven years is that, we have been doing earnings calls is that incentives is very difficult to project quarter-by-quarter. We have gotten pretty good at projecting it on the full year basis. And so, with every passing quarter we get smarter about the deals that close, and the deals that are taking longer to close that we thought might close. And so, nothing has occurred that has changed our outlook for the year. But we are reaffirming the lumpiness of incentives and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re seeing here. We have one quarter in the bag and three to go and we\u2019re very comfortable with our guidance of 17% to 18.5% and we expect the three out-quarters to run at a higher rate than what you saw in the recently completed Q1.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Smitti Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.","Smitti Srethapramote","Thank you. At your analyst day a year and half ago, you guys estimated that there would be 38 million mobile plant cell [ph] locations by 2017. Just wondering if you guys can give us an update in terms of how things have played out versus your initial expectations and are there any particular geographies where you\u2019ve seen acceptance increased noticeably due to mPOS?","Byron Pollitt","That\u2019s a good question, and I have the number, but I don\u2019t have it now in terms of how many mPOS locations there are. But the number is growing extraordinarily quickly. The last number -- Canada, Australia and other places, I mean the numbers that I saw were several quarters ago, actually probably its almost a year ago, we\u2019re probably at $5 million and I believe the number was over $10 million, the last time I checked. So, I mean, the growth is happening and in addition to just the mPOS devices out there, usage is what's extraordinarily important. So, we can make sure we get you that number and next time we talk publicly we\u2019ll make sure we\u2019ll mention it, so everyone has it.","Jack Carsky","Our next question, David.","Operator","The next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.","Tien-tsin Huang","Great, thanks. Charlie, it sounds like you said -- I think you said you can protect the bottom line of, if the macro deteriorates here. Can you elaborate, was that an expense comment and maybe can you just give us an update on the timing of the CFO search? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf","Sure. So, on the first one, listen I think my comments are quite simple which is, the economic environment in terms of what we\u2019re seeing with the strengthening dollar obviously makes our jobs more difficult. The point of what I was trying to say was, we are not changing our spending patterns, the projects we have underway based upon what we\u2019re seeing in the world today. We\u2019re not laying people off. We\u2019re not even thinking about doing anything like that. We\u2019re continuing to push forward to grow the company because we think that\u2019s the right long-term thing for us to do given the opportunity, and we think as Byron just went through, we think we\u2019ll continue to perform as a company. Having said that, we also just always remind ourselves that like any company you can always tighten up and you can always go through and prioritize and figure out what the most important thing to do is and you really have to do every last thing. And if we got particularly noticed that what we are seeing in the world would affect us in any kind of meaningful way beyond what we expected. We have the ability to do that. And we\u2019re not contemplating that and even if we did that, we would assume -- assume we would do it in an intelligent way that still allows us to invest in the right thing. So, the point is if we had to and if we thought it was prudent we could reduce the expense base of the company or certainly slow the expense growth but not something we\u2019re contemplating doing right now. And on the CFO search, I would hope -- I hope we have something to report shortly on that.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Just a couple of clarifications. I guess, Charlie what's the strategy for rolling out tokenization for browser based ecommerce? I guess, I was under the impression, this spring you guys will be rolling something out. I\u2019m just curious what the plans are there? And then, secondly Byron on FX, just given your comments on some of the hedges in the rolling off of some hedges. Should we think start modeling in a couple of point impact for fiscal year \u201916? Thanks so much.","Charles W. Scharf","So, on the first piece. In the spring of this year we will have some tokenized solutions in the marketplace for some browser enabled solutions.","Byron Pollitt","Okay. And on the FX, Bryan I wish I had a crystal ball. But let me relay the following circumstance which is the dilemma. When we gave foreign exchange guidance on the fourth quarter call we had a full year of hedges in place. Three months later, we\u2019re saying that the interim FX developments have negatively impacted our revenue growth by about 50 basis points. So, within three months of our last projection of FX we\u2019re off 50 basis points in the year it was hedged. So, we are not yet ready to talk about FY \u201916. That said, your projection of just how strong, how much further strengthening the U.S. dollar can achieve. How long it can sustain at this level before the inevitable cycle goes back the other way, is as good a guess as ours will be. In terms of impact, we\u2019re using as our best proxy the December 31, forward exchange rates.","Jack Carsky","Next question, David.","Operator","The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead with your question.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. Could you talk a little bit, I mean you mentioned during the opening comments about the holiday spending being a little different kind of debit spending being affected by gasoline. Are there trends that you think that will be persisting throughout 2015. I know we\u2019ve got some differences in the way tax refunds are going to be paid this year. I mean any other things that we should be aware of as we go through \u201915 particularly in the U.S. and keeping that stuff in mind?","Byron Pollitt","I guess, because we spend a lot of time tearing apart everything that we can find about the holiday spend numbers. The stuff -- the things I talked about were the most important for us isolating the conversion, so you get a real underlying view of spend. We have talked about the impact of gas and what we would expect to be the ongoing impact of gas. The only thing which we didn\u2019t cover here which we spend a lot of time talking about is ecommerce volume. Ecommerce was extraordinarily strong during the holiday season which is a continuation of what we have seen. Growth rates of ecommerce were two to three times what they were in the physical world. And for us, we like that, because cash doesn\u2019t work in the online world. And so, we have got a much higher participation rate in the ecommerce world than we do in the face to face world. Other than that nothing is coming to mind, Moshe.","Jack Carsky","Next question, David.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Please go ahead with your question.","Craig Maurer","Yes, good evening. Thanks. First, could you give us a little bit of commentary on the impact that pricing changes that we have seen reported by the acquirers will contribute to your guidance on revenue growth? And secondly, we have seen EVMCo produce a draft of 3DS 2.0 based on Visa and MasterCard\u2019s work indicating that you\u2019ll be able to take additional authentication metrics into account starting in, at the beginning of \u201916. Does this also mean that what we\u2019ll get a card holder present like interchange tier to show up at time as well? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf","Let me take the first one. As we described on our fourth quarter call, we have a number of price adjustments that will take place in the second half, U.S. acquiring card service fees in April roughly two basis points, about 40 basis points on U.S. acquiring ISA again in that April timeframe, these get faced in. So, no impact in Q2, fiscal Q2, a beginning in fiscal Q3, full impact in Q4. So as you think about modeling it on a fiscal year basis we would expect our lowest revenue growth rate to be in the upcoming Q2, and then as the price adjustments start to kick in delving in Q3 and then by Q4 having an impact that would bring us to double digit revenue growth in fiscal Q4. Put that altogether and we are still reaffirming the guidance we gave in Q4 for the full year, but today largely because of FX at the lower end of that range.","Byron Pollitt","And then on your second question, I wouldn\u2019t relate those two dates. The work we\u2019re doing on 3D secure, in re-looking at the rates as we said. As with tokenized solutions being in the marketplace, we are constantly looking at what makes sense, constantly looking at the fraud, looking at the value added. And if it makes sense for us at some point to do something different within a change rates, we\u2019ll do it. But right now, we have no specific plans to talk about.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead with your question.","Timothy Willi","Thanks and good afternoon. Charlie, just going back to your comments, I guess throughout the class action that is starting to settle with those that opted out et cetera. Any comments you would have just around sort of the tone of collaboration, with yourself and the retailers would sort of come to the end of this, and just trying that into anything we should think about maybe longer term around rebates and incentives and the mix that would move more towards retailers versus banks, if there is anything we should consider there?","Charles W. Scharf","No, on the first piece, listen I think -- our relationships with merchants as we have said are extraordinarily important to us. Being able to settle these lawsuits is a good thing. It puts that conversation behind us and it an opportunity to talk about things that we can do together, the most obvious thing that I can talk about Visa Checkout. The idea of merchants advertising along side us, promoting something isn\u2019t something that would even have been contemplated a couple of years ago. And they are doing it because -- not because they like us as people, they\u2019re doing it because we have a product which they believe is good for them. When you\u2019re buying something in the ecommerce space, you put something in the card to checkout. What you want as a retailer is you want someone to actually pay for that. And for us to be able to bring a solution to market which has a much higher close rate, which is easy to use, where we can leverage our brand jointly, and ultimately by the way bring new customers to them is something that excites them. And so, those are the kinds of conversations that are very different that we\u2019re able to have today. Not everyone is in that bucket, but that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about it. We would like to have that kind of partnership with everyone. And as I said before, that\u2019s something that is going to play out over a long period of time. We know we have to prove to merchants that we can show up with solutions that are better for them, as I went through at Visa Checkout. As we announced a quarter or two ago with something called Visa Transaction Advisors, where we\u2019ve now turned out broaden analytics talents towards helping oil companies reduce fraud at the fuel pumps through risk scoring that we do on a real time basis for them. So, I would describe it as, it\u2019s encouraging, but it\u2019s a long-term discussion where there have been proof points in the marketplace and you\u2019ll start seeing them over a period of time.","Byron Pollitt","And with regards to incentives, Tim, the main action as it relates to incentives doesn\u2019t really today, it has little to do with MDL and much more to do with outrank in debit related to routing. That said going forward, I think as we increasingly introduce new product initiatives, new services and where we want to accelerate trial and adoption, we\u2019re prepared to put some incentives on the table to help crime in the pump and as a way of crafting a smart market entry using the merchants as a launch partner for services that will be good for the network and all its participants.","Jack Carsky","And with that we have time for one last question.","Operator","And your final question comes from Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question.","Lisa Ellis","[Indiscernible] at the end. Thanks guys. Hey, Charlie I just wanted to follow-up on the point you made on ecommerce. First, could you give an update on the mix of revenue or volume you\u2019re seeing to the e-commerce channel and the card mix as well? And then, second question is about the fed strategy paper on approving the U.S payment system that was released on Monday. I\u2019d love just your thoughts on that, the level of involvement or engagement you guys have had with the fed and how you see it impacting your business?","Byron Pollitt","So on the first don\u2019t have a lot of color. We\u2019ve not release numbers like that either by product or exactly what the mix is, but obviously given you what the relative growth rates are and so hopefully that\u2019s helpful. On the fed paper, first of all, we\u2019re very actively involved with the fed as many others are. We participate in the dialogue that they\u2019ve -- that they\u2019ve had up to this point leading up to the paper that they just released. And our experience has been that they\u2019ve been extremely inclusive with all partners seeking input. I\u2019d say, in terms of what it means for us, I mean, I don't think any of us exactly know and I think that will play itself out. What we do know is that we\u2019ve a network that works extraordinarily well, that provides great value for people that run transactions over it and a lot of what we do isn\u2019t easily duplicated. And its one thing to say that you're going to build something, its nothing to actually get it in the marketplace with the ability to put value added services around it. The people that participate in our network, the four parties get paid for it or they get benefits from it and they do it because they actually get those things out of it. So there are some very natural reasons why networks like ours and our competitors are attractive in the marketplace out there whether you\u2019re an issuer or whether you\u2019re an acceptor of the products. And as we\u2019ve talked about, what we spend our time, I mean, I don\u2019t want to underestimate the importance of running the network well, we spend a lot of time making sure that that\u2019s the case. We spend a lot of time on network security, but we spend even more time building value added products around it and the idea is that you run transaction over the Visa network and there is more value to you, because of either services we provide, whether its on a risk basis, whether its things that can help you grow your revenues and we\u2019re working on a series of things now that you will start to see in the marketplace. So again over a period of time, if people have a choice where to run their transaction over it, we\u2019re not going to sit here and say well, we just have a really good network, so you should run it over ours which we want to give both merchants, issuers and consumers ultimately reasons to want to use our network as opposed to any other solution out there.","End of Q&A","Jack Carsky","And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining us today. If anyone has any follow-up questions, feel free to give Victoria or myself a call. Thanks.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, it does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky","Good afternoon, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s Fiscal Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Joe Saunders, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa's Chief Financial Officer.","As always, this call is currently being webcast. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. PowerPoint deck containing highlights of today's commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and as a result of a variety of factors, actual results could differ materially from such statements. These include setbacks in the global economy and the impact of new financial reform regulations.","Additional information concerning these factors is available in our last 10-K on file with the SEC. It can be accessed through the SEC website and the Investor Relations section of our website.","For historical non-GAAP or pro forma-related financial information disclosed on this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available on the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's earnings press release. This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph W. Saunders","Thank you, Jack, and good afternoon, everyone. We are pleased to have the opportunity today to review our third quarter performance and the progress we continue to make in delivering against our strategy.","Visa had another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 10% increase over the same period last year.","After adjusting for our previously announced litigation reserve, net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 20% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.56, a 25% increase over the fiscal quarter of 2011.","So with 3 strong quarters of operational performance behind us, which include insights into both the initial adverse Durbin impacts and our fiscal fourth quarter services revenues, we are now adjusting our 2012 EPS growth guidance to low 20s. And we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. We used $461 million of our excess cash to repurchase 4 million shares during the fiscal third quarter. Looking ahead, our board has authorized an additional $1 billion share repurchase program.","You've heard this before but it's worth repeating, the shift from cash and checks to digital currency is a global trend that we expect to continue well into the future. Today, more than 30% of global consumer spending, almost $10 trillion, remains on cash and checks worldwide. Interestingly, despite Visa's success increasing penetration of electronic payments over the past several years, the total opportunity to take share from cash and checks worldwide has actually expanded since our IPO, driven primarily by global population growth and expansion of many emerging economies where electronic payments currently represent a relatively small percentage of personal consumption expenditures.","But we're never content just to benefit from evolving demographics, Visa is taking action to accelerate growth beyond the secular trend. To do so, we are focused on building and expanding the entire payments category in every market that we operate. That means in our partnership -- that means in partnership with our financial institution clients, putting more payment products in more people's hands, tapping entirely new market segments with diverse product offerings, expanding the places where Visa products are accepted and innovating next-generation payment technologies that create a superior payment experience for account holders and add value to financial institutions and merchants.","And as we are successful in expanding the overall payments category, Visa's business benefits through diversity and resiliency, which helped us continue to grow through the past economic cycles. So while we are closely watching economic conditions that could impact Visa's business, including fallout from continued volatility in Europe and softening outlooks for both China and Brazil, our underlying business drivers remain strong.","To begin my business review, let's first discuss the United States where credit posted yet another strong quarter, with payment volumes increasing 10%, Visa's fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category.","In addition to strength in the overall category, I'm confident we picked up share in credit as we've added new clients and built upon Visa's strong existing client relationships.","Turning to U.S. debit, the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012 and '13. During the June quarter, Visa's aggregate debit payments volume growth in the U.S. was negative 9%, as our clients complied with the April regulatory deadlines. This was driven by the fall off of Interlink payment volumes, which came in line with our projections.","Meanwhile, Visa Debit, which excludes Interlink, posted healthy mid single-digit payment volume growth, which we expect to continue.","As predicted during last quarter's call, I am confident Visa experienced the trough for U.S. debit payment volumes during the fiscal quarter, and we are now seeing signs of improved performance in the fourth fiscal quarter. That being said and as we have stated previously, we recognize that some debit share loss resulting from this regulation will be permanent.","As for implementation of our debit strategies to compete for merchant routing and win issuer business, I will simply say I am pleased with our progress and confident in our long-term position. Our efforts remain on track, and our strategies are gaining traction. We are absolutely delivering the value we promised to our merchant and financial institution clients, and equally important, the strategies are delivering on Visa's own financial and operational expectations.","As for the CID, the status is essentially unchanged since our last call. I remain comfortable our actions are appropriate, and we continue to be in regular contact with the department providing information as requested. I'll keep you updated if and when the situation warrants.","Switching gears, I'd like to briefly provide my perspective on the proposed merchant litigation settlement announced earlier this month. We reached a reasonable outcome that ensures the long-term health and competitiveness of the payments industry in the United States.  Importantly, our current guidance for fiscal 2012 and '13 fully takes this agreement into account.","I am pleased that we have settlements after an extensive process, coordinated by court-appointed mediators, which have been approved by class representatives, class counsel and the retailers who filed separate suits. We anticipate these will have support among the retail community in the U.S. because it is a fair and an appropriate compromise for all parties, and that the agreement will be approved by the court.","As for the next steps, preliminary court approval of this agreement is expected in the fall, and Visa is preparing to begin implementation in the early part of 2013.","Bottom line, we are moving towards ending a 7-year dispute with an important constituency of our client base: merchants. And we are doing so in a reasonable and responsible way. Looking ahead, we are actively looking for opportunities to work collaboratively with the U.S. merchant community to advance our mutual agendas. In particular, we believe that investments we are making in next-generation payment technologies, V.me, mobile payments and merchant offers, will drive considerable value to merchants.","Now let's shift the discussion to Visa's international business where we continue to focus on driving long-term growth. Breaking down our specific regions in constant dollars, payment volumes in Asia Pacific grew 13%, Canada at 8%, while CEMEA and Latin America posted gains of 41% and 20%, respectively, in the June quarter.","As I mentioned at the beginning of my remarks, a top priority is building the payments category globally. To that end, we continue to execute a targeted investment strategy in several geographies with significant growth potential, deploying locally tailored acceleration plans to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year horizon.","So let me give you a few specific examples to demonstrate our progress. In Russia, over 80% of consumer spending is still cash-based, which presents a significant opportunity. To drive future growth, Visa is intensely focused on expanding usage in every day spend merchant categories, including supermarkets, a strategy that aligns particularly well with our strong stable of debit cards in that country.","During the most recent quarter, Visa launched acceptance at Mutney [ph], the country's largest grocery chain, with more than 5,000 stores. In fact, with the addition of Mutney [ph], Visa now is accepted at the 4 largest food retail chains in Russia, a major step towards accelerated growth in that country.","At the same time, in the Middle East, we are building on our traditionally strong position with a fluent [ph] and Shariah-compliant credit products, working with clients to expand debits.","As one example of our success, Visa recently secured a significant multiproduct extension with the National Bank of Kuwait.","A key element of our strategy is increased investment in local expertise and local engagement. To that end, we recently opened our first offices in Doha, in Abu Dhabi, as well as doubled the size of our presence in Dubai to serve clients better across the Middle East and the CEMEA region generally.","And in East Africa, a region I recently visited, we are investing now to reap long-term returns. We recently opened a regional headquarters in Nairobi, Kenya, an important opportunity in that geography is using our Fundamo platform to deploy mobile solutions and drive long-term growth.","We are also making steady progress in Rwanda, which offers a case study of how Visa can proactively engage governments and align our own growth agenda with domestic priorities. In that regard, we are working with the Rwandan government to increase access to and usage of electronic payments in that country. A key priority is financial inclusion and literacy using mobile technology.","Additionally, Visa is now processing domestic payments and interbank ATM withdrawals, an important step forward for this emerging economy.","Also, our efforts will help increase tourism volumes from international travelers, a key driver of economic activity and a top government priority.","Finally, this effort should be the foundation for our activities in the entire East African region.  Expect us to talk to you more about this in the future.","We're also making steady progress in Indonesia, a rapidly expanding economy with a growing affluent middle class and a population, fast approaching 250 million. A key element of our strategy here is growing acceptance. To that end, Visa signed a multiphase, multiyear card acceptance promotion with the country's largest petrol chain, Pertamina, with more than 4,000 gas stations nationwide and approximately $30 billion in sales volume annually, the promotion will help expand the acceptance of Visa credit and debit cards over the next few years.","Most recently, during the last quarter, CyberSource, Visa's 2010 acquisition, signed a number of deals to accelerate e-commerce acceptance, including one with a national airline, Garuda, to provide payment, gateway and fraud management services.","Meanwhile, in China, I know you are already aware of the World Trade Organization's final report containing the findings of the case between the U.S. and Chinese governments concerning China's domestic electronic payments marketplace. While we are still assessing its implications, we are hopeful the ruling ultimately could provide for more global entrants into China's payment marketplace. Although, a number of additional steps still need to be taken in the WTO process before we have any clarity or certainty.","Most importantly to Visa, we continue to make strategic investments to expand our existing business in China. To that end, we executed several long-term client partnerships during the quarter, including multiyear extensions with CITIC Bank and China Minsheng Banking Corporation. We also secured a new relationship with Bank of Communication.","Overall, our focus is on advancing our partnership with local banks and China UnionPay to serve consumers and businesses using our existing 78 million co-badge cards when traveling abroad.","In fact, earlier this week, Visa cosponsored a payment security symposium with China UnionPay. The symposium was hosted by The Payment and Clearing Association of China. It was under the endorsement of the People's Bank of China.","During this event, Ellen Richey, our Chief Enterprise Risk Officer joined banking executives, regulators and law enforcement in Beijing to speak about Visa's role in payment security in the fast-growing Chinese market.","And finally, we are 2 days away from the start of the 2012 Olympic Games. There's a reason that Visa has been a sponsor of the Olympic games for more than a quarter of a century. No sponsorship platform offers a better opportunity to help our clients around the world grow their businesses while also driving incremental transaction revenue for Visa.","Over the past 13 Olympic Summer Games and Winter Olympic Games, this sponsorship has provided Visa with a global platform to amplify our brand message among a passionate global fan base, then drive tangible business results.","We work with our clients to tailor their Olympic-related activities to address the unique needs of their own business and geography, including cardholder acquisition, retention or increasing usage.","This year, I am pleased that Visa has engaged a record number of clients in our program, with more than 1,000 financial institutions and merchants worldwide activating Olympic-related activities, including a large portion from priority growth markets. This represents a 70% increase from our program in Beijing and positions us for a highly successful event over the next 2 weeks.","So to wrap up, our strong performance during the fiscal quarter demonstrates the underlying strength and resilience of Visa's business model. We continued to accelerate the migration away from cash and check to electronic payments. We helped our clients grow their core business lines. We expanded our footprint in international markets, both emerging and established. We advanced our innovation agenda. And we took significant steps to resolve critical business issues.","As always, I remain highly confident in the future of Visa. And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron.","Byron H. Pollitt","Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some observations and call-outs. First, note that we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We eliminated the previously disclosed litigation accruals associated with both the MOU in the merchants litigation and the preliminary agreement with the individual plaintiff, since both of these events are covered by our retrospective responsibility plan.","These accruals, which totaled $4.1 billion, resulted in a quarterly after-tax loss of $1.8 billion on a GAAP basis. Excluding these litigation accruals, we reported solid earnings per share of $1.56 for the quarter.","Second, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. We expect a similar, if not slightly higher impact in the next few quarters, as more of our debit volume is exposed to lower variable fees and incentive agreements. As we have stated before, this is already incorporated into our guidance.","Third, foreign tax credits resulted in a benefit of $56 million or $0.08 to our adjusted diluted EPS this quarter. These tax credits were contemplated in our full year guidance, with the amount recognized in the third quarter representing the total for the year.","Fourth, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 5 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth, most recently 10% in the quarter. Through the 21st of July, credit payment volume growth has comped at a 9% rate, consistent with a somewhat tepid but sustained U.S. economic recovery.","Fifth, as anticipated, aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 9% growth rate in the third quarter, led by Interlink payment volume, which was off 54%. So far, the month of April has proven to be the trough in debit payment volume loss. And since then, we have seen sequential monthly progress during the quarter in recapturing portions of this Interlink volume.","Importantly, Visa Debit, which excludes Interlink, continued to post solid mid-single-digit payment volume growth.","Sixth, client incentives for the quarter, as a percent of gross revenue, were 19%, consistent with our full year guidance range, which is weighted to the back half of the year.","Higher incentives had 2 drivers: First, pricing adjustments linked to our U.S. debit mitigation strategies, which are expected to continue and potentially grow as our merchant and acquirer agreements take hold; and second, certain Rest of World incentives, which are not expected to repeat in the fourth quarter.","Lastly, in late May, we received from the IRS a notice of proposed adjustment for our fiscal 2008 federal income tax return. This notice would disallow the deduction and associated tax benefit related to payments made in 2008 toward the American Express litigation. We disagree with this proposed adjustment. We are comfortable defending our position, and importantly, we made no changes to our tax estimates relating to this deduction or any similar deductions for covered litigation in subsequent fiscal years. Resolution of these types of tax matters generally take some time to conclude.","Now, let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global, payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter, followed by our results through July 21. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012.","Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars was 6%, down from the March quarter's normalized 10% after adjusting for the leap year.","Several call-outs: first, combined credit growth for both the U.S. and Rest of World held steady versus a normalized prior quarter, both produced double-digit growth; second, Rest of World debit growth was unchanged at 28%, same as the normalized second quarter rate; third, more recently through July 21, U.S. payment volume growth was flat, comprised of 9% credit growth and minus 7% for debit.","Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 14% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter, which compares to a normalized 15% rate in the second quarter. The U.S. grew 11% and the Rest of World, 16%.","We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions. Through July 21, cross-border volumes, on a constant dollar basis, grew 12%, with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and the Rest of World at 13%.","Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $13.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter, a 1% increase over the prior year period. A debit-led decline of 3% in the U.S. was offset by 18% growth in Rest of World.","For the month of July through the 21, processed transaction growth was a positive 2%, driven by an improving trajectory in U.S. processed transaction growth.","Separately, CyberSource reported 1.3 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year.","Three call-outs: First, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the rules next year; second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. Credit and Rest of World; finally, although there appear to be darkening economic clouds, our global revenue drivers remain healthy with no clear signals of a downturn at this point in time.","Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 10% increase year-over-year. After hedges, there was no meaningful foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter.","Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 15% over the prior year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the March quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the June quarter.","Data processing revenue was $1 billion, up 17% over the prior year's quarter, based on solid growth rates for CyberSource transactions and Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S., as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective in the quarter.","As a reminder, the fixed acquirer network fee initiated in the third quarter is booked to data processing revenue. Offsetting merchant and acquirer incentives are reflected in the contra revenue incentive line, which I'll cover in a moment.","Turning to a different metric. We saw a step-up in the gross revenue data processing yield, due in part to strategic pricing adjustments, but also driven by the steep decline in Interlink transactions in the quarter, which are by far our lowest yielding product.","International transaction revenue was up 13% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes, with low double-digit growth rates in the U.S. and mid-teen growth in the Rest of World as measured on a constant dollar basis.","As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 19%. The fourth fiscal quarter will also see an elevated level, but is likely to be slightly less than Q3. Together, these incentive levels are consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. While we are not yet prepared to offer a more detailed view of fiscal 2013 incentives, we do expect a modest increase from the 2012 level of 17% to 18%.","Total adjusted operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 10% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our investments in growth-related technology projects.","Marketing expenses of $242 million reflect a heavier weighting of spend in the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics.","Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter was 58%, bringing our fiscal year-to-date to 61%, consistent with our guidance of about 60% for the year. The third quarter's margin is in line with our expectation for expense timing, as we realize a second ramp-up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics.","Capital expenditures were $108 million in the quarter and are $235 million year-to-date. Given our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year, we will likely come in at the lower end of that range.","Our adjusted tax rate for Q3 was 29.2%, and as I mentioned at the outset, was positively impacted by a $56 million benefit from foreign tax credits. The amount recognized represents the total for the year.","During the quarter, we spent $461 million to repurchase 4 million shares at an average price of $115.51 per share. Our board recently authorized a new repurchase plan totaling $1 billion, effective through July of 2013.","Separate from the share repurchase program, on July 24, we added an incremental $150 million to the escrow account. The fourth quarter event will reduce the B share conversion ratio to 0.4206, thereby reducing the A equivalent share count by 1.2 million shares.","At the end of the June quarter, we had 670 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The adjusted weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the third quarter totaled $675 million.","Finally, we are making only one adjustment to our outstanding 2012 fiscal guidance, other than the minor notes I've addressed. Given where we are year-to-date, we are eliminating high teens from our EPS growth guidance and going with just low 20s. As is our custom, we plan to fully address our 2013 guidance on our fourth quarter earnings call.","And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] First question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","If you -- I was hoping you could flesh out a little bit the steps that you've taken now that we're kind of 3 months further in with respect to the debit acquiring fee and you've talked about some of the effects. But what's actually happened? How much of that has been implemented? And could you talk a little bit about how that's kind of been -- how that has flowed through the numbers?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, we're -- I'm not exactly sure about the specific question, but I'll -- there were 2 significant things that we did, one was the pricing and one was the paid or the debit card change. So from a fixed pricing point of view, that's been fully implemented. From a paid or a debit card point of view, that has been significantly implemented, but it's being implemented in phases and it will take a few more months to get it fully done. Remember, however, that we retained the Interbank logo on the majority of our largest customers. And so none of that volume, as long as the Interlink logo is there, will go through paid.[ph]","Operator","The next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division","So what I was thinking is now that you have at least arrived at this settlement proposal, I'm wondering if you're thinking about the utilization of your free cash flow differently from what we've seen over the past several years since you funded the escrow account. And then secondly as you talk about the investments that you think are going to be important to the merchants, when we look at the incremental margins in the quarter versus sort of past couple of years, we're kind of at a low level -- or certainly [ph] close to a trough level. And I'm wondering if we should be thinking about the investments going forward at these more incremental margin levels.","Byron H. Pollitt","So let me take the first one. We have no change whatsoever in our philosophy of returning excess cash to shareholders. To the extent that we are not placing cash in the escrow account, the alternative would be open market repurchases of our A shares, and that is exactly what we intend to focus on. So no change on that front, as further evidenced by the approval by the board to authorize a new $1 billion dollar share repurchase program. Second, with regards to margins -- let me reframe that, last year, we delivered about a 60% operating margin. That is our guidance for this year. The lower margins, that operating margins you're seeing in this quarter and we'll see again in the next quarter are all consistent with our guidance of about 60% for this year. As you may recall from our -- at the beginning of the year earnings call, beginning of fiscal year, we indicated that it would be about 60% for the year, but that we would be a little higher in the first half of the year and a little lower in the second half of the year, largely due to a ramp-up in technology investments and a weighted marketing spend for the Olympics timed with the second half. So this year, past year, about 60%, and we'll let you know what '13 looks like in another quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Can you first start off, you said in the past you would expect an acceleration of revenue growth in fiscal year '13, I think, versus 2012 levels. Can you just comment on the main drivers of that, especially if you expect incentives to be sequentially higher year-over-year next year?","Byron H. Pollitt","So what we said was -- or meant to communicate was that this was a comment around the implementation of the Durbin rules. And that what we expected is that once we had annualized the impact of Durbin, which will take us through the first 2 fiscal quarters of next year, once we have lapped those rules and the Durbin impacts were in our base, at that point, everything else being equal, we would expect an acceleration, particularly in our -- specifically focused on our debit business because we've got the Durbin impact now in our base. So that's what we meant by that. Everything else being equal, we would expect to see it. Again, with regards to revenue growth for next year, we'll be much more specific about that on the next quarter call.","Operator","The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Yes. So, Byron, just to follow up to that, does that mean your fiscal '13 guidance signal is not relating to overall revenue growth? It's just related -- it's just relating to the growth in your debit business in the U.S? And then I guess the follow-up to that is that you indicated that your growth trends are not showing much effect from macro issues and you've had a string of pretty good incremental wins that are presumably offsetting what appears to be a general slowing in retail spending. Is there any way to quantify the recent contribution in your growth rate from new wins that are occurring as an offset to the cyclical pressures that are out there?","Byron H. Pollitt","So let me -- yes, let me -- I'll go first in responding to that. So the guidance, the specific quantitative guidance we have for next year for '13, number one, is EPS growth in the high teens; number two, incentives that are modestly, slightly higher than what we expect to experience this year. That's the extent to which we've guided to '13. And remember, when we said we expect revenues to generate, that's everything else being equal. We expect to have debit -- the U.S. debit part of the business annualized halfway in through the year. So in order -- I mean honestly, to give a much more informed perspective on revenue growth for next year, we'll wait to the fourth quarter call at which point we'll have much better visibility of what we're looking at going in. Meanwhile, we are reconfirming the guidance that we currently have for fiscal year '13. With regards to incremental wins, you can say we have some, certainly on the credit side. We don't have -- we have the opposite, so to speak, courtesy of the U.S. government on the debit side. And so in balancing those and looking at the current underlying revenue drivers of cross-border volume growth, transaction growth, inside the U.S., outside the U.S., that's really what's underpinning our guidance comments for '13 -- for balance of year and for '13 to date. Joe?","Joseph W. Saunders","Yes. I don't think that there is a significant amount of traction yet on some of the credit wins in the United States. So I don't believe that, that's where the growth is coming from. But certainly it is cause for optimism as it relates to our credit volumes going forward. I would also reference a lot of our wins outside of the United States, which are picking up steam as we talked about and will provide revenue. And I'm sure, as Byron has pointed out, that everybody understands, a lot of our '13 guidance was a reflection on how we would fare given the Durbin legislation. Right now, our metrics in every other regard are quite strong. And we will, as Byron said, address our expectations next quarter.","Operator","The next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","I applaud your comments about working more collaboratively with merchants. The fact is though, we're just now hopefully turning the chapter on a relationship that's had tension involved for many, many years. So this is a big step forward for both sides, positive step forward. But besides the technology that you alluded to earlier, I mean how difficult do you think it will be to change your overall cultural approach and just general relationship overall with the merchants from a very high level, aside from the actual product level?","Joseph W. Saunders","There's been a, I suppose that you could characterize for the last 7 years, as a contentious relationship. But the fact of the matter is when you look at the history of the usage of electronic payments, it's been growing quite rapidly during that period of time. So I'd characterize it as a kind of a love-hate relationship, I mean something that you sometimes can't do with and what generally you can't do without. And I think that we are in a position to reach out and do much more going forward, particularly because of the technology that we're embracing that will bring a new level of value to the merchant community. And I'm very, very optimistic about it. We work with the merchant community through all of this, even as you talk about what's going on right now or as certain merchants may complain about this or that. Remember, we have incentive contracts with a significant number of them. And so we are working with them. We're dealing with them on a daily basis, and we think that those relations will improve as time goes on. Certainly, that's going to be our endeavor.","Operator","The next question comes from  John Williams with UBS.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just very quickly, Byron, I just wanted to get more detail on your comment that you said you're seeing no clear signs of a slowdown. I think if you look at the other folks in the industry, American Express is the one that really comes to mind. Do you have anything to say regarding the affluent calling out high-end versus low-end differences that you might have seen, maybe traveling hotels or any other somewhat discretionary verticals that you might have seen some change in behavior over the last few months?","Byron H. Pollitt","I think it's too early to make that conclusion. John, what we do is watch -- we break down the quarter month-to-month. And there can be some very wide differentials within a given quarter. Let me give you an example. In the quarter just completed for U.S. credit, we grew 8% in the month of April, 12% in the month of May, 10% in the month of June. All-in, it delivered 10% growth. And so when we look at the monthly kind of progression over the past couple of quarters, these are all -- they bounce around month-to-month, but they're all pretty healthy. And so I think the hardest part of a trend to call is the beginning. And given the kind of healthy growth rates we're experiencing, it's -- we just don't see a discernible trend. But I promise you, we will update everyone quarter-by-quarter, and would be happy to go through monthly progressions to help give a better flavor for this. So I'm not saying it's not happening, just saying we're not seeing it yet.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just wanted to ask a few questions on the litigation settlement. So what's the process in dealing with the merchants that opt out? And also, what's the plan for the, I guess I'd call it, overfunded litigation escrow? How are you going to deal with that as the Class B shares come unlocked? And then lastly, maybe -- don't be mad, Jack. Just what's the -- in terms of the surcharge, no surcharge rule going away, how much volume in earnings do you estimate will be at risk by allowing surcharging in the U.S.?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, I'll answer the question about surcharging, and then I'm going to let our counsel who watched over this litigation for the past 7 years make some comments about the rest of your question. We think that the position that we struck, and if you look at the MOU and you look at all of the details of surcharging and how it can be affected and what the caps are and so forth and so on, we think it's a fair settlement. And we do not look at surcharging per se as it relates to this litigation as something that will -- it significantly affect us at all. I mean, that's our feeling about it. That's our position. We could talk about this for hours, and of course we have and we did before. We agreed to do anything, and we'll just have to let it unfold. But I think it's a -- I think that the settlement is a reasonable settlement for both sides. Josh?","Joshua R. Floum","Thanks, Joe. As to the process going forward, we are very confident that the court is going to approve this settlement. And the reason I say this is this case has been pending for 7 years. And during a great deal of that time, there has been a court-ordered mediation process with 2 mediators and the involvement of the court. And at the end of that time, all of the class counsel, the class representatives, the individual merchants, as well as the financial institution defendants have agreed to the deal. It's a fair and reasonable deal. And therefore, we're comfortable that at the end of the day, the court is going to approve the settlement.","Byron H. Pollitt","And with regards to the, Tien-Tsin, the unlocking of the shares, we've had a lot of practice with the unlocking of the C shares. And as a result, we are very confident that when that time comes, we'll be able to manage that with barely a ripple with regards to impact on stock price.","Operator","The next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Why don't I just pick up on that question, if I could. And just thinking out beyond the court approval coming in the fall that you guys expect, can you guys just clarify what sort of true legal recourse the retailers that choose to opt out of the settlement, what kind of legal recourse they actually have? Obviously a couple of the biggest have publicly announced that they do not support the settlement, which probably doesn't surprise anybody. But if you can just clarify for all of us what kind of legal recourse they actually have when and if they formally opt out, that would be great.","Joshua R. Floum","Right, the way the deal is structured is that opt-outs, and you always expect a couple in a class action lawsuit, can sue only for monetary relief. There's something called a non-opt-out class for injunctive relief. What that means is that all of Visa and MasterCard's rules in existence as of the time of approval are released both by the opt-ins and the opt-outs.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just want to ask about the mid-single-digit growth in the Visa Debit line. I guess I thought that number would be a little bit higher. Has that trended down over the last couple of quarters? And then if it has, what might be driving a little bit slower growth in Visa Debit? Is it a move towards PIN, loss of share, Durbin?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, I mean, we always expected to have some deterioration in the magnitude of that growth number. And as a matter of fact, it's doing better than we had originally anticipated. Remember, when the whole Durbin thing came, and you had a number of debit cards with rewards associated with them, it drove financial institutions to promote it much more heavily. It encouraged consumers to use it considerably more. And so part of the whole Durbin legislation was a little bit of a damper on debit card transactions in general. Not that they were going to stop, it's just that the rate of growth was going to slow down. So we're actually quite happy with where we are.","Byron H. Pollitt","And I'll just add a little quantitative perspective. We were -- in the fourth fiscal quarter of '11, we were kind of at the upper end of mid-single digits in that category. We've remained in that range for Qs 1, 2 and 3. And if you look at Q2 on a normalized basis, pulling out the leap year, the growth rates for Q2 and Q3 are identical. So I would say this is a -- with the overlay of what Joe said in terms of kind of a modest level of impact, it has been relatively sustained during this fiscal year.","Operator","The next question comes from Wayne Johnson with Raymond James.","Wayne Johnson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division","This question is for Joe. Could you give us an update on how V.me is progressing for commercial launch? Is Visa still on track with that? And if you could just provide kind of initial expectations how we should see this rollout this fall?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, yes, I think we are right on track with the Click-to-buy and aliasing capability that we suggest that we would rollout by the end of the year. It is up. It is live. It is running. We have -- we currently have 6 relatively large merchants on the system. We do not have a significant number of consumers at this particular point in time. But we're on schedule with several financial institutions to begin that in the very near future. And so right now, we're still anticipating a holiday season rollout of the project. And of course it'll gain a lot more traction in 2013 than it will at the beginning of 2012. But we're happy with the progress, we're happy with the performance and we're happy with where we are, both with the merchant community and with financial institutions.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Could you talk a bit about anything you've seen in Latin America, looking at sort of the regional data, constant currency, that one seemed to show more of a slowdown at least for the June data, while all the other regions sort of held steady. So I'm curious that there might be something relative to that economy or country that impacted those numbers that might be in play for a couple more quarters. And then, if I could slip one other in, just any thoughts around the average credit ticket in the U.S., which had been climbing steadily out of the recession and now seems to be in a slightly sort of negative position. Is that fuel? Or is there something else you might think would account for that trend in the last couple of quarters?","Byron H. Pollitt","Let me start with the Latin America. With regards to currency -- first of all, let me just mention to the group that we do hedge exposures. So whatever impact, with the exception of 2 countries, which I'll turn to in a moment, we can dampen the impact on FX. With regards to currency-specific countries, we are seeing a depreciation in Argentina and a continued depreciation in Venezuela. The outlook for devaluation, I would say, is nothing's a certainty, but I -- at some point, it looks like we're heading to that. And you can't -- there's no economic hedge for either one of those 2 currencies. So is that a bit of a drag on our Latin America business? Yes. Is it hedgeable? No. And so -- but that's baked into the numbers we reported. With regards to any other country call-out, I would say Brazil has tempered a bit. There has been a tax placed on credit usage for cross-border travel, which has definitely put a bit of a break on the exuberance of the Brazilians to see the world. That tax is not applied to debit, but it is applied to credit. And so I would say overall, particularly the rest of Latin America that the business is strong. It has very, very healthy growth rates, unimpeded by shifts in currency. Average credit ticket, no substantive change in that metric for the moment. But if you'd like something more specific, I'm sure if you call our IR group, Jack or Victoria would be able to give you something more specific.","Operator","The next question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One, a question for counsel relating to a previous answer, when you say opt-outs can sue only for monetary relief, does that include relief from interchange? And secondly, for Byron, the yield on processed transactions in the quarter jumped significantly, which was expected, but it was a lot more than what we were looking for. Do you think that the yield posted in the quarter is a good one to think about going forward?","Byron H. Pollitt","Let me start with the yield question. So the yield increase in the data processing category absolutely was expected. Remember a couple of things as perspective, that as part of our Durbin mitigation strategies, we are -- we implemented a fixed acquiring network fee, which is completely captured in the DP category. We also reduced variable transaction fees, which are also included in the DP category. But we then introduced a degree of incentive offset, and that appears in a completely different line. So while the growth yield for DP goes up, it's not a true picture. And instead, you really ought to be looking at net yield, which I'll come back to in a minute, as it relates to Visa Inc. revenue yield. With regards to the DP yield, there's one other factor involved, which will -- which has an impact on the calculation, which is our lowest yielding product is Interlink. So as -- and that has borne the brunt of the loss as we conform to the new rules. And so as Interlink moves out of the denominator in terms of yield calculation, it has the least impact on the numerator and automatically, the yield moves up. And so you have both of those indicators going forward. There are a number of factors impacting the DP line. Debit is one, including Interlink; CyberSource booked into the DP line. And so I think what it's going to take is the next 2 or 3 quarters or so in order for us to kind of reset what the base trend lines ought to be projected off of with regards to data processing. So I think -- wish I could be more helpful, but I think it's going to take another couple of quarters before this sorts out. When you put all of this together and you look at the Visa Inc. revenue yield, of which DP is an important component, but that captures the incentives. In the way that we capture and measure yield, our yield for the third fiscal quarter of '12 is actually flat with the yield we experienced in the third quarter of '11, fiscal year '11. So a lot of moving parts. This is where we're sorting out, and I'm afraid it's just going to take 2 or 3 quarters before we can we reset the different trend lines on the different fee categories.","Joshua R. Floum","And as to your first question, opt-out merchants can only sue for monetary damages. And by the way, those claims would be covered under our retrospective responsibility plan. Claims for things like rate relief or interchange reductions, that's in the nature of injunctive relief. And opt-outs cannot make those claims.","Operator","The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","It sounds like you guys are still see some reasonably good underlying organic growth globally, and I'm just wondering how we reconcile that with kind of the darkening clouds commentary you mentioned before. And then secondarily, I was just wondering if you could talk about the -- how the tax benefit will be utilized in terms of the litigation escrow reserve build.","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, Byron, why don't you answer the second?","Byron H. Pollitt","Yes, I'll do the first one. With regards to the litigation of the -- how the tax impact will be utilized, there's a different treatment for GAAP, and it's a different treatment for cash flow. So for GAAP, we go ahead as soon as it's probable and estimable, which we concluded it was, we go ahead and put that through the income statement. So on a GAAP basis, that's now behind us. With regards to the cash flow impact, you can't record the deduction on your return until you actually make a payment. And so the payments associated with this are potentially some time out. And so there will be no cash flow impact this year associated with that once the agreement is -- once we're further along -- much further along in the litigation process, we'll be in a position to actually make payments, at which point we can then take the tax deduction. We'll give you some perspective on that on the fourth quarter call.","Joseph W. Saunders","And as it relates to your first question, we -- I mentioned in my comments that the demographics of the world are changing, the number of places that accept electronic payments are increasing. And so there is some countercyclical things that occur and allow us to build volume even when economies are slowing down to some extent. That's always the difficulty we have in calling out what's going on in the world or what do we see or how do we measure or know exactly what's happening. And it's tough because more and more people have access to electronic payments, and more and more locations accept electronic payments. And those have to be factored into the equation.","Operator","And the last question does come from Glenn Greene with Oppenheimer.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'll just ask on the U.S. debit volume trends. You sort of saw -- I mean, through May, I think you gave us an update, it was sort of negative 8 end of the quarter, kind of negative 9. And encouragingly, it sort of looks like it improved in July to negative 7. So I mean, I guess the question -- or do you think we're sort of in a sustained, improved trajectory? And obviously the pricing efforts are having some effect here, but where do you think we go from here?","Byron H. Pollitt","We're in uncharted waters. We like the notion that it's an improving trajectory. And we will -- honestly, we'll know better how competitors respond to our strategies, and I think this is still very early days in terms of trying to project how this will play out. Remember, the rules only went into effect April 1. So we've only had, what, 3 months and 3 weeks of operation under these new rules. And to date, we're pleased with how our strategies have taken hold to start, and we'll report on how well they continue to perform in the upcoming quarters.","Joseph W. Saunders","Without making an absolute prediction on the heels of what Byron just said though, I will remind you what I said in the remarks I made earlier, and that is there will be a permanent deterioration in our debit card volume as a result of the Durbin legislation. There's absolutely no question about it. So when we talk about waiting and seeing, we're kind of waiting to see where it gets to, but I don't expect to be -- I don't expect to be close to where we were when the whole thing started.","Jack Carsky","Well, that wraps it up.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our Web site.","And with that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.","Byron Pollitt","Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, turning to revenue, as expected and previewed on our call last quarter revenue growth moderated during the quarter, growing 9% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis or 7% nominally, which includes the expected 2 percentage points of FX headwind we had been guiding to since the beginning of the fiscal year. As a reminder the current Q2 is lapping 15% revenue growth in the prior year quarter, which benefited from a number of favorable one-time adjustments.","Looking ahead to Q3, we expect nominal revenue growth to be in mid single-digits which could be a couple of percentage points below Q2\u2019s growth rate. As signaled on last quarter\u2019s call, a softer Q3 growth rate was also anticipated given continued FX headwinds of 2 percentage points, a 17% revenue comp in the prior year quarter, also driven impart by one-time events and a moderation in cross-border spend which we view as short-term. After two softer quarters in fiscal Q4, we expect to see constant dollar revenue growth more reflective of the secular shift as well as the e-commerce and mobile trends that have driven and will continue to drive attractive growth for years to come.","As a footnote to fiscal Q4, we expect very little impact from Chase card conversions, particularly given our quarter lag and reporting of service fees. This event will have more impact in fiscal year 2015.","Our guidance for client incentives remains unchanged, despite delivering first half client incentives as a percent of gross revenues of 15.8%, we expect incentives to be second half weighted and finish the year within the current guidance of 16.5% to 17.5%. On a full fiscal year basis, we now expect our guidance of low double-digit constant dollar net revenue growth to be in the 10% to 11% range with a negative 2 percentage point impact from FX.","Now let\u2019s turn to payment volume and transaction growth. On a constant dollar basis global payment volume growth was 12% unchanged from Q1. U.S. payment volume growth for Q2 was 8%, also unchanged from Q1. With a boost from Easter timing and better weather U.S. payment volume growth for the first 21 days of April rose to 12%. The deceleration in cross-border growth seems to be bubbling out. Q2 constant dollar growth was 8%, 4 percentage points down from Q1, but the first 21 days of April registered 7% growth nearly flat to Q2. Cross-border weakness is pronounced in Latin America, as in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, the Canada to U.S. corridor and Russia.","Visa process transaction growth was a healthy 11% in Q2 and rose to 14% for the first 21 days in April. Taken together we are seeing a sustained economic recovery, but no signs yet of acceleration. A word on Russia and Ukraine, we have clearly seen a drop-off in cross-border volume and sanctions are expected to have some impact on volume. Our guidance assumes several pennies of EPS impact for the fiscal year. We are fully engaged with all parties involved and we\u2019ll continue to adjust our outlook as the situation clarifies overtime.","Next callout relates to our effective tax rate for the period. At 22% for the quarter, our rate was positively influenced by the recognition of tax benefits under IRS Section 199 which allows for the deduction of a portion of the income related to U.S. domestically produced computer software. As a reminder, successfully employing strategies to manage our tax rate lower has been a consistent component of our earnings guidance since we went public in 2008 and will continue to be in the future.","The total benefit to the quarter was $218 million, $184 million of which represented prior years and $17 million of benefit for each of the first two fiscal quarters. We expect an additional 30 million to 35 million of benefit over the remaining two fiscal quarters and a continuing benefit in future years. Accordingly, we are adding to our guidance for fiscal 2014 a full year tax rate approaching 30%. Please note, this rate was contemplated in our full year EPS guidance for fiscal 2014.","Last callout, we remain bullish on our future growth prospects and fully committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of 5.1 million shares during the quarter at an average price per share of $217 and change resulting in the total cost of 1.1 billion. This leaves an outstanding open to buy of 3 billion at the end of March, and as always we will take advantage of market movements to effectively repurchase at attractive rates.","Now let me dive a little deeper into the numbers. As noted earlier global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 12%, the U.S. grew 8% and international grew 16%. Drilling down further for the March quarter, U.S. credit growth was 11%, slightly higher than the 10% in Q1. Through April 21st credit improved to 14% growth, U.S. debit was 7% in Q2, flat compared to Q1 and through April 21st debit also improved, rising to 11% growth. As mentioned earlier, global cross-border volume delivered an 8% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter, down from 12% in the December quarter.","The U.S. grew 7% and international grew 8%. Through April 21st cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% with the U.S. growing 8% and international registering 7% growth. Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled 15.4 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 11% increase over the prior year period, the U.S. grew 7% while international delivered 23% growth. Through April 21st, processed transaction growth rose to 14%.","Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, a 7% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by a 2 percentage point foreign currency headwind.","Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.5 billion, up 7% over the prior year and was driven by moderating global payment volume growth. The difference between the 7% reported revenue growth and the 12% growth in constant dollar payment volume is largely due to 3 percentage points of negative FX. Visa service fees are disproportionately impacted by foreign exchange translation, compared to other revenue lines.","Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up 7% over the prior year\u2019s quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa process transaction both in the U.S. and internationally. The difference between 7% revenue growth and 11% transaction growth in the period was due to one-time SAMs accrual reversals in the prior year in combination with the influence of the fixed fee component associated with the SAMs pricing structure that does not grow with transactions. International transaction revenue was up 5% to $871 million reflecting some moderation of growth across the globe that first impacted us at the outset of calendar year 2014.","Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 2% from the prior year. Certain expenses have been rephrased to the Q3 and Q4 fiscal quarters and as signaled last quarter, we continue to expect elevated marketing investments in Q3 and Q4 relative to Q1 tied to the 2014 FIFA World Cup event. Operating margin, 65% for the second quarter, ahead of our annual guidance of low 60s, but consistent with our expectations for higher expenses in the fiscal third and fourth quarters.","That said we now expect our full year operating margin to be in the low to mid 60s. Capital expenditures were $97 million in the quarter. At the end of the March quarter, we had 629 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 634 million.","Finally, given our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, let me recap our full year guidance. Constant dollar net revenue growth 10% to 11% with 2 percentage points of negative FX impact; client incentives in the 16.5 to 17.6 range; operating margin in the low to mid 60s; tax rate approaching 30%; EPS growth of mid to high-teens; free cash flow of about 5 billion.","And with that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie.","Charlie Scharf","Thanks a lot Byron and good afternoon everyone. Let me start with a couple of comments about the quarter and reiterate some of the things that Byron had said. First of all and probably most importantly to us as we look at our results underlying what we see the business drivers from the most part remains steady from last quarter. Specifically the U.S. spending levels grew consistent with that of the prior quarter, not accelerating or decelerating but still reasonably strong and as Byron had mentioned April is off to a strong start which is certainly encouraging for us.","Non-U.S. domestic spending grew consistent levels as well and non-U.S. cross-border spending was weaker and as Byron mentioned, it\u2019s from very specific corridors which we can certainly talk more about. Revenue growth came in where we expected and as we mentioned it was impacted by the strong U.S. dollar and these non-recurring comps from the prior year, and we expect these effects to be slightly more pronounced in the third quarter. And looking even beyond the third quarter, we would expect in the fourth quarter to see revenue growth more reflective of the strong payment volumes that continue to underpin our quarterly results.","Let me move now for a second and just describe what we see in Russia. As I\u2019m sure you all know the U.S. government imposed economic sanctions a few weeks ago which has forced us to take action. We\u2019re complying with U.S. law as you would expect which means that two affected banks cannot issue or acquire transactions for Visa. These banks represent less than 1% of our volume in Russia and you would expect that we would continue to comply with U.S. law as sanctioned situation evolves. As of now all of the Visa systems are processing normally and we continue to serve all of our other clients in Russia today. Due to U.S. sanctions the Russian Duma is working on modifications to the current national payment system law, President Putin has directed the Duma to pass a series of changes which could pass as early as tomorrow. The proposed modifications are evolving, but as we understand them could include the following; first of all, all domestic data processing would need to be onshore; second, most domestic transactions data would need to remain domiciled within Russia; third, a payment network must provide continuity of services in compliance with Russian law; fourth, the creation of a settlement center 100% owned by the Central Bank of Russia; fifth, a collateral requirement for foreign payment systems; and lastly, the ability to impose volumes on foreign payment system providers.","Keep in mind, this is all still fluid and while none of this is certainly helpful for Visa if passed, parts might even cause us to rethink our domestic processing opportunity in Russia. But we are hopeful that there is still opportunity for Visa to participate in the growing in the electronic payments business in Russia. We will not understand the impact on our business in potential future until the laws and regulations are completed. But we remain committed to finding ways to provide our services as long as U.S. government and Russian governments allow.","On the legal and regulatory front, not a lot to talk about this quarter as I\u2019m sure you know in late March the U.S. Court have appealed for the DC Court rule but the Federal reserve acted properly in its interpretation of Dodd-Frank a result which we are obviously pleased with.","A quick update on payment security and specifically industry collaboration, last quarter I spoke at length about the need for the industry defined broadly to work together to create payment standards and improve security. We believe there is an opportunity for this collaboration to occur and are encouraged. We and MasterCard have formed a cross-industry working group to accelerate this joint-collaboration. The purpose is to work with a broad group of participants in the payments landscape, not just to move forward to more secure technologies in the short-term, but to think in long-term as well. This includes driving EMV adoption, but it looks to create a clear roadmap for the future of payment security, inclusive of both physical, POS as well as card-not-present transactions.","The group will have representation of banks of all sizes, credit unions, acquirers, retailers, point of sale manufacturers and industry trade groups. We also look forward to broad network participation so we can be as effective as possible. On EMV specifically First Data Star Network, FIS\u2019s NYCE Network, Discovery Financial Services PULSE Network, and other regional network providers have agreed to participate in the common debit solution that these introduced last year. The collaboration between Visa and our partners will help enable the deployment of debit EMV solutions. This is again an example of industry players working together to move payment security forward.","Let me talk for a second about tokenization. The standards, services and technologies we\u2019re working on will play an important role, not just in security but in enabling and securing new payment experiences in the online mobile and face-to-face channels. We are making progress on our work towards getting it into the marketplace. The token standard that we, MasterCard and American Express jointly wrote and sponsored has been adopted by EMVCo, the industry standards body, and is currently at a common period across the other card networks, banks and security industry groups.","We will be rolling out our token services capable of associating a limited use of Visa token with an underlying card credential and are working with issuers, processors, and acquirers that introduced our first wave of token programs. You will see applications deployed within the next 12 months and these tokens will play a role in our offerings but also those of select strategic partner engagements ranging from remote online or mobile purchases to proximity mobile interactions.","We have also talked a great deal about our merchant efforts. We recently reorganized the Company to strengthen the outreach to our merchant partners. We are lucky to have hired Ram\u00f3n Martin, a well-respected industry expert in payments with a great deal of merchant knowledge. As an example, he has a history as the member of the Board of Directors of the National Retail Federation. We are excited that he will lead our efforts relative to our merchant strategy, and help deliver customized products and services, and look forward to discussing more specifics in the future.","Let me now just turn for a second and just talk about small business merchants. We have had made changes to our FANF structure, our fixed acquirer network fee, including modifications that are designed to lower or in some cases eliminate FANF, on volume from small merchants with less than $15,000 in annual gross Visa sales. Most importantly, we believe these changes can serve to expand the Visa acceptance among very small businesses, while eliminating the fees for smaller retailers we\u2019re also making other adjustments to FANF to improve the alignment of these fees, regardless of whether a merchant connects to Visa through an acquirer, a processor, a payment facilitator, or other party.","We have also talked on these calls about rules in the past and our efforts to simplify our operating regulations. On October 1st we will be eliminating close to half of our operating rules. This includes reducing the complexity of our dispute resolution processes, and while we are making substantial changes now we continue to get client feedback and we will continue to introduce more changes beyond.","Let me talk for a second about Japan. I have spoken about two things here in the past, both the opportunity within Japan but also the importance of growing our processing business globally. Just a reminder, that although Japan is the third largest economy in the world by GDP, the number of payment cards in the market and usage is still very low, only 14% of PCE and just 8% on Visa products. Earlier this month we acquired 100% ownership of GP Net, a joint-venture that we have founded with seven leading Japanese issuers back in 1995, as a result of having total control, we now control our domestic transaction processing activities. It will allow us to further integrate our processing and product solutions to merchants, acquirers and issuers something that we are very excited about.","We are also very focused on the debit opportunity in Japan. While debit is still considered in its infancy stage, there is a meaningful opportunity for growth given the large deposit base which exists in the banks from which to grow a debit business. As an example, this quarter we launched Visa Debit with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, one of the three mega banks, again just one example of how we\u2019re working collaboratively with the banks to target a very meaningful opportunity.","So to conclude, let me just make a couple of comments looking ahead. First of all I continue to remain very excited about the opportunity that we have to continue growing the business. While the strengthening U.S. dollar and difficult comps from the prior year have affected our reported revenue and will again next quarter, the underlying revenue growth of the business is strong. It will accelerate as the economic recovery accelerates as well, and most importantly the long-term secular trends and our competitive position remain as strong as ever and I\u2019m constantly reminded that there\u2019s more cash to dis-intermediate than when the Company went public in 2008.","And with that Byron and I are glad to take your question.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Sir, your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Thank you. I guess I just wanted some more context or on some of the comments Byron had about the volumes. Byron you talked about cross-border weakness being temporary and seeing some firmness in the decline. Could you just talk about what gives you comfort that we could rebound from here or at least flatten out? And then second, you guys talked about sustained economic growth and not accelerating growth, is that simply just by observing the absolute volume statistics or there something else you\u2019re seeing underneath the covers that lead you to believe it\u2019s more sustained versus accelerating? Thank you.","Byron Pollitt","So, let me start with cross-border, we haven\u2019t seen single-digit cross-border growth rate since I would say 2009, that was five years ago and given the underlying secular trends in our business none of those are diminished, none of those are going away. As Charlie said, there\u2019s more cash to dis-intermediate today, note, outside the U.S. in particular, then it was when we went public, so from our standpoint, we look at cross-border, the fundamentals are still in place, it recovered nicely from 2009, so we expect to see the same, hard to predict when, and it may be a little early to call, given the April results, but by -- given the 4 percentage point drop we saw between the two quarters and given the fundamentals underpinning this secular shift, our view is we could be reaching a bottoming out, and in any event looking forward we would expect this to move north.","In terms of the broader economic question of sustained recovery, this is very much anchored in the volume trends we\u2019re seeing, recognizing that there is modest but if not weak job creation in the U.S., at some point that will begin to accelerate but we are adding jobs, so the underlying fundamentals that should inform and drive spend are in place, they\u2019re just in first gear, and so that\u2019s our take on the environment. Charlie, would you like to add?","Charlie Scharf","The only thing that I\u2019m going to add, back to the first part of the question on cross-border, as Byron and I both pointed out, the corridors that we\u2019re seeing the weakness are very-very specific places, so for instance when you look at U.S. cardholders traveling abroad, that volume, those growth rates are actually flat quarter-to-quarter, which is obviously a good sign for the core U.S. and the health of the U.S. consumer, again in very-very specific places and not at all across every single geography which would give us more cause for concern.","Jack Carsky","Next question...","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Could I ask one more follow-up, if you don\u2019t mind? Embedded in your guidance is what assumption around cross-border growth for the rest of the year?","Byron Pollitt","No acceleration.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase","Great. Thanks. Just to clarify is the revenue revision at the high-end of the revenue outlook is that really just explained by cross-border or is there something? Just wanted to clarify. And then just maybe on the Russia front, did you disclose how much it represents in terms of revenue, today and I\u2019m curious as a bigger picture question, sorry to build on this but, maybe Charlie, does this Russia situation sort of build this case that maybe countries are going to consider creating their own domestic schemes like the ones that Putin\u2019s talking about? Thanks.","Byron Pollitt","I\u2019ll tell you what Tien-tsin, could you re-ask your first question, I didn\u2019t actually understand it.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase ","Yes, I\u2019m rambling a little bit Byron, just the first question in a simple way, is the revenue revision in terms of your outlook, I think you said it was 10 to 13 before, and now we\u2019re looking at 10 to 11, if I heard that correctly. It\u2019s the difference there just across the border or is there something else?","Byron Pollitt","Yes we would -- it\u2019s heavily driven by cross-border. We would also add that U.S. debit down shifted more than we had anticipated when we constructed the original range. And so those are the -- I would say those are the two primary.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase","Understood. And then on the Russian stuff?","Byron Pollitt","On the Russia, let me answer the first part of the question, which is the revenue part and then I\u2019ll turn it back over to Charlie for the second part. When we said that there were several pennies of impact, you may attribute 100% of that to revenue, and we didn\u2019t put any expense offset against that, so it would be the revenue equivalent in this fiscal year, and heavily weighted, 90% weighted to fiscal Q\u2019s 3 and 4.","Charlie Scharf","And the only thing I would just, on that point, and then going to your last point Tien-tsin is, remember, we don\u2019t know exactly, what our position will be in the marketplace. So the issues that exist really today relate to domestic processing within Russia. We still think by the way that there is meaningful reasons why the Russian government should want ourselves and the other established networks to participate there. And so we\u2019re not assuming that it\u2019s in the best interest of them for us not want to be there. And away from the domestic business there\u2019s obviously a very big part of our opportunity there is cross-border, which as you know is extremely hard to build a cross-border brand and processing assets in a short period of time. So again we really are still trying to understand ourselves exactly how this could play itself out. But still are hopeful that we still have a meaningful opportunity to continue to participate in the growing electronic payments business in Russia.","And then we are broadly, kind of your last part of question on national payment systems, certainly the activities within Russia get people thinking about what it means for them. I\u2019m not sure how many parts of the world are actually contemplating the types of activities that Russia has taken upon themselves to bring about the sanctions which certainly should factor into people\u2019s minds. But as you know there are national payment schemes in different parts of the world that we compete with. And you know we firmly believe that what we have to offer goes well beyond what a national payment scheme can offer in terms of the capabilities of our network, our global acceptance, our ability to be accepted across all channels, fraud screening, I mean we can go on and on with the list. And so we are used to competing, and as long as there is the opportunity to compete, then we feel okay about the prospects. But certainly it\u2019s an issue.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase","Excellent, thank you.","Jack Carsky","","Next question.","","Operator","Our next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Yes hi guys just a couple of questions. One, just the down shift in U.S. debit and then obviously the lower cross-border volume, is any of that impacted by a share shift or share loss, or do you think that\u2019s all economically driven? And then secondly just a clarification on Russia, is the a couple of pennies, that you\u2019re talking about in earnings hit, is that 100% of Russia going away, or is that just the piece you think is going away due to the written proposal of the legislation that Charlie highlighted? Thanks.","Byron Pollitt","On U.S. debit, it is, and we expect it to continue to be a pretty competitive space without full access to all the other debit spend just yet hard to know whether there is any shift going on. But we think that there has been a down shift in debit spend. We saw some of it occur right after the target breach, and so this is one where -- we\u2019ll just have to see it play out where we are encouraged by the spike post to Easter. So I think we will stay with this question over the next couple of quarters and get better informed.","Cross-border, we don\u2019t think so, in terms of share shift. When you revert back to very specific corridors, very specific countries that have regulatory and tax events namely in Brazil and Argentina, manipulation of exchange rates by the Venezuelan government, those things are going to impact everybody. And so we don\u2019t think there is a sense of share shift there. This is just something much more fundamental to cross-border travel, and it should impact all.","With regards to Russia a portion of the down shift in revenue growth is very clearly cross-border. In the quarter leading up to the Crimea crisis we began to see a down shift in Russian travel. But it was a modest deceleration. It then dropped quite a bit further after the Crimea crisis unfolded. This is a level of travel that this country generates a level of cross-border travel that if things quote return back to normal whatever that is in the future, we could easily see a rebound in Russia, Russian cross-border. We have got some place holders in for sanction effects that could be ongoing but honestly as Charlie said it\u2019s way too early to call this the situation is very much fluid at the moment and we\u2019ll keep you updated as we progress. Charlie do you want to add?","Charlie Scharf","No I think that\u2019s fine.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research","Hi. Thanks for taking my question I appreciate all the color on a confusing situation like Russia, but Charlie turning to a issuer that you know very well during the quarter Chase gave a little more color on what they\u2019re doing with ChaseNET so now given the largest wallet initiative out there among the large issuers so just thinking about it this initiative takes hold in other and successful for them and other large issuers start considering the same strategy what you think it means for your efforts with V.me and I\u2019m sure this issue comes in your discussions with large issuers. Can you shed some light on how they reconcile the thoughts between their own initiatives on wallets and V.me? Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","Sure. Listen I can\u2019t speak for every issuer or certainly I cannot speak for Chase as well what I can tell you from our point of view is we are fairly agnostic as to whether it\u2019s our wallet or someone else\u2019s wallet as long as our cards are appropriately represented on a fair level playing field. And in the case of Chase whether it\u2019s our cards or whether it runs over VisaNet or their version of VisaNet again we view those as our transactions. So to the extent that other issuers choose to want to go build their own wallets we\u2019ll be supportive of that but that doesn\u2019t stop us from continuing to build our wallet capabilities which I don\u2019t like to use the word wallet I like to use the word digital acceptance as a way to think about what we\u2019re trying to build. So that every bank out there and to serve its customers properly in digital commerce with digital acceptance. So hope that answers your question.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. So just quickly I thought I heard you say Charlie that there you\u2019re dropping as of October 1st you\u2019re eliminating say 50% of your operating rules is that?","Charlie Scharf","That\u2019s correct.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Okay. And so what I was trying to get at I guess in that question is what is it that I guess you\u2019re hoping to achieve by simplifying that I know it\u2019s a big part of your strategy that you\u2019ve highlighted in the past but I\u2019m wondering is that hope that it\u2019s going to come with incremental volumes and the retailers are looking to this and you\u2019ve also adjusted the stamp fee for small merchants so I\u2019m just trying to understand from a bigger perspective what is it that you\u2019re hoping to gain by changing half of your operating rules that\u2019s a pretty significant change?","Charlie Scharf","Shortlist and I think all of these things that you pointed out in addition to the operating regs go towards the point of I think most people would tell you whether you\u2019re an issue or merchant or in an acquirer people would say that historically that we were probably pretty difficult to deal with and we operate in a very competitive world today people have choices both established choices and have the opportunity to think of other ways to process payments and we want people to enjoy doing business with us and to think that we treat them openly, fairly and clearly and our operating regs which I\u2019ve got the version and they\u2019re sitting on my desk it\u2019s actually 1,538 pages pre our changes.","Okay. And so imagine trying to be -- you are an issuer or an acquirer and you\u2019ve got to live by those and so simplification redundancy helping people understand what it means to do business with us as well as going out and what we\u2019ve been doing is asking again issuers, acquires, merchants what don\u2019t you like in that, what doesn\u2019t makes sense and a big part of the feedback that we received was on charge backs and the processes that we have put in place, the reporting requirements documentation and things like that. So we\u2019re very committed to continuing to support the integrity of our brand, the integrity of the payment system security and things that go towards the quality of our network but we have to be the kind of place that people say I understand the rules, I understand what it means to do business with you and you don\u2019t have a bunch of things buried on page 1,427 that they didn\u2019t understand. That in combination with these other things again I think just as if I was on the other side trying to figure out who I would want to do business with is the way I\u2019s wanted to be treated and that\u2019s way we\u2019re approaching it.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Got it, thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from James Friedman of SIG. Your line is open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group\/SIG","Hi. I wanted to ask you about NACHA and the prospects for acceleration in ACH, either Charlie or Byron, if you could help us think about the competitive dynamics in the instance that ACH were to be accelerated how if at all might it impact your business?","Charlie Scharf","Sure I guess I can start with this, which is we, our -- the differences between what the established payment networks have and what ACH\u2019s the differences are huge. It\u2019s not just the frequency of settlement it\u2019s the underlying ease of use of the ability to integrate within your systems it\u2019s the data that we have collected and then enable both issuers, acquirers and merchants to use it in the way which is good for risk purposes scorings that we\u2019ve developed and we have a whole series of capabilities that again that we\u2019ve all developed over 10, 20, 30, 40 years that really is not easily replicable.","Our view is that certainly the issuers understand the benefits of working with that in this ecosystem they control the customer relationships and so we\u2019re very confident in that position that we have and the ability to differentiate our services versus what ACH can do. And I think if you look at some of the big players that use ACH and actually track through ACH and see well how does that actually impact the customer experience? It\u2019s a terrible experience for the customer as opposed to a network like ours. And in the environment that we live in today and the way banks are viewing the importance of their customer relationships it\u2019s just another differentiator that we had. So we love the position that we have relative to ACH.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group\/SIG","Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Don Fandetti - Citigroup","Yes Byron just given the slowdown in cross-border I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about your relative revenue yield my understanding is in the U.S. the yield is pretty high compared to domestic I mean is there a difference between let\u2019s say [indiscernible] and Asia can you talk a little bit about that?","Byron Pollitt","There are differences and there are different practices with regards to yields across the globe. We typically don\u2019t get into that level of detail to be a little helpful in this arena to the extent that there is a strong growth by U.S. cardholders that it\u2019s a strong consistent yield from an area of the world that is particularly well positioned to grow cross-border because of the strength of the U.S. dollar. You\u2019ll note that when we referenced the cross-border weakness before we called out a specific corridor it was Canada to the U.S. the U.S. to Canada corridor is doing just fine and as Charlie said the outbound travel by U.S. cardholders has remained quite strong and so I will leave the color at that.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research. Your line is open.","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research","Yes. Thanks. I was wondering could you just give us an update on what\u2019s happening with CyberSource there is a little bit of a deceleration in volume growth in V.me filings too?","Byron Pollitt","Okay, I\u2019ll take the CyberSource, so there has been some deceleration in the growth of CyberSource we contribute that specifically to two large customers or clients that we lost in fiscal year \u201913 and we\u2019re starting to see the impacts of that in \u201914 that said we are very bullish on CyberSource we recognize the issue, we are investing significant sums to upgrade and add to the features of our CyberSource platform both for large enterprise businesses as well as for small businesses, we are actively adding people to this business. So our enthusiasm remains robust I will caution that it will take several quarters before we can get this turned around but remain very bullish and very confident on the outlook of CyberSource\u2019s future with Visa.","Charlie Scharf","And let me take V.me. So I think I\u2019ve talked to on the prior year\u2019s call we have learned an awful lot since our initial rollout of V.me and we have altered our approach to really take away all the functionality other than what I described before as meaningful digital acceptance. And so we\u2019re getting really excellent feedback from merchants and issuers alike. We\u2019ve actually rolled out the first phase of the new platform a few months ago and we have begun launching it with those merchants. It\u2019s incredibly -- it's just hugely more simple for them to actually integrate it into their checkout experience literally days as opposed to months and the new integrations that we have include Lululemon, Autozone, Petco and the Wine Enthusiast. But probably more exciting those are terrific names but we\u2019ve also executed term sheets or master service agreements with an additional 38 large merchants which represent almost 60 billion in addressable volume. 23 of those merchants are actually in the Internet Retailer Top 100. So we\u2019re going to -- we're continuing a press forward, we have a much better solution in the market, and it\u2019s resonating.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Yes hi thanks. A couple of things, regarding just I want to clarify, so you\u2019re EPS guidance fully contemplates the tax benefit you received in the quarter. Please clarify that. And secondly, regarding Russia, should we see the changes to law that you discussed earlier, specifically related to the basically trapping data and transaction flow and what not we\u2019ve seen in Russia. Is your current network structure capable of doing that, as of tomorrow. Because if I remember correctly, you guys were in a hub and spoke network where your data flows back through the states?","Byron Pollitt","Let me take the tax and EPS question first. The direct answer to your question is yes. The tax benefit that we recorded this quarter was contemplated in our full year guidance. That said, let me just provide updated perspective. When we give guidance as we did at the beginning of the fiscal year, so this was back in October, our style is to offer guidance without caveat and without excuse. And so when we give guidance it is naturally broader and have to take into a number of unknowns and you make educated judgments on how the year would unfold. The rate of economic recovery, unknown, cross-border impacts given a stronger U.S. dollar and currency movements, unknown, cross-border impacts due to global tensions, unknown.","Thing about taxes is that as you get into the range where we are currently operating on taxes, this becomes more initiative driven as opposed to where your operating throughout the country, throughout the world. And so as these initiatives, as this one often take several years to research, prepare, occur, recording, and so the timing of these is often outside of our immediate control and therefore unknown with regards to when we can actually take them. And so all of these things are contemplated. We did contemplate including tax. We also began the year with a range of revenue that was low double-digits constant dollar which was 10% to 13%. Had we delivered in 12% to 13% constant dollar as opposed to what we are now seeing given other impacts in other areas of 10 to 11, then we would have been at the upper-end, certainly at the upper-end of our guidance if not a little above because more than one factor is playing out in our favor to a greater degree than we might have contemplated in the beginning. So that\u2019s the context. Charlie, Russia?","Charlie Scharf","So let me.","Byron Pollitt","So it\u2019s like, it\u2019s on to the Russian expert here.","Charlie Scharf","So on the question, and I just want to reiterate to be clear that the law is still evolving. As it gets red, it does evolve and get -- and there are changes that occur from day-to-day, and then once the law is actually passed there do have to be regulations to coincide with those laws before they get implemented. So there are some things in the law which there would be relatively quick implementation. There are other things which I think some of the dates go out until 2016.","To answer your specific question, today, we do not have the ability, in a very quick way to deploy a separate version of VisaNet in a specific country. Having said that, we do have instances where we can start to move parts of it, whether authorization is much easier for us to do than entire clearing and settlement, and there it\u2019s certainly something that we\u2019re capable of building even though it might take a little bit of time. But also remember, I mean this is critical, because you\u2019ve got very much, we\u2019re caught between the politics of the United States and the politics of Russia. But you just get down to reality for a second. We have 100 million cards in Russia today. We have 100 million cards there and if not in anyone\u2019s best interest inclusive of the Russians to make those cards not available to their own citizens.","And so that\u2019s why we are hopeful that as this situation unfolds, that people understand things like that and that to the extent that they believe it\u2019s important to build a national payment system. It can be done in a way where there is the appropriate transition and we have the ability to figure out whether it makes sense to compete in that marketplace, because there would be unlikely that, unless there\u2019s some draconian things that are passed that it wouldn\u2019t evolve in a way like that.","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Just on that point, because I think this is important looking out concerning the NSA concerns and what not, if they did go ahead and make those changes have you contemplated the length of time it would take to restructure your network to comply because this could apply in the future to how China opens up. And we know that your biggest competitor is already there with the technology in place so if it was a short window, given a conversion could theoretically be done away from you.","Charlie Scharf","Okay, so two different things, number one is absolutely we\u2019ve done an awful lot of work and you can assume that we\u2019re preparing for everything that we should prepare to, the second is, I would just caution you to make the statements that others can comply.","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Okay, thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore. Your line is open.","David Togut - Evercore","Thank you very much, can you give us an update on the size of the commercial card as a percentage of total volumes and give us also a sense of the growth rate and whether that\u2019s been affected at all by the issues you put forward today?","Byron Pollitt","On the first part of your question, no, not, but Investor Relations could give you an update on that afterwards, let me just quickly look, commercial payment volume growth, we can give you a perspective from the U.S., and since the beginning of the calendar year it has been low double-digit growth, very high single to low double-digit growth consistently January, February, March, with an uptick in April.","David Togut - Evercore","Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Thanks. I just want to shift gears to margins for a minute, the personal expense came in below our estimates and you also raised your outlook for margins to the mid 60s versus low 60s previously. First, is there anything new that\u2019s driving the change versus your initial expectation and can we expect that to really continue off of a new base being mid 60s now into future years, and then just a quick housekeeping Byron, I know that you -- you should metrics into April 21, most of them looked like they were expanding or accelerating, just what impact did Easter actually have, given the timing in April this year versus last year, I don\u2019t know if you said that on the call before? Thanks.","Byron Pollitt","We didn\u2019t, what I said on the call beginning with the April results is that it\u2019s very clear, I\u2019ve been in a form of retail for 18 years before coming to Visa, the Easter impact is absolutely a phenomenon that exists, typically you look at the run rate going in, the run rate going out, you compare it to the prior year. we\u2019re several weeks away from being able to do that metric but the lift, part of the lift is certainly due to Easter, it\u2019s also sensible that part of the lift could well be a return to be more normal weather, it\u2019s very hard to isolate specific weather impacts but we have done a lot of work around those states in the U.S. for example that had much more severe weather than normal versus those that didn\u2019t, the growth rates, there\u2019s a clear delta in the growth rates, some of it but not all of it mitigated by e-commerce, so as we get back to more normal periods post Easter, post weather, I think we\u2019ll see a more normalized growth rate and one that may very well have some pent up demand fueling it.","With regards to expenses, the, at some point predictably as we continue to invest aggressively in extending our network, the reach of our network like a CyberSource, those, that investment will come with margins that are not that attractive or we wouldn\u2019t invest but they\u2019re not going to be in the 60s, we\u2019ve not reached that inflection point yet, and so that\u2019s why you saw us on the margin move up from low 60s to low to mid 60s, and with regards to personnel if you think about it, when we went public in 2008, we had 4,000 plus employees, today we have 10,000. And so in the span of a little over five years we have more than doubled our employee base and we go in searches, we digest, we optimize, we go forward, we will continue to invest in talent which is a key driver of our success and we would expect growth of the personnel base that you see today despite the more than doubling of our personnel over the past five years.","Jack Carsky","Adrian, at this point we have time for one more question.","Operator","Okay our final question is from Jennifer Dugan of Sterne, Agee. Your line is open.","Jennifer Dugan - Sterne, Agee","Thank you, most of my questions have been answered but I was wondering could you give us a little bit more color on the expected fiscal 2015 revenue impact from the Chase conversion that\u2019s going to happen towards the end of the year?","Byron Pollitt","At this point we would, we do expect to have an impact, it should not be, it\u2019s a valued and important addition to our business, I think to the extent that we wouldn\u2019t give color on that specifically but we do expect it to start showing up in the first fiscal quarter and I\u2019ll remind the group, some of the conversions are taking place today and will pick up pace or expected to pick up pace as the year unfolds, but to the extent that that revenue shows up in service fees, we book our service fees on a one quarter lag, so any conversions that take place say in the fourth fiscal quarter, the service fees won\u2019t show up until the first fiscal quarter of fiscal \u201915.","Jack Carsky","And with that we\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us today, if anybody has follow-up questions feel free to call Investor Relations. Have a nice evening.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. This concludes today\u2019s conference and you may disconnect at this time."],"22384":["Visa, Inc.

Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Dexter. Good early morning, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2015 earnings conference call and Visa Europe acquisition discussion. With us today from London are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Nicolas Huss, Visa Europe's Chief Executive Officer; while here in California we have Vasant Prabhu, Visa Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer.","This call is being currently webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for the next 30 days. PowerPoint decks containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's earnings commentary and an overview of the Visa Europe transaction were posted to our website prior to this call.","Let me also remind you that these presentations may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on Form 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.

Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks a lot, Jack, and greetings from London. It's great to have Nicolas here as well, you'll be hearing from him in just a little bit. We certainly appreciate the early hours especially for those on the West Coast this morning. Given our announcement regarding Europe, we thought it was important to do the call as early as possible given the desire to communicate with our clients, employees and partners here in Europe. We're quite excited about our announcement and have a full agenda, so we'll try and move through our prepared material quickly, leaving plenty of time for Q&A at the end.","We have six topics to talk about this morning. First, we reported a solid fourth quarter and strong year-end to fiscal 2015. Second, we'll view our outlook for the fiscal 2016 year on a standalone basis. Third, I have some brief comments on previously announced dividend increase. And fourth, we announced the acquisition of Visa Europe. As you know, we have been clear that this was a transaction that we thought made tremendous sense for both our company but also for Visa Europe and its members, so we're thrilled to be able to move forward as one company.","And with the Visa Europe acquisition, we announced two other items regarding our capital structure. First, our board has improved an increase to buyback authorization to bring the total available to $7.8 billion. And second, we announced that we will implement a new capital structure for the company. We intend to raise $15 billion to $16 billion of debt in conjunction with the Visa Europe announcement, but you'll see that we view this as a trigger to implement a more efficient long-term capital structure for the company.","We'll first talk about our earnings results and outlook for 2016, then we'll discuss the Visa Europe acquisition and our capital actions, leaving time for questions.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Vasant.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Charlie. As Charlie indicated, we have a lot to talk about on this call. I will only comment briefly on our fourth quarter and 2015 results and spend most of my time giving you as comprehensive a picture as we can of our outlook for fiscal 2016. We're pleased to report another strong quarter and full fiscal year results with solid revenue and earnings growth. Our high growth in a tepid global environment demonstrates yet again the fundamental resilience of our business model. Results were generally in line with our expectations going into the quarter with a few call-outs.","First, our core metrics remained robust around the globe. The underlying secular conversion from cash and checks to electronic forms of payment continue at a fast clip as demonstrated by high domestic payment volume growth rates. This is obscured by the significant drag caused by the strengthening of the dollar against most major currencies over the course of the year. In the fourth quarter, this impact worsened as the dollar strengthened further against key currencies. This hurts us not only in currency translation terms but also in slowing cross-border volume growth.","Second, as expected, client incentive levels in the quarter came in at 18.4%, well above the full year run rate of 17.1%. This sets us up well for fiscal 2016 payments volume growth. Several key renewals as well as a couple of significant wins will drive the incentive rate higher in 2016. I'll talk more about this when I discuss our outlook for 2016.","Third, expense growth was somewhat higher than we had anticipated due to a legal settlement in Australia and Visa Europe transaction costs. This cost us about $0.01 of EPS in the quarter. Finally, we did not repurchase stock in the quarter due to the Visa Europe conversations that were underway. For the full year we repurchased 44.1 million shares at a price of just under $66 per share for a total of $2.9 billion. We currently have authorization to repurchase up to $2.8 billion of stock under our prior plan and an incremental $5 million recently authorized by our board.","Moving on to the quarter's business drivers and our financial results, global payments volume growth in constant dollars for the September quarter continued to be strong at 12%. U.S. credit grew 10%, moderating 2% compared to the June quarter as the positive effects of Chase conversion wane. U.S. debit grew at 9%, up 3 points from June. So gasoline prices continue to have a significant negative effect of approximately 2 percentage points growth in Interlink volume tied to certain routing wins offset a significant portion of the gas impact.","International payments volume constant dollar growth of 15% was up over the prior quarter, with increases posted in all regions and more specifically followed by the Middle East, Sub-Saharan Africa and Mexico. More recently through October 28, U.S. payments volume growth was 9%, with U.S. credit growing 9%, and debit 10%, a slight downtick in credit and uptick in debit versus the fourth quarter.","Global cross-border volume growth declined to 5% after three consecutive quarters of 8% constant dollar growth. As has been the case for several quarters now, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar is negatively impacting key corridors of cross-border commerce. Specifically, outbound commerce from Russia, Canada and Brazil have deteriorated further in the past few months.","While growth rates were still high in Q4, outbound commerce from China has seen a moderation in trend. Inbound commerce into the U.S. continue to drift lower in August and September. The bright spots are outbound commerce from the U.S. and the Middle East, commerce into Europe has been growing for most regions but as you know, we do not benefit as much from it currently.","Despite the slowdown in cross-border payment volume growth and the significant negative drag from currency translation, international revenues grew 16%, helped by the previously announced pricing action and continued high currency volatility. Overall, growth was relatively \u2013 was impacted relatively equally by pricing and currency volatility. Through October 28, cross-border volume growth on a constant dollar basis has slowed further to 3%, in line with the August\/September trend.","Transactions processed over VisaNet totaled 18 billion in the fourth quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the June quarter. The U.S. delivered 11% growth while international growth was flat. International processed transaction growth is 13% when you normalize for the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April.","Through October 28, process transaction growth was 8% with a U.S. rate of 11% and an international growth rate that remained flat, the international rate of course being impacted by Russia.","Overall, we had a strong finish to another solid year of top and bottom line growth. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.6 billion, a 13% increase year-over-year in constant dollars or 11% in nominal dollars. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was up 12% on a constant currency basis over 9% in nominal dollars.","Diluted earnings per share in the quarter were $0.62, a 16% increase in constant dollars or 14% on a nominal basis over the prior year's adjusted results. For the fiscal full year, diluted adjusted earnings per share grew 18% on a constant currency basis, almost 16% in nominal dollars.","With that, I'll move on to our outlook for fiscal 2016. Starting with payment volumes. Payment volumes globally have grown around 11% in constant dollars for the past two years. As we look ahead to 2016, we are anticipating an uptick in growth driven by the U.S. Most of the step-up in the U.S. growth rate is expected in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 and beyond. The first quarter trend should be generally in line with what we experienced in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.","As we enter the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we begin to fully lap the big gas price declines from last year. In the second half, USAA conversions are expected to start and then late in the fiscal year, Costco conversion should commence. Offsetting these to some extent will be the end of JPMorgan conversion gains. Outside the U.S., easier comparisons in our Latin America and CEMEA regions as they lap the sharp declines last year, and Brazil and Russia should help reported growth rates.","If all this plays out as we expect, global payments volume growth will accelerate in 2016, ramping as the year progresses and setting us up nicely for 2017.","Moving on to the cross-border business. Cross-border volumes, as you all know, are dependent on global economic conditions and the relative strength of key currencies, most particularly the U.S. dollar. In fiscal year 2015, we experienced sharp declines in outbound cross-border volume growth due to both these factors in key markets like Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil and Russia, starting late in the first quarter and worsening as the year progressed. Our large U.S. inbound business also declined as the dollar gained strength. And in the fourth quarter, Chinese outbound volume started to soften.","Through the first half of fiscal 2016, we are not anticipating any meaningful improvement in cross-border growth rates from current levels. As we enter the second half, comparisons are easier and if the dollar stays stable or weakens, we could see an uptick in growth. Net-net, we expect the cross-border business will remain sluggish in the first half. Dollar strength and macroeconomic conditions will determine the second half. On balance, we are planning for improved cross-border growth rate in the second half of fiscal 2016.","While cross-border growth slowed in FY 2015, currency volatility hit new highs as the year progressed, serving as a significant offset. Year-over-year growth rates were accentuated by the unusually low levels of volatility experienced in the second half of 2014. Speculation about Fed rate increases in the U.S., the sharp decline in commodity prices, uncertainty about Chinese growth, Greece, et cetera, all contributed to keep currency markets guessing.","Given the high levels experienced in 2015, it seems very unlikely that volatility will be a tailwind again in 2016. Volatility has moderated in recent weeks and, although uncertainties persist, one might project a reversion to the mean for the year. Given all this, we are assuming that currency volatility will be a headwind throughout fiscal 2016 and significantly so as the year progresses when comparisons get a lot tougher.","Processed transaction growth rates dipped from 10% in the first half to 8% in the second half as we transferred domestic processing to NSPK in Russia. About half of the domestic transactions shifted in Q3 and all domestic transactions in Q4 fiscal 2015. This will continue to impact reported transaction growth rates through the first three quarters of FY 2016. As we enter the second half, U.S. transaction growth rates will rise as we bring on USAA and then Costco volume.","Moving to client incentives. In 2015, client incentives came in at 17.1% of gross revenue, below our expected range of 17.5% to 18.5%. This was due to volume shortfalls in markets like Russia and Brazil, delays in renewals, and some shift to dollars from incentives to gross price reductions. We anticipate a step-up in client incentives in fiscal year 2016 based on renewals completed to date and renewals anticipated in 2016, as well as the conversion of USAA and Costco.","Among the significant renewals completed in 2015 were core brands like Southwest and United, Wells Fargo and U.S. Bank in North America, large issuers in Russia, Japan, and Latin America. USAA-related incentives will kick in midyear and Costco later in the year. In 2016, we also expect several large renewals.","Our current expectation is that client incentives as a percent of gross revenue could climb to the middle of the 17.5% to 18.5% range. The first quarter in particular should see a high level of renewal activity and the largest impact from renewals worldwide. The Q1 incentive rate will likely be at the high end of the full year range or possibly higher.","With incentives growing faster than gross revenue, net revenue growth will lag gross revenue growth. In constant dollars, we anticipate fiscal year 2016 net revenue growth in the high single-digit to low double-digit range. Also, based on all the factors I discussed earlier, the first quarter growth rate will likely be 2 percentage points lower than the full year growth rate, with growth picking up as the year progresses. As a reminder, our service revenues lapped one quarter from payment volumes whereas incentives are booked in the quarter in which payment volumes occur.","Which brings us to the currency translation impact from the strengthening dollar. The fiscal year 2015 impact of exchange rates was a 2.5 percentage point drag on net revenues, higher than we had anticipated at the start of the year. If we look at where the dollar is today and the basket of currencies we are exposed to, the FY 2016 impact looks to be 3 percentage points. The bulk of this impact is in currencies like the ruble, the real, the Venezuelan bolivar, the Argentinean peso, and the Canadian and Aussie dollars.","On the expense front, we will continue to invest in key growth initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service and other strategic programs as well as our long-term plan to bring key technology and customer service activities that are currently outsourced in-house. Network-related expenses will grow due to the full year impact of fees paid to NSPK for processing transactions in Russia. We will start to lap this added expense in Q4 2016.","We will have significant startup costs to set up domestic operations in China. We are actively working on being in a position to compete domestically and will submit our application upon release of the final regulations. We are assuming China startup expenses will ramp through the year. We are holding the line on cost increases in all overhead functions. In nominal dollars, we expect a step-down in the rate of expense growth in fiscal year 2016 as a result of all these actions versus almost 6% growth in fiscal year 2015. Expense growth will run at a high single-digit clip in the first half and substantially lower in the second half.","Our tax rate in 2015 came in at an adjusted 29.3%, almost 100 basis points lower than expected due to the favorable resolution of some tax items. As always, there are various tax initiatives underway. However, we expect our tax rate to normalize in fiscal year 2016 back to the low 30%s. In FY 2015, the lower than expected tax rate added over 1 percentage point to our EPS growth. In FY 2016, the anticipated increase in the rate could be as much as a 2 point drag on EPS growth.","Now that we've announced the Visa Europe transaction, we can resume our stock buyback. It is fully our intent to step up the pace of buybacks immediately to make up for buybacks not completed in Q4 FY 2015. Despite this, our weighted average share count in 2016 will be higher than it would have been had we been buyers of our stock in the fourth quarter of 2015.","When you put this all together, we expect our constant currency EPS growth in fiscal year 2016 to come in at the low end of the mid-teens range. Without the expected increase in the tax rate, EPS growth rates would be almost 2 percentage points higher. Furthermore, the currency translation impact will be higher on earnings than it is on revenue. We project a 4 percentage point drag on EPS growth from exchange rates. This is due to two main reasons. First, a larger proportion of our expenses are dollar denominated; and second, profits relative to revenues are proportionately higher in some of the higher rate (19:32) currencies.","The first quarter EPS growth rate will be significantly lower in the mid-single digits for all the reasons I outlined earlier, a net revenue growth rate in Q1 that tracks a couple of percentage points below the full year run rate and an expense growth rate that will run meaningfully higher than the full year run rate. The EPS growth rate will step up as the year progresses except in the fiscal third quarter when we lapped a large tax benefit last year.","As you can see, there are a variety of factors that will drive our revenue and EPS growth in fiscal year 2016. The key underlying drivers of our business remain very healthy. We expect a step-up in payments volume growth, major new accounts and renewals, good expense control resulting in healthy core revenue and earnings growth in constant dollars despite a generally uneven global economy.","We have several significant factors driving down our reported growth rate in FY 2016 which should moderate with time. These are a potential regression to the meaningful currency volatilities, the continuing strength of the dollar impacting both the cross-border business and creating a currency translation drag, and a return to normalized tax rates.","As the impact of these unfavorable year-over-year comparisons fades, the strong underlying growth momentum of our core business positions us well for robust reported growth in fiscal year 2017. We remain as bullish as we've ever been about the long-term secular trends in our business.","As always, we will update our views as the year unfolds and share them with you each quarter. This outlook excludes the Visa Europe acquisition. When I come back, I'll walk through the potential financial impact of Visa Europe on fiscal year 2016.","And with that, I'll turn the call back to Charlie.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks very much, Vasant. I'll try and keep my comments brief so we can move on to Europe. First of all, we're very happy with our performance both in the quarter and 2015. We continued to deliver strong results in a global economic environment which still has more headwinds than tailwinds for us.","Adjusted earnings per share growth of 14% in the quarter and 16% for the full year include the continuing negative effects of a series of items, including the translation impact of a strong U.S. dollar, reduced cross-border volume driven by that strong dollar, and continuing drag from lower oil prices. Of course, there are positive offsets including strong payment volume, healthy processed transaction growth, and high currency volatility. Our strong results in the face of these pluses and minuses speak to the resilience of our business model.","Regarding what we see across the world, I'll keep it simple and just say that the economic environment has shown little change over the last quarter, with some slight deterioration especially outside of the United States. Having said that, domestic activity is still fairly strong. And while we didn't get much help from an accelerating economic environment, our business still showed continued strong growth. Our longer term bullish growth outlook is intact and, most importantly, the underlying fundamentals of our business continue to deliver, and these will continue to drive continued growth.","We'll discuss capital in much more detail when we review the Europe transaction but I do want to comment on our recent dividend increase. We've discussed our view that the dividend is an important way for us to return capital to our shareholders. We've also said that we would hope to consistently grow the dividend as we grow the earnings of the company, and the recent 17% increase maintains the payout at our stated target range of below 20%s. Most importantly, we feel it's a strong statement that we're increasing our dividend at the same time that we're announcing such a significant transaction.","Now, let me turn and make some comments about the fundamentals of our business. We continued strength in our key client relationships across the world. In the United States we're in a great position. Over the course of the year, we extended some of our biggest relationships which were up for renewal, including our partnership with Wells Fargo which we renewed just this quarter. We now have partnership agreements in place with five of our top six until at least 2020.","Outside of the U.S., we're also in a very strong position. We continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world. For example, in Australia, we signed a new 10-year exclusive partnership with the National Australian Bank. While we did had some notable losses this year, we also had successes winning significant new business with Costco and USAA.","I want to just make a couple of observations about how we view pricing and share in this context. First of all and, most importantly, we view the big opportunity for us is to drive growth in the marketplace, and therefore, the most profitable growth is achieved by electronifying cash and check across the world, expanding participates in the electronic payments universe, and helping grow commerce more broadly. We believe this is how we create real long-term sustainable value. If you look at what's driven our revenue growth over the last several years, it's just that, not taking share from competitors. That's not to say the market isn't competitive; it is. And as you know, our competitors are very, very good and we respect them.","And since we went public, you've seen clients make long-term partnership decisions, some of which have benefited us, others of which have benefited others. There will be situations where clients seek to do more business with us because of our capabilities, products and brand, and we will support them. We'll also defend our share aggressively. We will be competitive with the market but we do not seek to win deals solely on price. We do not view pricing on its own as the best mechanism to grow. So, I strongly believe in focusing on long-term value creation and that our future is about growing electronic payments and commerce broadly, and ultimately expanding into new or underpenetrated segments.","Now, a few comments on the underlying business. Visa Checkout continues to gain momentum. We now have more than 7 million registered users in 16 countries, and over 470 financial institutions partners participating globally. More than 250,000 merchants are currently live globally including 10 of the top 50 e-commerce merchants. New merchant partners include Kohl's, Best Buy, Shutterfly, Lands' End, Fanatics, and Abercrombie & Fitch, to name a few.","We also announced that we now have built the ability for issuers and merchants to tokenize Visa Checkout transactions. We expect this to begin in early 2016, as merchants and some issuers complete the work required to enable token acceptance. Many issuers are ready now, but given the rapid approach of the holiday season, we do not expect merchants to enable token acceptance as they head into their year-end annual system freezes. Second, as you all know, we partnered with Google and Samsung to bring two great new mobile experiences to market. Android Pay and Samsung Pay both launched their solutions in the U.S. in September and, in the upcoming months, will roll out their programs internationally.","Third, we continue to build out our technology capabilities to deliver differentiated services in the marketplace. In September, we launched Visa Integrated Marketing Solutions, a card marketing platform designed to help small- to medium-sized issuers optimize their marketing efforts. It's a service offered by Visa Performance Solutions, which provides a range of advisory services to issuers, merchants, and acquirers, and is currently available to any Visa issuer in the United States interested in increasing their performance of their Visa consumer credit or debit portfolios, and the platform is expected to extend globally in the coming months.","Last month, CyberSource launched Decision Manager Replay, the industry's first fraud tuning analytics tool which allows merchants to quickly analyze and adjust their online fraud management strategies. Merchants could take a batch of recent transactions and run them through the Decision Manager system, re-testing for fraud using more or less stringent risk levels. The system can reconfirm which transactions are fraudulent and which ones have been mistakenly flagged for fraud and denied but were in fact valid.","Looking ahead to fiscal 2016, let me just share a couple of thoughts following Vasant's. Our guidance for 2016 is reflective of several things. First of all, it excludes the impact of Visa Europe, which will make the second half of our fiscal year more complicated. We will do our best to isolate the impacts for you so you can understand the impacts discretely and evaluate our sustainable performance. While we cannot predict the future any better than you can, we do have to make assumptions as we plan for the year. We have shared these in a fair amount of detail with you in addition to providing the numerical guidance but, at some point, you need to make your own determinations. Having said that, there are some things that I want to emphasize from Vasant's remarks.","The effects of the strong dollar will have an increased negative effect on us in 2016 but there will be a point when the dollar stabilizes and we lap this effect. As Vasant said, we are planning for negative 3-point impact on revenue growth and 4 points on EPS growth in 2016 before we hope to see some improvement. Cross-border weakness continues but can change quickly with movements in the dollar and domestic economic growth.","And please pay attention to Vasant's comments on timing. While we don't usually get as specific as we've done on this call, we do have some line of sight which would suggest that some of the items Vasant spoke about should impact the early part of the year disproportionally, especially Q1. Having said that, we always look through our results and ask what has changed about our views on growth beyond the fiscal year. We continue to feel great about our opportunity to drive revenue, earnings, and EPS growth for our shareholders. There's more cash to disintermediate than ever and we have more tools than ever to accomplish.","And with that, let me switch gears and talk a bit about the Visa Europe transaction. Today, as you've seen, we announced that we and Visa Europe have entered into a definitive agreement for Visa Inc. to acquire Visa Europe. We're thrilled about the prospect to bring these two companies together and believe the transaction will benefit all involved. I'll give an overview of the transaction starting on page three of the prepared presentation, if you want to follow along. Nicolas will add some comments. After that, Vasant will cover the financial aspects in more detail before we take questions on all topics covered on the call here.","We will acquire Visa Europe for an upfront consideration of \u20ac16.5 billion consisting of \u20ac11.5 billion in cash and \u20ac5 billion in convertible preferred stock. In addition, Visa Europe member-owners will potential receive an earn-out payment of up to \u20ac4 billion and \u20ac0.7 billion in interest. This earn-out will be based on the achievement of net revenue targets during the 2016 fiscal quarters following the close and provides additional upside to both parties if those agreed targets are met. It will be payable following the fourth anniversary of the transaction close.","We plan to issue between $15 billion and $16 billion in senior unsecured debt to finance the transaction and establish a more efficient long-term capital structure. We plan to offset the effect of the issuance of preferred stock with increased stock buybacks and believe our capital structure will still provide us flexibility to pursue future growth opportunities, and as you know, this is obviously an attractive time to issue debt given the historically low interest rates. Our initial leverage will be between 1.4 and 1.5 times gross debt-to-EBITDA, and we target our long-term leverage at between 1.1 and 1.5 times gross debt-to-EBITDA.","Based on discussions held with the rating agencies, we expect to maintain our current investment credit ratings of A+ and A1. The transaction has been approved by both Visa Inc. and the Visa Europe boards will result from the exercise of the amended put option and does not require VI or VE shareholder votes. It is subject to customary closing conditions and transaction regulatory approvals and we expect to close in the third fiscal quarter of 2016.","Moving on to page four. Turning to the transaction rationale behind the transaction, this is obviously strategically important for both of us. We believe the combination will create significant benefits for both European and Visa Inc. clients. They will benefit as we work every day to earn their business bringing them the full power of our global platform, innovative products and services, as well as our world-class brand. The transaction will provide European clients with direct access to our investments in technology, differentiated products and services, capital, and talent. We'll also prioritize European needs in the allocation of our resources, and we believe we can deliver a stronger set of digital capabilities than would be possible without this combination.","And with that, let me turn it over to Nicolas for him to add his perspective.","Nicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.","Thank you, Charlie. A few comments from a European perspective. The first one is that the time is right. Payments are increasingly global with more and more power from competition, scale and investment capacity are also increasingly important. Adding to this dynamic is regulation which you're all well aware is a key focus for our company and industry. We're now seeing the worlds of payment becoming more global from consumers traveling and shopping across borders through retailers and, of course, many of our most important bank issuers and acquirers being more regional or global players.","We're also seeing the tech giants and mobile companies launching services in this payment space here in Europe and the relationship between issuers, acquirers, and merchants is changing. In terms of processing, scale is a critical driver of competitive advantage and becomes even more important in Europe with the mandatory separation of scheme processing activities.","If I look at it from a customer perspective, Visa Inc. commitment to continuing to develop the European market is important for our clients. Representing 26% of total combined payment volumes, Europe will be Visa's second largest region. Our clients are reassured that there will be an empowered regional office (34:35) with strong regional focus processing in Europe and potential for investment that will be attractive to European members.","From a management perspective now, the focus is on completing the transaction so that we can get on with integration. The signing is an exciting and significant milestone towards reuniting the two parts of Visa but up until completion, my message to the team will be that we also need to continue to deliver our strategy and the service that our members and stakeholders value highly. Continuing to deliver puts the business in the best position to benefit from the integration of the two organizations.","Finally, I strongly believe that the uniqueness of this deal lies in the fact that our two companies already work together and have done so throughout our history. We share a brand, rules, and a number of operational practices further facilitating our union and rationale to come together.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Nicolas. Let me just make a comment about perspective from Visa Inc. This transaction does create a truly integrated global leader that will allow us to capitalize on strong growth opportunities in a highly attractive region. We also expect that it will create substantial value to revenue opportunities and cost efficiencies associated with the transaction from a member-owned association to a commercial entity and the opportunity to integrate the two businesses. We're also confident in our execution capabilities given our experience of transitioning to a commercial model from a member-owned model ourselves. Also remember, as Nicolas pointed out, we're merging two entities that have a close working relationship and share many common products and platforms.","Let me make a few comments about our views on this financially. The transaction is financially attractive for both parties. With balanced consideration of a mix of cash, stock, and earn-out, we expect it to be accretive to our stand-alone revenue and EPS growth before transition costs beginning in fiscal year 2017, the first full year of the combination. The preferred shares offer current VE members continuing ownership stake in the company and also serves to provide liability protection to our Visa Inc. shareholders in conjunction with the new loss-sharing agreement with key UK banks. The earn-out provides additional upside potential for both parties if net revenue targets are achieved. We feel very good about the structure of the transaction since the balance consideration encourages the VE's current owners and VI to work together to enhance the long-term value of the business to the benefit of all parties. Vasant will go through this in more detail in a few minutes.","I think in the interest of time, I will skip page five, which you can read on your own, which just talks about why we think it's an attractive growth opportunity; as well as page six, which is this current snapshot of the Visa European business; as well as page seven and eight, which show you the complexion of the new combined Visa.","Let me move on and talk about page nine, which are our post-acquisition plans. Before I get into the details here, just want to make a comment about our ability to execute. We've done this transition before, as I pointed out, when we created Visa Inc. and have a great deal of experience, not just knowledge, of what's required. In addition, as I've already said, we also have people on both sides who have worked together for a long time and will benefit from those strong relationships.","Since his arrival, Nicolas has made significant changes to VE which has resulted in an even closer working relationship between our two companies. He's also made changes to the business which are consistent with the way we would run the company going forward. He and I spent some time thinking about the integration process and our time line and approach will put clients first. In short, we know how to do this and will pace it properly.","So, turning to our integration plans, I want to first recognize the shift in focus that occurs as we transition from a member-owned association to a commercial entity. The nature of our relationships with clients will evolve and we will be working hard to continue to earn their business. We think we've got a fantastic platform from which to do that with innovative and differentiated products and services, in addition to our world-class brand.","We also plan to maintain a strong European presence, just as we do in our other regions. We expect to have a local empowered leadership team in Europe led by Nicolas, with the European headquarters here in London. In addition, we'll invest in the country resources needed to serve clients effectively. We intend to maintain a data center in Europe and will obviously continue to comply with European data privacy regulations.","Finally, Visa Europe comprises 38 countries and we will ensure that we have country-specific strategies that are responsive to the evolving competitive and regulatory landscape. One of the strategic benefits of the transaction is that we will be able to deliver enhanced digital and mobile capabilities in Europe so this will be an important focus post-close. Our plan is to provide access to our Digital Solutions roadmap and partners. VE had already announced plans to roll out Visa Checkout and we're already working with them on that in the context of our existing partnership. We can extend to Europe all that we're doing to open our technology platform, which will enable collaboration and co-development of innovative payments experience.","By combining the two companies, we do expect to get benefits of scale and efficiency, providing access to our infrastructure, products, and corporate services to VE. We will fully integrate the VI and VE systems, which we expect to take three to four years as we work carefully with our clients to do this properly.","On the pricing side, we believe there is an opportunity to expand yields in Europe as we align the economic model with the value we bring and genuinely evaluate pricing from the perspective of a commercial enterprise rather than a member-owned association. However, we will be careful to remain competitively priced for our clients. It's obviously a very competitive environment and please remember that it wouldn't be intelligent for us to telegraph our specific plans, so we're not going to talk anymore about the specifics about pricing and yields.","And with that, I'll hand it over to Vasant to go through some additional details about the transaction.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Charlie. On slide 10, we outline the financial impact of the acquisition on Visa. Assuming the transaction closes April 1 next year, 2016 will be a stub year with two quarters of Visa Europe in our numbers.","We expect low single digit percentage point EPS dilution in fiscal year 2016 before onetime integration costs. There are three reasons for this. First, we will be issuing preferred share, which at the time of issue will on an as-converted basis amount to approximately 80 million shares of our class A shares, or 3.3% of shares outstanding. This creates almost $0.025 of EPS dilution each quarter until we buy back an equivalent amount of class A shares. We will be stepping up our stock purchases over and above our normal course buybacks to offset this dilutive impact.","Our plan is to do this through open market purchases over six quarters post-closing. In other words, we expect to have bought back an amount of our class A shares equal to the preferred shares issued on an as-converted basis in addition to our normal buybacks by the end of 2017. As you may expect, the dilutive impacts of the shares issued to Visa Europe members will be greatest in the second half of 2016 and taper off through 2017.","Second, we expect to issue $15 billion to $16 billion of debt with maturities from 2 years to 30 years. We're putting in place a long-term capital structure. The weighted average cost of this debt could be around 3% to 3.5% depending on market conditions. We are working with Visa Europe to prepare the required financial information which will include unaudited pro forma financial statements reflecting the combined entity under U.S. GAAP for fiscal year 2015. Market conditions permitting, we could be in the market in early December. Interest on the debt is expected to cost us $0.03 per share per quarter. This is $0.03 of dilution in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 if we have the debt in place three months before we close.","Third, we're not assuming significant benefits from revenue and cost action in the second half of 2016. We will have some benefits, but they will not be material enough to offset the dilution from the stock and debt issued until 2017 and beyond. As we get to closing, we will refine our estimates and be able to give you a better sense of the impact on 2016 EPS.","In fiscal year 2017, both revenue and cost benefits accruing from the acquisition will start to kick in, and the dilutive impacts of the share issuance will fade away. It is our current projection that Visa Europe will be accretive in fiscal year 2017, our first full year as a combined entity. 2017 accretion is expected to be in the low single digit percentage points range before integration costs.","We will provide non-GAAP numbers that adjusts for onetime costs associated with the restructuring of Visa Europe as we integrated into Visa. We are working on purchase accounting and its associated impact on our financial statements. It is our current expectation that the bulk of the purchase price will be allocated to indefinite lived intangible assets which will not be amortized. Other than adjusting for onetime integration costs, we do not plan at this point to move to cash EPS reporting. Once again, we will provide more clarity as we get to closing.","We expect the full integration to take until the end of 2020. As Charlie indicated, net revenue yields are expected to expand as we move to market-based pricing over time depending on client, competitive, and regulatory factors. On the cost front, the majority of the savings are derived from the technology integration which requires the most time. As such, technology-driven savings will be largely realized after 2017. We will have savings from organizational integration in 2017 and 2018, but we will also be making immediate investments in deploying our digital initiative and enhancing our client service model. We expect all the revenue and cost synergies from the Visa Europe transformation to be realized by 2020.","In 2020, we would expect high single digit percentage point EPS accretion and Visa Europe operating margins to be comparable to Visa Inc. margins. In total, we're targeting $200 million in cost savings, or roughly 30% reduction from the current run rate. When we look at the current run rate, we exclude the royalty that Visa Europe is currently paying us. This is included in their reported expenses but, as you know, it is not a cost reduction for the combined entity. We also exclude noncash depreciation and amortization expenses.","While we reduce cost where we can leverage Visa scale, we will also be adding cost as we invest to bring additional capabilities to our European clients, as well as to enhance the service we offer them at the local market level. As Charlie indicated, we will continue to operate with London as our regional hub much as we do today in Singapore, Dubai, and Miami for our other international regions. We will also retain a data center in the EU.","To fully integrate Visa Europe, we will incur $450 million to $500 million in onetime cost over three years to four years. The bulk of these integration costs will be incurred to complete the technology transition. As I mentioned before, we will specifically identify these costs each quarter and update future estimates as needed until the integration is complete. We will have some onetime cash and noncash charges coincident with the closing of the transaction. Cash closing costs are estimated approximately $150 million which includes stamp duties payable in the UK plus the usual contingencies paid to bankers, lawyers, et cetera.","Since the put will cease to exist at closing, we expect to reverse the put liability currently on our books a onetime noncash gain of $255 million. Also under U.S. GAAP, the royalty fee currently paid by Visa Europe is deemed to be below market. At closing, we have to establish the value we are realizing for implicitly paying Visa Europe to end this arrangement. As a result, we expect to record a $1.5 billion to $2 billion noncash write-off of the purchase price to reflect the settlement of the existing franchise agreement. Once again, we will have more precise estimates as we get to closing.","Visa Europe operates as a U.S. taxpayer with a 35% tax rate. As you know, Visa's effective tax rate is currently below this. As such, our blended tax rate will increase modestly post-acquisition. As always, we will work on tax planning initiatives to reduce our tax rate over time.","Moving to slide 11. As we've said for many years, we will put in place a long-term capital structure coincident with this acquisition. We intend to issue $15 billion to $16 billion in debt with maturities ranging from 2 years to 30 years. The size of each tranche will be adjusted based on market conditions. Our plan is to issue in the U.S. market in U.S. dollars for best execution. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio could rise to 1.5 times immediately post the acquisition. It is our plan to manage our long-term gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio in the 1.1 to 1.5 range. Based on our conversations with the rating agencies, we expect to maintain our current A+, A1 ratings at these leverage levels.","Of course, our net debt-to-EBITDA ratios will be significantly lower at all times given the cash we hold for settlement as well as any offshore cash. We could have used offshore cash to fund part of this transaction but have chosen not to do it at this time. Post-closing, we expect to put in place alternative structures that will allow us to achieve the same goal in a more logical and tax efficient manner.","As I indicated earlier, we will use proceeds from the debt offering to fund the upfront cash payment to Visa Europe members as well as to increase stock buybacks through 2017 to offset the preferred stock issued. The capital structure we will have in place will not only be more efficient but will also not restrict our future flexibility to invest in growing our business organically, to fund appropriate M&A, and to maintain our philosophy of returning excess cash to shareholders through dividends and buybacks.","Slide 12 provides a summary of sources and uses of cash. It's important to note that we expect to have approximately \u20ac2 billion or $2.3 billion of cash on the Visa Europe balance sheet which will transfer over to us at closing. This cash is freely available for settlement or general corporate purposes as needed. As I mentioned earlier, post-closing, we will work on restructuring some of the new entities to put in place mechanisms that will allow us to use excess cash we have offshore more efficiently. In terms of the upfront cash consideration, which is to be paid in euros, we plan to hedge a portion of our euro exposure between now and the close of this transaction.","Moving to slide 13, Visa Europe members can realize a total value of up to \u20ac21.2 billion at the end of four years. Almost half this value is in the form of the earn-out and preferred shares. The earn-out provides additional upside potential to both parties if agreed net revenue targets are met cumulatively over 16 quarters post-closing. Preferred shares give Visa Europe members a continuing stake in Visa and the opportunity to benefit from the value we can create in Europe and globally. The preferred shares also provide a funding source for legal fees and litigation settlements if we have them in the future.","As we do in the case of the class B shares, we will adjust conversion ratios to account for any payments made. There will be two series of preferred stock issued: one to UK and Ireland members; and the second to all other members of Visa Europe who are eligible to receive preferred stock. We will have an additional layer of coverage in the UK under a loss-sharing agreement with 11 of the largest UK members to directly fund settlements for domestic claims after certain levels of losses are paid from the UK and Ireland preferred stock. There will not be any additional indemnities in the UK for domestic claims.","Outside the UK, the second layer of coverage will come from existing indemnities which will remain in place. This mechanism is designed to fund legal expenses and settlements, if any, related to interchange in the Visa Europe territory. Specifically, potential losses based on domestic and EU rates up to the value of the preferred shares are covered 100% by this mechanism as our 70% of potential losses based on inter-regional rates. In the UK, as necessary, Visa Inc. can rely on additional protection under the LSA for 91% of claims related to domestic interchange.","Slide 14 describes how we expect to account for the earn-out and the preferred shares in our financial statement. The earn-out will be accounted for as contingent consideration. The fair value of the obligation will be recorded as a liability on our balance sheet at closing based on a probability rated estimate of the payout. Each quarter, we will mark this liability to market based on the revised view of the probability and size of the payout. This quarterly adjustment will be recorded as non-operating expense or income over the 16-quarter earn-out period post-closing.","As a reminder, all these amounts will be noncash until the fourth anniversary post-closing. At this point, a cash payment will be made to Visa Europe members up to a maximum of \u20ac4 billion plus up to an additional \u20ac700 million of interest depending upon the cumulative net revenue performance of the business over the earn-out period. The preferred share will be recorded as equity at close based on the value of class A share equivalent at \u20ac5 billion with a small discount to reflect the restrictions around transferability of the shares. If covered litigation payments are made or legal expenses are incurred, the conversion ratio of the preferred shares is reduced with an offset to litigation or professional fee expenses. In addition, we expect to record the two noncash charges I mentioned earlier.","With that, I'll turn this back to Charlie.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Vasant. In summary, we're delighted to be reuniting the Visa family. We believe we've structured this in a way that creates value to grow Visa Europe members, our shareholders, and our clients globally. Before I turn it over to Jack, first, I want to thank both the Visa Europe team and that the Visa Europe board. To Visa Europe team, congratulations on a great company you built. Thank you for all that we've done together to this point and we look forward to being your partner as one combined company.","And to the Visa Europe board, thank you for the energy, patience, detailed work and the way in which you focused in a balanced way on delivering both short and long-term value to your members. We'll work hard and I'm confident this combination will deliver both short and long-term benefits to your members.","And with that, Jack, we'll turn it back to you.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Charlie. Dexter, at this time, we're ready to start the Q&A session. And I would like to just ask all of the folks listening today to limit yourself to a single question so as to provide more folks the opportunity to get on the call. Dexter?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","I would now like to turn the \u2013 Okay. Our first question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Charlie, I heard you loud and clear that you don't want to talk about pricing, but one of the concerns that's been expressed is that the banks, once they kind of get their \u2013 once the check clears, would want to leave. Could you just talk about \u2013 obviously, you've got the earn-out payment and the preferred, could you talk about how you thought about that structure in terms of the long-term partnership with the current banks that make up Visa Europe?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I mean, let me start and Vasant can obviously chime in. Listen, I think, as we've \u2013 as both Vasant and I each talked about, we think the structure very much aligns the interest of us doing what makes sense for Visa Inc. as well as doing the right thing on behalf of the former members. And as I said, we live in a competitive world. We understand what goes on, but at the same time, we are going to have to transition from a member-owned structure to one which is different than that.","So, again, all I can say is that we're very, very conscious of both sides of the dynamics which is, there's opportunity for us as a combined company, but we also have to do it very intelligently and very carefully in a way that our clients understand and, at this point, probably expect given all of the conversations directly that we've had with the board.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","David Togut - Evercore ISI","Thank you and congratulations. Can you give us a sense of how the $200 million in cost savings will layer in approximately between FY 2017 and FY 2020?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So, as I said in the comments, in 2017, mostly we will look at the global platform that Visa Inc. has and seek to integrate from an organizational standpoint Visa Europe into Visa Inc. There will be some adjustments in 2017, but then the bulk of the savings, as I mentioned, really come from harmonizing the two technology platforms. And what we will be doing in 2017 is really working on harmonizing the platforms. And then, as Charlie said, very carefully transitioning over to our new platform. We will run both platforms for a period of time, which is where some of these integration costs come in.","Technology-related savings will kick in mostly in 2018 and beyond with the bulk of them in place by the end of 2019 and into early 2020. So, the savings pick up over time and that is factored in to the outlook we've given you. We will have accretion next year; when I say next year, I mean in fiscal year 2017. And then, we expect that we will be in the high single digit accretion range by the time we're done with all the integration.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And let me just add to that just a little bit of color around the reason why the conversion takes the amount of time that it takes. What we are not doing is just taking the existing platform we have and asking all of Visa Europe's clients to convert to that. The work that we have to do is to go through very carefully and understand what needs to get build out in the Visa Inc. systems to accommodate everything which is very specific for the European clientele. We then need to go build it and then we need to have a conversion plan in place that works on behalf of clients.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And the other thing I would just also mention, in case it wasn't entirely clear, is we will almost immediately, post the closing, make investments to bring additional capabilities to our European clients like Visa Checkout, as well as make investments to provide a level of service at a local level and enhance what we have today. So, there will be investments happening fairly quickly in the process, too.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. I guess, Vasant, I heard you say, I think, that Visa Europe and Visa Inc. margins you're assuming will be equal at some point in time. Could you just talk about whether or not there might be some deviation in that? Just figured that you might be able to extract more synergies from Visa Europe on a combined platform. Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. I think what you've got is a best sense of things at this point in time. Obviously, as one gets into this and we go into years two and three, we'll learn more about all the possibilities in terms of both what we can do on the cost side, what we can do on the revenue side, and so on. I think this is, at this point, I think the best point of view we can offer you. And when you adjust for the royalties that Visa Europe is paying us, when you look at the cost savings we can generate, it gives you a sense of where margins can get to from where they are. And so, we feel good that by the time we're done with the integration, Visa Europe margins should be in the Visa Inc. range.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Thank you. Kind of shift gears to the core business, Charlie. The cross-border business obviously is probably one of the highest margin areas of the company. It continues to be light, I guess, even after the quarter. Do you think we've troughed here, or is your sense that you could tick a little bit lower?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, listen, the easy answer is we really don't know. There's been continuing weakness and the early part of this quarter is slightly below where we were running. But that's a call on, as Vasant talked about in his remarks, on the strengthening, the weakening of the dollar, and broader economic impact. I just \u2013 I do want to say relative to cross-border, when you think about what we have to offer and what our competitors have to offer, cross-border payments is hugely value added. It's something that we'll experience the kind of volatility that we've see given the impact of the dollar on people's ability to spend, but it doesn't change the long-term value that we provide in cross-border, and we believe that ultimately translates to volume as these things evolve over time and also as we start to lap decreases that we've seen.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Thanks.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of James Schneider of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","James Edward Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Charlie or Nicolas, could you maybe comment specifically on whether the agreement includes any terms whereby the owners of Visa Europe re-up for a certain length of time and agree to remain at a certain issuance volume level or card level with Visa Inc.?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Listen, there are agreements in place in Visa Europe that stay intact and we work commercially beyond that. Beyond that, you can look at the structure yourself and see what that provides for.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Look, just on the financing side, you're bringing on roughly $15 billion to $16 billion in unsecured debt versus I think about $12 billion upfront needed and obviously you're using another $5 billion from preferred. I think you said, you mentioned in the past, you had about $5 billion plus of foreign cash and I know you mentioned you're not using it now. So just, when you think about all the cash you have there, $7-plus billion of free cash flow annually, can you just comment on the incremental buyback potential in addition to the $5 billion authorization you mentioned that we could potentially expect to see maybe even above and beyond the preferred?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. So, as we said earlier, we will borrow more than the cash that is paid out to Visa Europe up front. We will use that additional cash to step up our pace of buybacks. Our goal is to buy back the equivalent class A shares to offset the effect of the preferred shares issued over four to six quarters post the closing, so by the end of 2017. We will have more flexibility in the use of our offshore cash post the closing. We have a variety of plans that we expect to put in place and, as they fall into place, we'll talk to you about it. The goal will be then to have \u2013 not only have more freedom to move the offshore cash but also to move it efficiently and with minimal friction costs. I should also make sure you remember that we do keep cash available as a back-up for our daily settlement process. Some of that offshore cash today is used for that purpose so you shouldn't assume that all that is excess cash.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason A. Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. Wanted to get a sense of how much revenue synergy is assumed in the fiscal 2017 and the fiscal 2020 accretion projection, and just directionally, how much of that might be expected to come from improvement in the net revenue yields versus other general sources of top line synergy like cross-selling?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, as Charlie said, we don't plan to talk much about specific pricing plans for obvious reasons. But as you look through sort of some of what we've told you, clearly, when you move from an association model, you would expect there to be improvement in net revenue yields. How much, how fast, exactly how, I think we've given ourselves the ability to do it in the way that makes the most sense competitively and otherwise. And there's not a whole lot more about this that we plan to talk about publicly, but you'll see as we go along how things evolve.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of George Mihalos of Cowen. Your line is now open.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the deal, guys. Wanted to start off going back to the core business, how do you guys think about the improvements in the net revenue yield given some of the puts and takes around cross-border, some large business coming up with Costco and the like, your thoughts about being able to drive that higher over the intermediate term?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, as you saw, I mean, we had some pricing last year. We'll get the benefit of that pricing in the first half of fiscal year 2016 also. Clearly, the mix of the business with growth we have happening outside the U.S. which is a higher net revenue yield business, the mix of the business improving in terms of e-commerce and so on helps yields. We'll always look for opportunities where we create value to price for that value. And over the past three or four years, you've seen some steady improvements in net revenue yields.","So as Charlie said, I mean, fundamentally we like what we see in our business. The underlying trends of the business remain as good as they've ever been. We have some short-term what we consider to be transient drags on the business on a reported basis from some of the reasons I outlined. And then we have \u2013 as you see happening from time to time in this business, we have some big new wins, some big new renewals happening that have some impact in the early years and early quarters of those renewals and wins.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And I would just add to that. First of all, I obviously agree completely with what Vasant said. When we talk about the specifics the way we're thinking about 2016, they are driven by some very, very discrete and very specific items that don't continue for the long term in this business as opposed to what we do believe is the strong underlying growth that you'll see especially as we get to the latter half of 2016 in the domestic business, and then ultimately in the cross-border business, and that's really what positions the core business to continue growing.","But what I really do want to just \u2013 it would be remiss if I didn't point out is with commerce moving to digital platforms as we're seeing, we have more ways to involve ourselves in that commerce than ever before. And as we stood here \u2013 when this company went public and we talked about what we were going to do to attack all of the cash that was still on society, the things that we're talking about now, especially as it relates to mobile, didn't exist to the extent they do today. And so as we think about our ability to tackle and take advantage of disintermediating that cash and continue to provide value-added services alongside that, that's not in how we're thinking about 2016 or probably 2017, but that's what we come to work every day to try and drive, and why we feel so good about the long-term growth that still exists in the business.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah, hi. Thanks. Considering the strong appearance of underinvestment in the Visa Europe platform since the recession, I was hoping for an honest assessment of where you see their capability now versus Visa globally. And also if you can discuss in terms of regulatory scrutiny that this deal is likely to come under, all things considered. Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me take a shot at the first one and then, Vasant, you can chime in on the second. On the first one, I personally think it's like a gross overstatement to talk about whatever words, Craig, you used to describe Visa's \u2013 Visa Europe's investment since the recession. My view \u2013 again, I've only been here three years and I'll tell you in the three years that I've been here, it was, I guess, a year into that or so that Nicolas joined, we have been working extremely closely together on leveraging our platform at Visa Inc. to help Visa Europe's clients.","In addition to that, and I'm speaking for him but he can certainly chime in. He's sitting right here. He's been fairly aggressive about coming in and thinking about running the company the way you would think about running a for-profit company. And if those things together result in a lower expense base, so be it. That does not mean that they're not investing in the future of the company. I actually think just the opposite in a lot of what we're seeing. Having said that, even with all that he's been able to do as a standalone business, it's a small portion of what we'll be able to deliver as a combined company, both in terms of efficiencies and additional capabilities.","Nicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.","Yeah, that's a very good answer. I don't think I have anything specific to add to that.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And on the regulatory front, obviously, we've been in touch with the various authorities. They are aware of what has been underway. We have been in touch with them even as we got to this announcement. If you look at it from a regulatory standpoint, Visa Europe as part of Visa Inc. now has access to substantially greater financial resources, which makes it a financially much stronger player. Whether \u2013 if there's any concern around settlement risk management, the resources available now are vastly bigger. If it comes to concerns about cyber security, et cetera, you now have Visa Inc. and all our capabilities available to Visa Europe on an unfettered basis.","So when you look at all that, we think this makes Visa Europe far more stable and stronger from a regulatory standpoint. We have indicated, as Charlie did, that we will maintain as we have with all the other Visa businesses, a very large local presence in London, and increase our local presence in many of the other key European markets. And we will continue to have a data center in the European Union and comply with all the regulatory requirements. So we really think that this is a big plus from the standpoint of what regulators care about.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And Vasant (01:13:15)","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hold on. Hey, Jack, hold on.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Yes.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me just add to that for a second.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Sure.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Just to be really specific for a second, when we look at the specific regulatory approvals required, there are three antitrust control filings which will take place. It's the European Commission, the Turkish Competition Authority, and the Jersey Competition Regulatory Authority. And when we think about what this means for competitive reasons, we're very, very confident that we will get through this process in the timeframe that we spoke about. And then what Vasant is talking about goes beyond regulatory approvals required. It goes to the fact that our combined company and the way we intend to run it is very consistent with what we believe European regulators want out of this company.","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan...","Craig J. Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Trying to (01:14:15) answer to my first question, it was the best I've ever seen it. I don't want to embarrass the guy sitting next to me so...","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Tom McCrohan of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Tom McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, guys. Visa Checkout seems to be a pretty significant initiative here in the United States. I was wondering if you could share with us the conversations, dialogue you're having with the European banks and their willingness to embrace that as well in the 38 countries in Europe.","Nicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.","Nicolas speaking. I think we've just started the process of talking to our customers about Visa Checkout. And they like the fact that it will be a common approach between what used to be up to now to Visa \u2013 two (01:15:02) different Visa company. And having said that, once again, we are very early in the process. So we'll see how it goes, but I see no reason why they shouldn't like it.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And let me just add just because I think this is second nature to Nicolas, but for the rest of us it's different than the environment we operate in. When decisions like that are made at Visa Europe, they are made with a great deal of effort from the Visa Europe management team. But I would describe it as deep involvement from the board, which includes some of the most significant and a fairly wide representative group of the clients that exist within Visa Europe. So it's not management on their own making a decision to do something. It's done management with the board that do, in fact, represent the existing clients.","Nicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.","And there was a lot of scrutiny from the board on this specific topic.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Excellent. Dexter, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you so much. I just want to, I guess, try and assess how the terms of the earn-out tie with the accretion targets that you set. I heard the revenue targets. How about costs and the timely execution of the synergies, the $200 million that you called out, are they stipulated anywhere? Again, I'm just trying to gauge how visible the synergies are on the cost side. Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So, Tien-tsin, as we disclosed, the earn-out is linked to net revenue targets. So cost is not figured into it. Net revenue, we think, as you all know, reflects significantly value created in this business. It's also relatively easy to track. And the whole purpose of the earn-out is that if this business has greater value, then both sides benefit from that value.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Paul Tucker of Egerton Capital. Your line is open. Mr. Paul Tucker, your line is now open.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Paul, are you there? Dexter, let's move on.","Operator","Okay. Our next question comes from the line of Smitti Srethapramote of Susquehanna (sic) [Morgan Stanley]. Your line is open.","Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. It's Smitti from Morgan Stanley. Charlie, just wondering if you could share more details or give us more update on the China opportunity. Any more granular details on when you could potentially get a license? And also can you share with us some of your early thoughts in terms of how you plan to address the issuing and acquiring side over there?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, listen, as far as timing goes, there's really not anything additionally to talk about, otherwise, I certainly would've covered it. We cannot submit our application until the final regulations come out. As best we understand, they're actively being worked on within the Chinese government. But again, it's up to the Chinese government, not up to us.","Within our company, you can imagine that we are not sitting around and waiting for that event. We've got a tremendous amount of work going on inside the company, people working on both an application because there are a series of models out there for industries which have been opened up to competition. So we've done a fair amount of work on being prepared for that as well as there's a fair degree of \u2013 a fair line of sight relative to what our operating environment will have to look like within China. And so we've got a team of people working on being in a position to have that in place in the timeframe that's outlined in the licensing process.","And then we've got our China team working on just what you asked, which is what our strategy is to grow the acquiring side of the business, because we've got a very, very big gap between where our cards are accepted and where UnionPay's are in the physical world, as well as the big opportunity that exists in the online space. And on the issuing side, as I pointed out many times, we have fairly deep relationships with Chinese banks as evidenced by the sizable cross-border business that we have today.","So our domestic plans are regular part of the conversations we have with the issuers. So that's a very long way of saying we've got active plans that we're working through but obviously, we can't do anything until we're able to submit our application and then see what the Chinese government decides from there.","Smitti Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Yes, sir. Our next question comes from the line of Jamie Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. Thanks. Nicolas, in your prepared remarks, you had mentioned that the relationship between issuers, acquirers and networks in Europe are changing. I was wondering if you or Charlie could elaborate on that. I know it's an open-ended question but your insights would be appreciated.","Nicolas Huss - Chief Executive Officer, Visa Europe Ltd.","I think one of the points that will be changing due to regulation is the relationship with the retailers and therefore with the acquirers, and that's the point I was referring to. Once again, this will come out from the new regulation that we have, as you know, in Europe, and we will see that happening during next summer. My last comment maybe would be the fact that from a competition perspective, this might open a different approach to retailers. That's what I was referring to.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And the only thing I would add is those of us \u2013 those of you that have been following us for a while have heard us talk about the efforts that we have underway on the merchant side of our business. And we're very hopeful that the solutions, like what we announced with CyberSource this past quarter, will be all applicable within Europe to help build those relationships and ultimately the acquiring side of the business.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi, guys. Just to follow up on that, how do you guys believe the new European regs will impact Visa Europe? Will it be some positives and negatives and does it come out neutral? Or do you guys come out more on the positive end or negative end? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, listen, I think \u2013 I guess a couple things. Number one is, relative to the timing of the transaction for us, there's a fair amount of clarity at this point on what the environment looks like. So as we think about the way we forecasted the impact on our company as a combined entity, it takes into account what we believe the pluses and minuses are of the regulatory environment.","When you look at things like the separation of scheme and processing where the final regs haven't been released but there's pretty clear direction where things are going, it's like anything else in life, there are potential pluses and potential minuses. And what we've got here is the ability to be very proactive about thinking through how we're going to make it a plus for us. I think that's as much as I want to say at this point.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ken Bruce of Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Ken?","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Can you hear me?","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Yes.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Sorry. Okay. Charlie, I know you're reluctant to project too much here, but you point out the experience that you've had or Visa's had in terms of converting from a bank association, and I'm wondering, should we look back to that as a \u2013 the Visa Inc. transition as being a blueprint or a playbook for how you would approach Visa Europe here? Is that helpful at all for us?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, listen, I think \u2013 listen, the short answer is on most things, no, other than what we learned as we went through that in the training that the people at Visa Inc. have had on both sides, on being on the Visa Inc. side, call it, the U.S.-based part of the business, as well as the strong contingent of non-U.S. people, we've just been through and know how to do it.","When we talk about like our lack of willingness or whatever words you use to talk about specifics, I actually think (01:24:27) we're being pretty clear here. What we're not doing is we're not telling you the specifics of what we intend to do on price. And again, as I said in my prepared remarks, I hope you understand that that's the smart thing for us to do as opposed to lay out exactly what you're going to do. By the way, I can't imagine a company in any industry that would think that's a smart thing to do.","So what we've done is, in lieu of that, is we've given you what we think the expense synergies are. We've laid out what we think our capital actions will be so you can get to your own point of view on what that means for our share count. And we've given you what we think will happen all in all relative to EPS accretion at different points of the transaction. So if you have all that, you should be able to do the revenue number, and behind that is what we believe we'll do overall in pricing.","So again, what we're trying to do is be fair and transparent for this transaction because it is a different kind of transaction starting from a different place in a different environment, both competitively and from a regulatory perspective. So the case is built specific for this transaction but we're trying to create that balance of being as transparent as we can while not giving away anything competitively.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Dexter?","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hey, guys. Taking a step back from the details of the transaction, when you look out to 2020 and beyond, what effect do you think your Visa Europe acquisition as well as the regulatory changes in Europe will have on the underlying secular dynamics in Europe? Meaning adoption of card, adoption of digital, kind of mix of credit and debit. There's some sharp differences between some areas of Europe and much of the rest of the world.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Listen, there are, and I think \u2013 I guess broadly speaking, what I'd say is \u2013 and I know you all know this \u2013 but any time there is stronger competition, there's an ability to drive greater results. And so whether that means that because we are able to bring the capabilities that we have today and that we're able to continue to develop based specifically upon the European needs, that will allow us, we believe, to drive deeper penetration than Visa Europe would have been able to do on its own just because of the resource constraints that they had. As we become stronger here, our competitors will become stronger here as we've seen in other parts of the world.","I know you all spend a lot of time comparing us to our competitors, we do as well because we want to learn and because we compete with them every day. But the reality is the stronger we each become, the stronger we make the other. And you see that as being evidenced in how \u2013 the swiftness that we move in the marketplace and the types of things that we are doing.","And if you look at the types of things that we're doing as a company or MasterCard is doing as a company, I don't believe that those things would have been in market if we were continuing on as associations. So we do think that we will bring more competition to this market. The competitors will respond knowing that there's more competition. But our belief is there's still a tremendous amount of opportunity to electronify payments in the marketplace and we've got a greater ability to do that as a combined entity.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And the only other thing I would point out is despite all the troubles that Europe has had economically in the last five years, is you've seen from Visa Europe's reported numbers on payment volumes, there's been very healthy payment volume growth through that entire timeframe. And there still is a very large opportunity, as Charlie said, in Europe, in the 38 countries that will now be part of Visa Inc. to disintermediate cash and checks. So we're very excited about that kind of opportunity that was previously not part of \u2013 not available to Visa Inc. shareholders.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Dexter, at this point, we have one time for one final question.","Operator","Thank you very much. And the last question is coming from Jason Deleeuw of Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.","Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Yeah, thank you. And I want to ask a question on Chase Pay and the announcement with MCX, does that agreement change Visa's interaction with Chase or just the general payments transaction at all? And are you hearing from any other large issuers that are now more interested in an arrangement like ChaseNet?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Whatever they've announced doesn't change anything with any contractual agreement that we have with Chase. Whatever they've done with MCX is something that they've done. I would say that as we've said before, we have very active dialogue with our clients, both here in the U.S. and abroad \u2013 not here, I'm not in the U.S. right now \u2013 but in the U.S. and abroad of what the potential benefits of that structure are and whether that's something they're interested in.","And to date, there has not been a lot of appetite. Whether that changes or not, we'll see. We are very, very focused on solutions that make it easier for all Visa cardholders to pay for things, anyway, whether it's a physical point of sale or in the digital space, and we will be aggressive in helping all of our clients to compete on that level playing field. Every single one of them regardless of what any one individual issuer does.","Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)","Thank you.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Charlie.

I would now like to turn the conference to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky","Good afternoon, and welcome, everyone, to Visa Inc.'s Fourth Fiscal Quarter and Full Year 2012 Earnings Conference Call. With us today are Joe Saunders, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing highlights of today's commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance. And as a result of a variety of factors, actual results could differ materially from such statements.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.","And with that, I turn the call over to Joe.","Joseph W. Saunders","Thanks, Jack. And as always, thank you all for joining us today. Let me begin by saying that our hearts and thoughts are with the people on the East Coast of the United States who are now recovering from Hurricane Sandy. Many of our clients, our employees, our partners and investors like you live in affected areas. And we hope that you, your families and your neighbors are all safe and moving toward a full and speedy recovery.","Visa closed out fiscal 2012 with a solid fourth quarter, delivering net operating revenues of $2.7 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter were $1.54, an increase of 21% over the prior year quarter. The adjustment in diluted earnings reflects the impact of a $627 million increase in net income during the fourth quarter from the reversal of tax reserves and accrued interest associated with our covered litigation. This was due to the withdrawal of the notice of proposed adjustment by the IRS during the quarter. Byron will provide additional commentary.","Revenue gains for the quarter were driven by particularly strong payments volume growth for credit products in the United States, as well as continued expansion of our core business and growth of processed transactions in international markets.","Visa also delivered strong performance for the full fiscal year. Net operating revenue in 2012 was a record $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over 2011. Adjusted net income was $4.2 billion, a 19% increase over the prior year. Full year adjusted diluted earnings per share came in at $6.20, 24% ahead of last year.","Now let's turn the discussion to what's ahead in 2013. Byron will get into specifics on broad guidance for fiscal 2013, but we are reaffirming our commitment to a growth rate in the high teens for adjusted diluted earnings per share. That being said, Visa is taking a measured approach to the coming year. We are mindful of uncertainties in the global operating environment, including softness in some pockets of the global economy and continued volatility in Europe. And given our better-than-anticipated performance in fiscal 2012, we essentially raised the bar in ourselves and now face somewhat tougher comparisons in the coming year.","With that in mind, at this early point in fiscal 2013, we are once again setting our net revenue guidance growth to low-double digits. An improving economic environment could well change our view, but we'll take a prudent road for the time being.","Effective tomorrow, Charlie Scharf becomes Visa's Chief Executive Officer. I will continue as Executive Chairman of the company until March 31, at which point I plan to retire. Charlie's appointment was the result of a thorough and robust succession process. Charlie is a proven leader. He has experience as a senior executive with large global enterprise and is familiar with Visa both as a client and as a board member. Importantly, Charlie drove innovation well at the helm of Chase's retail operation. I am confident that Charlie will hit the ground running, not miss a beat and accelerate our forward momentum. I look forward to working with him to make this transition seamless. And I'm sure he looks forward to getting to know you better, and that he will talk to you directly when he leads our next earnings call.","Given Visa's outlook for growth, we continue to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders. During the quarter, our as-converted common share count was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share by spending $324 million. Earlier this month, our Board of Directors authorized an incremental $1.5 billion for Class A share repurchases. Additionally, as reported last week, our board raised our dividend 50% over last year's rate to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis.","Turning to our business in the United States. Overall, we continue to apply a disciplined approach to expand Visa's business in the rapidly evolving technological and competitive landscape. Our business is tracking closely with our expectations. For credit products, Visa extended our gains. During the September quarter, payment volume grew 9% with particular strength from our products. Prepaid growth also continues to be strong in the United States with the general purpose of payroll segments serving as our 2 biggest growth drivers in the category during the September quarter, posting 28% and 30% payment volume growth respectively.","Now let's turn to U.S. debit, where the situation continues to play out as expected and in line with our guidance. Quarter by quarter, we are getting smarter about how to operate in the new environment in which we wish to pull to grow our debit business. That being said, I want to reiterate our belief that the share loss resulting from the Dodd-Frank regulation is both permanent and fully incorporated in our FY '13 guidance.","Overall U.S. debit growth rates have stabilized since our last earnings report, with aggregate debit payment volume growth modestly improving to negative 6% during the September quarter. Further, we have been working with issuers to secure long-term contracts. To that end, we've secured our top 15 U.S. debit issuers to long-term agreements.","In short, our revised strategies for the U.S. debit segment continue to gain traction in the marketplace, achieving Visa's own operational and financial expectations while simultaneously delivering value and benefit to our clients.","As for the U.S. Department of Justice's civil investigative demand, I have no material update. We are regularly submitting data to the DOJ. The company will continue to update you as the situation develops, but we remain comfortable in our position on this issue.","At the same time, we are making steady progress towards completing the previously announced merchant litigation settlement in the United States. On October 19, the merchant plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval. Subsequently, the judge set an accelerated timetable last week, which calls for hearings on the motion on November 9. We are hopeful the judge will grant preliminary approval shortly thereafter, with the rules becoming effective 60 days later. Bottom line, I'm confident that the overwhelming majority of merchants will support the agreement and it will be approved.","Now let's briefly turn to Visa's international geographies where payment volume growth moderated slightly during the fiscal fourth quarter but still delivered strong revenue growth of 13% as we continue to maintain our strong competitive leadership position. Overall, we continue to advance towards our goal of generating 50% of our revenue from outside the United States. To drive growth, we continue to apply a targeted investment strategy, which deploys locally tailored acceleration plans within several key geographies. In doing so, our goal is to substantially increase Visa's revenue over a 5-year time horizon.","In the interest of time, I won't walk through a list of new and expanded agreements from the quarter. But suffice it to say, we continue to grow our relationships with financial institutions, merchants and governments of all sizes around the world. And these are driving payment volume and processed transactions, as well as revenue growth for Visa. This approach will continue to be a priority as our organization moves ahead in the future.","Lastly, let me talk about Visa's innovation agenda, an area where we are making considerable progress. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business platforms, add incremental value to the merchant community and their acquirers and forge new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our financial institution clients. But most importantly, we know that our innovations must create real value for our clients and account holders who ultimately use these products and services.","Let's start with V.me, our digital wallet. We are making significant progress putting together the network that will enable us to scale consumer adoption of V.me. On the issuer front, we recently announced 2 major partners, PNC and U.S. Bank, both of which will make an immediate impact as we begin to grow users of the product. All together, we have 34 agreements signed with leading U.S. issuers, including 4 of our 10 largest institutions in the United States. Looking ahead, we're confident that the number will continue to grow. Together, they give us the opportunity to tap roughly 50 million consumers through our bank partners. We look forward to making additional announcements in this area in the coming months.","At the same time, we're making progress to signing up merchants for V.me. By the middle of 2013, we expect to have more than 1,000 online merchants using V.me, including 20 of the 50 largest e-commerce merchants in the country. I want to reiterate that V.me is designed to help capture the significant immediate growth opportunity in e-commerce. e-commerce is one of our fastest-growing channels, with Forrester Research predicting that U.S. consumers will spend $327 billion online by 2016, up 45% from the $226 billion in 2012.","As a reminder, V.me creates a simplified and secure e-commerce experience for consumers no matter what payment device or technology they choose to transact with. This offers our clients a differentiated solution to address a real market opportunity today and provides a fast and convenient experience with consumers making online purchases.","At the same time, Visa is a leader in enabling NFC payments at the point of sale in the United States. As one example, Isis, the payments joint venture founded by AT&T Mobility, T-Mobile USA and Verizon Wireless, is currently enabling Visa payments via NFC in its own mobile wallet as part of their recently launched pilot. Isis's open approach aligns with Visa's strategy of enabling consumers to make mobile payments with whatever device they choose using the trusted accounts they already have. Consumer adoption of NFC is in its very early stages today. And I'm very comfortable that Visa is well positioned to deliver the best mobile solutions to our clients, helping them take advantage of this long-term shift in consumer behavior.","Also on the innovation front, I'm pleased that CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions total $1.4 billion, growing 25% versus the same period a year ago. CyberSource's unique capabilities are particularly resonating in international markets. At the time we bought CyberSource, they had field operations in only 4 countries. Today, that number is 12 and growing, and CyberSource teams are benefiting from Visa's local market knowledge.","To conclude, I'd like to say again how proud I am of what we've accomplished toward Visa. Since our restructuring 5 years ago, we have successfully delivered on all of our investor commitments and transitioned to a solid public company that will continue to compete globally well into the future. Visa is built on a simple yet effective strategy: To be the best way to pay and be paid. To deliver on that promise, we have created an organization that is focused on delivering payment products and services to the evolving needs of consumers, merchants, governments and financial institutions. We have also established a culture that can adapt to a fast-changing landscape and thrive in the midst of challenges. And we are well positioned to continue to expand our core business, invest in next-generation technologies that will define the future of payments and accelerate expansion of our business outside of the United States.","Today, I know we have the right people, the right strategy, the right technology and the right experience to continue to be a leader of our industry. And with Charlie as CEO, I am confident that Visa will continue to grow globally and deliver innovation that meets the needs of Visa account holders and our clients.","I'd like to thank everyone at Visa, all of our partners and all of our investors for the opportunity to work with you. I look forward to seeing Visa take full advantage of all that lies ahead.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron.","Byron H. Pollitt","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some observations and callouts. First, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis. We were recently notified by the IRS that the NOPA, or Notice of Proposed Adjustment, in connection with the deductibility of our litigation payments made in 2008, had been withdrawn. As a result, we reevaluated and reversed all previously recorded tax reserves and accrued interest associated with all covered litigation expense previously recorded. This increased net income for the quarter by $627 million.","Second, U.S. revenue growth continues to be supported by solid credit payment volume growth, although our 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit growth were interrupted as the September quarter clocked in at 9%. Through the 28th of October, however, credit payment volume growth has comped at an 11% rate, a notable rebound, reflecting a month-to-month volatility dynamic we've seen more of recently.","Third, with 4 quarters of lower U.S. debit interchange and 2 quarters of the new debit routing rule behind us, the impacts have been manageable. Aggregate U.S. debit posted a negative 6% growth rate in the fourth quarter versus a negative 9% in the third quarter led by Interlink payment volume, which was off 48% versus 54% in the third quarter. While we are pleased our mitigation strategies are working as planned and are consistent with our expectations, we would caution that the U.S. debit environment is still evolving.","Finally, as was the case last quarter, the all-in impact from U.S. debit regulation, which includes restructured pricing, incentives, other mitigation strategies and volume loss, cost us about $0.04 in EPS for the quarter. Management's view of the future effects have been incorporated into our guidance.","Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the quarter followed by our results through October 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal fourth quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2013.","Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 6%, unchanged from the June quarter. The U.S. grew at 1% and Rest of World at 12%. More recently, through October 28, U.S. payment volume growth posted a 3% gain comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 4% for debit. Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 10% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter, which compares to a 14% rate in the third quarter. The U.S. grew 8% and the Rest of World, 11%. The moderation in growth was broad-based, with notable stepdowns in the U.S., North and Southeast Asia and Latin America. Through October 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 11%, with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and Rest of World at 12%.","Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 14 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 2% increase over the prior year period and up from 1% in the prior quarter. A debit-led decline of 1% in the U.S. was offset by a 19% growth in the Rest of World. For the month of October through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a positive 4%, driven by an improving trajectory in the U.S.","Separately, CyberSource recorded 1.4 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year.","Three callouts. First, as expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is being felt by our Interlink product, where transaction growth will continue to be negative until we lap the implementation of the routing rules in the middle of next year. Second, Visa processed transactions continue to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and Rest of World. Finally, as Joe mentioned at the outset, we are operating under the assumption that the U.S. and global economies will continue their moderate growth over the next 12 months as uncertainty from the fiscal cliff, continued Eurozone concerns and a general slowdown in world trade put a damper on domestic consumer cross-border spending.","Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.7 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year and ahead of our expectations as a result of stronger U.S. debit and credit performance. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was $10.4 billion, a 13% increase over the prior year and a better performance than we had anticipated going into the year. After hedges, there was negative 1% foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter and no impact to the full year.","Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This reflects strong payment volume growth in the June quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $1.1 billion, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates from Visa processed transactions outside of the U.S. and for CyberSource globally, as well as competitive pricing actions that became effective last quarter. The step-up in gross revenue data processing yield, which we first saw last quarter, continued to carry through this quarter due in part to strategic pricing adjustments but also driven by the ongoing, though moderating, decline in Interlink transactions, which are, by far, our lowest-yielding product.","International transaction revenue was up 5% to $796 million, reflecting solid but moderating strength in cross-border volumes, with mid-single-digit-growth rates in the U.S. and Asia Pacific, low-double-digit growth in Latin America and low 20s in our SEMEA region as measured on a constant dollar basis.","Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenues came in at 17%, lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to better-than-expected revenue performance but in line in terms of absolute dollars. For the fiscal year 2012, incentives were 17% of gross revenues, at the low end of our guidance of 17% to 18%.","While total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 18%, it is important to note that this heavier-than-normal operating expense level is not a new quarterly run rate. When viewed on a full year adjusted basis, expenses grew 12%, of which approximately 2 percentage points were due to annualizing acquisition expenses. And as expected, this annual expense growth was consistent with delivering a 60% adjusted operating margin, which was our guidance for the year.","As further perspective on expenses, 3 callouts. First, we staged more of our investment spend in the second half of the year to enable a tighter linkage between revenue and expense growth. Second, marketing spend of $271 million intensified in Q4, associated with the London Olympics. For the full year, marketing expenses were $873 million, relatively unchanged from the prior year and in line with our guidance. And finally, third, we took over $30 million in Q4 restructuring reserves, which included the closing of our San Francisco offices and consolidation of our staff into our Foster City campus. Looking ahead to 2013, we have planned a closer balance between first and second half operating spend.","Our operating margin for the quarter was 56%, bringing our fiscal full year adjusted margin to 60%, which, as noted earlier, was on target with our guidance for the year. Capital expenditures were $141 million in the quarter and ended the fiscal year at $376 million. This roughly represents the midpoint of our guidance range.","Our adjusted tax rate for Q4 was 33%, and for the entire fiscal year, 33%. As I mentioned at the outset, both of these figures were affected by events over the course of the year.","During the quarter, total as-converted Class A common stock was reduced by 2.5 million shares at an average price of $127 per share, utilizing $324 million of operating cash on hand. This is inclusive of the $150 million escrow funding made in late July. As Joe mentioned at the outset, our board recently authorized a new repurchase program totaling $1.5 billion effective through October of 2013. This is incremental to the $865 million still outstanding from our previous authorization.","We also raised our annual dividend 50% to $1.32 per share on an annualized basis, which represents a payout ratio of about 21% on 2012 adjusted earnings.","At the end of the September quarter, we had 668 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fourth quarter totaled 672 million, and for the full fiscal year, 678 million.","Finally, let me finish up with our guidance for fiscal 2013. In terms of the top line, as Joe said at the outset, we are guiding to net revenue growth in the low double digits, though the possibility of upside exists if we were to see a noticeably stronger economic rebound over the course of the year than we are currently experiencing. As a reminder, going in the fiscal 2012, we built into our internal projections a sustained but modest recovery for that year, with fiscal Q3 and Q4 bearing the brunt of U.S. debit regulation followed by economic acceleration in 2013.","That said, the trends in the past 2 quarters suggest economic assumptions around 2013 were too optimistic. Many of the same uncertainties remain. And while we lost significant U.S. debit share, we weathered the second half of 2012 better than we expected. As we look ahead into 2013, growing uncertainty in the U.S. and world economy has precipitated a slowdown in domestic and cross-border spending. When we combine this global outlook with the higher bar created by better-than-anticipated 2012 revenue growth, we now find ourselves in a situation similar to 2012 and believe revenue guidance in the low-double-digit range is the right call at this time.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share growth remains the same, at a high teens rate. Client incentives, as a percent of gross revenue, are expected to range between 18% and 18.5%. We expect this modest increase over fiscal 2012 to be driven by a growing level of incentives for financial institutions outside the U.S. in combination with incentive contracts with large U.S. merchants and acquirers.","Marketing expense is projected to be under $1 billion. However, we will see modest moderate uptick over the level of fiscal 2012 with more of the marketing spend budgeted in the first half versus the prior year. The uptick will be driven by greater investment in our APCEMEA region, as well as incremental investments behind our V.me and mobile initiatives.","Operating margin is expected to remain at about 60%. The tax rate is expected to be in the 30% to 32% range. This reduction anticipates benefits from foreign tax credits to be claimed in fiscal 2013. We anticipate the timing of these benefits to be skewed more to the second half of the fiscal year.","Capital expenditures are projected to range from $425 million to $475 million. This represents a moderate increase over the $376 million we spent in 2012 and fully funds investments we are making across the globe in support of our core business as well as our mobile and e-commerce initiatives.","Finally, we expect free cash flow of about $5 billion. Our priorities for use of this cash remain the same: first, reinvesting in the business; second, appropriate acquisition; and third, distribution to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Before we take your questions, recognizing Joe's retirement next March, I want to briefly reflect on Visa's 5 years as a merge to business entity and our 4.5-year public life. With 2008 as a base year and despite a deep U.S. recession and challenging regulatory environment, under Joe's leadership, the Visa team has delivered net revenue growth at a 14% compound annual growth rate and adjusted diluted EPS at a 29% compound annual growth rate. Our adjusted operating margin has gone from 46% in March of 2008 to 60% today. We lowered our tax rate from 41% to 33%. We have tripled our dividend rate through annual increases and have collectively returned $1.8 billion in dividends to our shareholders IPO to date. Lastly, over that same period of time, we have reduced our common share count through litigation escrow funding and open market purchases by 118 million shares, representing $9 billion returned to shareholders.","And with that, operator, for the 19th time since going public, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","I had a question on your new CEO starting tomorrow, Charlie. I guess why -- what led you to Charlie Scharf? I mean, this is a dynamic time technology business, international growth. Charlie's, everything we can tell, is a very strong executive but more of a U.S. Bank guy. What were the key choices in selecting Charlie and going outside the company today versus internal?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, as I mentioned in my comments today, he's a dynamic executive, he has done well. He understands our business. He's been a client. He has been on our board. And if you remember, he was on the board of this company for 3 years. He has more than a fleeting familiarity with Visa. He is very familiar with the staff at Visa, having interacted with many of them for a number of years. He has run large global operations in the past. And while he's not a technologist, per se, he's run large organizations that depend very significantly on technology. We also, as you remember, have parsed our company in a way where we have focused on technology simultaneous to what we do in our core business. And there has to be a recognition that our core business is the -- is what's feeding this engine and what's creating the revenue and the cash flow that allows us to invest. We have an extremely strong technology organization. We've hired a number of extraordinary individuals over the last 2 or 3 years. We're very, very confident that, that organization has the ability to take -- to continue to take us forward. And, in fact, I think you'd have to admit that vis-\u00e0-vis other companies in our space, we're way out front, and we don't intend to lose that. So thanks for asking the question.","Operator","Our next question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","Just one of the beauties of Visa's business model is kind of the scalability. And just in looking at your operating margin guidance, it seems like we have another year in 2013 of relatively modest operating margin expansion. Could you just talk about the dynamics that kind of preclude that from happening? And then specific -- one just callout or clarification. I was wondering if there was a callout on the other revenue line, because that was up a little bit?","Byron H. Pollitt","The -- with regards to operating margin leverage, we have been kicking up the pace of reinvesting, particularly in our growth initiatives that are -- that really won't begin to drive revenue in a meaningful way until 3 and 4 and 5 years out. And you can look at mobile, V.me. And so what we have done up to this point is invest aggressively in new office expansions and deploying more account executives serving clients in country, all of which drive margin expansion, which, as you've noticed, has moved from 46%, which seems like a lifetime ago, up to 60%. And as more of our investment or acquisitions are much more forward-looking, there will be more of a lag between when that'll show up in operating leverage expansion versus pure investment in the core that leverages the -- completely the VisaNet platform. With regards to other revenue, the reserves associated with the release of the FIN 48 expenses that we had recorded associated with the NOPA, a part of that was -- part of those reserves were recorded in other income. And as we released those reserves, they showed up in that column.","Operator","Our next question will come from Greg Smith of Sterne Agee.","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Byron, just 2 quick questions on the 2013 guidance. Is there any pricing -- are there any pricing increase assumptions in there? And the second one is just, can you reiterate what you said on marketing? Will we actually see the first half heavier than the second half or just more of a skew compared to 2012, please?","Byron H. Pollitt","Can you repeat the last question again?","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Just the total marketing spend, you called out that the -- you said there would be more of a skew to the first half. Were you talking just total absolute dollars heavier in the first half than the second half? I just wasn't clear on that.","Byron H. Pollitt","Yes. So -- yes, let me deal with that one first. There was a -- if you look at the total amount of marketing spend that we incurred in the fourth quarter, it was $271 million. That was 31% of our entire year's marketing budget. And what we have in marketing is a -- this year, is a percentage and dollar weighted much higher to the fourth quarter or to the second half. And on a percentage basis for next year, we expect to see a better balance, a more even -- it won't be 50-50, but there -- it'll be much more in balance between what is spent in the first half and second half. And even though you asked that question in the context of marketing, let me broaden that and say that, that should hold true for our entire operating expenses. We were much more second half weighted this past year than we expect to be in the year to come. And I'm sorry, your first question was?","Gregory Smith - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","In price increases.","Byron H. Pollitt","Price increases. I would say that there is very little in the way of pricing built into the coming year. And in fact, we are giving back some effective pricing as a part of our response in the U.S. debit arena. So the revenue growth for next year is going to be delivered the good old-fashioned way, by driving hard against payment volume, not only in the U.S. but in the Rest of World in particular.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to get a general update on the e-commerce business in terms of either your percent of volume or percent of revenue or growth or whatever metrics you can provide? And some color on to what extent V.me can accelerate this and perhaps in which time frame? And then just a quick clarification for Byron. What caused the jump up in other income here in Q4?","Joseph W. Saunders","You go first.","Byron H. Pollitt","Okay. So with regards to other income, this was -- it was principally driven by 2 things. The release of reserves, which are related to the reversal of the NOPA reserves on the IRS situation that clarified itself this past quarter. A part of the -- the vast majority of those reserves are taxes. But when you are put into a situation where you potentially have to pay back taxes, then you have an interest charge. And that's -- that interest charge was the source of the release in reserves that hit that column. In addition, we had some insurance recoveries that occurred that quarter, and that's why those popped up. On the e-commerce, with regards to the percentage of our business, we don't have an update on that for the moment. But this is our fastest-growing channel across the company globally. And within that e-commerce channel, the fastest-growing form factor is mobile. And this is why we have put such emphasis on V.me, which is particularly suited for the mobile form factor, and why we have put such strong focus on mobile strategies that go far beyond NFC and are global in scope.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I got 2 quick ones maybe. Just on the rebate line, that was nicely lower than we expected for the quarter. I'm curious for next year, the line of sight into the 18%, 18.5%, how much of that step-up is sort of signed based on your deals that you've already renewed or recently won versus anticipated deals? Just trying to get a better sense of conservatism versus reality there. And then secondarily on debit, I know there's a little bit of improvement in October. How much of that is paved in -- from the other mitigation strategies versus just macro or new wins? That would be great.","Byron H. Pollitt","Okay. So on the incentive side, I would say, first of all, that the drivers are almost as much Rest of World contracts that a number of which -- a meaningful increment of which have already been signed and will begin annualizing at a higher incentive rate going into next year. And we've already -- and so that's one major driver of the incentive increase. The other major driver is that we're only 2 quarters into the routing rule changes in U.S. debit. And as a result of that, we've got a building momentum of agreements that we are signing with merchants and acquirers. And that also will -- has yet to annualize in the coming year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Thomas McCrohan of Janney.","Thomas C. McCrohan - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","Can you expand a little bit about the routing agreements that are still being signed with the merchant community? Just give us a sense of how those are going to be structured and how they're going to be flowing through the income statement?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, what I would say is 2 things. These agreements are very much performance-oriented agreements. They -- for the most part, they only pay out incentives if the volume is delivered. Now I think it's important to emphasize that the agreements, themselves, don't guarantee volume. They incent it. If the volume is there, the incentives will be paid. And if they aren't, they aren't. And so there is -- to a certain extent, there is a degree of variability with regards to how much incentives will be paid out and it will be completely tied to the volume delivered. And then we are still, as I said before, on a path of signing additional merchants with these agreements, so we do expect them to be not only performance-based but to grow in number as the year unfolds. The way these are booked into the income statement is virtually 100% contra-revenue incentives.","Operator","Our next question comes from Julio Quinteros of Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a quick question on kind of decomposing the EPS growth rate. I'm understanding where the revenue growth is and the target for the margins. If you think about the buyback that you guys have currently coupled with your lower tax rate, is there some proportions that we should be thinking about in terms of how much of the buyback is built into the EPS growth? And then also the tax rate, I think you say was in the 30% to 32% range, is that correct?","Byron H. Pollitt","Yes. So, Julio, I'm going to let you do the math. What we've done is given you the -- given you all the metrics that we typically give you at this point of time. The -- clearly, there is a dynamic with the double -- low-double-digit revenue growth and the operating margin is -- will be the major contributor. Tax, once again, will allow us to add a little octane to the EPS growth. And then as you have noticed, we're very disciplined repurchases -- repurchasers of our stock over the course of the year. We also have a habit of readdressing the opportunity for buyback at every single board meeting. So today, as we enter into the fiscal -- new fiscal year, we have $865 million of previously authorized but unspent open to buy on share repurchase. We have $1.5 billion new program that was just announced. So that gives us a little over $2.3 billion of open to buy. And then, of course, later in the year, should circumstances warrant, we have the opportunity to go back to the board and ask for additional share repurchase opportunity. Recognize, however, that the later in the year that the share repurchases occur, the corresponding lower impact they will have on a given year's EPS.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bill Carcache of Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","Joe, some of the U.S. data that we've seen shows a clear consumer preference for PIN over Signature. I wonder if you could comment on whether that's, in fact, what you're seeing as well; and if so, what you attribute that to? And then if you could just kind of share your thoughts on how strategic you see the role of U.S. debit in the context of your suite of payment products, now that it isn't the growth driver that it once was?","Byron H. Pollitt","So we're -- I suppose we're in a bit of a odd position to comment on this in one sense because with regards to PIN, thanks to a regulatory change, a substantial part of our PIN market share was gifted to our competition. And so it's a little hard for us on the margin to comment on the PIN. However, on the Signature debit, or what we refer to as Visa Debit, I can tell you that our business has, since the implementation of the rules, I think in prior quarters, we have experienced solid mid-single digit growth. And that growth rate is on balance, drifting a little north in the most recent quarter.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","Okay, great. Yes, in terms of the way growth trends are generally playing out in the month of October, MasterCard today indicated growth improvement outside of the U.S., and generally, stability in the U.S. Are you taking somewhat of a more cautious stance on the recent growth trends, or is your view fairly consistent with the way MasterCard characterized it earlier today?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, they have an eloquent way of stating things, as you've mentioned before. But I wouldn't say we're copying MasterCard. I'd say our growth in the United States, particularly in the credit business, which is our highest-yielding business, is significantly stronger than any of our competition, and it continues to grow. And I mentioned that in my remarks earlier. We have strong growth outside of the United States as well. MasterCard deals in Europe, and we don't. They have quite a bit of strength in Europe, but our Asian and Latin American businesses are growing at very robust rates. We continue to believe that we'll have more than 50% of our revenue coming from outside the United States in a very short period of time. I think that there is tough competition to deal with. I mean, I don't think there's any question about that, but we're doing very well. And in the parts of the world in which we do business, we are competitively advantaged, and we intend to maintain that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just looking at the Rest of World, it was a little bit lower than we expected. I think you mentioned maybe Asia was -- and obviously looking at the numbers, it looked like Asia was a little bit slower. But can you talk about the Rest of World? Was that all economy that's causing the deceleration? Is there any contract losses we should know about? And then secondly, on the international revenue growth, it was a little lower than we expected. Byron, maybe you can just help me through that again because I know cross-border was up 7%, so it's a little bit below cross-border growth. And usually, international revenue growth sometimes is above cross-border.","Byron H. Pollitt","Okay. So I would say in looking over the Rest of World that there were no contract losses material to speak of. In fact, I can't even think of one. So it's much more economic. And as we look at kind of the cross-border as well as the domestic spend inside the Rest of World countries, both of them put on the brakes a bit. Now recognize, Brian, these are still, for the most part, robust growth rates with that we would love to aspire to here in the United States. But in terms of feeling light there, at least in the fourth quarter, there was a bit of a downshift that's -- I think it's economically driven. And with regards to just -- I know 4 weeks does not a trend make, but October was a bit encouraging as it looks like there was a bit of a bounce back in the month of October as it relates to Rest of World cross-border, as well as Rest of World processed transactions, both of which we have real-time visibility too. With regards to international revenue. Let's see. We had nominal cross-border growth of 7%, and we had international fee growth of 5%. And if I look back over the last 3 or 4 quarters, there is always kind of plus or minus 2 or 3 percentage points of noise. I don't think there is any particular callout as I look at the drivers of international fees. It's just -- so I think we're pretty close to the nominal cross-border growth and no real callouts.","Operator","Our next question is from David Hochstim of Buckingham Research.","David S. Hochstim - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated","I wondered can you just maybe put a little more color on what you're seeing in the way of spending in Asia and the U.S.? Any changes in behavior, consumers or corporate customers in terms of the spending mix plus T&E?","Joseph W. Saunders","There has been a clear increase over the year credit spending of more affluent people. A lot of what's going on even in the U.S. economy is driven by consumer spending, as I'm sure you know as well or better than I do. And I think that most of these things have exhibited some sustainability. There are different blips in a few countries around the world and in Asia in particular that are associated with specific events. Some of the noise between China and Japan has hurt some of the volume between those 2 countries in the cross-border volume and the payment volume in particular. And there have been other examples of similar situations. On the bias, though, things are proceeding as well as we expected given the overriding macroeconomic situation. And we're very happy where we wound up in 2012, including the fourth quarter, and we'll have to go from there. As Byron said earlier and as I said, we can't totally avoid what's going on in the global economy. But I think that the -- we're certainly positioned to do well next year.","Operator","Our next question is from Ken Bruce of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question relates specifically to V.me, and I recognize that it's early days. You gave some very encouraging information earlier. I was wondering if you could maybe provide some insight as to what you think it will take to close the gap on the remaining top 10 issuers? And separately, if you think that either 2013 guidance already incorporates some of the pickup in spending on V.me, or if you think that's really more of a 2014 and forward event, please.","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, the answer to the last part of the question first, I think, is more of a 2014 event. I mean, going back to the Internet, there were $327 billion spent on the -- or, excuse me, there was $226 billion spent in 2012. People expect that to move to $327 billion by 2016, which I mentioned in my earlier comments. We have a extraordinarily significant share of that volume. It is the fastest-growing category we have without V.me. And I think V.me will enable us to increase our share of the transactions. So not only are we going to be dealing in a category that's increasing, and even though that category may be taking some sales away from in-store sales, I think we will get a larger share of those sales than we have in the past. Any time you do something like we're doing with V.me, it's a chicken-and-egg kind of a thing. What comes first, all the merchants or all the customers? We're running at a pretty rapid rate as it relates to putting both on, and I think we'll have a successful start-up this holiday season. I think that by the middle of the year, we will have a much more robust environment. And by the -- and by a year from now, we'll be poised to take significant advantage of what we've done. As it relates to closing the gap in the top 10, I don't like to speak for my customers before they speak for themselves. But I am looking forward to and I think you could legitimately look forward to hearing a lot more about new additions in the very near future.","Operator","Our final question will be from Craig Maurer of CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","Couple of questions. One, are there any unique or specific profit aspirations for V.me other than gaining share in e-commerce? And secondly, decoupled debit, TSYS commented that their fastest-growing debit customer now is a decoupled debit customer. And it's pretty clear to us that the MCX merchants are going to launch with decoupled debits. So my question is, has something changed in decoupled debits since Capital One failed at that attempt 2 years ago that would make you a bit more nervous of that product?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, I don't think anything that I'm aware of has happened that should precipitate that. And, of course, that failed because they couldn't bundle transactions. They had to have specific -- they had to be able to specifically list each transaction, which they were unable to do. As it relates to MCX, I mean, I think they have lofty aspirations, and they probably have a lot of horsepower to work with. I think we're aware of what we're doing, and -- I mean, we're aware of what they're doing, and they're aware of what we're doing. And we're working hard to compete. And I don't think that, that in itself is going to define who Visa is or isn't in the near- or the moderate-term.","Jack Carsky","And with that, ladies and gentlemen, thank you, all, for your participation today.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us.","It is clear from our strong results today that the business continues to perform well as we simultaneously invest to deliver growth in the medium to long term. Given that it was a busy quarter, I\u2019m going to streamline my comments on the business performance and only offer a few headlines; then, I\u2019ll discuss how we are enhancing our capabilities through our recent acquisitions and investments; and finally, I\u2019ll review our progress in building partnerships around the globe with FinTechs as well as our traditional clients.","So, let\u2019s start with our third quarter results. Revenue growth was better than expected at 11% or 13% on a constant dollar basis. Payments volume growth was 9% on a constant dollar basis or almost 10% excluding China, which continued to be impacted by some runoff of our dual branded cards that captured domestic volumes and had limited impact on our revenue. Cross border growth rebounded up 3 points from last quarter and client incentives were lower than anticipated.","Processed transaction growth accelerated to 12%. Adjusted expense growth was 10%, reflecting marketing investments, the impact of the new revenue accounting standard, and a number of nonrecurring items. And adjusted EPS growth was 14%, lapping a low adjusted tax rate of 18% last year. Vasant will share more details in his remarks.","As we look ahead to the future, we\u2019re pursuing our strategy by A, investing in growing and enhancing our network, including capturing new payment flows, building out our acceptance footprint and expanding our base of clients. We\u2019re building our arsenal of value-added capabilities that could be components on our network or on other networks, what we call network-agnostic, and see we\u2019re fortifying key bedrock pillars of the business, talent, technology, security, and the brand.","Against this backdrop, this quarter, we announced several strategic acquisitions and investments that will accelerate our progress in capturing new payment flows and extend the boundaries of our capabilities and our network.","First, we assume control of Earthport in early May and are pleased to say that as of July 4th, we\u2019ve obtained full legal ownership. Earthport provides cross-border payment services via network that connects with local ACH system with direct connections in 88 countries. Before Earthport, through our Visa Direct capabilities, our debit credentials and ATM network, Visa could reach about half of the bank accounts. With Earthport, we\u2019ve become a network of networks and have extended reach to over 99% of bank accounts in the 88 countries including the top 50 markets.","Our integration efforts are well underway and we are actively working to launch our first, fully integrated experience, prior to the calendar year-end, which will provide a single connection for clients to push funds to cards via VisaNet and bank accounts via Earthport.","Also in the quarter, we announced the acquisitions of Verifi and tokenization business from Rambus, which will help us in our development of network agnostic services, and will be integrated with our existing suite of tokenization, fraud management and risk solutions. This tokenization acquisition will enable Visa to extend the security and convenience of tokenization to all types of transactions including the ability to support domestic card network, account-based and real-time payment systems. Before this acquisition, Visa could turn a 16-digit Visa credential into a token, but now we can tokenize a bank account, a domestic card network credential or a ticket.","Verifi\u2019s best in class dispute resolution tools enable issuers to connect with merchant\u2019s data immediately, when a consumer calls to dispute a transaction, so that the issue is settled within one phone call. Verifi is the industry leader with 25,000 merchant connections helping to decrease the time spent on resolution, while at the same time decreasing the percentage of chargebacks. Verifi adds to existing Visa tools, which are aimed at reducing customer friction across the entire payment experience.","Last week, we announced the acquisition of Payworks, a point of sale software solution, which enables acquirers to support merchant terminal payments via the cloud. This enables merchants to seamlessly and quickly implement new functionalities such as adding new payment types, thereby creating better customer experiences and lower merchant operating costs.","Payworks will add in-store payment processing to CyberSource\u2019s InComm ecommerce payments platform to create a fully integrated omnichannel payment acceptance solution. As part of CyberSource\u2019s solution to acquire, these capabilities will be white label to drive more innovation in the payments ecosystem.","Across Southeast Asia, we have partnered with and invested in Gojek, a ride-hailing service that has become a mobile Super Approximately, featuring over 18 different verticals spanning payments, delivery, laundry cleaning, tickets and more. To give you a sense of the magnitude of Gojek, they have 108 million app downloads and half have been used in the payment service, GoPay. We\u2019re working together to make digital payments easier for both GoPay and Visa users while expanding to new use cases.","In the B2B space, we recently announced an investment in PayMate, a leading B2B payments FinTech in India who we have been partnering with in India and our CEMEA region since last year. PayMate operates a portal, connecting 35,000 buyers and suppliers to provide buyers with a consolidated view of their accounts payable across all payment types. Through the use of Visa credentials, buyers and suppliers have access to better reconciliation data.","Our partnership and investment seek to drive incremental volume to our network by helping big and small businesses bring more efficiencies to their payment processes as well as transition from cash and checks to digital payments via a Visa credential.","Visa Direct continues to deliver transaction growth of over 100% and opens up opportunities for additional payment flows. In the U.S. alone, over the last 12 months, more than 60 million Visa credentials have sent or received funds via Visa Direct, 75% of which have completed more than one transaction using Visa credentials. About 70% of these users have received funds which can drive additional spend in our C2B.","In cross-border remittance, we\u2019ve announced a new strategic relationship with Western Union. Western Union adds to our growing list of partners in this area, including MoneyGram, Remitly and EMQ, allowing their customers to make cost-effective cross-border payments through Visa credential with speed, convenience and transparency.","In addition to cross-border remittance, Visa Direct has also grown in the insurance disbursement space. Today 5 of the top 10 insurance companies in the United States either are using or in the process of enabling Visa Direct to facilitate quick and secure claims payout to their customers. In Europe, we recently added our first insurance use case with Insurance-as-a-Service provider Setoo in partnership with SafeCharge, a global payment service provider.","Another disbursement use case that is gaining traction is small business merchant settlement, which allows acquirers to transfer funds in real time at the request of the merchant, helping with cash flow needs of small businesses. Visa Direct is enabling the recent launch of Instant Transfer by PayPal in Canada, in addition to the United States for same-day settlements to small businesses and individual consumers. As we continue to drive new and existing payment flows, we remain focused on providing exemplary user experiences to ensure that Visa remains the preferred way to pay.","Tap to pay significantly improves the point-of-sale experience, and consumers are adopting it quickly. This quarter outside the United States tap to pay surpassed 50% of face-to-face transactions that run over our network, up from less than 30% just three years ago. There are now almost 50 countries where contactless is at least a third of all face-to-face transactions, up from 35 countries at the end of last fiscal year in September. We know that when contactless is introduced to a market, it increases the number of transactions For instance, this past quarter, while UK payments volume grew in the low to mid single digit, processed transactions grew much faster in the double digits. Transaction growth was 2.5 times the rate of payments volume growth and consumers made more small dollar tap to pay transactions with their Visa card instead of cash. Canada has also seen a similar dynamic. ","In the United States, we\u2019re well underway to reaching 100 million tap to pay Visa cards in force by the end of 2019, and early adoption is similar to what we\u2019ve seen in other successful tap to pay markets. We expect to surpass 3 million Visa cards by the end of 2020.","As we discussed previously, transit continues to be one of the best ways to habituate the use of tap to pay. The New York MTA launched an open loop payments -- a pilot on May 31st in a limited number of stations as part of an 18-month rollout and the results to-date have been very encouraging.","Other areas where we\u2019re making progress to improve the user experience include tokenization, secure remote commerce, and the installation payment solution we are piloting. All of these enhancements reflect a fundamental truth that is simple, consistent, secure and frictionless user experience leads to incremental volume and transactions.","We know that it takes strong partnerships across the ecosystems to deliver these great user experiences. Therefore, we are actively listening to client and customers\u2019 needs, and working to support their success. Partnerships are not simply additive to our business model, they are fundamental to our business model, whether it\u2019d be our traditional financial institutions or FinTechs.","And on FinTechs, they continue to be key enablers around the world and helping to expand access to electronic payments and opening up new acceptance. And these are the natural partner because we bring global scale, a recognizable brand, security, reliability, and sophisticated capability.","This quarter was no exception in our ability to develop partnerships with FinTechs. So, I\u2019d like to highlight a few. In India, we launched a co-brand credit card with the largest cab app aggregator, Ola Cabs; and SBI Card, the second largest credit card issuer in the country. With a simplified application process and a seamless card management through their app, this product will offer a rich reward proposition across all those 150 million users.","Across Asia Pacific, we\u2019ve partnered with Razer, a global lifestyle brand for gamers with 60 million users to offer a prepaid credential in the Razer Pay e-wallet. In Latin America, Rappi, a leading on-demand delivery platform is now using Visa debit card as the preferred way for its customers to pay in Colombia, Mexico, and soon also in Brazil. They\u2019ve also implemented CyberSource solutions across their seven operating markets to drive more secure and seamless transactions. Rappi currently has more than 20 million registered users and 90,000 delivery drivers who fulfill close to 5 million orders a month.","In Turkey, we partnered with one of the largest FinTech, ininal, in an effort to reach the 40% of the Turkish population that is unbanked with the launch of a nationwide program for general purpose, reloadable Visa prepaid card.","We\u2019re also excited about the opportunities these new partnerships could bring for sure, but we also continue to build deepen relationships with our more traditional merchants and issuers, and I will call out four this quarter.","In Europe, we renewed the credit and commercial portfolios with Bank Leumi, the largest bank in Israel; and Cr\u00e9dit Mutuel, one of the largest issuers in France. Across Europe, our deal volume and win rate is significantly higher on a year-to-year basis -- year-over-year basis.","In Brazil, we teamed up with Itau and MercadoLibre to launch a contactless cobranded card targeting MercadoLibre consumers with installment capability and a unique app for managing loyalty points. MercadoLibre has 38 million buyers in Latin America and Brazil, representing 60% of their marketplace\u2019s volume.","In the United States, we\u2019re pleased to announce that we have extended our longstanding partnership with JPMorgan Chase through the end of 2029. This long-term extension will enable us to work together to accelerate the growth of electronic payments, deliver enhanced payment experiences, such as our recent collaborations to enable tap to pay in the New York City subway system. Additionally, we work together to support and innovate our world-class co-brand partners and to further extent into the commercial space with B2B solutions.","Our pipeline of partnerships is robust, and we expect to sign several other significant renewals and new deals in the remainder of this fiscal year.","So, in summary, it was an exciting quarter for Visa with strong results, strategic acquisitions and growth in partnerships. As we look ahead, our focus continues to be expanding our network with a wide variety of new payment flows and acceptance options; growing our value-added services portfolio to enhance all networks, not just Visa\u2019s; investing in foundational elements that make Visa a world class partner, superior talent, innovative and reliable technology, unmatched security and a powerful brand. We remain open minded, innovative and flexible to meet the needs of the growing ecosystem in a rapidly evolving payments landscape as we\u2019re committed to our goal to be the best way to pay and be paid to everyone everywhere.","Now, let me turn it over to Vasant.","Vasant Prabhu","Thank you, Al.","Despite strong currency headwinds, our business trends accelerated in the third quarter, as net revenue and EPS growth were both higher than expected. Net revenue grew over 11% on a nominal dollar basis and over 13% in constant dollars, while adjusted EPS grew 14% in nominal dollars and approximately 18% on a constant dollar basis. Through three quarters of fiscal 2019, net revenue is up 11% and adjusted EPS up 17% in nominal dollars, and over 12% and 19%, respectively, in constant dollars.","A few highlights: Growth across all key business drivers, payments volume, process transactions and cross-border volume accelerated from last quarter. Payments volume growth in constant dollars improved to 9%. Global constant dollar growth excluding China and the UK was over 10%. Chinese domestic volumes are impacted by dual valid cards, which have minimal revenue impact. The UK economy remains weak due to Brexit uncertainty; ex-UK global payments volume trends remain robust.","Processed transaction growth accelerated to 12%, primarily due to faster U.S. growth and a full quarter of processing gains in Argentina. Adjusting for cross-border volume within Europe, constant dollar cross-border growth was 9%, up almost 4 points from last quarter, exceeding our expectations. As a reminder, cross-border volume within Europe has revenue yields similar to Europe domestic volumes and continues to be impacted by e-commerce platform, reorienting within the EU. Growth was consistently strong each month after factoring Easter timing in April, and the improvement from last quarter was broad based.","Every region\u2019s outbound growth improved by at least 1 point, mostly benefiting Europe and U.S. inbound volume. Net revenue growth was 11.4%, despite 2 points of exchange rate drag and the lowest currency volatility we\u2019ve seen in five years. Growth was helped by stronger cross-border momentum and lower client incentives than expected. The impact of pricing was higher than last quarter.","Client incentives were better-than-expected due to lower incentives for some deals and program than we had estimated, lower volumes in some markets and some deal delays. At this point, we have a very robust pipeline of significant renewals and new deals that we expect to get done by the end of our fiscal year.","We have closed on Earthport and Payworks as well as signed definitive agreements to acquire two other companies. These acquisitions significantly enhance our capabilities, extending our reach to over 99% of global bank accounts in 88 markets, facilitating tokenization of all types of transactions beyond our own, streamlining dispute resolution and enabling omnichannel payment processing through CyberSource. We expect all these acquisitions to close before the end of the year. ","We also added significant new partners, like Gojek, MercadoLibre and Ola Cabs while renewing our enduring partnership with JPMorgan Chase through 2029. We repurchased 12.9 million shares of stock-based common stock at an average price of one $163.59 for $2.1 billion in the first fiscal quarter. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, we returned $2.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter. ","Now, some details on our key business drivers. Payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis accelerated to 9%, credit was up 7%, debit was up 11%. Growth remained strong in most parts of the world with CEMEA growing 22%, Latin America 16%, Asia Pacific excluding China, growing almost 10% and Europe excluding the UK, growing 12%.","U.S. payments volume growth was 9%, up 1 point from last quarter. The improvement was driven by the timing of Easter as well as higher consumer credit growth. Fuel prices were ultimately a drag on growth in the quarter as the strong start in April faded in May and June. Double-digit growth was sustained in debit at 11% with Visa Direct contribution similar to last quarter. Credit grew 7% as the impact of the Cabela\u2019s conversion continued and we start to lap commercial card wins from last year.","International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 9%, growth in CEMEA remained robust at 22% with strong momentum across Russia, the Middle East and Africa. Latin America growth accelerated 2 percentage points to 16%, driven by improvements in Brazil and Mexico. Growth in the UK remained weak. However, growth in the rest of Europe accelerated to 12% with particular strength in Central and Eastern Europe. Asia Pacific growth excluding China was almost 10%, in line with last quarter.","Processed transaction growth of 12% is up 1 point from last quarter. Growth in the U.S. accelerated almost 1 point, in line with volumes. Also helping growth was a processing gain in Argentina, which had a full quarter impact. Growth improved in Brazil and was stable in Europe, Asia Pacific and CEMEA. After getting off to a strong start in April, mostly due to Easter timing, cross-border volume growth remained healthy through the quarter, resulting in 7% growth on a constant dollar basis, up 3 points from last quarter. Constant dollar growth adjusted for cross-border volume within Europe was 9%, up 4 points from last quarter with strength across both travel-related online spending. Of the 4-point improvement, approximately 1 point was driven by the lack of cryptocurrency drag that impacted each of the past two quarters due to the spike in cryptocurrency purchases in late 2017 and early 2018. Another couple of points was driven by broad-based spend increases. Outbound commerce accelerated from Canada, Japan, Australia and across most of Latin America and our CEMEA region. Europe was the biggest beneficiary of inbound commerce with growth in the mid-teens.","Moving on to a quick summary of third quarter financial results. Net revenue grew at a better than expected 11.4%, driven by higher processed transaction and cross-border volume growth as well as lower client incentives. This growth rate includes a 2-point headwind from exchange rate shift and a sizable drag from low currency volatility. The adoption of ASC-606 lifted revenue by approximately 1.5 points. Service revenue grew 10%, benefiting from pricing. Data processing revenues were up 13%. International revenue increased 8% with pricing actions and a favorable country mix, i.e., slower growth within Europe being significantly offset by lower currency volatility. Other revenue grew 49%, a little over half of which is driven by the adoption of ASC-606 and the remainder a result of clients increasingly utilizing our value-added service capabilities.","Incentives as a percent of gross revenues of 20.9% were lower than we expected this quarter due to lower incentives for some deals and programs, some deal delays, and lower volumes in some parts of the world. We expect to see an uptick in incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the fourth quarter, based on the deals just completed in the third quarter and the current pipeline of significant new deals and renewals expected to be signed in Q4.","Operating expenses declined 18% on a GAAP basis due to the litigation provision last year associated with the interchange multi-district litigation. Excluding the special items, expenses grew 10%, primarily driven by marketing costs, a number of non-recurring expenses captured in G&A and technology-related investments driving growth in network processing and depreciation expenses. Marketing expenses grew 18%, driven by investments related to the FIFA Women\u2019s World Cup and the adoption of ASC-606.","General and administrative expenses grew 37%, primarily due to several non-recurring items, ASC-606 impacts, and indirect taxes. The adoption of ASC-606 added approximately 2.5 points to expense growth.","Non-operating expenses were $78 million higher than last quarter, as investment gains were $9 million in the third quarter versus $84 million in the second quarter. Year-to-date, we have recorded $89 million in investment gains or over $0.03 of EPS, largely due to the change in accounting rules. As you know, this is a non-recurring item. We continue to benefit from higher interest income on our cash balances as well as from forward contracts swapping some of our U.S. dollar debt to euro-denominated debt, which reduces our interest expense.","Moving now to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the entire fiscal year 2019. First, let me share our business driver growth for the first three weeks of July, which are relatively consistent with the third quarter. Through July 21st, U.S. payments volume growth was 8% with U.S. credit growing 7% and debit over 9%. Processed transactions grew 11%, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 8% or over 9% excluding cross-border volume within Europe. Our fourth quarter outlook assumes growth trends across our key business drivers, in line with what we experienced in the third quarter. The exchange rate drag is expected to ease to 1.5 points on net revenues. Currency volatility will likely remain a significant headwind. The impact of pricing will be higher than Q3. Based on our current deal pipeline and the recognition of deals signed in this quarter, we expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to be 1.5 to 2 points higher than Q3. When you put all this together, we expect fourth quarter net revenue growth to be moderately better than the third quarter.","On the expense front, we continue to invest in our growth programs. Fourth quarter expense growth is likely to be in the mid to high single digit range. The fourth quarter will include a full quarter of expenses including integration costs and purchase accounting for Earthport and for Payworks, which closed last week. The exchange rate drag on EPS will ease to 2 points. We expect the acquisitions of Verifi and the tokenization business of Rambus to close during our fourth quarter. Depending on timing, they could add a small amount of revenue and 1 point to 2 points to our expense growth. When we report our fourth quarter results, we will quantify the revenue and EPS impact of all four acquisitions.","We are updating our full-year fiscal year 2019 outlook, on net revenue growth, low double digits on a nominal basis with approximately 1.5 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact and over 1 percentage point of positive impact from the new revenue accounting standard. The change in the ASC-606 impact is driven by deals that were not anticipated at the beginning of the fiscal year. Client incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the 21.5% to 22% range; expense growth in the low single digit decrease on a GAAP basis; and an approximately 10% increase adjusted for special items in fiscal 2018, including approximately 2.5 percentage-point increase from the new revenue accounting standard; effective tax rate in the 19.5% to 20% range; EPS growth low 20s on a GAAP nominal dollar basis, and mid to high teens on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis, including approximately 2 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact. We have several acquisitions that will be completed this year. As I mentioned earlier, we will quantify for you the revenue and EPS impact inclusive of integration costs and purchase accounting on our fourth quarter results. We will also give you our best estimates for the revenue and EPS impact of these acquisitions on fiscal year 2020 when we provide our 2020 outlook in October.","In summary, business momentum accelerated in the third quarter. We exceeded our revenue and EPS expectations, despite strong headwinds from currencies. More importantly, we are substantially enhancing our capabilities through four acquisitions, new strategic partnerships and significant renewals of longstanding relationships with several key renewals and new deals to be executed in the fourth quarter. We continue to invest at a healthy clip to drive long-term growth and capture the extraordinary opportunities available to us to drive payments digitization globally.","With that, I\u2019ll turn this back to Mike.","Mike Milotich","We are now ready to take questions, Jordan.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jim Schneider","I was wondering if you could provide any more detail on the extension of the JPMorgan partnership. Whether there is any substantial change in the terms of that agreement outside of the length and in terms of the scope, anything that would show up in the economics of the business going forward? Any color around that would be very helpful. Thank you.","Al Kelly","Thanks, Jim. We\u2019re obviously not going to discuss the details of it. I think, both companies are very satisfied with it. JPMorgan is a big and sophisticated issuer. And I think as I talked to the senior leadership team there, we thought it was a good idea to renew our deal and kind of focus on all the various things that are happening in payments and make sure that we weren\u2019t distracted by a negotiation that would happen over the next year or two. I\u2019m not going to add much more color than that.","Mike Milotich","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller","Thanks, guys. Look, it\u2019s great to hear the momentum in the pipeline on the wins and renewals, including obviously the JPM deal. It sounded like you were saying out that the win rate, especially in Europe, is stronger than before. And I guess, first of all, is there anything that\u2019s changed in terms of why you think you are winning at this rate? Is it actually better than it was before? And then, maybe just comment on even in the back of that how rebates and incentives, the guide is actually a little bit lower than it was before, despite these renewals in this pipeline? Thanks, guys.","Al Kelly","I\u2019d say a couple of things, and I\u2019ll let Vasant talk a little bit about the incentive. First of all, in Europe, we\u2019re now on our front foot. We are past the integration. We\u2019ve got our management team in place. We\u2019re not all the way there, but we\u2019ve been moving more resources into the markets. And we\u2019ve been able to focus much more on running a very good commercial organization in Europe. And I think that it really is starting to pay dividends to be able to be not distracted by any of the integration activities.","I think, the second thing that\u2019s happening in Europe but is also happening around the world is that we\u2019ve gotten our act together as it relates to FinTechs. I\u2019d be the first to admit, I think we were a little bit slow out of the chute a year and a half ago. But over the last five quarters or so, we\u2019ve been very, very focused on FinTechs and making sure that we are easy to do business with, easy to integrate with, easy to get on-boarded. And I think that FinTechs appreciate the various assets that Visa brings to the table from our global reach to our fabulous brand to a lot of our experience and capabilities and our scale.","So, I think that those would be the two big factors that would come to mind for me when I think about your question about what is different recently. I don\u2019t know if Vasant wants to add to that or certainly talk about the client incentives.","Vasant Prabhu","I think on the client incentives front, there is a variety of reasons why they\u2019re running lower than we might have expected. Several items that are good things where some -- we make estimates on the terms under which deals might be renewed, and in some cases we haven\u2019t had to use up the incentives we thought we might have needed to when we sort of gave you a general view of things. So that\u2019s a good thing and that is actually permanent and continues. Secondly, volumes have been lower in some parts of the world and that does lead to lower incentives. Thirdly, exchange rates that impact the gross revenue line, as you know, help the incentive lines. So, to some degree that is reflected also when you do a year-over-year comparison. And then, as it relates to the wins, which we\u2019re very -- as we said, we\u2019re very happy about what has already happened, but we also have a very robust pipeline, many of which we will be able to tell you about next quarter, and a lot of that is incorporated into our outlook for the fourth quarter. Those wins, they play out over time. The volume comes in over time and the incentives will play out over time. So, you won\u2019t see the impacts right away. So, those are some of the reasons.","And in terms of sort of the activity now and the things and their contribution to volume, as you know conversions take time, they play out over time. So, the volume will sort of layer in over a year or two. So, you won\u2019t see the full impact for at least a couple of years from things that we are winning right now.","Mike Milotich","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi. Good morning, guys. Question about the strategy, Al, that you talked about with the acquisitions of Earthport and Rambus, and some of the other organic investments. You\u2019ve highlighted that you are adding more of these network of network type of services that extend beyond the boundaries of VisaNet. Can you just talk a bit about this strategy more broadly, meaning like what market opportunity specifically are you going after, and is this sort of ancillary to the core business or do you expect it to become more core over time? And then, finally, how do you think about maintaining the quality of the Visa network and brand, as you sort of extend and expand into the sort of network of network model?","Al Kelly","Thanks, Lisa. So, today, we process about three quarters of the transactions that have the Visa brand on the credential being used, whether it\u2019s a virtual credential or a real card. We recognize that there are other situations where we may not be able to process, whether it\u2019s a real-time payment network that a country decides to build out or a domestic card network, payments network that somebody decides to build out. And when we look at those kinds of networks, we see a lack of sophistication in some of the capabilities. And we believe that we have an opportunity to take our toolbox of capabilities and provide additional value to those networks, either on a licensing type basis or pay-as-you-go type basis. And I see it as very additive to our ability to grow the Company and grow revenue and be involved in as many transactions in some way, shape or form as we possibly can. In no way are we stepping back from continuing to invest in VisaNet. It is a very important asset for us. And we have a number of projects ongoing right now. And we will continue to make sure that VisaNet is the best possible network in the world in terms of capabilities and in terms of security and in terms of reliability, all of which are very, very important.","Vasant Prabhu","Yes. I mean, if you look at each of these -- you look at Verifi, it clearly enhances our network because we can streamline dispute resolution on our network, but it\u2019s also network agnostic. And therefore, we can help other networks also provide or streamline dispute resolution. And it not only takes a lot of the time and cost out of it, but is a much better consumer experience. So, there\u2019s value, both to our network as well as the ability to go beyond our network.","If you look at Earthport, clearly that allows us to substantially enhance our reach. And to the extent that a portion of how we get the money from point A to point B might not be on our network, does not mean that it isn\u2019t a Visa-branded transaction with all the security reliability et cetera that our brand offers. And so, it allows us to be a network agnostic where it makes sense to be network agnostic in the interest of serving our customers.","And then, if you go to Payworks, CyberSource now has a substantially enhanced capability to serve what is an incredibly high demand, which is merchants\u2019 desire to approach their business in a omnichannel kind of way where they can see the customer at the same time between both their online business and their in-store business. So, in every case, it enhances an existing business, but it also allows in every case the opportunity to extend our business beyond, let\u2019s say, our proprietary network.","Mike Milotich","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Hi, guys. Good afternoon. Al, just wanted to ask on Facebook\u2019s Libra. There is some confusion in the market on how to think about that. Is it a strategic partner for Visa or a potential disruptive threat? Just curious your thoughts and level of expected Visa involvement in Facebook Libra.","Al Kelly","So, Bryan, the first thing I\u2019d say, I think it\u2019s important to understand the facts here and not any of us get out ahead of ourselves. So, we have signed a nonbinding letter of intent to join Libra. We\u2019re one of, I think it\u2019s 27 companies that have expressed that interest. So, no one has yet officially joined. We\u2019re in discussions, and our ultimate decision to join will be determined by a number of factors including obviously the ability of the association to satisfy all the requisite regulatory requirements. So, Bryan, in my estimation, it\u2019s really, really early days, and there\u2019s just a tremendous amount to be finalized. But obviously, given that we\u2019ve expressed interest, we actually believe we could be additive and helpful in the association.","Mike Milotich","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thank you so much. Good to see the revenue acceleration. I wanted to ask also on M&A. So, you stepped up the number of deals, you said four. I think you did last year one deal. So, I\u2019m just curious, is the appetite for Visa to do more deals going forward. I\u2019m just curious if this is the maybe the new norm for deal activity. And separately, I just want to clarify, maybe with you, Vasant. Aside from FX accounting and the 606 accounting change and also tax, what\u2019s changed in your outlook, if you were to adjust for those items?","Al Kelly","Let me handle the first part and then I\u2019ll let Vasant, Tien-Tsin, answer the question that\u2019s directed to him. No, we have not changed our posture as it relates to M&A. And the reality is, when we see an asset that we think is going to add value or bring incremental value for our clients or they are our customers or our investors, we\u2019re going to pursue it. This quarter simply was a much busier one in terms of deals closed or deals where we reached definitive agreements.","Vasant Prabhu","In terms of outlook, Tien-Tsin, if you look at our guidance for the full year, our net revenue growth, it\u2019s changed -- it\u2019s unchanged in the low double digits. The FX impact, as you saw, was about 0.5-point higher than we had expected at the beginning of the year. And the accounting impact is also 0.5-point higher roughly. So, it\u2019s sort of a wash. So, the underlying revenue trends, low double digits and generally as good as we thought as you saw somewhat better in the third quarter. Client incentives, as you pointed out, have come down for all the reasons we talked about. Expenses, higher than we had expected at the beginning of the year; some of it is the accounting impact going up a bit; some of it is we\u2019ve continued to invest at a healthy clip. Tax rates, slightly lower than what we expected at the start of the year. And net-net, I think our EPS is starting from the mid -- I think they were mid-teens when we started; now, we are mid to high teens. Other than the fact that the cross-border business started the year softer than we expected but has picked up well, the other big thing that has sort of been negative is the fact that currency volatility, as I pointed out, is now running in the last quarter at the lowest levels we\u2019ve seen in five years, and that has continued into the fourth quarter. But that\u2019s fine. I mean, as you can see, we\u2019ve absorbed it pretty well. If currency volatility had not been this low, clearly, our international revenue growth would have been higher. So, it did have a decent impact on our international revenue growth. But despite all that and despite the currency headwinds being as high as they\u2019ve been, we\u2019re delighted that our nominal dollar growth is going to be in the low double digits.","Mike Milotich","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from David Koning from Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","David Koning","Yes. Hey, guys. Thanks. And I guess on days, I know, Q2 was a little light with Easter and processing days timing end of the quarter, Q3 picked up a little, and I think Q4 you actually get maybe another extra day. So, what I\u2019m wondering, you talked a little bit about U.S. decel through the first three weeks of July, and a little bit of transaction decel. But, do you actually pick back up because of the number of days in the quarter and get back to kind of more stable with fiscal Q3?","Vasant Prabhu","Yes. In terms of processing days, the easiest way to explain it to you is, this quarter was a normal number of processing days, last quarter was below normal, and next quarter is above normal. So, you\u2019re right, because of the way this quarter ended and next quarter is going to end, it will help us processing days wise in the way that processing days hurt us last quarter. This quarter was more normal. And as it relates to the three weeks, we always tell people three weeks don\u2019t make a trend. I wouldn\u2019t read too much into it. I think, our outlook is that the trends will be roughly in line with the third quarter. So, if something is slightly higher, slightly lower in the first three weeks, I don\u2019t think it tells you much.","Mike Milotich","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from our Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Harshita Rawat","Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. I want to ask about PSD2 the implementation deadline for Strong Customer Authentication this fall. So, my question is, how your thoughts evolving, and whether the current ecosystem in Europe is ready for this deadline, and what are the long-term benefits and trade-offs of this directive could be?","Al Kelly","Harshita, how are you? It\u2019s -- you are absolutely right that we\u2019ve been engaged actively with European and certain nation authorities and trade associations throughout Europe to raise awareness that we think less than half of the merchants are going to be ready by the deadline, which is September 14th when Strong Customer Authentication is supposed to get into place. We\u2019re certainly pleased that the European Banking Authority had a recent opinion that\u2019s going to allow for extensions as set by the local regulators. And I think that most everybody is going to largely kind of look to the -- aside from people not being in compliance. It\u2019s our understanding that regulators in the UK and France, for example, have already communicated that they are not going enforce the September deadline. It would be very, very bad for particularly small merchants. So, there is a reluctance to move the deadline date. But I think where we\u2019re landing is that people will look past it and allow for exceptions for some time to come.","In the meantime, we are working with merchants and issuers as much as we can to help them make sure they will be ready. We are also working on various solutions to help identify exempt to non-exempt transactions and trying to figure out how to optimize secure customer authentication. We\u2019ve got a Visa trusted listing capability, which allows consumers to identify merchants that frequently shop and therefore they trust them. There is a Visa delegated authorization that allows acquirers to identify merchants that already are performing strong authentication as spelled out in the regulation. So, there\u2019s any number of things we\u2019re doing to try to help merchants and issuers be ready. But, I think that this won\u2019t really come to the place where people will be required until we get well into 2020.","Mike Milotich","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar","Questions on B2B Connect that recently joined -- launched it globally. I know it\u2019s early days, but I was hoping to get a couple of things answered. First, it seems you are finding now what\u2019s looking like holistic offering, based on your organic and inorganic investments in the ecosystem. So, is that a fair assessment? And if not, what parts need to be added? And secondly, can you comment on any early traction you might be seeing in this area?","Al Kelly","It\u2019s just too early. We are just getting past the pilot stage. We\u2019re talking to various banks around the world about connecting. And I just don\u2019t expect to be able to share results probably for a good six months. I think it\u2019s going to take that long before we really see the traction with B2B Connect. So, there is still some technical work banks would have to do, and obviously still some sales work that has to be done to make sure that people understand the capability and what it can do.","Mike Milotich","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore. Your line is now open.","David Togut","Thanks. Good afternoon. Piggybacking a little bit on Ashwin\u2019s question, all three mega mergers this year in bank tech and payments have really highlight B2B payments as an important growth objective. And of course, you\u2019ve signed up FIS and Bottomline to B2B Connect and just closed Earthport. So, I\u2019m curious if you could expand upon your game plan, specifically to build out distribution into the enterprise B2B market, especially for cross-border, which you\u2019ve highlighted as a lucrative growth opportunity for Visa?","Al Kelly","Well, I think, David, you\u2019ve hit the nail on the head. I mean, the enterprise level volume that has traditionally been wires and check. This is going to require a whole different approach than the approach in the carded area where we rely on issuers and we rely on P-cards and corporate cards and small business cards and virtual cards, in order to be successful. In the enterprise space, you\u2019ve got to be integrated into some of the large enterprise systems and you\u2019ve got to build a network of partners that have the ability to generate the kinds of distribution with credibility that we need. So, we\u2019re going to continue to look for ways to build partnerships and look at investments, like the one we made in PayMate, and one that we made earlier in BillDesk. And we\u2019re going to continue to try to forge investments and distribution partnerships wherever we can because I think that\u2019s going to be a key to unlocking the volume in this -- the non-carded space of B2B.","Vasant Prabhu","Yes. I mean, our B2B strategy has many components and B2B Connect is one component. B2B Connect addresses, as you said, high-value transactions on a cross-border basis. Through Earthport and Visa Direct, we can address B2B transactions but low-value transactions that are high volume also on a cross-border basis. We also have initiatives that go beyond cross-border to domestic AR and AP. So, it\u2019s a broad range of things happening on multiple fronts. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve heard about our partnerships with Billtrust and so on that deal with AR. We have other partnerships that deal with AP. So, it\u2019s a variety of initiatives on multiple fronts.","As it relates to B2B Connect, since that was your question, we know that the value proposition is very strong. We bring settlement -- it addresses a whole bunch of pain points. We bring settlement capabilities, the security and reliability that doesn\u2019t exist today, we utilize distributed ledger technology, and we do tokenization to substantially enhance the security of the transaction. I think, as Al said earlier, with anything like B2B Connect, you have to get the network effect going. And that means having both ends represented at scale. That takes some time to develop, which is why as Al said, you have to wait for some time as we get both sides of the network pulled together and then the volumes build. We talked about that when we talked about contactless. There are two or three years where it all builds up and then it takes off. So, it will be some time before the network effect starts working for us in B2B Connect.","Mike Milotich","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. Good evening. I wanted to kind of just dovetail a little bit on all these discussions around these new payment flows globally. And the question is really twofold. One is, is there a need for investments, like sizable investments in the coming years to increase the scale opportunities for VisaNet? And then, secondly, Al, can you just talk a little bit about how you do think about security vulnerabilities, as you build out these networks? And your distribution points are clearly getting closer direct-to-consumer. Thank you.","Al Kelly","Dan, our new payment flows, clearly, there is always going to be investment to drive them to the level of scale that we won. I mean, in the last year plus, we\u2019ve greatly added to the resources in Visa Direct, which are all kinds of new payment flows into the various use cases that it\u2019s supporting. We\u2019ve obviously built out resources in the B2B business unit as we continue to explore that space. We\u2019ve got people. We\u2019ve had to add people to chase down all the various wallets that are out there in the world, not all of them with financial institutions, they are with all kinds of organizations like Gojek that I talked about in my remarks. So, I think from a technical standpoint -- I\u2019ll come to your security question in a second, from a technical standpoint, I think Visa Direct is, I\u2019m sorry VisaNet is able to handle these various use cases today. As we get into new ones, we may have to do some augmentation of VisaNet to make sure that we can handle a new use case that we might not have anticipated. But, I think, really the bigger challenge in the bigger area where we have to invest is simply getting feet on the street and getting people out there to understand what our capabilities are and realize that we could bring various solutions to them that they might not have anticipated. And clearly with the acquisitions and the nonbinding agreements that we\u2019ve talked about, we\u2019ve got new capabilities that we can bring to our clients all the new around the world that we have to go communicate. So, that\u2019s where I think the preponderance of the investment will be.","Security is something weighs on my mind all the time. We have an extraordinarily robust, and I\u2019m knocking wood as I say this, cybersecurity organization. We spend hundreds of millions of dollars. We have hundreds of people who work in the group. We\u2019re very conscious of anybody that -- any system or organization that in any way, shape or form is going to come anywhere near VisaNet, goes through incredible scrutiny in terms of their security. When we look at the acquisitions we\u2019re doing now, they will be integrated into VisaNet until we are completely and totally comfortable that we\u2019ve got their cybersecurity capabilities that where they need to be before we fully integrate them.","So, you never know, the bad guys are continuing to invest as much as the good guys. And we got to stay out ahead of it. We got to remain vigilant. And it\u2019s something that we at Visa believe that security is a critical underpinning of the trust in the payment ecosystem. And given our place in that ecosystem, we believe we have obligation to stay vigilant in our cybersecurity. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re pushing tokenization, so that we can devalue data. It\u2019s one of the reasons we\u2019re building Consumer Transaction Controls. So, consumers can have a role in protecting their security and their data and the use of their payment credentials over time. And we will -- this is an area we\u2019ll continue to invest a lot of money in.","Mike Milotich","Jordan, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from James Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","James Friedman","I just wanted to ask, Al, in your prepared remarks, you alluded to the used cases of tap-and-pay and the tax rate between transaction growth and volume growth, you referenced that 2.5 times accelerator in the UK. Is there anything unique about the UK market or do we think of that as a template of things to come? Thank you.","Al Kelly","Jamie, the only thing I can say and I think a bit unique or different about the UK market is that we have been in the transit system there for longer than we have in most other big markets around the world. And as I also said in my remarks, we are finding that transit is one of those things that really creates the habit and what people are commuting home -- to work and home 10 times a week, and they are tapping and get used to it. They realize and look to tap in all kinds of instances, particularly instances where heretofore they were using cash for lower ticket purchases. So, I think that as we continue to pursue the 200-plus transit projects that we have going on around the world, not certainly including the one I referenced in my remarks in terms of the MTA here in New York where we\u2019re seeing really nice results in just a kind of a seven-week period since we\u2019ve been up and running. I expect that in markets where we are able to penetrate the transit system and get high levels of adoption of tap-and-pay in general, I think, we\u2019ll see similar type of results. That said, we\u2019ll have to see how it plays out over time.","Mike Milotich","We\u2019d like to thank everyone for joining us today.

Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky","Thanks Nib. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s fiscal first quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa Inc.'s Chief Financial Officer.","This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for the 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website as well.","Let me also remind you that these presentations may include forward-looking statements.

I am going to start with a series of comments both about the quarter and a little bit about what we're seeing in the world and then I'll pass it over to Vasant before we take questions.","First a few comments about the overall results. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company given the ongoing macroeconomic headwinds that we have discussed before. Operating revenue grew 5% nominally or 8% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative three percentage point impact from FX.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 10%, volume growth continued at a healthy pace, growing 11.5% in constant dollars only down slightly from September's 12% growth. U.S. payments volume growth was essentially flat at about 10%, again healthy growth.","International payment's volumes growth was 14% down one point from last quarter, but we continue to see weakness in cross border volume. U.S. outbound spend is strong, but it was offset by continued weakness from Canada, Brazil and Russia and more recently we're seeing increasing weakness in the Middle East and China.","We do see some areas of strength such as Mexico, Japan and New Zealand, but they're obviously smaller markets for us.","Now a couple of words about the U.S. holiday season; overall consumer spending by our Visa Cardholders during the season was similar to last year, but spending patterns are changing.","Ecommerce continue to grow at a much higher rate than the spending at physical stores. We saw mid teens eCommerce growth during the holiday period versus mid single digits growth in the physical world. More than 25% of all spending on Visa Cards during November and December was online up from less than 20% just three years ago.","Also the pattern of spending during the holidays has changed, while Black Friday and Cyber Monday remain important shopping days, less spending is consolidated on these two days than recent years and more people delay their spending to later in the season this year.","Let me move on and say a couple of words about Visa Europe. We're making very good progress. We continue to work towards a projected second calendar quarter closing. We received two of three required regulatory approvals with the third one that's required from the European Commission.","Vasant will discuss it, but we feel very good about the execution of our $16 billion debt financing and most importantly we feel as good about the transaction today as the day we made our announcement.","We've had great interactions with our Visa European colleagues. We've had a series of very positive conversations with European financial institutions and we remain confident that we're creating value and are focused on execution at this point.","We move on to China now. We continue to work towards the ability to make a formal application. We're waiting for final regulations to be released. We have a clear path to have a complying operating environment. So we can compete domestically if we're awarded a license.","I was in China last week and participated in the signing of two MOUs. They involve Visa working with two Chinese groups on driving financial inclusion as a means to support property alleviation.","The strategic partnership and programs we announced, underscore our long-term commitment to China and to fulfilling the Chinese Government's goal of reducing property and promoting inclusive finance.","We also continue to collaborate with government institutions, industry organizations and NGOs to support the global goals of a alleviating property, promoting transparency and fostering inclusive social and economic development.","As we work through our plans for entry into the domestic Chinese marketplace, we continue to feel good about our ability to help expand the rate of growth of the Chinese economy and increase the Chinese bank's ability to compete domestically, especially in the eCommerce space.","Talk for a second about some client activity, in the United States, we expanded our relationship with Fidelity and U.S. bank where we are now the exclusive payment network for their co-brand card.","Card members can earn cash back with the Fidelity rewards Visa Signature Card and Fidelity Investments 529 College Rewards Visa Signature Card. The new cards in the program will be issued with chip technology for security and give access to the payment industry's leading digital wallets including Apple Pay, Samsung Pay and Android Pay.","Visa and Walmart announced an acceptance agreement with Sam\u2019s Club. Beginning next Monday more than 650 Sam's Clubs across the United States in Port Rico will begin accepting Visa credit cards in store.","Walmart.com and Samsclub.com will also begin supporting Visa checkout this year. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients around the world as well. Just a few notable highlights. We've seen very strong renewal activity across the world in places such as New Zealand, India, China and Latin America. Some names include ANZ New Zealand, ICCI Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank of China.","In Latin America we renewed a multiyear credit, debit and commercial agreement with BBBA, one of the largest issuers within our Latin American region. The deal covers seven markets including Chile, Peru, Venezuela, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina and Colombia and we renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with PREDESCO another one of our largest issuers in Latin America.","We talk say few words about Visa checkout we continued to be encouraged by the growth that we see since it was launched 18 months ago. We have more than $10 million registered users in 16 countries and over 600 financial institution partners participating globally.","More than 250,000 merchants including some of our largest global retailers have signed on to accept these Visa checkout representing a $100 billion in addressable volume.","Starbucks, Walgreens, NFL Shop, HSN and Match are among the new merchants taking advantage of Visa checkout's ability to deliver seamless digital payments and as I mentioned earlier, Walmart.com and samsclub.com will also begin supporting it this year.","Our confidence is Visa Checkout is based upon independent research that supports the nation that it makes commerce easier for consumers and ultimately results in increased sales for merchants. According to new independent research from TomScore, Visa Checkout significantly increases sales conversion.","Visa Checkout customers completed 86% of transactions compared to 73% for PayPal Express Checkout and 57% for the traditional merchant checkout. Visa Checkout customers are more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers and 95% of Visa checkout customers say sign up was easy and 96% feel secure making purchases with Visa Checkout.","We recently launched a new platform called Visa Commerce Network, built on the trail paid platform, which we acquired in 2015. Visa Commerce Network enables our merchants to deliver targeted discounts and benefits to Visa cardholders in order to acquire new customers and increase sales.","Visa cardholders receive these benefits seamlessly by simply using their Visa cards to make purchases. No coupons or codes are required. To-date more than a dozen leading merchants including Duck Donuts, Regal Entertainment Group, Shake Shack and others have successfully used Visa Commerce Network and we recently entered into a partnership with Uber.","Uber riders have started receiving discounted rides when they use their Visa Card at certain local retailers.","Say a couple of words about the migration to EMV in the United States. We reached an important milestone on October 1, which was the official kick off to chip in the U.S. We\u2019re optimistic about the progress and momentum we're seeing as banks issue more cards, merchants activate ship terminals and consumers increasingly make secure chip transactions.","Already there are more Visa chip cards issued in the U.S. then in any other country in the world. More than 200 million Visa chip cards were issued as of December 2015.","43% of all credit cards representing 72% of purchase volume, 21% of all debit cards representing 45% of purchase volume, over 750,000 merchant locations have enabled EMV representing 17% of the total face to face locations in the U.S. Based on our recent client survey we expect 50% of locations to be enabled by the end of this year.","While we know we have a long way to go over the next few years to reach the critical massive adoption that we desire, we feel very good about the progress today.","Now before I turn it over to Vasant, just a few comments about the environment. It\u2019s clearly a mixed bag but certainly creating some short term pressures for us. The headwinds we discussed last quarter continue and are probably slightly worse with little relief in sight in the short term.","As a reminder, they are the translation impact of the strong U.S. dollar, reduced cross-border volume driven by the strong dollar, continuing drag from lower oil prices and while we\u2019re believers in China for the long term the domestic volatility it's creating increased headwinds for us.","These headwinds are muting our growth today both through the translation effects as well as reduced business volumes and will likely continue for the foreseeable future, but our ability to grow over the long term will be driven by our continued strong underlying payment volume growth.","So, our mindset is that we have to be cautious in the short term due to the headwinds, but the long term fundamentals of our business volume growth remained strong.","And as I've said before, our business volumes can change quickly with changes in the U.S. dollar and domestic consumer confidence around the world, it\u2019s just hard to predict the timing.","Vasant will cover in more detail but even though there has been much talk over the past few weeks of the slowdown in the U.S., our business volumes in January have been strong.","So given all of this, our results are reasonably good, which speaks to the strength of our business model, our brand, our people, but do not reflect the long-term value of the franchise, but the pressure as we have seen we likely continue for the foreseeable future before abating.","Now over to Vasant.","Vasant Prabhu","Thanks Charlie. In a turbulent and uncertain global environment we're pleased to report that our business performed well in the first quarter as a result modestly ahead of our expectations.","A few highlights; net operating revenue was increased 8% in constant dollars, the exchange rate drag was three percentage points both in line with expectations.","Weaker than anticipated cross-border revenue was offset by lower than expected client incentive. Client incentives were lower due to software volumes in international markets and some deal delays.","Expenses only grew 2% well below the high single digit rate we had indicted. We have focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending program given the uncertain macroeconomic environment.","As the year progresses we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives are adequately funded. We mark down the value of the Visa Europe put from $255 million to zero since the VE Board, Visa Europe Board amended the put in connection with our proposed acquisition.","We are required to revalue the put each quarter. We are still awaiting regulatory clearance but expect to close the transaction in line with the transaction agreement leading us to load the value of the put, this non-cash non-operating gain added $0.10 to our reported earnings.","As a reminder should the deal not close, the put will be reinstated in its un-amended form and we will need to value this liability based on all available information at that point.","In December we issued $16 billion in debt with maturities ranging from 2 to 30 years. The weighted average interest rate was 3.08% with the weighted average maturity of 13.1 years. This is the low end of the 3% to 3.5% interest rate range we indicted last year.","We're pleased with this outcome. We will of course use the proceeds to fund the upfront cash consideration for the Visa Europe acquisition as well as to step up stock buybacks over the next five to six quarters to offset the dilutive impact of preferred stock that will issue to VE members.","For the next section now in place, we will have interest expenses of a $125 million each quarter almost $0.04 per share. In the first quarter we recorded interest expense of $24 million. We will incur the full $125 million interest expense in the second quarter with no offsetting benefit from Visa Europe operating income.","Finally we repurchased 25.7 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $78.52 was shared for a total of $2 billion. As we have indicated we stepped up the pace of our buybacks to make up for stock not purchased in the fourth quarter last year due to the impending Visa Europe transaction.","At the end of the quarter we had remaining authorization of $5.8 billion for stock repurchases. We've continued to be buying of our stock in January under our 10b5 programs.","Moving on to the quarter business drivers. Global payment volume growth in constant dollars for the December quarter continued to be strong at 11%, U.S. credit grew 9%, moderating one percentage point compared to the September quarter as the positive effects of Chase conversion have lapsed. U.S. debit grew 10%, up one percentage point benefitting from some interlinked gains.","Adjusted for conversion and the impact of gas prices, underlying growth in U.S. payment volume for both debit and credit have stayed very stable over the past several quarters.","In the quarter, the gas price drag was around one percentage point on credit and two percentage points on debit. In December, we lapsed the inflection point for gas price declines, which should help reported growth rates going forward, although gas prices will remain a modest drag since pricing is still below last year.","This is already evident in January U.S. aggregate payment volume numbers, which show a modest uptick of one percentage point to 11% through January 21. To date, macroeconomic weakness is not evident in U.S. consumer spending, but this could change as the year progresses.","International payment volume constant dollar growth of 14% was down one percentage point from the prior quarter. While 14% is a healthy level of growth, we have seen a step down in growth rate in Brazil, Russia and the Middle East as a result of the oil price collapse and weakness in commodity markets.","Growth has remained strong across Mexico and other parts of Latin America as well as parts of Asia like India. Of course the impact of the strong dollar on international payment volume has been significant with growth flat in nominal terms.","Cross-border volumes have been slowing for several quarters now. Cross-border growth continues to decelerate, dropping to 4% in the December quarter from 5% in the prior quarter.","In the past quarter, we saw a sharp slowdown in outbound commerce from China and the Middle East and the strong dollar continues to hurt commerce into the U.S. You might recall that we had expected cross-border trends to remain weak in the first half and I had hoped for some improvement in the second half of our fiscal year as comparisons became easier and\/or the dollar stabilized.","Given recent trends, that appears less likely due to the deceleration from oil linked and China linked economies. Through January 21, cross-border volume growth in constant dollars is running at 5%.","On the positive front, inbound commerce into Europe remains the strongest corridor, though this has also slowed due to China and the Middle East. Also closing of the Visa Europe transaction we'll begin to benefit from growth of commerce into Europe.","Transactions processed over VisaNet totaled 19 billion in the first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior period and unchanged from the September quarter. The U.S. delivered 11% growth and international growth was flat, both unchanged from the prior quarter.","As a reminder, the international growth rate is negatively impacted by the transfer of domestic processing in Russia that started at the end of April. Through January 21, processed transaction growth was 8% with a U.S. rate of 11% and flat into national growth.","Turning to our financial results, service revenues grew 7% in excess of nominal payment volume growth of 4%, helped by the pricing actions we took last year. Data processing revenues also grew 7%. Both were in line with our expectation.","International revenue growth dropped to 6% from 16% in the prior quarter. Currency volatility moderated substantially in the quarter reverting to the long-term mean. This drives most of the decline in the reported rate of growth.","The impact of the pricing actions we took last year was largely offset by the significant negative impact from exchange rate. While this sharp decline in the growth rate of international revenues was mostly expected, cross-border volumes were weaker as I mentioned earlier due to the China and the Middle East.","Exchange rates and revenues from currency volatility will continue to be a drag on reported international revenue growth through the year. Other revenues were down 3% primarily as a result of low license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payment volume growth.","As it became clear that the global economy was going to experience a period of turbulence and uncertainty, we focused hard on prioritizing and phasing our spending plans for the year. As such, we were able to limit our expense growth to 2%.","We held the line on personnel cost and professional fees, marketing programs have been reprioritized and phased in the context of the uncertain revenue outlook for the year. Network and processing expenses grew due to the NSPK transition in Russia. Reported G&A expenses were up driven by a variety of factors including exchange rate adjustments and cost of product enhancement.","Our adjusted effective tax rate was 29.3% modestly lower than our full year expectation of low 30s. This was largely due to the recognition of certain benefits earlier than we had anticipated. Our full year tax rate projection remains unchanged.","Looking ahead to the second quarter, service and transaction processing revenue trends remain unchanged. International revenues remain weak. Currency volatilities are high going into the quarter, but could revert to the mean as they did last quarter and we will lap high volatilities from last year.","The exchange rate drag remains approximately three percentage points. Net-net, mid single digit nominal revenue growth appears likely to be sustained. Expense growth rate will step up through the mid single digit range with increases in personnel cost and the growth in network and processing expenses due to Russia.","One big change between the two quarters, which is important to note is interest expense. We will have a full quarter's interest expense starting in the second quarter of $125 million, almost $0.4 per share. We want to make sure you all incorporate this into your models going-forward.","As we look ahead to the second half of the year, our primary concern is the economic weakness in international markets and the risk that will impact the U.S. As you may recall for our commentary last quarter, our outlook assumed some second half acceleration in U.S. growth and high cross border growth due to easier comparisons.","Current trends create some uncertainty around our revenue outlook for the year. As the year progresses, we will continue to look at opportunities to moderate expense growth while ensuring critical initiatives that are adequately funded. At this point, there is not much more we can tell you about the back half.","In terms of Visa Europe, we do not have any financial updates at this time. As a reminder, our outlook for the full year excludes Visa Europe. Assuming things proceed as planned, we will provide more detail on our second half expectations inclusive of Visa Europe when we talked to you again at the end of April.","With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Vasant. Sam, at this time, we're ready to start the Q&A. And I'd remind everybody if they could please keep their questions to a single question and then queue back up so that more folks are able to get on the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Bob Napoli","Thank you and good afternoon. A question just on the competitive intensity of the industry and any changes you may be seeing. Certainly the credit card industry broadly at the margin continues to seem to get somewhat more competitive and you also have some regulatory challenges around the world.","And historically, this hasn't really been able to penetrate its way through to Visa and Master Card revenue yields or I just -- wondering if you could you any update given the competitive changes on the issuer side and the regulatory changes if there is anything for us to be concerned about on the revenue yield for the business?","Charlie Scharf","Well, I think the business is competitive and I always remind everyone that our business has been competitive since the day we went public. We and Master Card evolved our structures roughly the same period of time. We compete in the marketplace every single day. And that has been a very consistent way of doing business.","Domestically, across the world there are local networks that we compete with. And there are emerging global competitors such as Chinese Union Pay in the traditional space as well as a series of people in the eCom whose names you know that we continue to compete with.","I think when we think about what we have at Visa in the quality of the network, the safety, the security, the global acceptance and now the capabilities that we built in the world of digital commerce and the value-added services, we feel terrific about our ability to continue to compete.","And we're very, very clear that we know that we have to continue to add value to transactions that run over our network in order to sustain the kind of margins that make this such an attractive business.","And we think that there are couple of us with us leading the pack who are uniquely qualified to do that. And so those views I think are very consistent with where they were last quarter, last year and a couple of years ago.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Perlin","So the question I have is as you think about serving all these incremental constituencies, you're much more merchant direct and centric and then also much more consumer direct and centric.","I'm wondering how you're prioritizing your expenses when you think about throttling back on projects and what we should be mindful of, because I look back on your expense lines may be back in, we were coming out of the last recession, your marketing dollars as an absolute dollar were almost kind of absolute levels. So I don't know if you pulled that back to norm. I'm wondering where do you throttle back. Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","Yes. So let me take a stab at it and then Vasant you can add anything you want to add. I think so first of all, it's us who want to want to be really just clear for a second is we are not building a business which is consumer direct and we're not building a business which is merchant direct.","There are occasional times when we will do something directly with the consumer or directly with the merchant, but it's in a way that's of course a four-party model in a way that we believe is ultimately good for issuers and acquires. We're just acting as a facilitator.","So we still very, very much believe that the model that we have is an amazing model and we continue to most of what we do to work through those people. But the fact is we are consumer brand and we have a role that we've got to play there.","When it comes to the comments on expenses, I think -- I guess what you should take away is that nothing that we have done when it comes to re-phasing, delaying or reducing any of the expense dollars that we contemplated in our minds relate to anything, which is going to help build the business for the future.","If you ask us, are we as efficient as we should be? Are we spending every last dollar wisely across the place? The answer is no and the answer is still no today. And so what this environment does is it gives us the ability to take a harder look at where we're not as efficient as we should be and attack those dollars.","So we've not cut back on anything that relates to building or digital business. The APIs and SDKs that are part of the developer center, the things that we're doing on behalf of merchants, the things that we're doing on behalf of issuers to build our consulting services.","We're still very, very committed to building that and as we think about what this environment does is, it's just creating extra focus for us. We certainly don't think that the slowdown that we're seeing that's affecting the business is something that changes the business model for the long term. So we're not going to change the things that we think build the business for a long term as we said here.","Vasant Prabhu","And the only other thing I would add is we've said that the expense growth rate will be back in the mid single digits in the second quarters. And as Charlie said, there is nothing we've done to date that does anything in terms of either the funding or the pacing of critical initiative whether that's Visa Checkout, Visa Direct is token service, all the critical initiative.","Times like these are a good opportunity to take a hard look at -- is every dollar well spend and prioritized once again. And we took some time to do that in the first quarter and in the second quarter, the expense growth rate will be back in the mid single digits. And we'll keep monitoring the external situation.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Sam.","Operator","Yes. Thank you. Next question is from Chris Brendler with Stifel. Please go ahead with your question.","Chris Brendler","Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask another question on competitive environments and get your updated thoughts on PayPal in particular. It seems like they've been a good supporter of our online volumes and a lot of transactions are funded by cards.","But the opportunity seems a little bit different from the remediation threat. I just wanted to get your thoughts on that particularly threat? And also when it comes to Briantree venture of the in-app development and the potential for remediation risk there, is there competitive response from Visa to some of the technology that they've enabled to or that kind of stuff.","Is that area that you could potentially expand and soon become a competitor when it comes to online in that purchases. Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","Yeah, let me -- let me do the first one first. I\u2019m not going to talk about any specific company. What I will say is that we love partnering with people that we think are good for the payment system and preserve our client's roles and our role in the ecosystem and there are many examples around the world of people that we partner with in ordered to do that.","There are also some examples of people that don\u2019t do that and people that generate business for us in the short term whose business model is built around dis-intermediating us eventually and our clients is not something that we like, not something that we support and not something that we're just going to sit ideally by and watch.","Our first preference is to figure out how to work differently with those people. Those are the active conversations that we're engaged in. If we can't get to a predicted conclusion there are a lot of things at our disposal that we can do which we have not done, which will enable us we believe to compete in a very clear and very direct way in a way that\u2019s a level playing field for everyone.","And so our first preference is to figure out how to partner with people, but if that doesn\u2019t work out then we will compete directly with them and that will evolve in the near future and so more to come on that and the second question was around\u2026","I guess the question was there are people like Braintree out there whose services help enable mobile commerce and what\u2019s our response to that and on this one, our response is multiple on multiple fronts.","First of all we have a great business in cyber source where we also own a business called authorize.net that deals with smaller merchants and helps enable smaller merchants to accept online payment.","That business is focused both in the browser space, but also in the mobile space and we've just made a series of changes internally with some leadership changes that we're very excited about to help reenergize the business there and to be in a position to compete.","We also made an investment in Strip and work very closely with them and we think they\u2019re just extremely talented people who are almost solely focused on the mobile space and enabling mobile commerce in a way that\u2019s very friendly to us and we're excited to continue to help them build their business globally.","Jack Carsky","Next question Sam.","Operator","Yes, thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, could you talk a little bit about -- you mentioned a couple of very large merchants that are going to be deploying Visa Checkout this year.","Can you talk a little bit about what the sales and implementation cycle might be and how to think about the progression perhaps over the next couple of years in that does it seems like it's pretty important from a competitive standpoint?","Charlie Scharf","Yeah, so the sales cycle -- honestly the sales cycle varies dramatically with the priorities that the individual merchants have and obviously the more continuing success that we have changes that sales cycle as well.","When we're able to quote the kind of numbers that we're able to quote on comScore for what it actually does to merchant sites and the merchants themselves and actually share those experiences, nothing changes the sales discussion more than that.","And so I think it's fair to say when we first started these discussions. It could be six to nine months in terms of a calling process if not longer. I'll tell you I saw a note today on the way down here that we got an incoming call from a sizable merchant, which was very surprising to me saying that they would like to implement Visa Checkout.","So it really is -- the game is changing, but we also in our minds we know, this is merchant by merchants, it\u2019s a long term build and we just have to continue to show the kinds of progress that we're seeing with these -- about the numbers of merchants and the size of merchants.","The implementation piece -- I hear what it was, but its dramatically quicker and easier for merchants to implement. If they can fit us into their queue it's literally weeks at this point as opposed to when we had the first incarnation it was multiple months.","So the real issue is just making sure they understand why it's good for them and just having a merchant decide that its priority for them and that\u2019s what we're starting to see.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.","Jason Kupferberg","Thanks guys, so this quarter clearly seems to support that Visa can really protect the bottom line with cost controls and more or less any macro climate, but obviously the tone is getting understandably more cautious regarding the global volume outlook.","So, I understand you're not changing your fiscal '16 revenue growth guidance, but just curious whether or not the lower end now feels more likely than it did at the time of the last earnings call. And then just very quickly any metrics on Visa Checkout volume you can share.","Vasant Prabhu","I\u2019ll just jumping on your first question. The thing to point out is if you look at international payment volumes as we said in our comments, in constant dollars they were actually up 14%. So it's still incredibly healthy growth and then in nominal terms, it comes down to zero.","If you can see what an huge impact exchange rates have had and U.S. payment volumes both credit and debit if you adjust for conversion and GAAP have been remarkably stable. So that\u2019s what makes us optimistic about the long term.","In the short run as Charlie said there is two issues, it's the strong dollar is hurting commerce into the U.S. which is a very sizable business for us and has been a big drag now for multiple years. The dollar also affects translation. You saw that from 14% constant dollar growth to zero it's huge.","And the cross-border trends, clearly are being hurt by both the strong dollar as well as what\u2019s happening in commodity markets China etcetera.","So, we feel these as not really reflecting the long-term trends in our business and so we really don\u2019t want to change anything in terms of our long-term profile of investment, but we are also mindful of the fact that the new few quarters we will face the same pressures.","So all we're really doing is being prudent and prioritizing, they are not fundamentally changing anything in our investment posture and I guess the next question was on Visa Checkout numbers. I think you provided some in your comments.","Charlie Scharf","Yeah but we actually don\u2019t provide the volumes.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is now open.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Charlie my question is also on an element of the competitive environment, which is we\u2019ve seen Visa now maybe partnership in new ways with some of the banks in order to win portfolios that were and co brand relationships that were up for [RFP] and of course there is the evolving relationship with JPMorgan and what they're doing now on Chase Pay.","And so I wonder is there something occurring now between Visa and the banks in terms of that the kind of relationship that banks are seeking to have with you in the United States that's different than in the past because it seems like the stance is a little more aggressive in response to some of the dynamics that are making growth to hard to come by in the States.","Charlie Scharf","I think it\u2019s a good question. I think and I think there are couple of different things going on. I think first of all part of what you're seeing in the evolving relationships that banks have with the networks not just in the U.S. but around the world is as the years past, since we have transitioned from association to public company, networks are kind of sorting out their point -- I am sorry, banks are sorting out their point of views on networks and what they want those relationships to look like.","And so what you start to see now is at the same time payments evolving very, very rapidly driven mostly by digital, but by -- but I think also as importantly, the payments businesses broadly including the debit card business and the credit card businesses are now very much a part of what a bank does and why they think about their entire relationships as opposed to five, six , seven, eight years ago we were transitioning from the majority of the business being done on the credit side by standalone companies.","So all a sudden being integrated into a bank, but still being run separately. So as they combined these businesses and really run them as an integrated business they're now thinking about how they need to have a partnership with a payment network, which is much more strategic as opposed to just a third party provider services.","So what you're seeing is you're seeing longer term contracts whether its people used to do one and two year contracts and now you've seen us do three, five, seven and 10 in some cases and that\u2019s because it\u2019s a -- it is a different kind of relationship.","I think the other thing that\u2019s going on in the marketplace is you start to see especially here in the United States banks have become very, very good at understanding the different segments, the different opportunities that they have to use payment products to serve their clients and they're able to compete with the like of other names out there that they didn\u2019t necessarily focus on before and are having great success in that.","And when you have success, it gives you confidence to go get more aggressive in some of these co brands and some of these other things that you see.","So, what we want to do is to be the payment partner of choice, to be the one that helps them think strategically as well as to be the best actual provider of network services and you're seeing people make choices relative to who their network partners is and what that means for the aggressiveness in the marketplace is it\u2019s a more competitive marketplace.","But again to me that's something we\u2019ve seen it increasing over a period of time and it's because there are people -- there are more people that have better abilities in the payments space today than there were three years ago, five years ago or 10 years ago.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Jim Schneider","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if I could ask a question about the U.S. consumer trends that you're seeing. Clearly it sounds like from the data you\u2019ve seen so far, I was seeing any material downtick in the U.S. consumer although you\u2019re watching it very closely.","But can you maybe talk about any other kind of underlying stats you're looking at. I think almost a year ago you talked about the speculation about lower gas prices driving increased saving and banking of that savings.","I am wondering if you\u2019re seeing any evidence of increasing discretionary spend and then just as a clarification relative to the one point of acceleration you mentioned so far, year-to-date if I strip out the effect of lower gas prices, would you still be seeing the same consistent underlying trends or the one point of acceleration. Thank you.","Vasant Prabhu","I think what we're seeing is a very stable U.S. consumer environment. If you look at multiple quarters all the way through last year and into this year and you adjust for as we said conversions and gas prices it's in very stable for any question marks about whether the benefits from gas prices floating into. We've seen a little bit of that on the debit side as we said that earlier.","Yes, there is a small benefit as you look at January from the impact of gas prices declining, but gas prices are still below where they were last year. So we had a two percentage point impact on debit one on credit that will moderate, but won\u2019t go away completely. So most of it we would ascribe to that.","Wouldn\u2019t read too much into three weeks of January, we then had some awful weather in the last few weeks, last few days and that definitely will affect some of the commerce. But overall I don\u2019t think there is a whole lot more we have to add than what Charlie gave you in terms of holiday spend shift to commerce channels. I don't know if there is anything else you could add.","Charlie Scharf","No I think that\u2019s it.","Jack Carsky","Okay. Next question.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys, look I just want to follow up on guidance, since your guidance was provided last quarter, we had further deterioration on some macro areas like you mentioned gas prices and definitely some of the emerging oil based economies, but again you maintained your guidance for now and did pretty well in the quarter.","So I guess as of now do you include similar trends on the slower areas like Brazil, Russia, Middle East as persisting at these similar rates throughout the year and then what if anything would you say has been a surprise to the opposite since last quarter on revenue that might offset the slower macro, maybe it was cross-border versus the 3% right, if you can just give you us more color on that. Thanks guys.","Charlie Scharf","Yeah, listen this whole concept of guidance is it\u2019s a very strange thing right because you're asking us what we think our volumes will be next quarter, the quarter after that and the quarter after that? And we know a little more than you know, not a whole lot more.","So asking people to give procession in terms of what\u2019s going to happen effectively to the dollar, consumer conference, things like that. We really don\u2019t know. So, what we try and to do is be as transparent as we can about what do know.","And we recognize that it's hard sometimes to figure out what a trend is and it's hard to know what the triggers will be to either seen an uptick or downtick. So we try to be very clear in our remarks that we\u2019re not changing guidance, but if we don\u2019t see improvement then the guidance will come under pressure.","Vasant Prabhu","Yeah and I think if you want to know what could offset, we told you that we saw some additional factors that were causing deceleration in cross-border trends and that was really two main things that was travel out of China and it was travel out of oil linked economies.","What could cause -- what is the most significant variable that could cause trends to change in a positive way do we know what's going to happen? We don\u2019t, but it\u2019s the dollar.","If the dollar begins to show some signs of weakness clearly it has a big impact on our business not immediately, but over time on two fronts. One the translation impact, which you can all estimate, but then there is the other impact, which will play out over time which is, commerce into the U.S., which is a big part of our business.","And then in the second half certainly Europe will be part of Visa and the travel into Europe has been better than travel into other geographies. So hopefully, that will help us and some of that we knew going into the other end and giving some of our perspectives we incorporate some of that.","Charlie Scharf","Just to give you a little sense. We were looking earlier in detail at the cross-board spend and if you look at -- look over a much longer period of time when you go back to when our cross-border growth was in the low double-digits versus where it is today and say where is -- what\u2019s the biggest effect?","Almost something like 75% or 80% of that effect is -- the reduction is from sales wired in the U.S. So it\u2019s the drop in spending of non-U.S. cardholders in the United States.","Just -- it\u2019s a very, very dramatic, very clear, very specific item predominately driven by the dollar, not totally, but predominately driven by the dollar and it moves quickly on the way down and at some point it could quickly change the other way as well we just don't know when.","Jack Carsky","Next question Sam?","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Ken Bruce with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ken Bruce","Thanks, good afternoon. My questions really relate to some earlier comments, I\u2019ve recognized that you have some expenses that you can manage. I was wondering if you might be able to provide some sense as to what you would -- how we should be thinking about what would be core spending or core investments in the expenses versus may be some of those areas that you talked about in terms of gaining more efficiency.","So, just so we kind of have an understanding as to how much leverage you have from that standpoint. And then second question are you --and this is granular, but are you seeing any changes in activity within the U.S. in those areas that are particularly known for high energy or high exposure to gas and oil in particular? Thank you.","Vasant Prabhu","Yeah I think you can see some of this from things that we might put out through our economics, but there is clearly this, you can see the subdued activity in oil, oil related states and the West is doing better in aggregate then other parts of the country.","But other than that I don\u2019t think there is anything we would tell you that is not available from other sources of data that you see.","The other question was on the cost side. What we said earlier was cost related to technology initiatives that are critical to product development for the future, cyber security, those have a long-term -- we have a long-term perspective on that and there really is no change in our posture on those things.","It's on the margin where we can tighten the belt on things that maybe somewhat more discretionary and you could do them later or you could do them now and there comes a point where you criminally don't want to cut below a certain level. So we're being very prudent.","We see many of these as transient and cyclical kinds of things with some strong underlying trend. So we see no reason to change our posture on our long-term investment outlook.","Charlie Scharf","And the only thing I would add is that we're going through the initial discussions with our colleagues at Visa Europe and so obviously after we close the transaction, we'll go with full fledged integration.","And that just is an opportunity to help us focus on efficiency in general and just to repeat what we said is that we still are believers that the underlying trends in the business are extraordinarily strong that there are places that commerce is moving to and we're building the appropriate solutions that will enable us to be as successful in the digital world and the physical world and we're very committed to continue to invest in that space.","But remember we are a very young for-profit company. It wasn\u2019t that long that we were an association and so opportunities to focus internally and to get smart about where you're spending your dollars to ensure that they're going towards the future and towards client-driven things is a good thing and that's our focus as we talk about the allocation of our resources.","Jack Carsky","Next question Sam.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. I guess I have a question on the share buyback and the dilution offset to the preferred issuance. Understanding the markets are volatile, but is there anything that precludes you from maybe having a little bit of a shorter time horizon in repurchasing those shares?","And then just one data point question. Do we have -- and I am sorry if you guys have disclosed this before, but do we have a specific number on how much of your volume is travel that's coming out of China into other countries? Thank you.","Vasant Prabhu","I believe on the second question no, we don't -- we don't provide that. In terms of buyback if you calibrate the buybacks, as you know our buybacks have always been more problematic than opportunistic, but within the programmatic buyback, you've seen us calibrate up or down depending on market conditions and assessment of valuations and so on.","So yes, there are opportunities to speed it up if we want to, but I think our best expectation remains what we told you earlier, which is that our goal is to buyback or offset the dilution caused by the issuance of the preferred stock by the end of fiscal year 2017?","The pace in which we do that whether it's more in some quarters, less in others, I am sure will calibrate as each quarter comes by.","Charlie Scharf","The only thing I'll say is to add on that is we have and well, I guess I will say this way, if you look at our actions on the debt offer, we issued the debt in December well ahead of what we expect to be the closing day because we looked at what we thought the right long-term economic decision was as opposed to what the negative effect would be this quarter and next quarter.","And so when it comes to buybacks, it's the same economic discussion and obviously depending on the size, depending on how you want to accelerate there are different cost to do those things and we think about that in terms of what the right thing for us to do is.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Craig Maurer with Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Craig Maurer","Hi thanks. Two questions. First just on -- should we expect the incentives that were pushed out due to the delays on show up in the fiscal second quarter or will they be spread out more through the year.","And secondly, Charlie Visa Checkout, we've been noticing a lot of incentives being pushed through the channel for consumers to sign up and use the offering and I was just wondering if you could comment at all regarding potential share gains against competitors in the digital wild space if there is any anecdotal evident there yet, thanks.","Vasant Prabhu","Our planned incentive as I mentioned in my comments, some of the reason they were lower than we expected, they were in the middle of the range rather than the high end of the range. So it was a small difference.","Partially it was volumes because our international volumes were lower and so you get a reduction in incentive payments as a result of lower volume and it was only partially because of delays and some of those yes, they will move into the second quarter and so you should expect that the second quarter time incentive range will not look a whole lot different than the first quarter, but these are small shifts. These are not big shifts.","And I tuned at after the first quarter. What was the second question.","Craig Maurer","Visa Checkout. Visa Checkouts anecdotally do we now for gaining share of other Checkout IT solutions.","Charlie Scharf","I don't know the answer to that to be honest.","Jack Carsky","And we will go to the next question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Thanks. I just wanted to ask again about the revenue sensitivity. So if cross-border doesn\u2019t accelerate in the U.S., doesn\u2019t accelerate in the second half '16 as is in the guidance and let's just say the cross-border stays at this depressed level along with the U.S. staying more the same, are we talking about potentially then the revenue guidance for the full fiscal year '16 has to come in and you would protect kind of the bottom lines or other cost cuts.","Just want to make sure I know the sensitivity of what happens if it stays more the same environment, thanks.","Vasant Prabhu","Yes, I think you can probably run those numbers as well as we can. Cross-border the international revenues are roughly 20% of our revenue base and they're about 6% now and maybe there was an expectation that it would be somewhat better in the second half as we lap easier comparison.","You can sort of look at it if it stays at these levels what -- we wouldn't do anything that would be wrong for the long term in our business. As we said, we will continue to look at phasing and prioritizing expenses while investing in things that matter.","So I think we're suggesting that we can offset all revenue shortfalls that might emerge and it is too early really to tell you how the second half might shape. As you know, when we get to the second half, the comparisons do get somewhat easier. So we'll have to see how that plays out.","We'll have to see what the dollar is doing at that point. Lots of unknown. We've given you our best sense of the next quarter. It looks to be very similar to what we saw in the first quarter and that's about as good as\u2026","Charlie Scharf","The only thing I would add, let me, to your point Vasant is we tried -- we feel like we've got a much better line of sight obviously to the next quarter. So we try to be as clear as we can there and as we get to the end of the next quarter, at that point we should -- we should have a much more definitive point of view on what the year looks like as well as the impact of what the year will be at that point in time.","Jack Carsky","At this point, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Great. Thanks for fitting me in. Just and good job on the expenses here, I just wanted to ask about some of the tailwinds and if there is any update on the timing and I am curious if your outlook already contemplates USA and I guess Cosco and some of those things coming on, thanks?","Charlie Scharf","Yes, there is no update on those things. They're all proceeding on plan and they were in our guidance.","Jack Carsky","And with that, we would like to thank everybody for joining us today. If you have any additional questions, please feel free to give either myself or Victoria a call. Take care.","Operator","Thank you, speakers. And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for joining.

[Operator Instructions]. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Shania. Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Visa Inc' s fiscal second quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer.","This call is currently being webcast over the internet and is accessible on the investor relations section of our website, at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today's commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on forms 10-K and Q which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.","For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC, are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release.","And with that I will now turn the call over to Vasant.","Vasant Prabhu","Thank you, Jack. In keeping with prior practice let me begin my remarks by highlighting some key call-outs from the quarter. First, we reported a solid quarter of financial results despite a backdrop of continued domestic and international economic cross currents. Importantly, revenue growth of 8% was a couple of percentage points better than we had expected and telegraphed last quarter. The up side was driven by lower incentive levels than previously assumed and a higher currency volatility benefit. Our flat EPS growth for the period year over year was a direct result of the favorable tax impact we enjoyed in the second quarter of FY '14.","Second, the overall strengthening of the dollar continued to exert pressure on revenue growth. Exchange rate headwinds this quarter reduced reported revenue growth by approximately two and a half percentage points. We expect dollar strengthening and its associated impacts, to continue for the balance of the year.","Third, for the second consecutive quarter, our client incentive rate came in below expectations. This was once again due to the timing of certain contractual obligations, as well as moderately lower payouts associated with lower payment volumes in several challenged geographies like Russia and Brazil. We expect line incentives to be higher in the second half of the year.","Fourth, our effective tax rate was 32% in the second quarter, 10 points higher than Q2 last year, when we recorded an IRS section 199 tax benefit related to multiple years. Our tax rate will fluctuate from quarter to quarter this year, as I will discuss later.","Overall, the underlying drivers of our business remain stable and healthy, as evidenced by payment volumes and transactions growth. However, the strong dollar impacts us negatively this year not only on currency translation, but also in our cross-border business. Despite these headwinds, we're maintaining our outlook for the year in line with guidance previously provided.","There are, however, some significant shifts from quarter to quarter which we want to make sure are clear to you all. First, on the revenue front, after a better than expected second quarter, we now project the third quarter to represent the low point of growth for the year at 6% to 7% on a nominal basis. Growth will pick up again and approach double digits in Q4.","The third quarter is expected to be negatively impacted by higher client incentives, some are shifting from the second quarter, the continuing drag from lower gasoline prices and tougher comparisons in the other revenue line which benefited last year from revenues associated with our FIFA World Cup sponsorship. The full benefit of price increases and the smaller incentive drag due in part to the lapping of a deal intensive quarter in FY '14 will help Q4 revenue growth.","Second on the expense front, we expect a meaningful step-up in expense growth in the third quarter, as a number of programs including marketing and certain technology initiatives have been phased to the back half of the year. As always, we will continue to carefully monitor the economic backdrop and can and will make expense adjustments as necessary. Our full year expense growth expectations remain unchanged at this time.","Third, we expect a higher tax rate in the third quarter, followed by a substantially lower tax rate in the fourth quarter. Our estimated tax rate in the third quarter is expected to be as much as 200 basis points higher than the rate in the second quarter. However, as currently anticipated, we expect to take advantage of certain tax benefits as early as the fiscal fourth quarter which would drive an effective tax rate in the low 20%'s in Q4 and no change to our full year fiscal tax rate expectation of the low 30%'s.","When you put this all together, we're now looking at third quarter fully diluted EPS being $0.06 to $0.08 lower than analyst's current expectations. For the year, we now expect our fully diluted earnings per share growth to be at the low end of the mid-teens range, in line with current analyst expectations.","Moving on to second quarter business drivers and our financial results, I will start with global payments volume and process transaction trends. Global payments volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 11%, unchanged from the prior quarter. The U.S. grew 9% and international grew 13%, both at similar levels to the December ending quarter. Drilling down further, in the March quarter, U.S. credit grew 12%, a two percentage point moderation compared to the December quarter.","The account conversion is complete and consistent with last quarter, contributed approximately 3 percentage points to our overall credit growth in the period. This positive impact will continue for the next two quarters, though at a declining rate before lapping. Lower gasoline prices, the full effect of which hit payments volumes this quarter reduced credit volume growth by two points. As such, gasoline prices appear to be the primary driver of the step-down in credit growth. U.S. debit grew at 6% in the March quarter, generally in line with the December quarter. Lower gasoline prices had an outsized effect on debit growth, reducing it by approximately three percentage points.","In aggregate, lower gasoline prices impacted U.S. payments volumes by a negative three points in the quarter. A portion of the savings from gasoline price declines is being spent in other categories, primarily grocery and restaurant segments. This is evident in debit payment volumes, not yet in credit payment volumes. More recently, through April 28th, U.S. payments volume growth was 9%, with U.S. credit growing 12% and debit 6%, essentially unchanged from Q2 trends.","Global cross-border volume delivered an 8% constant volume growth rate in the March quarter, unchanged from the December quarter. The U.S. grew 6% and international grew 10% in constant dollars. The further strengthening of the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year continues to have a negative impact on cross-border commerce. Forward currency curves imply that the dollar will gain in strength. If this materializes, these cross-border trends are likely to persist and perhaps worsen.","Through April 28th, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 9%, with a U.S. growth rate of 6% and an international growth rate of 10% generally in line with the second quarter rate. As you can see, when you adjust for the dollar, the underlying drivers of our business have remained very stable in aggregate.","However, the significant currency moves we've experienced this year are impacting cross-border commerce in a variety of ways, with the largest impacts coming from the U.S. dollar. Overall, cross-border volume growth has remained suppressed from historical levels.","As may be expected, outbound cross-border commerce from weakening currencies like the Euro, Ruble and the Canadian dollar has been slowing. Hardest hit corridors were Russian card holder spending across Europe and the Middle East and Canadian and EU card holder spending in the U.S. Offsetting this to some extent is accelerating cross-border commerce of the strong currencies, primarily the U.S. dollar.","In Q2 we saw U.S. card holder spend stepping up in Europe and Latin America. Chinese travel across the world continues to be robust. And cross-border spend out of Latin America is also picking up, helped by easier year to year comparisons. Currency shifts will remain a critical variable to watch as the year progresses. Any moderation of dollar strength will help our business and vice versa. Any pickup in economies like Europe, Brazil and Russia would be welcome.","Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 17 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 11% increase over the prior year period which was a one point improvement from Q1. The U.S. grew 9%, while international delivered 14% growth. Transaction growth in the U.S. is helped by some spending shift from gas to lower ticket categories of spend like QSR's.","Through April 28th process transaction growth was 10%, with a U.S. growth rate of 8% and an international growth rate of 14%. Transactions grew 14% in the period, as our reboot of the business continues to pay off. CyberSource will celebrate its five-year anniversary as a part of Visa this year and we have completed the integration of this business into our global merchant services and solutions functional area.","With the integration complete and since CyberSource transactions do not represent a material component of Visa's business, we will no longer call out this data separately after this quarter.","Turning now to our Q2 reported financials, net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.4 billion, an 8% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by solid growth globally across all revenue categories and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by approximately two and a half points by the strong U.S. dollar. Solid global payments growth volume drove service revenue up $1.6 billion, up 8% over the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, underlying payments volume growth in local currencies remains very healthy.","Data processing revenue at $1.3 billion was 9% over prior year's quarter, based on continued strong growth rates in Visa processed transactions, both in the U.S. and internationally. As mentioned, transaction growth in the U.S. was helped by some gasoline related savings being spent on lower ticket size transactions, such as QSR's.","International transaction revenue was up 11% to $964 million, with higher currency volatility countering impacts from moderating cross-border payment volumes and currency translation. As we measure our key currencies, volatility was at five-year highs in Q2, meaningfully contributing to international revenues.","Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 1% from the prior year, with moderate higher personnel, depreciation and G&A costs, offset by lower marketing and network and processing expenses. Higher personnel costs are primarily the result of higher headcount, reflective of our strategy to invest for future growth. The uptick in G&A was primarily the result of a loss related to our debit processing business in Asia which we sold during the period.","Higher depreciation was a result of ongoing investments in technology assets and infrastructure to support our digital solutions and core business initiatives. Offsetting these were lower marking expenses, due to the absence of the winter Olympics and FIFA World Cup spend in the prior year, as well as shifts in current programs to the second half of the fiscal year. As mentioned earlier, this will result in a step-up in expense growth for the balance of the fiscal year.","Our operating margin was 67% for the second quarter, in line with our annual guidance of mid-60s. Capital expenditures were $98 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, adjusting for our recent stock split, we had 2.45 billion shares of class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 2.46 billion.","On a split adjusted basis, we repurchased a total of 16.2 million shares during the March quarter, at an average price per share of just under $65 per share. Fiscal year to date, we have repurchased 28.6 million shares at a price of just under $65 per share, for a total of $1.9 billion. We currently have authorization to buy up to $3.8 billion of stock.","Since the IPO, Visa has add clear capital allocation strategy of investing cash to grow our business organically and through acquisitions as job number one, then returning excess cash to shareholders through stock buy-backs and dividends. Our dividend policy remains unchanged and our Board recently declared a $0.12 quarterly dividend per split-adjusted share.","For the past seven years, Visa has had a consistent approach to stock buybacks with the pace being modulated to some extent from quarter to quarter by valuation considerations. This approach to buybacks will continue, as evidenced by our purchases year to date. This is a growth business that generates significant cash flow and a low base of stock. A systematic buyback using excess cash after capital investments and dividends is a strategy we have been and will remain committed to.","In summary, the underlying drivers of our business remain robust. The strong dollar and other large currency moves have created some headwinds this year, as have the sharp decline in gas prices. These are the normal fluctuations one expects in the course of business.","The very attractive long term secular growth trends in our business remain intact. Despite the headwinds this year, our results are on track so far and we're comfortable reaffirming the guidance we provided to you at the start of our FY '15.","To conclude, this is my first earnings call as CFO of Visa. I'm delighted to be part of Charlie's team.","I look forward to meeting with many of you in the coming days and weeks and with that, I will turn the call over to Charlie.","Charlie Scharf","Thank you very much, Vasant. An official public welcome from all of us. First of all, let me start with commenting that we're very pleased with the quarterly results. We think of them as solid and consistent and certainly gratifying in the face of some of the more challenging economic conditions and geopolitical concerns that we see around the world.","Net revenue grew 9% nominally. FX impact hurt growth by two and a half points. Operating income growth of 11%, payments volume increased 11% on a constant dollar basis and cross-border volume growing at 8% on constant dollar basis, are all very solid numbers.","We see very little change in the overall global economy, with some exceptions and we see more short-term risk than we see up side. Consumer spend in the U.S. specifically continues at reasonable levels but is not accelerating. Gasoline prices continue to negatively impact both credit and debit. Outside the U.S., we see continued weakness in Russia and Brazil, but we do see strength in China and our Middle East and North Africa region.","And the effect of the strong U.S. dollar, as Vasant pointed out, is meaningful. We see this through the FX translation impact, but additionally, the benefit of that we see of U.S. spenders outside of the U.S. is outweighed by the negative impact on the non-U.S. spenders spending less in the United States.","Away from the economic growth environment, we continue to feel terrific about our activities to drive growth which I will talk more about. We continue to make excellent progress on our evolving technology initiatives which include everything we're doing in the digital space, mobile specifically, Visa Checkout and the work we're doing in our global merchant services and solutions groups. We continue to have a strong flow of significant client wins and renewals.","I will speak a little more on several of these points in a moment, but in sum, while we remain appropriately cautious in the short-term, we remain quite bullish on the medium to long term and continue to believe there are tremendous opportunities for years to come. Let me just amplify some of the comments that Vasant made regarding payment volume for a second.","First, the negative impact of gasoline on our U.S. payment volume is significant, at three percentage points. Though the initial impact on payment volumes was felt in our first quarter, the full impact did not hit until the second quarter and so the revenue impact will not be fully felt until our third quarter, because of the quarter lag on service revenues. In an update to our March quarter, Visa Insight Survey, things haven't changed much with consumers. About 30% tell us they're spending more in other categories, up from 25% last quarter.","The two categories that continue to stand out are the lower ticket categories, groceries and quick service restaurants. As I said last quarter, the lag time between lower prices and spending we think is about six to nine months, as consumers accumulate enough to feel comfortable making larger purchases. Keep in mind, consumer confidence and confidence in sustained lower gas prices will impact their willingness to spend.","Cross-border volume remains steady at 8% in the quarter, as we said. And as I have mentioned and Vasant mentioned, the effect of the strong U.S. dollar against certain global currencies is negatively influencing cross-border spend and ultimately revenue growth. The U.S. cardholders are spending more outside the U.S. as a result of the stronger dollar, resulting in higher transaction and payment volume growth on a constant dollar basis at international merchants.","However, given currency translations and generally lower acquiring fees in foreign countries, that volume is not as lucrative as what we would have enjoyed on an inbound basis. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar has hurt in-bound spend to the U.S., primarily from the Canadian, European, Brazilian and Japanese corridors. As Vasant mentioned, higher currency volatility has offset some of this.","Let me just turn now and talk about some important client activity. Starting with the U.S., we renewed a multi-year credit issue agreement with U.S. Bank, a great partner and one of our leading issuers and the fifth largest commercial bank in the United States. U.S. bank has been a long time Visa partner and we lack further to building further upon the exciting things we've done with them, in terms of innovation, new product development and security.","In the U.S. co-brand space, Best Buy, the world's largest retailer, will convert their consumer credit card portfolio to Visa later this summer. We also renewed a multi-year credit agreement with BP. BP has been a longtime Visa partner and launched its first co-brand in 2006.","We're thrilled with our new agreement with Costco. We're very pleased to have been selected to replace American Express as the credit card network for its U.S. warehouse clubs and gasoline locations, beginning April 2016. A strategic benefit for all Visa issuers and their cardholders. We're also excited to be partnering with Citi on the new Costco Visa co-brand credit card. We view Costco as truly unique opportunity and very strategic.","As I said, it is good for Visa, but an even bigger benefit for all of our clients. They're one of the largest and best retailers in the world. The third largest merchant in the U.S. according to the national retail federation, someone who historically did not accept our credit product and we now have an opportunity to gain acceptance where MasterCard and American Express are not accepted in the credit space. We also love that this is a truly long term acceptant [Technical Difficulty] and co-brand partnership.","For all of our clients and their consumer and business clients, it will be the first time in 16 years they gain access to the tens and tens of billions of dollars of annual credit payments volume that heretofore went to American Express.","It is a great opportunity to drive incremental usage. It should help all Visa issuers drive their cards towards the top of the wallet and increase new account and card holder acquisition opportunities. This was a very competitive process and there has been much discussion of what drove the outcome here.","I don't want to speak for Costco, but let me say that I have not met a retailer that cares more for their clients, their members more. Going forward, Costco will be entrusting their clients, their members, these precious relationships to Visa. If it were me, money wouldn't win the day. The best brand with the best capabilities would win. I've consistently said price matters, but cannot win the strategic relationship. So our strategy is not to be the low-cost provider.","As I think about what drove the decision here, I look at a series of things, including a view that we're the premier brand for Costco members, the belief that our brand will help Costco grow more than all the others, clear, strong brand preference among their members and target market, specifically with the higher growth affluent and millennial holders which in this case will drive membership and sales growth directly for Costco. Our broad global acceptance, our superior data and analytics capabilities and our leadership on innovation.","I would also point out that we feel that all the benefits I've outlined, plus what our issuers bring to the table, can create more value than others. Specifically and quite simply, we, our issuing partner and the co-brand can make more and provide greater value to our clients than smaller, closed loop networks. As a remainder, the implementation of these agreements is subject to the purchase of the existing co-brand credit portfolio by Citi.","Turning to our business outside the U.S., let me first start with China. Before I turn to market opening which I know is a topic that you all want to hear about, I want to talk for a second about our existing business. It is doing extremely well. We have a significant and fast growing business, with relationships that have been growing and deepening.","We're the market share leader versus non-Chinese providers and that share has been steady since 2013. We continue to sign contracts and be awarded new issuant business from Chinese Banks. As examples, this quarter we renewed and expanded our agreement with China Civic Bank, one of the largest partners in China. The program will now include issuance of Visa only branded companion cards, in addition to the dual branded program in place. China Everbright Bank, one of China's largest financial institutions renewed their credit agreement with Vise.","Regarding the market opening news, clearly this is a significant and positive step. The facts as we've read them thus far are consistent with our expectations and we're very excited to see more specifics which obviously will be important. We do intend to apply for a license.","As I've said, we have a strong business today with great local relationships which have only become stronger over the past several years. We're excited to participate in one of the most important markets in the world. And for Visa to help in the growth of domestic Chinese marketplace, working with Chinese companies and the Chinese government.","To be clear, we're not pursuing this for the short-term profit opportunity. This is a long term commitment which will pay off over the long term. We intend to prove our value as a partner within China, so bringing our value added capabilities to help grow the Chinese economy will come before our revenue and profit growth for quite some time. Regardless of when we start to participate domestically in China, we do not expect this to be a meaningful contributor to our financial results for many years to come.","Turning away from China, First-Ran Bank, a large issue in South Africa and our largest issuer in sub-Saharan Africa, extended their contract with Visa. We also renewed our partnership with Desjardins, the leading financial group in Canada and the fourth largest cooperative financial group in the world and lastly Banorte, one of Mexico's oldest and largest national institutions, renewed their credit agreement with Visa. On the other side of the equation, Citibank and Itau will be moving their business away from Visa. In certain regions around the world, we have contacts with Citi which will continue to run for quite some time. In terms of how quickly these conversions commence and ultimately how long it takes has not been made clear to us and we will let you know as we learn more.","While losing any business is disappointing to us, we know that we're not going to win everything, as we operate in a very competitive environment. We've always been very thoughtful and strategic about choosing for which clients we want to be aggressive in this competitive process and we feel great about our portfolio of client relationships. Importantly to us, we remain disciplined in our approach to negotiations and the net of these recent wins and losses leaves Visa and our partners in a better strategic position for the long term than would have otherwise been the case.","A couple of other quick updates on the regulatory and legal fronts. First of all, in Russia, we have been actively working with the national payment card system and central bank to achieve full migration of Russian domestic Visa transactions with minimal disruptions. All domestic Visa transactions will continue to be processed in accordance with the national payment system law.","And in the U.S., on the merchant litigation case, we continue to make good progress in settling the opt-out cases. Fiscal year to date, we've paid out $321 million and additional settlements are progressing nicely.","And we continue to lead the world to the world of digital commerce. Visa Checkout continues to make great strides. We now have 260 financial institution partners and 140 merchants live globally. To date we have over 4 million registered users, over $46 billion in total addressable volume accepts Visa Checkout and we continue to add merchants, including small and medium size retailers, where our acquiring partners are helping us grow acceptance.","We're also deploying Visa Checkout outside of the U.S.. As an example, we launched Visa checkout in China at the end of March, China Merchant Bank is the first institution in China to introduce Visa checkout to its customers. In the coming months, we're working with other Chinese institutions to deploy checkout.","In April, we kicked off consumer marketing campaigns in both Australia and Canada, in partnership with some of the biggest merchants in those regions. We're on track to be live in a total of 16 markets this year. ComScore conducted a study last month to evaluate our progress with merchants since launching Visa Checkout last July. The findings are very clear.","Visa Checkout customers convert to buyers 69% of the time. This is 66% higher than conversion rates reported with traditional on-line checkout. The product is doing exactly what we said it would do, solving the on-line friction problem at a rate that's higher than the competitive solutions we surveyed.","In the digital solutions space, a few comments. In my time here at Visa, it is amazing the amount of companies that are working and talking about the future of payments in the role, some very young, some very established. Regardless of tenure, it's clear to me that they fall to two categories. Those that talk about being innovative and those that are actually driving innovation in way that truly drives incremental value and can scale.","I'm proud of the work of the Visa team and proud to be leading the industry into this digital world. When we launched tokenization, we told you it was more than a set of just security standards. We said it was a platform to enable new commerce experiences, then came Apple Pay.","When we participated in the Apple Pay launch, we said it was just the beginning and there would be more solutions that leverage our digital platforms. Since then, Samsung has announced the new Galaxy S6 payments experience and Google's Android operating system supporting host card emulation. And we have several clients developing new HCE based applications in our sandbox as we speak.","As the industry leader, a Visa partnership gives the chance for these experiences to be successful because of our technology, our scale and our leadership. Our innovation is not something every consumer sees, but it is the things that we do as a platform that others can build upon and it is our platform that becomes embedded in all sorts of devices, operating systems and mobile apps.","Essentially we're enabling our partners to take advantage of one common payment platform and set of standards, but still able to customize their solutions to their specific client needs appropriate to their markets, with their preferred user experiences. Great companies come to Visa first because they know we understand the technology of payments better than anyone else and we understand the needs of their users.","And we continue to build out our capabilities to support our merchant partners. We completed our acquisition of TrialPay this quarter. It is a platform that we've worked with before and one that proved its value proposition before we decided to acquire the company. Combined with our broader merchant capabilities across Visa Analytics, Loyalty Products and VisaNet capabilities, this is a platform that we intend to use to help merchants improve their marketing and thereby drive their incremental sales.","During the last six months, we introduced to the market three new products and solutions specifically designed to help our merchant partners. First, we created a customer intelligence dashboard, a custom analytic dashboard for merchants to enable them to understand who is shopping with them at the store level.","We're helping merchants not only understand the sales trends, but also who is shopping, their demographics, where they live, where else they shop, et cetera. The platform is helping our gasoline merchants better predict demand, airlines to optimize routes and load factors and many others to optimize marketing campaigns.","The second solution is a digital marketing measurement product. Earlier this year, we launched a new platform which enables our merchant clients to measure their digital market spend with an entirely new level of accuracy. When a merchant runs a digital campaign, we're able to show them in real time how many of those impressions led to specific sales using a Visa card. For many years merchants have taken a big leap of faith that clicks led to real sales. For the first time ever, we're now helping them measure the actual sales.","The final example is a pilot program but one that we're excited about. Platform that actually drives new customers into our client's store. The platform is powered by Trial Pay, where we place targeted merchant offers on the web and on mobile apps.","For example, you're checking into a flight, you will see an offer to get 500 miles if you shop at Pete's coffee in the next week. When the customer comes in to buy their coffee, they're notified in real time that they've received their bonus. Miles, in this case.","Also we track the purchases and show the merchant in real time how many of the customers are coming into which specific stores. Early days, but client interest remains very strong. As you can see, these are products which we believe over a period of time changes our dialogue with merchants as we help them grow their business.","So just to wrap up, we're very pleased with our performance for the first half of the fiscal year, especially in light of some of the challenging aspects of the economic environment. It continues to be a very exciting time in payments, as you can tell from all the recent announcements. We remain bullish on our future and we continue to broaden and deepen our work relationships with issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments and other third parties.","With that, Vasant and I will be pleased to take your questions.","Jack Carsky","Okay, Shania, we're ready for the Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","Just trying to square a little more of the discussion on EPS growth being at the low end of the mid-teens guidance range, given your unchanged revenue growth guidance. Was it primarily tax rate assumptions in the second half of the year?","And then just to further add to that, are you incorporating further volatility benefits, FX volatility benefits in your outlook and guidance? Because it clearly helped your cross-border revenue growth this quarter. Thanks, guys.","Vasant Prabhu","Darrin, just a couple of things. I think the two things you should take away from what we said was there's a certain amount of moving around going on between the third quarter and the fourth quarter. We said that the revenue growth in the third quarter will be the low point of the year in terms of growth and then it will pick up in the fourth quarter, approaching double digits. So that's one thing.","The second is expense growth will step up a bit in the third quarter. Still in the mid-single digits level for the full year, but step up in the third quarter as some expense is shifting between the first half and the second half in marketing and technology.","And then if you look at our personnel expenses, you should be looking more at what the first quarter level was and a little bit of growth with some of the initiatives we have underway. And the last piece that shifts things, mostly between the third and the fourth quarter, was the tax rate. The main take away from all this is, as we said, $0.06 to $0.08 shift out of the third quarter. For the full year all we're saying is we still feel good about the range we provided, but we're at the lower end of the range. Really in line with where the street is right now.","Your other component of the question was currency volatility. We did tell you that it was at five-year highs in the second quarter. So in terms of what we're expecting going forward, as you know, we benefit when there's volatility because FX spreads widen. It does offset a little bit the translation impact of currencies. We're not assuming they stay at five-year highs. We're assuming that there's some amount of regression to the mean, but we're not assuming they go to the kinds of lows we saw last year.","So it's anybody's guess really. So we're just assuming that it's not going to stay at this level, but nor is it going to be as calm as it was last year.","Operator","Next question is Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Could you talk a little bit about how you will be trying to protect the volume from Costco, together with Citi, from American Express trying to win it back? And maybe just as a corollary, talk a little bit about your thoughts about what's going to happen when existing co-brands come up for renewal and the competitive environment, there?","Charlie Scharf","Let me take the second one first. Co-brands are in the market certainly all the time. It's been a competitive marketplace. And all the things that I talked about in terms of the advantages that we think we brought to Costco, we think we can provide to almost all co-brand partners out there. In this case, it's certainly helpful to be the incumbent and the leader in the space. We've got deep relationships with the largest co-brand providers, certainly here in the United States and others across the world.","And those relationships, where we believe if you treat the partner properly, you prove to them over a period of time you help them grow, there's got to be a reason for them to want to do something else, other than be with you. And so we feel very good about our positioning there.","On the Costco front, I think when you take a look at what we bring to equation, you can assume that Costco, who's got the most to lose in this, has thought an awful lot about what risks they have and what opportunities they have. And the reason for them to want to go and take the risk of moving the portfolio is because they think there's more upside doing business with us and Citi in this case.","And when we think about and they think about the brand preference that their customers have, as I said in my remarks, the things that specifically the affluent and millennials think about our brand versus the competing brands out there, we're very confident that we'll be able to do a better job for Costco than the incumbent. And that will start day one, as we work extremely closely with Citi and Costco and that work has begun already.","Operator","Next is Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg","So can you just confirm whether or not some of your planned pricing actions for April got implemented as expected? And then can you also just clarify related to Costco, do the incentives there hit in FY '15 or in FY '16, when the contract actually begins?","Charlie Scharf","So Costco will be 2016.","Vasant Prabhu","And the pricing is in. Just to clarify, the pricing -- there were two changes, both of which happened in April. The first was U.S. acquirer service fees on all credit products and the second was U.S. acquirer international service assessments. They went in roughly around the same time, but the impacts are somewhat different.","One of them hits a little earlier in terms of impacts on our financials, the other a little later. So we get the full benefit of the pricing in the fourth quarter. We get a little less of a benefit in the third quarter. It's really a small difference.","Operator","Yes, Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess I have a follow-up question to the Costco. Charlie, you mentioned it's been competitive in co-brand, but is it from an economic standpoint incrementally more competitive and does that then play out further as you renew some of the other co-brands down the line? I guess secondly, how confident are you that Citi will be able to secure the portfolio from American Express? Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","So when you say is it economically more competitive--","Sanjay Sakhrani","Is it getting progressively more competitive, meaning are the economics materially different than they were before?","Charlie Scharf","First let's talk Costco for a second, then we'll talk more broadly about co-brands. And I tried to make this point clearly. So, let me just make sure that I'm even clearer on it. We view Costco as something extremely unique.","And so this is an industry where it's amazing, the gossip. And I don't know whether it's the consultants or what it is, but everyone likes to go around and talk about everything that's happening in terms of pricing and who did what to whom on this. What I would tell you is what we and my guess is issuers were willing to do for Costco is very specific to a unique opportunity to gain the kind of credit acceptance that we've talked about and the kind of co-brand that we've talked about, for a partner now that didn't accept our products in the past of this size.","We view it as a unique opportunity to capture that volume and then to use the ability to have that acceptance to grow our products elsewhere, regardless of whether they're co-brand or not co-brand, but obviously the co-brand here will bring with it extraordinary benefits. So Costco to us stands on its own, in terms of the way we think economically about what we should be willing to do.","In terms of whether the co-brand space is getting more competitive economically, I'm not sure. It's very, very competitive, as is the issuing business. And I think when people lose relationships like this, they need to figure out where they're going to look and so we assume that they'll continue to be competitive. As we think about our future and we think about our ability to continue to deliver the kind of growth that I think you are all expecting from us, we factor that into our assumptions along the way.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And just the Citi portfolio? AMEX's sales to Citi of the existing portfolio.","Charlie Scharf","Everything that we hear suggests confidence, but we're not a party to it.","Operator","Next is Bill Carcache of Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Apologies for another Costco question, but was wondering if you could speak to whether any of your issuing bank partners have expressed any sort of concern about the interchange rate at which the Costco volume will be coming over? Just in the sense that it could be difficult for them to offer rewards on the Costco spend. Just curious if you think that could be an issue?","Charlie Scharf","Well, I guess I would start with, there were a lot of -- there were more issuers than Citi who wanted to win the co-brand. And so whoever certainly was involved in the process understands the competitive dynamic and what would exist.","And again, I think from our perspective, the conversation is exactly what I've said here. It's a unique and strategic opportunity to get access to an extraordinary amount of volume that we and our clients weren't going to have access to and if you think about if we didn't win, the kind of conversation that we were going to have and the kind of conversation we would have to have with our issuers and their clients about not being able to participate in the opening of one of potentially the biggest retailers in the world, is not a conversation that we would have relished.","So we feel very good about what we've done here. When we make decisions that affect our clients, we take them extraordinarily seriously and understand that they will look at those decisions in the context with everything else that we do for them and we feel good about what where we've come out and are confident that it's a benefit for them.","Operator","Next Craig Maurer of Autonomous.","Craig Maurer","Question on Brazil, the Itau loss, from what we understand that will be fairly material as a percentage of that business. And with ELO creeping into the market as well, are you concerned at all about Visa's historic market share in Brazil shrinking significantly? And following up on your comment on a Mexican win, do you have any greater visibility on when that market will open for Visa processing? Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","Let me do the first one and then, Jack, you need to remind me about the second question. So in Brazil, listen, losses are losses. You know, I would just make it clear that these types of decisions aren't generally decisions that people make without talking to a series of people. So we were certainly involved in a series of conversations. And again, everyone makes their decisions in terms of what they're willing to do and at what price they're willing to do it at.","And when a large issuer says that they're going to move volume away from you, it's going to be hard for us to make that volume up elsewhere. And that's a decision that we chose to make to some extent relative to how aggressive we were willing to be relative to pricing. Because we, as I said in my remarks, it's important for us not just to win volume, not just willing to win incremental revenue, but do it in a way which is smart for us and for the payments industry for the long term.","And ELO is -- it is a fact. It is what it is. It's a different kind of network with different kind of capabilities targeted, for the most part, at different types of consumers than we generally target our business. And I'll tell you that I feel great about the relationships that we have with the other large issuers in Brazil and think we have the opportunity to continue taking share from them, albeit that share won't we place what we'll lose from Itau.","Jack Carsky","Mexico processing.","Charlie Scharf","Yes, Mexico. There is no timetable. We're actively working on some things, there, where we think that we can prove to the issuers that by us processing, it actually becomes a benefit for them and there's nothing imminent there, but it will evolve over time.","Operator","Next is Dan Perlin of RBC.","Dan Perlin","My question is basically this, the step-up in expense growth occurring at the same time that your inventive fees are kind of suggesting that they're also stepping up -- I guess it's two things. One is, kind of alludes to the fact that you obviously see something on the horizon, maybe it's second half of this year or early into next and I would like to get some color on that? Why you had pulled the trigger on both at the same time? Secondly, why the incentive fee slip? Why did the client take so long to convert? What were those conversations like and why are they not taking place?","Charlie Scharf","Let me do the first one first. The first, they are unrelated. There's nothing that we see on the horizon or anything like that. As we said, incentives -- I've been here two-and-a-half years and it seems to me that we talk about this every single quarter which is we do our best to provide insight and we certainly do it for our own planning as to what incentives are going to be, quarter by quarter. But we don't have a lot of control over it.","It's hard to know exactly when negotiations will become finalized, contracts will close and it changes the level of incentives. So as we've talked about multiple times, it is the full year that we really think about as something that we feel much better about than quarter to quarter.","And on the one hand, we'd love to have things close sooner. It's not something we try and delay, but it happens in the normal course of business. And on the marketing side, there it just relates to some specific things that we're going to be doing in the second half of the year that really relate to the summertime, coming out of the summer into pre-school and then eventually leading into the holiday season. That relates to how we want to time our marketing spend.","Vasant Prabhu","I just want to highlight that we're not changing anything in terms of our full year expectations on expense growth. So there's really no change. So it's not like we pulled the trigger to do something different in the third or fourth quarter.","As Charlie said, there are some marketing programs, particularly as it relates to Visa Checkout, that we think we can get a lot of traction doing in the back-to-school period. That's money that has been coordinated with merchants and things like that, that this is the best time to spend it.","There are some regional marketing programs that are happening in the second half. There's some technology initiatives that are ramping up that may have been a little slower to start than we might have expected earlier, but are ramping up into the year, but it was all expect. And then in terms of the personnel expenses, there's a reasonable predictability in that, it fluctuates from quarter to quarter, sometimes there's some noise, small items here and there.","But if you look at our first quarter run rate and you assume there's a certain amount of growth with some of the initiatives we have, all in all, I guess the short answer is -- we're not doing anything specific to ramp up the expense growth and our full year expectation does not change. And as we said in our remarks, if the world changes, we're ready to take a hard look at what remains to be spent and decide whether it needs to be spent.","Operator","It's James Friedman of Susquehanna.","James Friedman","I wanted to ask about commercial. Charlie, any perspective about how you are doing on the commercial side? One of your competitors had called out some weakness on the commercial side, at least in North America in the calendar first quarter. Do you think that you're taking share and how are you competing in the commercial market?","Vasant Prabhu","Setting aside the share question, commercial payments growth for us in the second quarter was quite healthy at 10%; it's performing well. A lot of interest from non-financial institutions, participants to provide value added services. So there's a lot of non-traditional people coming in, like technology providers, healthcare entities and so on. I don't know if Charlie --","Charlie Scharf","The only thing, commercial -- we all talk about commercial, across all of the different people that participate in this business, as one of the great opportunities. I mean, the two really meaningful opportunities that the industry has that are really meaningful, apart from just the business as we know it, is P2P and commercial. There are large, large sums of money that -- on the commercial space, specifically, we compete in. We've worked really hard on our products, we're doing fine in it.","I really don't know about share. It's hard to know about it. But I think the 10% growth has the opportunity to be much, much larger. And that's something that we're working through and hopefully in the coming quarters, we'll have more to talk about specifically about what we're doing there. But it's an important business for us today. And the question is whether or not we can crack a nut and incrementally move it from the something which is incremental to which is more of a step function.","Operator","Next is Jim Schneider of Goldman Sachs.","Jim Schneider","Charlie, relative to the China opportunity, I realize that there's a lot of unwritten rules at this point and there's a lot of things still in the air, but can you maybe talk about your operational readiness from a network perspective to enter China and what you need to get to a level of full functionality, there and kind of the game plan on that front?","Charlie Scharf","Yes. Again, I would say, the devil is going to be in the details in terms of the way the rules are written. I would say it's been our expectation -- well, let me back up. What I said in the remarks is that there was -- what has been said has been what we've expected. And so you should assume that we've been planning for that and working towards that. There are different time periods that are laid out in terms of what the state counsel announced, relative to when things would have to be ready and we have teams of people around the company that are working to be prepared to enter as soon as we possibly can.","Operator","David Hochstim of Buckingham.","David Hochstim","I wonder, could you just go back to the international transaction revenue growth and help us understand how much of the change really was attributable to -- what the change is attributable to the increase in FX volatility? Because the gap might be even bigger next quarter and do you have a currency adjusted growth rate that would help us get back to that? And I guess also there's mix differences because of changes in cross-border spending?","Vasant Prabhu","Yes, I think you should look at -- there are three things going on in that international transactions line. One is, of course, all those transactions are in various currencies, so there is clearly an FX translation impact which is largely negative.","The second is the things we talked about which is that strong currency markets have outbound commerce that's improving, but the purchasing power of the currency is greater. So that you don't get the full volume benefit even though transactions are growing and then in weak currency markets you've got inbound -- you've got declining outbound commerce and a weaker currency. The net effect of all this is also negative.","Offsetting that, certainly we've benefited from volatility. I don't think we really ever publicly quantified those kinds of benefits. They move around. But clearly there's no question that some of the negative impact of the currency translation has been offset by the widening of the spread. And the two are uncorrelated.","You could see the currencies moving the other direction but the volatilities don't have to go along with them. But we'll keep you posted. As I said in the comments or in the question earlier, we're not assuming that volatilities remain at these highs. We're assuming some moderation in volatilities in the second half of the year. We're also not assuming that currency markets will go back to being sort of as calm as they were around this time last year.","David Hochstim","Right. So if they stayed close to these levels, we could see higher revenue than you have built in?","Charlie Scharf","It depends on what else it affects.","Vasant Prabhu","Exactly, there are other things. As I said, three things going on in that line. Higher volatilities will help us on that particular dimension. On the other hand, a move in currencies which affect the translation line and so on. There are many things going on in that line.","Operator","Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane","Just wanted to hopefully get some way to quantify the Citi and Itau losses and is it offset by some of the gains that you've had? Just trying to think about future modeling purposes. And then secondly, on tokenization, my understanding is we'll probably suspend charging for any fees even beyond FY '16? Just hoping to get an update on that.","Charlie Scharf","So we don't talk specifically about the volumes of Citi and Itau. As I said in my remarks, not clear to us what the migration looks like. So it is hard to be very, very specific other than things like Costco and the other positive developments that we have make us feel very good about how those things all fit together. Tokenization, what's the question?","Jack Carsky","Are we going to continue to charge in 2016? Will we charge.","Charlie Scharf","So we have the rate card out there. We've waived it through 2016 and we're continuing to look at exactly what we think the right way -- I would say what the right long term way for people to think about tokenization is, but to me, the important thing is, no one should expect that to be a monetary driver for us.","Operator","We have Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.","Tien-tsin Huang","Just wanted to ask on Europe, with legislation getting closer to being finalized. Does that change the probability of the put in any way? What's the latest there Charlie? And then just on Costco, real quick. Just the exclusive merchant acceptance, how critical is that for Costco, I guess, Visa? I know that's driving a lot of the uniqueness to it. Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","On the first one, listen, I don't think it changes the probabilities at all from our perspective, because we're not inside their board rooms to understand exactly what they're saying and what their drivers are. It's a consistent question that people ask us, in terms of what the probabilities are and we really don't know because they need the 80% vote. Until they get the 80%, then it's not going to happen.","So really don't know, really don't understand what the dynamics are and again, what really matters is how the blocking group of people feel about it. So those that don't want to vote for it. That's something that we're not privy to because we're not in those boardroom discussions.","But again, to circle back, we work really closely with Visa Europe. Example, whole group of people here today, Nicola, the CEO, is here today, as we're working through all the things that we're doing together to do a great job for our global clients, enable them to be as competitive as they can be versus the competition in Europe. And then the credit acceptance versus MasterCard and American Express, hugely relevant. That's why when you talk about the uniqueness of it, it just doesn't exist for a merchant this size that never accepted our product and now all of a sudden doesn't accept our other major competitors here in the United States.","As we think about what that means for all of our clients and for our cardholders, that's certainly factored into our thinking and I'm sure the issuer is thinking in terms of the importance and what it could mean certainly for our brand.","Jack Carsky","And with that we would like to thank everybody for joining us today.

All participants are in a listen-only mode, until the question-and-answer session of today's call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Charles. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal fourth quarter and full year 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s CEO; and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","This call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our Web site at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our Web site prior to this call as well.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as the result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s Web site in the Investor Relations section of our Web site.","For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today\u2019s press release. This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our Web site.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Byron.","Byron Pollitt","Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, as you can see from our earnings press release, we reported the quarter on an adjusted basis based on the litigation accrual we took in the wake of the $450 million escrow deposit we made in late September. As a reminder, this litigation provision is covered by our retrospective responsibility plan.","The $450 million additional litigation accrual has been estimated off of recently completed settlements with selected opt-out merchants representing approximately 3% of the total opt-out merchants based on sales volume, as well as the status of negotiations and discussions with other opt-out merchants. Excluding this litigation accrual, we reported adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.18.","In addition, consistent with past practice, the company\u2019s funding of the $450 million litigation escrow deposit had the same effect as a share repurchase, as it reduced the Class B share conversion ratio by an amount equivalent to buying back 2.1 million Class A equivalent shares at $215 per share. As a result, at the end of the fiscal year, we had 618 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis.","We continued to experience solid constant dollar payment volume growth in the low double-digit range both in the U.S. and internationally. U.S. credit continued to strongly perform, led in large part by Chase portfolio conversions. That said, looking ahead to fiscal 2015, our near-term outlook remains cautious given the modest pace of economic recovery, the geopolitical situation, Ebola, low currency volatility and continued FX headwinds from a very strong U.S. dollar.","Turning to revenue. As expected and previewed on our call last quarter, revenue growth for the fiscal fourth quarter rebounded growing 10% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis or 9% nominally, which reflects about 1 and 1.5 percentage points of FX headwind in the quarter. For the full fiscal year, revenue growth was 10% on a constant dollar basis and 8% nominally recognizing close to 2 percentage points of FX headwind for the entire fiscal year.","A word on international transaction revenue. Revenue growth for the quarter was 4% compared to 9% nominal growth in the cross-border payment volume. The difference can be explained by the continuation of historically low currency volatility discussed last quarter. That said, we saw an uptick in volatility across a basket of currencies in September, which continued into October. While we remain cautious in projecting this metric, results in September and October are encouraging.","Client incentives for the fiscal fourth quarter came in at 19.2% putting us right on target with our full year guidance of around 17%. As we telegraphed on last quarter\u2019s call, the elevated level of incentives was the result of key renewals in Canada and CEMEA which completed in fiscal Q4. I\u2019ll speak to fiscal 2015 in a moment.","Lastly, as always, we remain confident in our future growth prospects and full committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, in Q4, we committed $1.2 billion to reduce the number of Class A equivalent shares by 5.7 million at an average price of $213. This was accomplished through open market purchases and as noted earlier, a deposit of $450 million in the company\u2019s litigation escrow account.","Further, our Board approved in October a new $5 billion share repurchase authorization that in combination with the 682 million remaining from the prior authorization gives us 5.7 billion to deploy in the coming quarters. We also recently announced a 20% increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.40 to $0.48 per share. This level of increase is consistent with our previously stated objective of a 20% payout of the previous fiscal year\u2019s net income or in this case adjusted net income.","Now let\u2019s turn to payment volume and transaction growth. Global payment volume growth for the September quarter in constant dollars was 11%, slightly down from the June quarter. The U.S. grew 10% and international grew 13%. Drilling down further, for the September quarter, U.S. credit was 13% slightly higher than the 12% in Q3 in part due to Chase conversion activity.","Through October 21, U.S. credit improved to 15% growth. U.S. debt was 7% in Q4, a 1 percentage point downshift compared to Q3. Through October 21, U.S. debt is back up at 8% growth. Taken together, U.S. payment volume growth through October 21 was 11%, up 1 percentage point from the Q4 level.","Global cross-border volume delivered a 10% constant dollar growth rate in the September quarter, up nicely from 7% in the June quarter. The increase was attributable to stronger activity across a broader set of travel corridors with some effect from the timing of Ramadan. Notably, there was a nice pickup in travel to the EU from the Middle East, China and Australia. The U.S. grew at 7% and international grew at 11%.","Through October 21, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis held steady at 10% growth with U.S. growth at 6% and international registering 11% growth. Underperforming travel corridors includes several countries in Latin America along with Russia and Ukraine.","Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled 16.9 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, a 9% increase over the prior year. The U.S. grew 8% while international delivered 14% growth. Through October 21, processed transaction growth improved to 11% growth rate, up 2 percentage points. The U.S. grew 9% while international grew 15%.","Now turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, a 9% increase year-over-year driven primarily by growth in service and data processing globally and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by about 1 and 1.5 percentage points of foreign currency headwind. For the full fiscal year, net operating revenue was 8% over the prior year or growth of 10% on a constant currency basis.","Moving to the individual line items for the fiscal fourth quarter. Service revenue was 1.5 billion, up 8% over the prior year and was driven by moderating global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.3 billion, up 14% over the prior year\u2019s quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions both in the U.S. and internationally.","The delta between the quarter\u2019s 9% processed transaction growth and the 14% revenue growth was largely due to higher year-over-year growth in U.S. debt fees implemented in 2012. Of the delta, approximately one-quarter was due to lapping a one-time refund of an overpayment in Q4 of the prior year. The balance is ongoing as this fee structure stabilizes after having been implemented two years ago.","As highlighted earlier, international transaction revenue was up 4% to $938 million versus 10% constant dollar cross-border volume growth over the prior year period, as a result of a broad range of currencies experiencing volatility well below the 10-year median. In contrast to the year-ago quarter when volatility was near record highs, we are hopeful for a return to a more normalized volatility pattern in the coming quarters.","Turning to other revenue, it showed a slight uptick in the quarter reflecting a true up of the Visa Europe licensing fee, some of which was catch-up. Initially, the licensing fee was $142.5 million annually. The annual rate for fiscal year 2015 will be around 148 million. Excluding the litigation provision, total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, flat from the prior year.","For the full fiscal year, adjusted operating expenses were also flat to fiscal 2013. Adjusted operating margin was 62% for the fourth quarter and 64% for the full fiscal year both in line with our guidance of low to mid-60s. Capital expenditures were $227 million in the quarter and 553 million for the full fiscal year. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 623 million and 631 million for the full fiscal year.","Before I speak to specific items of guidance, let me provide some early perspective on how we see the timeline of fiscal full year 2015 playing out. We approach 2015 bullish on the long term, given the underlying strength in payment volumes and processed transactions and cautious in the short term. Here are some of the underlying observations and assumptions in forming our planning for next year.","First, while we expect U.S. and international payment volume growth to remain healthy, we have not yet seen acceleration in global economic growth. Cross-border volumes are rebounding as we reported 10% growth in the quarter but this is still below the low double-digit levels we experienced at this point last year and so we remain appropriately conservative in positioning this metric.","As a perspective, we know that these growth rates can recover without notice and that the notable declines in Latin American growth rates lap in January of 2015 and the market declines related to the Russian-Ukraine crisis will lap in March. Everything else equal, once these events anniversary, the pickup in cross-border growth could be in the 2 to 3 percentage point range. As to currency volatility, as I said earlier, while we have seen a bounce in September and October, we are not sure how sustainable this is.","Turning to a different subject, we will be taking selected pricing actions commencing in April of 2015 on certain U.S. acquirer fees, which will result in higher revenue growth in the second half of our fiscal year. Given that we have not taken actions in this area in four years, we believe the length of time and the substantial value these cross-border transactions bring to merchants make a modest adjustment appropriate.","In addition, based on recently completed significant client renewals that Charlie will speak to in a moment, as well as the successful growth in client payment volumes for both issuers and merchants, we will see higher levels of client incentives as measured by a percent of gross revenues with the highest percentage levels expected in the first half of the year.","In dollar terms, quarterly incentives in fiscal 2015 should be more indicative of the $700 million plus level seen in fiscal Q4. Finally, consistent with past practice, we expect to deploy our excess cash flow in 2015 to service our recently increased dividend and to continue to repurchase our shares.","To sum up, in terms of guidance for fiscal 2015, we are contemplating constant dollar revenue growth of low double digits with 2 percentage points of negative foreign currency impact. Absent any catalyst, we see our constant currency growth today at the very low end of the double-digit range.","As previously stated, our guidance contemplates several pricing actions to be effective at the beginning of fiscal Q3. This means our year-over-year revenue growth rates are expected to be double digit in the second half and in the mid single-digit range in the first two quarters as we lap low levels in incentives in the prior year.","Turning to client incentives, as a percentage of gross revenues, we expect it to be in a range of 17.5% to 18.5%, operating margin in the mid-60s, full year tax rate in the low 30s. On tax, as a reminder, when viewed quarterly on a year-over-year basis, the tax rate in Q2 of fiscal year 2014 was significantly reduced due to a tax benefit recognized under IRS Code Section 199 that included prior years along with an ongoing benefit.","Turning to earnings per share, on an adjusted basis, mid-teen growth and annual free cash flow in excess of 6 billion. Lastly and before I had the call over to Charlie, I wanted to address the topic of cross-border growth. In my conversations with analysts and investors, there have been a number of questions raised regarding our cross-border volume growth rate. In that light, on a one-time basis, we thought it would be useful to provide some incremental perspective, which we have included on Page 3 of the appendix of our PowerPoint presentation.","During our earnings report out each quarter, Visa includes in its operational performance package its cross-border volume growth rates on both a nominal and constant basis, excluding Europe. The first two columns show what we have historically reported in the operational performance data pack. The third column is new and represents a global view of Visa including Europe on a nominal basis to facilitate competitive comparisons across a common geographic footprint.","The next two columns also include Visa Europe and present cross-border growth rates recognizing there are at least two different methods for calculating those growth rates, which can have very different outcomes. When Visa historically measures and reports cross-border growth in constant currency, it uses the year-over-year change in exchange rates for the country currency and which the merchant transaction took place. Those growth rates are presented in the fourth column labeled merchant country.","Alternatively, one could also calculate cross-border growth rates using the currency representing the country in which the issuer resides. Those cross-border growth rates are presented in the fifth column labeled issuing country. Of course, other factors can also impact growth rates such as relative portfolio exposure to different countries and their currencies, the method for selecting FX rates and translating back to the U.S. dollar and share shifts, but those are much harder to isolate and quantify.","Recognizing the complexity of this topic, in addition to the one-time slide, we have provided an illustrative example of a cross-border transaction and the effect it can have on growth rates depending on the underlying methodology employed. You will be able to find it on our IR Web site located with the other earnings-related materials and that will be posted at the immediate conclusion of this call. We will then be available for follow-up conversations if you would like further explanation.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie.","Charles W. Scharf","Thank you very much, Byron, and good afternoon, everyone. First, I thought I\u2019d start with just a couple of brief thoughts on our fiscal fourth quarter. As Byron went through, our performance came in pretty much as we would have expected; adjusted earnings per share growth this quarter of 17% and 19% for the full year.","As we think about it, it\u2019s actually gratifying given the continued subdued economic environment globally and the volatile geopolitical environment which do affect our business. It says a great deal about the business itself and the company that we\u2019re lucky to be able to be a part of here.","Revenue growth continued to be constrained by the strong dollar, the low currency volatility compared with historical norms and cross-border growth below historical levels. As Byron mentioned, we believe that these items that have constrained our revenue growth are cyclical and can change very quickly.","More importantly, we really spend most of our time looking at the underlying fundamentals of the business and they continue to perform very well. In constant dollars, our double-digit payment volume growth with particular strength in the U.S. in addition to double-digit cross-border payment growth.","Processed transaction growth was strong as well. As Byron mentioned, these trends improved slightly in October through the 21st. Beyond our data through the 21st, our ability to see the future is the same as yours but we\u2019re cautious about the global growth as we plan for next year.","Just a couple of comments about capital now. We\u2019ve been very consistent as a company in how we think about capital allocation. We continue to believe the highest and best use of our excess capital is to reinvest it both organically and through acquisitions to further our growth. After that, we believe in growing our dividend as our earnings grow and maintaining a payout ratio of about 20% of our trailing earnings. We will opportunistically return the rest of our excess capital through share repurchases.","In 2014, we did all of these things; investing both organically in the business, outside investments. As Byron mentioned, we effectively bought back 4.6 billion of our stock during the year. And as we look forward, we remain committed to continuing our practices.","Last week, our Board approved a 20% dividend increase from $0.40 to $0.48 a share per quarter and they also approved a new $5 billion share repurchase program in addition to the roughly 680 million remaining from the prior authorization.","Given the opportunities in the payment space, we will continue to look for and prioritize growth opportunities, but our Board\u2019s actions should give you an indication of how we feel about our opportunities to grow in the future.","Let me talk for a second about Russia. Russia continues to move towards its goal of controlling domestic processing. Last Tuesday, President Putin signed modifications to the national payment system law, which positions the Russian Central Bank owned national payment card system as the preferred domestic payment processor. The law delayed the implementation of a guaranteed deposit from the end of October 2014 to March 31, 2015 to allow for an appropriate transition.","When the national payment card system is utilized, there is no guarantee deposit requirement. We\u2019re working closely with the government and our clients to ensure a smooth transition. We continue to expect to lose a portion of our domestic processing revenues in fiscal 2015 of about $50 million. This is likely to grow up to about $70 million on a full year basis when fully implemented.","We continue to believe we\u2019ll play an important role in Russia. Once this transition occurs and our baseline is reset, we will continue to focus on helping our clients grow both domestically and internationally. With that, I will talk for a second about our client franchise and just talk about some of our most significant markets, especially some of the things, which do create lumpiness in our incentives as we look forward into 2015.","First, let me start with Russia. We continue to work with our clients to support their businesses. We recently signed multiyear agreements with several Russia banks including Sberbank, by far the largest issuing bank in Russia. In the United States, we continue to have great success. We renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with the Bank of America, our second largest client globally.","To put this into perspective, if BofA were a country, it would be one of the largest in the world for Visa. Our agreement provides the opportunity to grow our share from our prior agreement and we\u2019re thrilled with the relationship we have with the Bank of America. Remember, when we signed our 10-year agreement with J.P. Morgan Chase, they agreed to move the majority of their non-Visa volume to Visa.","These conversions have begun and are going extremely well. Per Nielsen, total expected volume to convert has been estimated at over $40 billion. It\u2019s a bit less than 10 million cards overall and the conversions are expected to be completed by February 2015. In the U.S. credit market, we continue to gain share and remember this is the largest driver of our profit in the world.","Canada is one of our other large countries. Over the past two years, we\u2019ve signed long-term contracts with issuers and partners representing over 85% of our business including Scotia, CIBC, RBC, TD and Aeroplan. Visa\u2019s Canadian issuers have invested heavily in new rewards programs for Canadian consumers driving very strong growth and we benefit from these great partnerships that we have.","Brazil is a complicated market for us given the elections and the recently implemented cross-border taxes, but we continue to grow our relationships there as well. We\u2019ve renewed a multiyear credit and debit and commercial agreement with [CAHSA], the fifth largest issuer and we renewed a multiyear credit, debit and prepaid agreement with Banco do Brazil, our largest issuer in Brazil and the Latin American region.","Just a second on co-brands, which seem to be getting a lot of press these days. First just as a reminder, we think we have the best and we have the largest co-brand platform in the world with seven of the top ten programs exclusively Visa and great partners outside of the U.S. as well. This quarter, we renewed a multiyear credit agreement with Gap.","We\u2019ll continue to be the payment brand and network for the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy co-brand cards and our partnership with Gap extends beyond the retail store environment. Websites for the Gap and its family brands are now offering Visa Checkout as an online payment service.","In addition to the deals that we\u2019ve announced today, we\u2019ve agreed to terms to move a significant consumer credit co-brand from a competitor to Visa. We look forward to sharing more about this as cardholder plans take shape. We\u2019ve talked a bunch about bringing new capabilities to market for merchants and in addition to what we are doing in Visa Checkout, we are continuing to start to rollout products for the merchants.","Last quarter, we forged a proprietary relationship with TrialPay and had a small team from TrialPay join Visa to lead the development of a new product platform designed to help our merchants acquire more customers and sales opportunities. TrialPay is one of the leaders in presenting consumers relevant merchant offers during a transaction and we\u2019re using their technology and experience together with all of the capabilities that exist at Visa to build the platform that will drive millions of new customers to our merchant clients. You\u2019ll be hearing more about this in the coming months.","We rolled out a new product called Visa Transaction Advisor in August. It\u2019s a new solution, which helps U.S. fuel retailers prevent credit and debit fraud at the pump. This service enables merchants to use real-time authorization risk scores to identify transactions that can involve lost, stolen or counterfeit cards.","More than 65 million transactions per month are being reviewed by the service at 25,000 locations across the U.S. Some merchants have seen a 23% reduction in fraud at participating locations. Merchants using this service include top U.S. brands such as Shell and Chevron. These are just the beginning of our focus on directing our capabilities towards merchants.","Just say a few words about payment security and U.S. chip cards. At this point, most people understand most of the benefits that we get from moving from magstripe towards chip-enabled cards, but there are also some important unappreciated benefits just what I want to highlight.","Approval rates, again this is in the U.S., of chip cards versus magstripe are 97.9% for chip cards versus 92% for magstripe on cross-border and 99.2% for chip cards versus 98.4% in domestic transactions. Today, only 3.6 million terminals at 55,000 locations accept chip cards; 19.8 million Visa cards are in circulation, up 56% from 12.7 million but still a very small number relative to the total cards that are outstanding.","Having said that, we assume most people have read issuers, acquirers and merchants are working diligently to increase these numbers dramatically. The payment security taskforce that we participate on with a series of other people in the industry put out a press release that said that acquirers representing 80% of U.S. purchased volume estimate that at least 40% of U.S. merchant terminals will be chip-enabled by the end of 2015.","The group also reported that nine of the country\u2019s largest payment issuers estimated that they would issue more than 575 million chip-enabled cards by the end of 2015. There are also estimates that over 90% of cards will be chip-enabled by the end of 2017.","Turn for a second and just talk about our digital efforts, which are a huge focus for us inside the company. This quarter, we\u2019ve started to see some tangible progress as we have begun to introduce new digital solutions into the marketplace. First, a reminder that online purchased transactions for us are 19% of our business today and also that in the U.S. online, tablet and mobile purchases are growing at high double digit to triple digit rates versus a face-to-face rate of single digits.","We are aggressively pursuing this market with the expectation of growing our share. We\u2019ve seen several things to support this; Visa Checkout, Visa Token Services, Visa Digital services and Apple Pay. First, let me talk about Visa Checkout. Remember, this is our solution, which enables you to pay online in a very simple, secure way with a username and password. It\u2019s easy and secure for consumers and it\u2019s a terrific solution for merchants. It\u2019s easy to integrate and it\u2019s been proven that it increases the checkout floor rate for merchants. We continue to make great progress.","We passed 1.9 million registered users, over 200 financial institutions are partnering with us to roll this out to their clients and merchant reaction has been terrific. Merchants live today include Neiman Markets, Pizza Hut, Staples, 1-800-FLOWERS, Ticketmaster, Live Nation, Lululemon, Petco and Popsugar. Other new merchants who were live include the Gap and its brands, Tory Burch, Gymboree, Crutchfield and Orbitz and more who have signed but have not yet gone live included United, Virgin America and American Apparel.","Hopefully many of you have seen the advertising both in traditional media as well as digital and social with great partners such as Pizza Hut, Neiman Markets, Newegg and Staples. We intend to win and love the fact that we\u2019re partnering with merchants to drive Visa Checkout as a preferred solution in online commerce. To increase our region scale, we also integrated two partners; 3DCart and ProPay that provide access to a combined total of over 100,000 merchants.","In addition, our merchant acquired partners such as First Aid and (indiscernible) are integrating Visa Checkout for both their core platform and subsidiaries. As we evaluate our progress, we\u2019re focused on addressable online volume not the number of merchants and are very happy with our progress. To-date, over 33 billion in live addressable volume accepts Visa Checkout, another 30 billion has been signed and we\u2019re very confident that these numbers will be much larger as we get to the end of 2015.","In early September, we announced the launch of Visa Token Services. We talked about this a bunch, so I won\u2019t dwell on it. But it enables all Visa clients to offer their cardholders a secure and easy way to pay for mobile and online transactions, as well as it enables new forms of payment which are more secure that exist today. Apple Pay is the first used case in the market but many more will follow.","We\u2019re excited about Apple Pay but for us as we think about what\u2019s going to be coming into the marketplace, it\u2019s only the beginning. We expect a proliferation of exciting mobile and digital solutions leveraging our new capabilities. In October, we launched our sandbox development and testing environment for Visa Digital services as well as updated our SDKs that will enable issuers to begin embedding new forms of contactless payments in their Android applications.","Eventually, merchants and approved third parties will be able to harness the safety and security of Visa payments to create new proximity payment experiences for their uses. These services will be commercially available in the U.S. in January of 2015. Clients have already begun integrating to our development environment and our building and testing their applications in advance of our full commercial launch in 2015.","As far as Apple Pay goes, just a couple of quick comments. We\u2019re excited about our participation. We believe it\u2019s good for consumers, it\u2019s good for merchants and it\u2019s good for our industry. Our focus has been on security, scalability and inclusiveness. To the last point, we\u2019re working with over 1,000 financial institutions today and hope to see all of our issuers participate. On Monday, Tim Cook announced that over 1 million cards had been loaded to iPhone 6s in the first 72 hours. Visa represented over 600,000 of those requests; early days but very encouraging. ","And then just a note for us to be able to deliver all of these differentiated services in the marketplace, we continue to build our engineering and technology capabilities. To that end, we announced that we plan to add a 1,000 technologists and engineers in the U.S. This is in addition to the 1,000 that we\u2019ll be hiring into a new facility in India, which will open in 2015.","Just to wrap it up before we open it up for questions, let me just say a couple of other things here. There\u2019s been much talk about disruption in payment and what it means for us. Most of the disrupters are great enablers for consumers, merchants and our industry. Apple is the first great example. We and our clients can be great enablers of great consumer and merchant experiences. We bring thousands of banks, millions of customers and a convenience security customer service rewards and other great features that consumers like. You\u2019ll see many other enablers evolve that we will partner with and we\u2019re doing this all in support of our existing clients.","As we look to the future, we continue to see great growth opportunities for payments. We have our traditional channels and traditional ways of doing business, but we sit here today and we see the mobile opportunities in both the developing, the less developed and the developed world as being great drivers of our mission, P2P, commercial and our merchant relationships as all things that we\u2019re going to focus on to continue to build our business.","With that operator, I think Byron and I are ready for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Okay. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. With regard to client incentives, you talked about those being first half weighted in fiscal '15. Can you talk about how many of your top 10 issuing clients are renewing this year? And do you expect all those renewals to happen in the first half of the year given the frontloading that you talked about earlier?","Byron Pollitt","Byron here. So of the top 10, I would say one is scheduled to renew this year. And the frontend loading is really a function of two things and it\u2019s not what you just described. It\u2019s really a function of the deals that we most recently completed. We had a heavy deal flow that came to completion in Q4 and then will begin working their way through the fiscal year '15. But also as we have commented on many times before, incentives can be very lumpy in the way that they unfold. And so in the way that the deals were executed and we expect a frontend loading of incentives with regards to the P&L and then the guidance that we have given on a full year basis fully contemplates the lumpiness, so to speak, and we expect to deliver full year incentives somewhere in the 17.5% to 18.5% range.","Jim Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Thank you.","Charles W. Scharf","The only thing \u2013 this is Charlie \u2013 that I would just add is that also keep in mind that client contracts sometimes renew off cycle and that\u2019s contemplated in our guidance as well.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Craig Maurer - Autonomous Research","Hi. Thanks. Two questions. First, if you could comment on the apparent announcement out of the Chinese government this morning that they\u2019re going to move to open up that market for additional settlement clearing networks for bank cards? Secondly, a technical question on Apple Pay. We\u2019ve noticed that American Express is able to provide real time transaction alerts whether these are Apple Pay transactions or any other swipe, you\u2019re always getting an alert. On Chase transactions, which you\u2019ve provided a bespoke version of Visa, they don\u2019t seem able to provide this service. It would seem that Chase is not fulfilling the promise of that transaction that you had entered into with them or am I missing something? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf","Okay, let me do the second part first. So first of all, just to be clear, when you complete an Apple Pay transaction, there is immediate notification on the device itself that shows you that the transaction has taken place, the dollar amount and who the merchant is. You can then effectively flip the card over and see the running tally of all of your transactions. So, there is no \u2013 at least from our experience, my personal experience, there is no lack of clarity whether or not you\u2019ve completed transactions and it is very real time. The question about whether people are then providing additional alerts on top of that, that you got to talk to your individual bank about. We offer a service, which we provide to a series of banks out there that do allow for real-time alerts. I can tell you I personally signed up for it and I get it on as real-time basis as you can expect. But different banks choose what they want their consumer experiences to be. But having said that, again, it exist in real time on the Apple device. As far as China goes, there\u2019s really not a lot more to talk about than what you\u2019ve read, which for those who haven\u2019t read it, there was an announcement today that the Chinese government will open up the market to competition in our business. We don\u2019t know anything specific other than that. We obviously welcome it and we look forward to seeing the specific details and working with people within China to figure out what we need to do to participate in that marketplace where we believe we can add a lot of value.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","The next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital","Thanks, guys. Look, following a year where revenue growth ended up being a little more challenged than expected given some of the cross-border trends being slower, it\u2019s obviously nice to see the end of year pickup in those trends. But I guess following up on the guidance, if you can help us understand the assumptions you\u2019re making around a couple of different attributes includes volume growth versus the way it\u2019s trending in October as well as what part of this is from pricing, just because we\u2019re getting a lot of questions on how much pricing can actually impact the overall top line guidance of low double digits? Thanks, guys.","Byron Pollitt","So the headwinds that we had this past year, many of them still continue into this year. Our currency volatility we\u2019ve guided \u2013 we didn\u2019t actually expect to guide to two full percentage points of FX headwind a second year running, but particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar over the past two months has now made that much more likely. We were thrilled to see cross-border beginning to bounce back but it\u2019s too early to call that a trend. With regards to volume, it\u2019s based on low single digit constant dollar growth in volume gains, low double digit. And with regards to pricing, we don\u2019t go in \u2013 it\u2019s not our practice to go into the details of pricing but we have guided that it will take place in Q3 \u2013 beginning of Q3. So this is very much second half weighted and we also indicated in our guidance that we would expect to, with that pricing boost, be in double-digit revenue growth in the second half of the fiscal year.","Charles W. Scharf","Let me just pick up on that. As you\u2019ve heard from both of us, we know what we know. We don\u2019t know what we don\u2019t know. But we look at what\u2019s going on in the world and as we plan the company for next year, we have a cautious point of view of that. And so our cautious point of view suggest that we don\u2019t plan for very big increases in things driven by what\u2019s going on in the outside world. Albeit we know that they will improve at some point. We don\u2019t know when, but we think it\u2019s prudent to plan otherwise.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital. Your line is now open.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow back up, Charlie, on your 19% online. I guess it\u2019s volume or revenue, I need to get clarification of that, but the question really is that sounds like that piece of business is growing somewhere around three times faster than what you referred to as the face-to-face business and I\u2019m just wondering if you could give some sort of characteristics around how should we be thinking about revenue yields or all the products that you\u2019re going to be able to put around that type of volume, it sounds like there\u2019s more pricing opportunities in the future with those types of transactions and maybe what we\u2019ve seen on a legacy basis? And then just for level setting, Byron, is it 907 plus the mid teens that\u2019s the guided number or are we adjusting for the second quarter last year benefit? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf","So on the first piece, what I referenced in my remarks was really to talk about two different things. Number one is we have a big business in the online world today and the way we think about it is we\u2019ve been remarkably successful in a world where we haven\u2019t had great products to compete. We also stand back and we look at the growth and the growth rates of transactions done online, on tablets and on mobile are multiples of what\u2019s done face-to-face. So we both have a defensive reason to do it, but more importantly an offensive reason to help that migration and to participate in it. So the things that we\u2019re doing from Visa Checkout to Apple Pay to the things that are going to be \u2013 using our Token Services and our Digital Solutions are all about having the best products in the marketplace to capture where the growth is, which is in the digital channels. Relative to what it means for us from a pricing perspective, again we\u2019ve been very, very consistent on this which is we\u2019re not sitting here today thinking about this as an opportunity to capture more price. We\u2019re looking at this as an opportunity, one, to both be where the natural growth is but two, to help migrate all those cash transactions whether they\u2019re big value transactions or small value transactions into the electronic space where we\u2019ll hopefully capture more than our fair share. We do have a pricing schedule for our tokenization services. We said we\u2019re waving those fees for a year and we\u2019re going to see how this all plays itself out. But again, we look at this as this is the future of commerce, we want to be there. We see that there will be more volume in that world than there is for us sitting in the world that we are today, and if we make this up on volume as opposed to price that\u2019s just fine with us. If there are pricing opportunities in the future, we won\u2019t look the other way but that\u2019s not our reason to do this.","Byron Pollitt","To you second question, Dan, the short answer is 907 and the perspective is you were with us at the very beginning when we did our IPO. From the very beginning part of our investment thesis was that we would manage down the tax rate every single year to the best that we could. We started out at 41%. We said we\u2019d manage it down to below 34%, 35% over about five years. We didn\u2019t stop at five. We have continued to manage our tax rate. We have never adjusted or provided any EPS guidance that adjusted for a full year tax rate, because that\u2019s just one of the levers we have to manage the business and we will continue to do so. So it\u2019s mid teens off of 907.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets","Excellent. Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Don Fandetti - Citigroup","Yes. Charlie, I was just curious your thoughts on the U.S. market. I mean we\u2019re seeing some of your large bank issuers put up some loan growth. Consumer confidence has picked up, but we\u2019re not really seeing it in the spend. I was just curious on your outlook and just want to confirm that there\u2019s no real improvement baked into guidance in the U.S.?","Charles W. Scharf","Byron walked through some of the recent trends. Our performance in the U.S. credit market is strong but we don\u2019t look at it as \u2013 or let me say it differently. Certainly, in a really good performing economy should look much better than it looks today and we\u2019ve not factored that into our thinking for next year.","Don Fandetti - Citigroup","Okay. Thanks.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Thank you. I got a question on client incentives. Understanding that you guys had a big renewal in 2015, but how should we think about its trajectory looking ahead to 2016 and 2017? Are there large renewals coming up? And then just one clarification on the assumptions embedded in the guidance. Currency volatility as it stands right now, is that a tailwind in 2015 and are you assuming no tailwind? Thank you.","Charles W. Scharf","With regards to client incentives, from the beginning we \u2013 in fact going all the way back to the IPO, we have always viewed client incentives on an upward trajectory recognizing that the typical client contract is five years and that when a client contract comes up for renewal and if they have been successful, as most are, nearly all are in growing their portfolios, then the level of incentive adjust to a higher level recognizing the growth over the previous five years or whatever the term was and that\u2019s the way the businesses worked forever. In addition, client incentives were \u2013 back at the IPO we\u2019re much more a developed market phenomena and as the rest of the international group of countries have grown, we have applied client incentives more regularly to those multiyear contracts. And so there\u2019s a natural and healthy and expected upward trajectory in client incentives. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing and it\u2019s to the extent that we have one big renewal next year or this fiscal year, that\u2019s not driving it. What\u2019s driving it is what I\u2019ve just described.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","It drives the lumpiness, but not that trajectory.","Byron Pollitt","That\u2019s very fair. It drives the lumpiness but not the upward trajectory. And then your \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, your second question was\u2026?","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Currency volatility.","Byron Pollitt","Yes, so on currency volatility \u2013 boy, this one\u2019s tough. No one saw last year coming. It was at historically low levels. We\u2019re quite sobered about how to think about that and it would be very consistent for us to say that we have approached currency volatility with a high degree of caution and as Charlie said earlier, we absolutely know what we don\u2019t know about how currency volatility will behave in the future. So, as I said before, we were very pleased to see the September and October bounce. We didn\u2019t see it coming but we\u2019re pleased to see it happened, but we remain very cautious in our guidance with regards to the roll of volatility in the coming year.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Chris Brendler from Stiefel. Your line is now open.","Christopher Brendler - Stiefel Nicolaus & Company Inc.","Hi. Thanks. Good evening. I wanted to get a little more color, if I could, Charlie, on the pricing you mentioned in April. I think Byron also was saying about cross-border. Is this a similar pricing action to what one of your major competitors did on inbound cross-border? And if it is, does that change your thinking at all on how you wanted to view pricing? And I think we had talked about in the past that this is a situation where you are drawing a line in the sand and saying we\u2019re going to be independent in our pricing decisions and price for value. Just give me a little more color on that. And then a follow-up, if I could on union pay. It seemed like the articles are focused more on clearing rather than the entire food chain in the payments business of authorization and settlement. Can you give us a rough idea how much clearing is of total Visa revenues? Thanks.","Byron Pollitt","Why don\u2019t we start with the second one?","Charles W. Scharf","The union pay and clearing.","Byron Pollitt","Yes.","Charles W. Scharf","I don\u2019t have the answer. I\u2019m not sure \u2013 so the way we charge for our services, we charge service fees in data processing. And if we process the transaction then we reap data processing fees and that number is on our income statement and service fees if our brand is on the card. We can\u2019t sit here today and know what China is contemplating when they talk about opening up the marketplace quite frankly. But we really have to wait and see what they say and then understand what it means for us. Beyond that, we really don\u2019t know any more than you know at this time. Then the second one on pricing, why don\u2019t you start on pricing.","Byron Pollitt","So on pricing, I can say absolutely this was an independent decision. And as I said in my remarks, it has been four years since we have done something in this arena. Meanwhile, we have continued to invest in the transaction environment related to cross-border and in our domestic markets. And at some point we cross the line and say the value created for both our issuers and our merchants warrant a modest change in pricing which is what we\u2019ve taken.","Charles W. Scharf","And we\u2019ve said very consistently and I\u2019ve said it consistently and Byron said it consistently, there is no line in the sand any which way that the decisions are going to stand on their own and we have to look people in the eye and explain why they make sense for us in the environment that we live in and we booked this one for a long time and feel it\u2019s the right thing to do.","Christopher Brendler - Stiefel Nicolaus & Company Inc.","Great. Thanks so much for the color.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies & Co. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Thanks, guys. From what you see in your data, are lower gas prices in the U.S. sparking consumers to spend more actively in other verticals or are the lower gas prices just a drag on volume without any real offset? Because I guess we might have thought that the U.S. volume growth in the September quarter may have accelerated versus June, just given the Chase conversion, but it looks like it was pretty steady. So I\u2019m just wondering if there was a dampening effect from lower gas prices or what you guys are seeing there?","Charles W. Scharf","So this is a story that is undoubtedly going to unfold a bit. There is no question that there is a modest drag that we see in the numbers with the drop in gas prices. It\u2019s less than 100 basis points but it\u2019s clear there is a drag. You saw debit growth, which carries a lot of the gasoline transactions. You saw debit growth drop to 7% in the September quarter, you saw it bounce back to 8% through the first 21 days of October. But the data is still a little unclear whether that is spend that\u2019s being redistributed or in the prior year, if you may recall from October 1 through October 16, the government went into a partial shutdown and arguably depressed some spending during that period. And so this particular comp period is not clean. But the thesis that we punch way above our weight when it comes to gasoline prices, use of cards at the pump works on the upside. It also can be a drag on the downside. Then the big question is how is that money redistributed as it frees up, and at this point too early to call.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Hi. It\u2019s Brian from Deutsche Bank. Just looking at the data processing revenues growth at 14% and I think volume at 9%, one of the things that you talked about Byron was the higher U.S. debit fees, some pricing that kicked in. I just want to make sure I understand what that was. It sounded like there was a pricing kick that finally is having an impact in 2012 with three quarters of it still going to have an impact. I just want to make sure I understand what that is. And then finally on the pricing in April 2015, you guys expect \u2013 can you quantify that impact and where it will show up in the P&L? Thanks so much.","Charles W. Scharf","With regards to the data processing fees, to be absolutely clear there were no pricing actions in this area. This is about the pricing structure that we implemented back in 2012 and it was a \u2013 as you recall, it was a very different pricing structure than the one that we had previous to that point. And whenever you do that, it\u2019s going to take a couple of years to stabilize as you work your way through the full and complete implementation of that structure. That\u2019s what it is. It involves no price increase or no pricing action. And what I referred to earlier in my script has nothing to do with what you\u2019re seeing. And further this kind of stabilizing should have a positive effect in the next couple of quarters but diminishing and by the end of the fiscal year should be in our view pretty much stabilized. With regards to the other since we\u2019re not yet public on the details of the pricing, we will wait for another day to consider addressing that.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore Partners. Your line is now open.","David Togut - Evercore Partners","Thanks for taking my question. Could you address your pricing strategy more broadly over the next two to three years, perhaps gauge your pricing power and to what extent you intend to use it?","Byron Pollitt","Sure. I would say there\u2019s nothing new in our thinking which is first of all when we think about our ability to grow the company for the long term, given what the opportunities are for us to grow volume, using pricing to get to numbers that we hope to be able to show over a period of time is not something that we rely on. Having said that, we do think we should be paid fairly for what we do. And to the extent that we look at the services that we provide and feel that there is growing value in what we do, that\u2019s an opportunity for us to consider raising price. We know that people have options and so there has to be reasons to be able to do it whether it\u2019s on the issuer side or on the merchant side. And as I\u2019ve talked about before, we\u2019re spending a lot of time working with the merchant community on providing value for them. And as we do that, some of those things will result in things that will help us from a pricing standpoint. Other things support our existing price. So everything we do will be dealt on an individual basis. There is no line in the sand in any way we look at it. But again, as we come into the year and we think about what the opportunities are, pricing is something that we think is tactical for us and not particularly strategic at this point.","Jack Carsky","We have time for one last question.","Operator","Okay. Our final question comes from David Hochstim from Buckingham Research. Your line is now open, sir.","David Hochstim - Buckingham Research","Thank you. I wonder \u2013 could you give us an update on what\u2019s happening with CyberSource? Still pretty good growth in transactions, but the growth rate continues to slow?","Charles W. Scharf","Yes. So as we\u2019ve said \u2013 I\u2019d be happy to give you an update. We\u2019re not happy with the update. As you\u2019ve noted, the transaction growth has been slowing and as we\u2019ve said on an earlier occasion, we missed an investment cycle. We are now investing significantly to catch up both in our capabilities and our staff. You should expect the anemic growth, so to speak, to continue for at least another couple of quarters. We expect that that will begin to turn around by the end of this fiscal year. And then just one callout. The measure we give you is transaction growth. The transaction growth that we have lost has been among the least revenue generating of our transaction. So the revenue growth side of the equation has held up much better than the deterioration in transaction. But that said, we\u2019re not happy with the results but we have a very important role for CyberSource to play in our strategies going forward and we are investing aggressively to bring that back to a much stronger growth rate.","Jack Carsky","With that, we want to thank everybody for joining us today. And if anybody has follow-up questions, feel free to give Victoria or myself a call. Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for participation.

If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Kerri. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.'s fiscal third quarter earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer, and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's CFO.","This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.Visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.","And finally, for historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and any other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you very much, Jack, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time. There are a series of topics that I'm going to discuss today. I'll talk a little bit about third quarter results, a few comments about our European acquisition, and talk about litigation. I'm going to make some comments about the agreement we signed with PayPal today. I have a series of business updates that I'm going to walk through and then just a few sentences on the future before I turn it over to Vasant.","First of all, with the closing of our Visa Europe acquisition, as you can see if you look through the numbers, the quarter is somewhat complicated, but we tried to be as clear as we can in explaining the results. I want to start by saying that we're pleased with our continued consistent and predictable results in the face of an unchanged economic environment and increased geopolitical risks. To that point, the consumer has remained remarkably steadfast in the face of significant global instability.","Getting on to the results, we reported GAAP EPS of $0.17 per share and adjusted EPS of $0.69 per share. This includes several special items related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Vasant will discuss in further detail, but we view these as non-recurring items and are not a reflection of business performance.","On an adjusted basis, net operating revenue grew 3% nominally or 6% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a continued negative three percentage point impact from FX and in line with expectations we discussed last quarter. Our growth continues to be subdued by similar themes we have previously spoken about, such as the strength of the U.S. dollar on translation and cross-border volumes, continued low oil prices, and weakness in China and oil-based economies. However, U.S. spend remained steady, as does other domestic spend.","Overall, payments volume, cross-border volume growth, and processed transaction growth was similar to last quarter. The following numbers do not include Europe. U.S. payments volume growth was 10%, basically unchanged from last quarter after adjusting for leap year. International payments volume growth was 11%, down from 14% last quarter, driven almost entirely by lower domestic transactions in China that yield very little revenue. Cross-border volume growth was 5%, unchanged. Processed transaction growth was 10%, an acceleration of one point due to lapping of Russian's NSPK migration.","More recently, though, through July 14, U.S. payment volume growth was 11%. U.S. credit grew 18%, driven almost entirely by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. Debit growth, on the other hand, moderated considerably, falling from 8% in fiscal Q3 to 3% through July 14. The decline was driven primarily by Interlink. About a third of the decline is due to the lapping of very high growth at one of our large issuers who added Interlink to their cards last year, and the remainder is due to dynamic routing decisions. The decline due to the lapping will continue for another three quarters while the remainder is volatile, as merchants and acquirers make routing decisions dynamically.","Cross-border growth through July 14 is up 156%, but that's inclusive of Europe in the July 14 period. For comparability, if you include Europe in both periods, through July 14 growth is 12% versus 8% in the third quarter. The increase is driven by the timing of Ramadan and improvements that we see in the U.S. and Asia. And processed transactions rose 42% including Europe. If you include Europe in both periods, then processed transactions are flat at 11%.","Moving on to Europe, just a couple of comments, we're very happy to have closed the acquisition on June 21. We are well into the integration process. We have a management team in place which provides a great deal of consistency. We've developed an integrated management approach, and the teams are working extremely well together. We hosted 500 clients the week after the close in Europe, where we showcased the benefits of a combined Visa to those clients. We've implemented an integrated approach to global and multi-region clients. And we're working through product and digital roadmaps, ensuring Europe is appropriately prioritized within Visa.","Regarding Brexit, just let me make a couple of comments. First of all, with Brexit or without Brexit, it does not change our long-term view that the strategic rationale for putting these two companies together makes extraordinary sense. Also, I want to remind people that they had a put. And in that scenario, a negotiated transaction is a far better approach than having someone exercise a put at a time which is out of your control. Certainly in the short term, currency weakness and reduced economic growth are factors. We haven't seen much impact yet, but time will tell. We still feel good about our ability to deliver the accretion that we discussed, and Vasant will review that in more detail in his comments.","Let me quickly touch on legal matters now. The recent decision by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse the approval of our multi-district litigation class settlement is certainly disappointing. These cases were originally filed in 2005, and we continue to believe that the settlement was fair and reasonable for all stakeholders. However, the Appeals Court found that there were conflicts of interest between the two merchant settlement classes, a class that would have received money for alleged past damages and a class that would receive the benefit of certain changes to our network rules going forward. The court concluded that the conflict of interest between these classes meant that the classes were inadequately represented for purposes of settlement. It will take some time for the impact of this ruling to be determined, and there may be further appeals.","Meanwhile, Visa continues to honor the terms of the class settlement agreement, which remains in effect and did not terminate automatically because of the court's ruling. So for example, Visa has not reversed its rule change permitting U.S. merchants to surcharge credit transactions, and the funds that Visa paid pursuant to the class settlement remain in court supervised escrow accounts.","If the Court of Appeals decision remains after any further appeals, the matter will resume in the lower federal court, where we will defend the case and in time likely make a renewed effort to settle with the merchant classes. It is too early to speculate what shape that might take. However, I note that the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan continues to provide protection against monetary claims in the class litigation.","As you know, a number of merchants have opted out of the class and filed their own complaints, and are continuing to defend those claims which have not yet already been settled. The District Court has set a status conference on August 11, where we hope to obtain further clarity about next steps in both the class action and opt-out cases, but this will likely go on for some time.","Finally, I should note that all the individual settlements we've entered into with opt-out merchants remain in effect despite the court's ruling and regardless of the direction of any further appeals. The only exception is our settlement with Walmart, which was contingent upon the class settlement being affirmed. Its status will be determined after we have a final non-appealable decision in the class settlement.","Let me move on and talk about PayPal now. Earlier, we announced a new strategic partnership with PayPal. The partnership will result in significantly improved payment experiences for Visa cardholders in the PayPal and Venmo wallets. The partnership is designed to deliver significant benefits for Visa's issuing financial institutions, including a significantly better experience for their customers, more spending volume on their credit and debit cards, lower operational costs, and improved security. Merchants will also benefit from improved customer experiences, efficiency, and security, which together should help drive increased sales.","The details include the following. First of all, enhanced consumer choice and improved experience for Visa cardholders. PayPal will make it easier for new and existing customers to choose to pay with their Visa cards and ensure a more seamless experience. Visa cards will be presented as a clear and equal payment option during enrollment and subsequent payments, with an easy ability for consumers to set as their preferred payment method. Visa digital card images will be incorporated into payment flows. PayPal will not encourage Visa cardholders to link to a bank account via ACH. PayPal will also support and work with issuers to identify consumers who choose to migrate existing ACH payment flows to their Visa cards.","Consumers will also be able to instantly withdraw and move money from their PayPal and Venmo accounts to their bank account via their Visa debit cards, leveraging Visa Direct, providing experience that offers speed, security, and convenience.","An important aspect of our agreement is enhanced data quality. PayPal will ensure that the data provided to issuers and their cardholders for Visa-funded transactions will be consistent with the information that is received with traditional Visa card transactions. This will ensure better consumer experience, reduced cardholder confusion, ensure proper application of rewards, and reduce costly and time-consuming disputes.","PayPal will join the Visa Digital Enablement Program, what we refer to as VDEP, to enable them to expand their point-of-sale acceptance. This is a commercial framework for Visa partners to access our Token Services and other digital capabilities in the United States. Consistent with VDEP, issuers will be able to choose whether to participate or not.","The agreement affords PayPal certain economic incentives, including Visa incentives for increased volume and greater long-term Visa fee certainty. Importantly, Visa issuers will have a 12-month period of exclusivity for promoting their cards that are within PayPal's wallets. The partnership puts PayPal and Visa on a new constructive path forward and provides a framework for our companies to work together collaboratively.","A couple of notes about some client activity. We're pleased to announce that we renewed a multiyear agreement with TD in the United States and Canada for continued Visa credit and debit issuance. Regions Bank, a long-time Visa client, renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement. Chevron, one of the world's leading energy companies, renewed a multiyear credit co-brand with Visa. And as I'm sure you know, on June 20 Visa credit cards became exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations, and the new Costco Anywhere Visa card by Citi launched. This has been a long, complex process, but we're very encouraged by the results so far.","And outside of North America, Homeplus, the second largest retailer in South Korea with branch and home delivery services, renewed a multiyear co-brand program across multiple issuers supporting payWave. In Taiwan, we renewed a multiyear credit co-brand agreement with Taichung Bank, one of the largest co-brand programs in the market. And in Indonesia, we renewed a multiyear debit agreement with Mandiri, who is the largest state-owned bank in the country.","Moving on to EMV in the U.S., nine months out from the official kickoff to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from mag stripe to chip, and the U.S. is now the largest chip market in the world. More than 326 million Visa chip cards were issued as of June 2016, making the U.S., as I said, the largest in the world and larger than the UK and Brazil combined. 58% of credit cards and 37% of debit cards have a chip on them today. More than 1.3 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals, or roughly 28% of all merchant locations. Based on client surveys, we expect 75% of credit cards, 55% of debit cards, representing 96% and 73% of volume respectively, and roughly 45% to 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar 2016.","Having said all of this, this is a huge effort, and we're doing a series of things to help make this process move more quickly and more smoothly. To that end, Visa announced a series of initiatives to help accelerate EMV chip migration for merchants. We streamlined our testing requirements. We amended and simplified the terminal certification process. We committed to investing further resources and technical expertise in a manner that can reduce timeframes by as much as 50%. We are also making policy changes to help limit exposure to counterfeit fraud liability for merchants who are not yet chip-ready.","I want to say a few things about our relationship with U.S. merchants. We continue to invest in people, products, and solutions to help our merchant clients grow their business and reduce their costs. We've made good progress on this front with many of our merchant clients, though it's early days and this a long-term commitment on our part. You have read surely about some of the disputes we have with some merchants. We are committed to doing everything reasonable to resolve these issues, and we're committed to continue strengthening our relationship with all merchants.","As we continue to expand Visa Checkout around the world, we're constantly working to perfect the user experience and to deliver on our promise to make paying with Visa in the digital world as easy as it's been to pay in the physical world for more than 50 years. We've rolled out the new Visa Checkout experience to all of our merchants globally. Working with dozens of our top U.S. merchants, we updated the Checkout experience to simplify the signup process for consumers to enroll, add cards, and manage their information with more fluid interactions and smart autofill capabilities.","We also have begun to roll out an interactive Checkout button, allowing customers to enter their password right into the Checkout button and confirm Checkout with a single tap. Most of these features will be automatically available, which means merchants do not have to make any adjustments to their existing online Checkout processes or payment systems.","As we head into the Rio Olympics, we used the global sponsorship platform to highlight Visa Checkout and its merchants, including Best Buy and United Airlines, with whom we've created Olympic-themed ads that you'll likely see on TV in the U.S. in the coming weeks.","As we continue to look forward and drive new technologies in the payments space, as you know, we opened an innovation center in our San Francisco headquarters, which has served as a destination for clients, partners, and developers to see our new payments technologies and work alongside us and our experts and jointly create the next generation of payment and commerce applications. We've had great success and we've committed to expand the number of facilities so we can be closer to our clients.","To that end, in April we opened our Singapore innovation center. In May we opened one in Dubai and in June we opened one in Miami, all of which will serve our clients, partners, and developers in that region and act as a hub to jointly create the next generation of payment commerce applications. Accessible to both local and global clients, all these innovation centers will provide our partners with access to Visa APIs and software development kits available through our Visa developer platform. We also have an innovation center in London and have plans to open others in 2017.","We announced yesterday that we'll be opening a new facility in Palo Alto later this year. The office will house work that we do around data, business intelligence, technology research, and merchant solutions. We decided to open this facility following on the great success that we've seen with our San Francisco and Bangalore facilities. We've found that the combination of location, physical design, and co-worker collocation concentration are critical in our quest to continue to lead and innovate. All of these new locations provide opportunities to draw talent from communities that have concentrations of skills different from each other and allows Visa to benefit from the diversity of people and ideas in these very different communities.","We announced a new $5 billion share repurchase program. This brings the total available for share repurchases to $7.3 billion. This a reflection of our confidence in our business, our commitment to offset the dilution from the preferred stock issued to Visa Europe members, and our continuing commitment to return excess capital to shareholders.","Before I turn the call over to the Vasant, just a few words about the future; you can see that we provided full-year guidance on a GAAP and an adjusted GAAP basis as required, and we've tried to give you a clear indication of the impact of Europe in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis and without the impact of Europe, we reaffirmed all of our 2016 guidance metrics. You will hear from Vasant, but we're still confident in our ability to achieve the accretion from the European transaction we shared at the time of the announcement.","Looking ahead, we expect next quarter's results to improve modestly, similar to first half of the year's results. We'll provide more commentary on 2017 in October, but our underlying business is strong. And with the lapping effect of several items based on what we know today and assuming similar consumer spending partners, we feel good about our ability to produce stronger revenue and earnings growth.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Charlie.","In a world that's turbulent both from a macroeconomic and a geopolitical standpoint, our business remained steady and resilient. A few points to note, net revenue grew 6% in constant dollars and 3% in nominal dollars, at the high end of the range we had given you. Key business trends, payment volumes, processed transactions, and cross-border transactions remained stable. Currency volatility stayed high, especially post the Brexit vote. As expected, client incentives are almost 19% of gross revenue.","Once again, we had good expense management. Expenses declined 7% in the quarter on an adjusted basis and are flat year to date versus 2015. Lower personnel and marketing costs contributed to lower than projected expenses in the quarter.","Non-GAAP EPS in Q3 was $0.69 after you adjust for our GAAP EPS of $0.17 for four significant Visa Europe related non-recurring items: first, a $1.9 billion loss related to the settlement of the Visa Europe framework agreement as part of our acquisition of Visa Europe; second, a $92 million stamp duty paid to the UK treasury, recorded in general and administrative expenses; third, $60 million in transaction-related expenses recorded in professional fees; fourth, a net gain of $103 million, as we accumulated euros leading up to the closing of the transaction, which is recorded in non-operating income. You might recall we had a similar gain of $116 million last quarter, which we also excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment.","Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers, global payments volume in constant dollars grew 10%, roughly in line with the prior quarter when you adjust for the leap day. U.S. payments volume picked up modestly adjusted for the leap day, as we start to benefit from the USAA and Costco conversions, which helped credit growth to exceed debit growth in the U.S. International payment volume growth of 11% ticked down modestly.","The strong dollar continued to weigh on international payment volumes. Nominal growth was 5%. Despite Brexit, an oil price collapse, commodity market weakness, the slowdown in China, terrorism and other destabilizing forces, payment volumes have remained stable for most of this year.","Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars, a modest step up from a leap day-adjusted second quarter. As the strengthening trend in the dollar has moderated, we have seen a reduction in the rate of decline in our large U.S. acquired business and in outbound commerce from Canada. However, this improvement is largely offset by a continuing slowdown of outbound commerce from China, down from 50% growth rates in Q3 last year to barely positive right now. Cross-border commerce from oil and commodity-based economies remain sluggish.","Processed transactions totaled $19.8 billion in the quarter, up 10%. U.S. growth was 11% and international growth was 7%. As expected, international processed transaction growth rates are stepping up as we lap the transfer of domestic processing to NSPK in Russia.","As you know, these numbers are not inclusive of Visa Europe. In our operational package this quarter, we have included a schedule that provides you with a five-quarter history of the European geographies payment volume and transaction statistics. If we add these to our Q3 metrics both to this year and last, constant dollar global payment volume growth would be 9%. Cross-border volume constant growth calculated based on merchant country currencies would be 8%, and processed transaction growth would be 11%. Of course, starting next quarter, we will incorporate Europe as a new region in our operational performance data package.","Moving on to our financial metrics, service revenue grew 6%, roughly in line with nominal payments volume growth. The reduction in the growth rate from the last quarter was anticipated as we lapped pricing increases from last year. Data processing revenue grew 10%, in line with processed transaction growth. International revenues grew 4%, generally in line with volume growth, as we lap our price increases and the drag of the strong dollar moderates. Fortunately, currently volatility stayed high and comparable to the highs reached last year. Post the Brexit vote, volatility reached levels we have not experienced in recent years.","Incentives were in line with our expectations. As we indicated, the significant year-over-year increase was driven by an unusually low level of incentives in the third quarter of 2015. Incentives as a percentage of gross revenues approached 19% and will tick up further in Q4 as Costco incentives kick in. This will bring full-year client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to around 18.5%, at the high end of the 17.5% to 18.5% range that we had provided you.","With expense growth down 7% and a tax rate of 30.4%, our run rate EPS was $0.69 after making the four Visa Europe-related adjustments I described. As a reminder, there is no Visa Europe revenue, expense, or income in our Q3 numbers. Had we included Visa Europe results for the nine days we owned it in the quarter, it would have added a de minimis $12 million to our net income.","Some Visa Europe-related considerations, the European leadership team is in place, as Charlie said, and running the business. The business is performing as expected and integration activities have commenced. The employee consultation process, which is required by law before any restructuring of operations, is underway in the UK. The technology harmonization program has also been launched. We are moving fast to bring Visa's global capabilities to European customers, including Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Direct, as well as our consulting resources. Significant customer relationships have already been renewed and others are in process. We believe our customers are excited by what a global Visa can offer them.","Visa Europe members have been informed that rebates will terminated at the end of September 2016. We are working with our customers to transition to commercial relationships with competitive client incentive programs, as we have elsewhere in the world. This will be a multiyear process, but the early results have been positive.","The longer-term impact of Brexit on Visa Europe's business is too early to determine. The immediate impact has been on exchange rates. The weaker pound and euro will hurt revenues as reported in dollars. However, a significant portion of Visa Europe's expenses are currently denominated in pounds, which offsets the negative revenue impact. Given the relative value of the pound and the euro at this point, the net impact of Visa Europe earnings as reported in dollars is roughly neutral right now.","Brexit has also introduced significant uncertainty, which is never good for business sentiment. Most economic prognosticators are expecting an economic slowdown in Europe. Beyond this, it is too early to know what the broader and longer-term implications of Brexit are for our business.","Assuming exchange rates stay where they are today and there are no major economic dislocations as a result of Brexit, we expect Visa Europe earnings to offset interest expense from debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, as we told you last quarter. Visa Europe is expected to add 2% to 3% to EPS accretion in fiscal year 2017, in line with the low single-digit accretion we had anticipated.","Our accretion estimate assumes the current tax structure stays in place through fiscal year 2017. Under this structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. taxpayer. This tax structure is favorable from a cash tax standpoint. However, the current tax structure results in a high reported or book tax rate for Visa Europe's earnings. This will add approximately one percentage point to Visa's reported tax rate in fiscal year 2017. As always, we will be working on plans to improve both our cash and reported tax rates over time.","Visa Europe has over $2 billion of cash on its balance sheet. Based on discussions with our regulator in the UK, we will leave this cash within the Visa Europe legal entity. As a result of this action and due to the higher upfront cash consideration after we eliminated the earnout provision, we will issue additional debt later this year to fund stock buybacks to offset dilution from preferred stock issued in the transaction. Our current plan is to issue at least $2 billion in debt before the end of this calendar year.","As we indicated, we plan to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred shares issued by buying stock in excess of our normal buyback program. We have been buying stock back at a stepped-up pace for the past two quarters in anticipation of the closing of the transaction. We plan to continue buying at this pace until we have bought back sufficient stock to offset the impact of the shares issued. We expect that we will be done by the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2018.","In the third quarter, we recognized a $1.9 billion loss related to the Visa Europe framework agreement. Under U.S. GAAP, as part of our accounting for the Visa Europe acquisition, we are required to assess all pre-existing contractual relationships between Visa Europe and Visa. If the terms of those agreements are determined to not be at fair value at the time of the close, a portion of the purchase price paid in the transaction is deemed to relate to the effective settlement of these arrangements between the parties. The Visa Europe framework agreement was established in October 2007 between Visa and Visa Europe as part of our 2007 reorganization. This agreement provides Visa Europe with a perpetual exclusive right to operate the Visa business in the European Union in exchange for a license fee paid to Visa.","Under the terms of the framework agreement, the license fee paid by Visa Europe has increased modestly since 2007. However, the value of the Visa Europe business has increased at a greater rate. As such, management concluded that the terms of the framework agreement were not at fair value as determined under U.S. GAAP at the time of the close. We estimated the value of settling the framework agreement at $1.9 billion. The size of this settlement value was driven by the fact that the agreement was perpetual in nature and would have continued indefinitely had the acquisition not occurred.","Under U.S. GAAP, $1.9 billion of total consideration transferred to VE in the transaction is immediately charged to the income statement as a one-time non-recurring operating expense representing the cost of settling this arrangement. Had this arrangement not existed or its terms been at fair value, this amount would have been allocated to net assets acquired. This would have resulted in $1.9 billion additional goodwill recorded in the transaction.","Our third quarter balance sheet includes Visa Europe. In a few days we'll be filing our 10-Q, which will provide considerable detail on all aspects of the accounting for the Visa Europe transaction, allocation of the purchase price to net tangible assets and liabilities and to intangible assets and goodwill, as well as the impact of Visa Europe on cash and working capital balances. We would, of course, be happy to answer any questions you have after you review the 10-Q.","Moving to our outlook for the fourth quarter and the impact of Visa Europe, we expect nominal net revenue growth in Q4 for the legacy Visa business, not including Visa Europe, of around 5% to 6%, in line with the first half trends.","Q3 growth rates were depressed by unfavorable year-over-year comparisons on client incentives, which will normalize. We're also projecting a modest uptick in fourth quarter growth rates as dollar strength moderates and we lap the slowdown from last year. Visa Europe will add 13 to 14 points to fourth quarter net revenue growth.","We expect 2% to 3% expense growth for legacy Visa in Q4 from Rio-related marketing and higher technology project spend. Visa Europe will add as much as 15 to 16 points to expense growth. As I mentioned earlier and in line with what we told you last quarter, Visa Europe income should offset debt interest expense in the fourth quarter.","For the year, our key guidance metrics for legacy Visa remain largely unchanged. Visa Europe will add three to four points of growth to both revenue and expenses.","The consultation process is underway in Europe. We're also looking at adjustments to our global cost base as we integrate Europe. Assuming our plans are finalized, we expect to take a restructuring charge in the fourth quarter to resize our global cost structure as a result of the Visa Europe acquisition. As we have said previously, the technology integration will happen later. We will regularly update you on progress.","A quick word on fiscal year 2017. As we normally do, we will provide our comprehensive perspective on 2017 when we talk to you in late October. As we look ahead, we feel good about our business and what Visa Europe will add to it. There are, as always, tailwinds and headwinds. In the tailwinds column, payments volume uplift from USAA and Costco, two significant drags look likely to ease gas prices and the dollar translation impact, cross-border growth could improve as dollar strength moderates, and last but not least accretion from Visa Europe.","In the headwinds column, continuing global uncertainty, both economic and geopolitical, the impact of Brexit on Europe, China slowdown, and market entry costs. On balance, we anticipate 2017 will be a year with healthy top and bottom line growth for Visa.","With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Vasant. Operator, at this time we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Mr. Tom McCrohan of CLSA. Your line is now open.","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Thank you. A question on the PayPal agreements. One of the aspects of the agreement seems to be focused on having Visa being more of the default payment option, funding option on the PayPal account. So today what is Visa's share as the default funding option for PayPal accounts? Where do you believe this agreement is going to move that share? And what happens at the end of the 12-month period, exclusivity period, if Visa doesn't get the share that you expect it to get as a result of your negotiations? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Let me do a couple things, and Jack can chime in here too. Relative to what we make up of a PayPal wallet, you really have to ask PayPal that question because we know what we know and we have some general thoughts, but they really can be the ones and should be the ones. Generally, what we've always thought is that roughly half the transactions that run through PayPal run through a network, and we're roughly half or so of that, split between credit and debit, but I would call those gross approximations and directional, and you really need to talk to them.","Relative to what happens in terms of the flows, again, if you go through what I said, what we really are interested in doing is to ensure that Visa cards are on a level playing field. And if they're on a level playing field, we feel great about our ability to increase the amount of volume that run over Visa cards and ultimately benefit our clients. And so what the agreement does is it enables that to occur, and there's a period of time where we will work actively together and exclusively to move volume from ACH back on to Visa cards if that's what the client wants to do. And so to the extent that that happens, net-net that's a financial plus for us. As part of this agreement, as we've said, there are incentives that we will pay, Visa incentives that we will pay to PayPal. And if those numbers aren't reached, then the incentives don't get paid.","But the last thing I do want to say is partnership agreements work when there's alignment for everyone. And so we've had extensive conversations over a long period of time with PayPal, with our issuers, and other members of the payments community. And what we've tried to do here is to come up with something that really does work for everyone. And so where we could sit here and say this is all about driving growth in the electronic payments universe because we're creating better customer experiences, where they're allowed to use products that they want to use, where they get all the benefits of those products are and a seamless experience through PayPal, these products become a better alternative to cash and check and other alternatives out there.","So the way we see it, we've given ourselves an opportunity to grow, we've given PayPal an opportunity to grow. And most importantly, we've given from our perspective at Visa our clients an ability and opportunity to grow and provide a better experience for their consumers.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Tom. Operator, next question?","Operator","Our next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Mark Togut - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks and congratulations on completing the Visa Europe acquisition. Now that you own Visa Europe, can you update us on your thoughts with respect to the pricing opportunity there to move Visa Europe's prices over time closer to MasterCard's, which are currently at a significant premium?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't think there's much that we're going to add that we haven't said before on that. In the process of moving to a commercial enterprise, we obviously know what the market is. But we're also keenly aware that pricing should be reflective of the value that's added. And so I think that's a conversation that we'll have directly with our clients. And when it's appropriate, we'll talk more broadly about it.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks, guys, maybe just a quick clarification and then a question. Are you still expecting high single-digit EPS accretion from Visa Europe in fiscal 2020?","And then my question just on the PayPal agreement, it looks like it's U.S.-only. Is there still something potentially in the works for non-U.S. as well?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So on PayPal, it is U.S.-only. And I think we're each in the position where we'd like to turn our attention outside the U.S., but we wanted to get the U.S. done first.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And on the Visa Europe accretion, no, there's no change in our expectations for the long-term.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Perfect, thank you.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Jason. Next question please, operator?","Operator","Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Thanks for the update. I just want to go back to the timing you mentioned before around tailwinds. You mentioned a number of renewals also around large clients in your remarks. Incentives and rebates broadly were thought to be timed for the Costco and USAA deals I think early, followed by then revenue coming on in the next couple of quarters. So can you just provide us an update with the timing on those as the incentives are now flowing through, and should we get the revenue off that in the next few quarters? And then also, other types of incentives coming with those renewals, is there going to be any type of spike on that going forward? Thanks, guys.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I guess you were referring to the headwinds and tailwinds comments I had made. There was nothing there about renewals as it relates to next year. There is the normal course of renewals that we would do in the course of a year.","In terms of incentives kicking in, as I mentioned, Costco incentives will definitely kick in meaningfully in the fourth quarter with a quarter lag. As you know, service revenues kick in a quarter later. You will see in our gross revenue an uptick in the rate of growth both from USAA and Costco, and of course there will be an uptick also on the incentive line. And the net of all that, we'll talk about all that as we talk more comprehensively about 2017. Other than that, I don't think there was anything else I said that you were talking about. That pretty much explains the comments on 2017.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Perlin of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. I just had a question on the PayPal-Visa agreement. The participation now in VDEP, I just want to be clear. That does now qualify them for a different interchange tier, which would be lower. And then the incentive fee that you're talking about, just so I'm clear, that's coming out of your \u2013 that would come out of your contra-revenue. And do we need to be contemplating that more significantly in 2017?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So I just want to be \u2013 so VDEP, so just a couple things on VDEP. So what we've done is we have agreed with PayPal that they will have the ability to access Visa tokens. But in order to do that, they have to work with the financial institutions and they have to agree to provide those tokens. So what we've done is \u2013 think of it like we've enabled PayPal to have those discussions directly with the issuers, and that's up to the issuers to determine whether or not they would like to do that.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Katri of \u2013 let me check, of (43:40) Trading. Your line is now open.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, thanks. Just going back to Visa Europe, your large competitor is talking about opportunities for them to gain some share in Europe. Maybe you can give us some color on any sort of potential churn that you're seeing in that business, and what are we doing to protect that down the road? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Listen, there are a lot of people that do a lot of talking out there, and that's fine. We spend a lot of time talking to our clients and working actively with them on delivering value day in and day out and letting the results speak for themselves. I would say that from the moment that we've announced the transaction, I think we're extremely, extremely comfortable with the renewal activity that's taken place in Europe. The team in Europe I would tell you has \u2013 our team in Europe has delivered everything that they've said they would deliver to us, and that has continued in the period after the close.","Our conversations with clients I feel are exactly what we want them to be, which is they are very excited about having the opportunity to get access to the capabilities that the global Visa can bring, which Visa Europe was not able to bring. And so there are a lot of things that they liked about Visa Europe that encouraged them to do business with Visa Europe over a long period of time with those relationships, and we bring additional capabilities.","And so I look at the environment and say listen, everywhere we compete across the world, you have to show up with better products day in and day out, and that's what we're able to do in Europe. And until I see anything different than what we've seen, I'm going to continue to feel great about where we are.","Unknown Speaker","That's helpful, thanks.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Moshe. Next question, please, operator.","Operator","The next question is from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Your line is now open.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question on your comments around Interlink and dynamic routing. Can you just refresh our memory what to the extent the landscape has changed recently and what's causing the increased dynamic routing? My sense is there are some merchants who are using chip cards to take advantage of not just routing on PIN, but also routing on signature. And I wanted to see if you could potentially also discuss any legal aspects of the Kroger lawsuit as it relates to forcing consumers to choose PIN. Thank you.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not going to talk about anything regarding any ongoing litigation that we have, which I think is what you'd expect. But I'd say the following things. I think as we go through the conversion to EMV, there are a lot of moving pieces, especially in the debit world. With terminals having to be reprogrammed, new terminals out there, multiple applications embedded on chips and things like that, and merchants turning on PIN pads at different times from times when they've actually turned on the EMV reader. And so there's a lot of movement between signature and PIN, which is somewhat different than we would have seen in a steady-state environment, and that will play itself out. And that's not a plus or minus; there's just movement there. And that's just the reality of what happens during a conversion like this.","What we see is ultimately we just want our consumers to have the ability to use the cards. Merchants have whatever abilities that Durbin has given them, and they've had those capabilities ever since Durbin was passed. And a big part of that is they have the ability to choose the routing preference. And so as we've seen since Durbin came into place, quarter by quarter there's just a whole series of things that impact where a merchant wants to route to. People give them incentives. Whose incentives they think they're going to hit or not hit help them decide where they want to route to and route away from.","And so the Interlink volumes that we see, and we look at it regularly, are very volatile. And so just keep in mind that the numbers that I talked about which have that decrease, they're two weeks. And so someone can make a change in a routing table, we can see a very big impact. That can also change two or three weeks from now based upon what we do relative to incentives and things like that. And that is the way the business works, and I think that's the way the Durbin Amendment intended it to work.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Next question, operator?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Carcache of Nomura. Your line is now open.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Charlie, I wanted to follow up on your comment about Visa issuers having I believe you said 12 months of exclusivity to promote their brands on PayPal. Do you have a sense for what would lead issuers to want to take advantage of that period of exclusivity? And do you expect \u2013 you touched on this earlier. But maybe a different way of asking the question is do you expect that the partnership agreement is going to drive a little bit more of a shift in the mix of PayPal volumes funded by Visa products?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Listen, I guess the way I'd put it is I think \u2013 so first of all, it's completely up to the issuers on whether or not they want to proactively work with ourselves and\/or PayPal. Again, we're not telling any issuer they have to do anything. But what we've heard consistently from issuers, and I certainly experienced it when I was at one, is that ACH is a really bad thing. You're disintermediated. It's a bad customer experience. They don't understand the process to dispute things. Call centers don't understand information and things like that. And so given a choice, you'd rather have a transaction run over a Visa debit or credit product rather than ACH.","So I would assume that most issuers would choose to want to actively engage to try and move those transactions onto cards which, quite frankly, consumers know, love, understand and are very comfortable with how those products work. And so during this period of time, PayPal wants to work actively with us because to the extent that consumers want to do this \u2013 again, I can't speak for them, but consumer choice was an important part of the discussion in the press release, and that's what this actually provides.","So again, the way we look at, just as the network \u2013 but the way we look at what we've done in this agreement is we've taken \u2013 we've tried to work with PayPal in partnership to take away the things that discourage people from working together and take away the things that create bad customer experiences. And just when do you that in anything, hopefully you wind up with a position where people actually work together. And if you don't even just get back to \u2013 it should produce a higher level of growth coming from someplace else. And whether that comes from other networks, cash, check, any alternatives out there, we don't know. But that's what this agreement is. It's about taking those bad things out, providing a better consumer experience, and then the consumers will ultimately choose what they want to use. And again, as I said, we feel very comfortable that we'll do quite well in an environment like that, as our clients will.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Bill. Operator, next question?","Operator","The next question is from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes. Charlie, MasterCard is buying VocaLink. And I was curious if that has any incremental impact to you. Obviously, you dominate debit in the UK. I wanted to get your thoughts there. And also related to that, any early views on PSD2 and what that might mean to your debit volumes?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Listen, obviously they just announced it this morning, so it's very early. So I would say \u2013 and I honestly haven't had a chance to read what they've actually written, but I guess I'd just say a couple of things. And I think the same goes true for PSD2, which is \u2013 we as a network are successful not because we offer extremely low-priced commodity services with very little value-add. It's the exact opposite of that. And the ability for us to have grown the business that we've grown around the world is all about delivering value-added services, whether it's fraud protection, risk scoring, work on marketing, all those things. That's ultimately why people choose networks. And as I said, that's something that we need to deliver both not just to issuers, but ultimately to merchants, either directly or through the acquiring community.","And so to the extent that we do that, whoever we compete with, because remember, we've competed, as we've \u2013 we've competed with PayPal, which has had another way of doing business here. And in the physical world, we've done quite well and felt very comfortable with our ability to compete in the online world as we've developed these solutions. So for us, it's about creating that value, delivering on innovation. And I wouldn't underestimate the work that we have done at Visa on fast funds, push payments, and things that we're doing both in developed parts of the world and emerging parts of the world.","And so regardless of who buys what out there, those are activities that we had underway because there's tremendous opportunity. And I think those are the things that will allow us to compete, not just with an acquisition out there, but the types of people that will be able to insert themselves into the payment flow because of PSD2.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Don. Operator, next question.","Operator","The next question is from Lisa Ellis of Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. It looks like Visa Europe's volume growth decelerated again this quarter on top of I think a deceleration last quarter. Can you just talk about now that you've seen under the hood a bit, what's been driving the deceleration in their volume growth and how you expect that to look going forward, both now that you own the asset as well as in the wake of the regulatory changes in Europe? Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Lisa, Visa Europe's growth has generally tracked well with what we had anticipated. The business is performing pretty much exactly as we expected, if not a little better. And we've seen some \u2013 it's very early to assess the impact of Brexit. We haven't seen much change. We've seen other than the exchange rate impacts, which I talked to you about earlier, we've seen some modest impacts on the cross-border business, as you would expect. Inbound commerce into Europe and the UK in particular is picking up as a result of the exchange rate moves most likely, especially from Asia. Outbound from the UK is relatively stable in transaction terms. But as you would expect, when the currency moves, there is an impact on the ticket itself. But other than that, the business is performing almost exactly in line with expectations.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Operator, next question, please.","Operator","The next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. Good evening. A quick question on PayPal again. Is it safe to assume that you guys had conversations with the banks and that they were involved in the framework of a potential deal with them?","And then just maybe my follow-up related is, if the issuer tokens aren't used by the banks or applied by the banks, does that change the economic incentives part of the agreement? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the second question, no. And on the first question, listen, like any business, we have clients and we talk to them. And our clients have been very, very vocal \u2013 not in private to us \u2013 but publicly about what they've liked and what they haven't liked about the interactions historically with PayPal, as I've been. And so when asked, I've been very, very clear about what it is we don't like about PayPal. And I've also been very clear that we think that they've developed some great capabilities, have enormous respect for what they've created. And if we could fix the bad things, we'd be very excited about working together.","And so the things that we went about from our standpoint wanting to change are exactly those things. And so I don't think anyone should be \u2013 I'd be surprised if anyone here is surprised about what those things are. And there were some things that were important to PayPal. But as I said, ultimately this is about taking the roadblocks out and creating the opportunity for people to work together. But again, we're not putting anyone in a position where they have to.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Sanjay. Next question, operator?","Operator","The next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just two questions. I guess first on looking at one of the headwinds, it was market entry costs. So I guess I'm assuming that's China. And in June, China announced their rules for the networks to enter the market. So I guess I'm curious. Have you guys submitted your application yet and the next steps in China?","And then just secondly, Vasant, what has Visa Europe been growing at constant currency? And then what is your expectation in the fourth quarter guidance for Visa Europe constant currency year-over-year growth in 4Q? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So on China, I would say the clarity that we need to finalize all the information and submit all the pieces is still coming together. We have submitted pieces of what's required, but there are also some new things that have come forth that we're working through that relate to national security with reviews that are going to be necessary as well as encryption standards, which was something that was new that was added. So these are active conversations that we're having with the Chinese government. And we continue to do all of our planning so that when we do have clarity, we'll be able to submit everything that we need to.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","In terms of Visa Europe's growth, if you look, there's a schedule in our operational data package. I think it's on page six that gives you some historical data on Visa Europe's performance. So if you're talking about volume, payment volume, over the past \u2013 let's say the last quarter, constant dollar payment volume growth was 6.6%. And then over the last year, constant dollar payment volume growth was a little over 7%. So it has been fairly stable if you look at the numbers for the past several quarters. It swings up and down a bit along the way. We're not expecting anything different. We're clearly monitoring the impact of Brexit to see if there's any impact. It's really not evident at this point. It's minor. We'll have to keep watching it. But as far as it relates to the fourth quarter, we're not assuming any change in trend.","And in terms of its specific impact on us, you see that in the guidance we provided, where we told you that the revenue impact of Visa Europe on the quarter if you go to the table we have was 13 to 14 points of additional dollar revenue growth that would be added to our reported numbers because of Visa Europe, three to four points of additional revenue growth on a full-year basis. And as far as the income impact, we had told you last quarter and we are reiterating that that Visa Europe's income will offset the debt interest we had. So essentially it will make up for the debt interest in the quarter. So that's pretty much it.","Operator","The next question is from Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Yes, hi, thanks and congratulations for closing Visa Europe. I did have a quick question on the PayPal release. Just I was hoping you could explain how the V debt portion works in tokenization and how that will enable brick-and-mortar point-of-sale should an issue erupt. Are you just basically saying that PayPal will have the opportunity to wrap a Visa token within the PayPal wallet and then pass it through to a merchant like an Apple Pay would for Visa card acceptance?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Okay. So this in no way is enabling Visa to wrap any other type of funding mechanism in a larger Visa token for acceptance?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'm not sure I understand what you're asking, but what you described is exactly what's contemplated. To the extent that PayPal chooses to create an experience at the physical point of sale, if they can get the issuer to agree, just as an Apple Pay or a Samsung Pay or Android Pay, there can be a token provisioned to a device. And it will be \u2013 the transaction will take place as these other wallet transactions that use tokens.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Right, and so this would need to be a bespoke agreement between PayPal and an issuer. Okay, I understand. Thank you.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thanks, Craig. Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Thanks, Jack, kudos for getting this PayPal deal done. I was curious. Charlie, you said I think at our conference that PayPal can't be friend and foe, and so I was wondering. Does this deal mean PayPal is now 100% friend to Visa? Are there outs or end term dates in the agreement to call out? Also, does the deal change in any way your Visa Checkout strategy? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So the answer is it's a long-term agreement. We feel like we've addressed everything that we wanted to address, and it was a great conversation. We were both trying to get \u2013 again, as I said earlier, what we both wanted to get to was a point that PayPal, ourselves, and the issuers would look at it and say it's something that makes sense for all of us to work together. And that's based upon the fact that we're providing a better experience and the opportunities are greater than ever for consumers and merchants. So having everyone align is what we were after, and that's what we think we've done here. And so we feel very good that we're in a position, as I said, where \u2013 this is a framework where we can work happily together hopefully for a very long period of time because it's going to drive more growth. That's what it's all about.","It does not change our Visa Checkout strategy. Here too, I've been very consistent in saying that one of the things that we don't know is we don't know ultimately what experiences are going to win at the point of sale, either online or at the physical point of sale. And so given the fact that we are the global acceptance mark that's recognized more than any in the world, that's something where we should have a solution that leverages that acceptance and allows consumers to pay quickly and easily and securely in the manner that they're accustomed, and that's what Visa Checkout is designed to be.","But there are other payment solutions out there. We've talked about a bunch of them on this call, as is PayPal. And so what we want do is ensure that if we're working together under principles that we're happy with, which is what we've achieved here and what we have in the other ones that we support, then we want to enable multiple experiences. And ultimately consumers and merchants will choose which will win in the marketplace.","And so we're happy with the progress that we're making in Visa Checkout. We're glad we're doing it. Ultimately, what we're going to look at for success is how Visa usage is doing in the physical point of the world, online, and in mobile, secondarily where it's coming from, and ultimately that will help us make resource allocation decisions. But we want to be the enabler. We want the volume. We're doing lots of different things, and Visa Checkout is one of those things but it's not the only thing.","Jack Carsky - Global Head-Investor Relations","Thank you, Tien-Tsin, and thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has any follow-up questions, feel free to give Investor Relations a call.","Charles W.

Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.","Mike Milotich","Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everyone. And welcome to Visa's fiscal first quarter 2019 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR Web site.","Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's Web site and the Investor Relations section of our Web site. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.","Al Kelly","Thank you, Mike, and good afternoon to everybody. Thanks for joining us today. Let me start with the financial results before sharing some key highlights for the quarter. The company continued to perform well in the fiscal quarter with approximately 50 billion transactions under Visa network, driving $2.9 trillion in total volume.","Revenue growth was 13% and our key business drivers remain strong. Payment volume growth was 11% on a constant dollar basis. But please note that we modified our definition of payments volume this quarter to include all Visa directs use cases involving of Visa payment credentials. For your convenience, the historic growth rates have also been updated, and Vasant will touch on this in a little bit more detail.","For us, order growth on a constant dollar basis was 7%, slowing 3 percentage points from last quarter. Adjusting for the cryptocurrency purchases last year and a major e-commerce platform localizing volume within Europe, growth flowed just 1 point. Cross border is an area we\u2019re watching closely. Cross broader volumes flowed through the quarter and into January, and Vasant will provide a little more color on these trends. Process transaction growth was 11%, down 1 percentage point from last quarter; expense growth was 17%, primarily driven by personnel and marketing-related expenses; and EPS growth was 21%.","Let me briefly comment on holiday spending, starting in United States. Adjusting for Visa specific factors, spending during the holiday season in the United States was relatively strong. We've shown about the same growth we did last year, which was a strong year. Stronger debit spend growth was offset by weaker credit performance, which slowed later in the holiday season.","Retail growth was in line with last year, fueled mostly by e-commerce. E-commerce continues to grow more than 3 times faster than non e-commerce. However, e-commerce growth did decelerate moderately versus last year. E-commerce drove approximately one third of consumer spending, up 2 percentage points versus last year. In terms of key gains for sales, Black Friday was the largest shopping day, boosted by almost half of the spend via e-commerce. Black Friday was the third largest e-commerce shopping day in the holiday season.","Cyber Monday remains the largest email e-commerce shopping day and was the seventh largest shopping day overall in the holiday season. To give you a brief sense in the holiday and other major markets; Brazil and Australia saw a slightly stronger growth than last year; Canada's growth was similar to last year; and the growth in the UK slowed slightly. Reflecting on the quarter as well as the first few weeks of January, economic uncertainties related to the U.S. government shutdown, Brexit, Big equity market swings and the trade disputes in China are starting to have some impact on consumer spending.","I was glad to see the reopening of the U.S. government last Friday after 35 days. It\u2019s critical that a deal gets done in this three week period as I fear a second shutdown would have a further negative impact on consumer confidence and in turn on the U.S economy. Despite all the uncertainty across the globe and the recent cross border slowdown, our business performed well this quarter and we remain confident in our business performance over the medium to long term.","A corner stone of our long-term strategy is to deepen current client relationships and expand into new partnerships. In fact our performance is fueled by partnerships, whether it'd be our traditional financial institutions, FinTechs, commercial players, new payment flow partnerships or our sponsorship partners. As a B2B company with a great consumer brand, it is these partnerships that enable our continued growth and we\u2019re honored that company find value in the services Visa offers.","So let me start by sharing a number of client partnership deals executed this quarter that highlight Visa as a preferred partner across traditional clients, co-brands and FinTechs. Let me begin with the traditional brand deals. In Mexico, we signed a five year renewal with BBVA Bancomer, strengthening our strategic partnership with the largest bank in Latin America outside of Brazil. In India, we continued to lead the credit card market. During the quarter, we renewed deals with SBI card and ICICI, two of India\u2019s largest credit issuers.","In Australia, Visa will be the exclusive scheme for credit and debit card portfolios across Bank of Melbourne, Bank of Melbourne and Bank of Australia, which are all banks within the Westpac Group. Another great representation of partnerships and payments is demonstrated through our co-brand partnership. Co-brand partnerships bring together our merchants' brands as loyalty assets, and combine it with our payment network and our issuer partner assets. Across these types of partnerships, we had several wins in the quarter.","We executed a long term partnership with Air Canada, which is the largest co-brand portfolio in Canada. In Mexico, Costco converted their private label card programs to be 100% Visa. Visa won the co-brand partnership with Amazon in India, which is expected to be one of the largest credit card portfolios in the country as it matures in the next few years.","Lastly in Japan, we announced that LINE Pay co-brand card deal, which significantly expands the payment options for LINE Pay users. For those who may not be familiar, LINE is one of Asia's leading messaging platform and social network. Beyond co-brands, we continue to strengthen our projected footprint with our traditional acquiring and processing partnerships. Across India, we continue to work with local acquirers to expand access and strengthen consumer demand for electronic payment. To that end, we surpassed 1 million contacts with acceptance points in the quarter, and we now have 950,000 QR acceptance points.","In China, we executed a three year deal with Mckayla, one of the China's leading integrated financial services platform to open-up acceptance at 7 million merchant locations. In terms of processing, we were in close collaboration with various players in the Argentina payments ecosystem to complete the processing transition to VisaNet earlier this month. And in fact on January 25th, Visa began processing 100% of our Argentine transactions, enabling us to better serve clients with our products and our value added services.","Moving to new partnerships, FinTechs continue to be key enablers around the world in helping to extend access to electronic payments, open new acceptance, drive new payments flows and create new ways to pay and e-pay. Visa is increasing its reach and scope to address FinTech needs, both partnering directly with FinTechs, as well as platforms that service them.","In Turkey, we are partnering with Turkcell and their FinTech subsidiary Paycell to expand access to digital payment services by offering a Visa card integrated with their mobile wallet, which will provide financial services, such as money transfer, utility bill payments and acceptance at the point of sales. The service is targeted at addressing the 40% of the Turkish population that is under bank with a goal of reaching $10 million Paycell Visa cards in three years.","In Singapore, [Instram], a digital cross-border payments company powering local payments in over 55 countries will begin leveraging Visa's credentials for business and consumers by creating innovative products in payroll, travel and cross-border payments. In Africa, Flutterwave leveraged a suite of Visa capabilities, including digital prepaid card issuance, mobile payments, processing in Visa Direct to service both mobile money and bank clients. While Visa Direct has processed 100 million transactions across the 50 banking partners in Africa, it plans to grow across the continent reaching those who don\u2019t currently utilize electronic payment.","Also in Africa, Visa is partnering with GTPay, a prepaid processor and program manager focused on prepaid issuing in over 30 African countries. This partnership will enable faster time to markets for FinTechs and wallets. Visa continues to also invest in partners to innovating and grow our B2B payment offerings across both core card and new payment flow solutions.","In November, we announced our collaboration with Billtrust on their Bill Payment network designed to streamline the delivery of B2B payments to suppliers. The business payment network will provide financial institutions and corporate buyers with the ability to deliver digital payments directly to the suppliers' acceptance platforms. This collaboration reflect our increased focus on B2B accounts receivable and on improving the overall supplier experience when accepting B2B payments.","We\u2019re also continuing to expand our commercial card relationships globally. In Europe, Ixaris will shift their business to Visa and expand the range of virtual travel payment products it offers to online travel aggregators, global distribution systems and other participants in the travel industry. Ixaris is a leading technology provider for online travel agency solutions in Europe, and we're working with them on expanding their solution set into multiple regions. We also renewed our Citi commercial card partnerships by seven years in Europe and five years in Central Europe, Middle East and Africa. In Brazil, Itau announced the launch of the Visa Infinite corporate card, Visa\u2019s premier and premium commercial product. Itau is targeting top tier executive clients who need a business solution with expanded benefits that are more in line with their corporate travel habits.","In previous quarters, we provided an update on tap to pay, and we continue to see strong momentum with global contact list penetration of domestic face to face transactions. We've been constantly increasing and we continue to see 2% improvement quarter-over-quarter and an 8 point improvement year-over-year in the first quarter of '19, excluding the U.S. 44% of domestic face-to-face transactions that run over our network are now tap to pay.","In the United States, our partners are beginning to establish the foundation that will drive adoption and usage in the coming quarters. U.S. financial institutions are starting to issue more tap to pay card. Chase, our largest issuer plans to be issuing tap to pay cards in all credit and debit portfolios by the end of 2019. Additionally, Wells Fargo and Bank of America will start issuing tap to pay cards this year. Wells Fargo will start in the upcoming months and Bank of American will begin in the summer. For merchant acceptance, Target enabled tap to pay this month and Hy-Vee, a large grocer in the mid west also enabled tap to pay.","Visa Direct continues to expand use cases, geographies and usage by leveraging scale partners. Transaction count growth continues to be over 100%. Increasingly, large acquirers are seeing the value of offering Visa Direct. Notably, Visa is teamed up with Cielo, the largest acquirer in Latin America based in Brazil to start implementing real time disbursement capabilities to the Brazilian market. Once completed, they will be among the first to offer domestic originations. In Asia Pacific, ride or regional ride sharing app in Singapore started to offer driver disbursements facilitated through Stripe's Instant Payout feature.","In emerging markets, push payments allow consumers to use their enabled mobile applications to push money to a business account, conveniently using an alias, for example, a QR or a phone number for the payment of goods and services. Scan to pay, Visa's QR based payment solution launched in Cambodia in December. The launch was done in conjunction with five of the leading banks in the country of Cambodia. Scan to pay also advised in Ghana with the commercial launch planned for Tanzania this quarter. These launches showcase that scan and pay is expanding into emerging markets of all sizes and regions.","In terms of partnerships promoting our brand, we signed several partnerships to ensure our consumer brand remains healthy and top of mind. To that end, yesterday, we announced an extension of our 25 year relationship with the NFL by six years through the 2025 season. Our NFL sponsorship allows us to have tremendous reach to showcase our payment innovation across the United States for the benefit of our partners. This quarter, we also announced two new soccer partnerships, the Union of European Football Associations Women's football competitions through 2025 and the Confederation of African Football Total Africa Cup of Nations Tournament in 2019 and 2021. Similar to our other partnerships, we will leverage these partnerships to promote acceptance and showcase payments experiences at the tournament venues, and we will be able to share these rights with our clients.","Before closing, I'd like to briefly comment on a potential M&A deal in China and an update on U.S. merchant litigation. Visa made an all-cash proposal to acquire Earthport in December 2018. As you are likely aware, MasterCard made an offer late last week that was a bit higher and we're considering our options. And our further announcements will be made in due of course. Given that this transaction is governed by the UK takeover code, we will not be able to take any questions on Earthport or the potential transaction.","Relative to China, we filed Visa's domestic license application with the People's Bank in China last year, and we continue to work closely with the Chinese regulators and government to understand how to best proceed through the application promises. We realize there's been some recent market developments, but at this point, we can't comment on the structure of our China entity or potential partnerships given the sensitivity of the process.","In the U.S. merchant interchange litigation, we're pleased to share that last week the district court granted us preliminary approval of the damages class settlement. In terms of what happens from here, U.S. merchants will receive legal notice of the settlement, and an opportunity to opt out, and the court scheduled a final approval hearing for November.","In summary, we had a strong first quarter financially, it's important that the geopolitical challenges begin to get addressed, and we don\u2019t experience further erosion in consumer confidence that could impact cross-border spending as it has in recent weeks. That said, we have a very good business and we're committed to our strategy, continuing to invest in important growth initiatives. Through key sponsorships, we'll maintain our focus on strengthening our consumer brand. And together with strong partners, we continue to drive new payment flows, as well as expand electronic payment in the traditional consumer to merchant purchases.","To share a bit more detail on our Q1 results, I'll turn it over to Vasant.","Vasant Prabhu","Thank you, Al. We had a strong start to our fiscal year 2019 with EPS growth of 21% and net revenue growth of 13%, exchange rate shift versus prior year but a drag on net revenue and EPS growth of approximately 50 basis points.","A few points to note; as Visa business continues to evolve beyond purchases at merchants, we have updated our definition of reported payments volume to account for all new payment flows carrying the Visa brand. To-date, we had included funding or full payment volume related to Visa Direct, but not disbursement or push payment volume. Our payment volume now includes all Visa Direct disbursement volume. Where a transaction is processed straight through, i.e. it includes both a pull and a push in quick succession, the payments volumes is only counted once.","All prior periods have been adjusted to reflect the updated definition. This change added a little over half a percentage point to reported payment volume growth in constant dollars this quarter. There is a schedule in the operational performance data that shows the impact from this change on current and prior periods.","While growth rate flowed modestly from the prior quarter, payments volume and process transactions continued to grow at double-digit levels globally in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Cross-border growth rates, however, dipped to 7%. Lapping the spike in crypto currency purchases last year contributed 1 percentage point to the slowdown. The remaining two percentage point slowdown was within Europe or an intra-Europe cross-border transactions. These intra-Europe transactions have yields comparable to domestic transactions rather than a difficult cross-border transaction, hence a small revenue impact.","One point of the intra-Europe slowdown reflected general weakness across the EU. The other point was due to a pan-European e-commerce platform reorienting acquiring across countries, converting transactions from cross-border to domestic, again, with minimal revenue impact to Visa. The Cross border gross trend slowed significantly in December and this has continued into January, which I will talk about more in a few minutes.","Net revenue growth at 13% was very strong, helped by lower-than-expected client incentives. Visa timing moved some client incentives to the second quarter, shifting the equivalent to $0.01 in EPS between quarters. The new revenue accounting standard ASC 606 added approximately 1 percentage point to Q1 reported net revenue growth. The ASC 606 impact was larger this quarter than expected due to the timing of deals and client activities. The ASC 606 impact was partially offset by exchange rates, which were a 50 basis point drag.","As expected, expense growth was in the mid teens. ASC 606 added almost 2.5 percentage points to expense growth. Exchange rate impact on some balance sheet items added another point. Expense growth rate was moderate in future quarters, and we still expect full year expenses to grow in the mid to high single-digits on an adjusted basis. During the quarter, the U.S. Treasury issued guidance on how to apply new provision of tax reform that go into effect this year. Applying these GILTI and FDII provisions resulted in a lower-than-expected tax rate this quarter.","We bought 16.9 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $137.82 or $2.3 billion in the first fiscal quarter. Our board has authorized a new $0.85 billion share repurchase program, including this additional authorization, we currently have $9.8 billion available for share repurchases. Including our quarterly dividend of $0.25 per share, we returned approximately $2.9 billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter.","Moving now to a review of the key business drivers in the first fiscal quarter. Payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 11%. As I mentioned earlier, the inclusion of disbursement of push payment volume added a little over half percentage point to reported growth. This reflects solid underlying growth globally, particularly in the debit business. Credit was up 9%, debit was up 13% in constant dollars. Latin America, EMEA and Asia-Pacific ex-China, all had stronger growth versus the last quarter. Europe and Canada slowed moderately, while U.S. growth decelerated by almost 2 percentage points.","Total U.S. growth was almost 11%. Growth remains strong in debit at 13%. Debit growth was consistent with the last quarter both including and excluding Visa Direct disbursement volume. However, credit growth of around 9% slowed almost 3 percentage points versus last quarter. Credit growth slowed approximately 1 percentage point due to conversion, in particular, Cabela's, which started this quarter. Lower fuel prices contributed about half a point to the credit slowdown. The remaining credit deceleration was across multiple categories, particularly in travel and home improvement.","Credit growth was particularly soft in the second half of December. International payments volume growth in constant dollars was stable at 11%. Growth rate stepped up in Brazil, Japan across most of EMEA and in many parts of Europe. This was offset by slower growth in Australia as we lap win, as well as the Middle-East, UK and France. The rate of decline in Chinese dual branded card volume was consistent with last quarter. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% and slowed through the quarter. This is 3 percentage points lower than last quarter, primarily due to the drive from lapping the spike in crypto currency purchases last year, as well as into Europe volume. Again, the inter Europe slowdown has only a minor effect on revenue. Excluding these two items, U.S. outbound spend accelerated as the dollar strengthened. Outbound spend also accelerated in Japan and the Middle-East but decelerated in Canada and Russia as the currency has weakened.","In-bound commerce into U.S. flowed into the low single digit with the strengthening dollar. In-bound commerce into Europe remains strong and consistent with the last quarter. Growth in inbound spend to the Caribbean accelerated as we lap depressed growth last year due to the hurricane, which caused travelers to choose other destination. Process transaction growth of 11% is down 1 percentage point versus last year, mostly driven by the U.S. Growth in the U.S. slowed in line with credit volume. Growth slowed in Brazil as we lap processing wins, which is partially offset by the processing gains in Argentina. Growth also slowed in the UK consistent with the slowing spend growth, given the high levels of uncertainty as we approach the Brexit date in late March.","A quick review of first quarter financial results. Net revenue grew 13%. As I mentioned earlier, net revenue growth benefited from delays in client deals. Exchange rate shifts lowered Q1 net revenue growth by 0.5 percentage points, which is offset by a 1 point benefit from the adoption of ASC 606. Service revenue grew 9% in line with nominal payments volume growth last quarter. Data processing revenues were up 15% as we continue to benefit from pricing changes made last year. International revenue increased 11%, benefiting from lapping low currency volatility last year.","Also, as I described earlier, some of the cross-border deceleration in the first quarter was driven by slowing inter Europe volumes, which have only a small impact on international revenue. Other revenue grew 30%, primarily driven by the adoption of ASC 606, but also helped by increase client adoption of some of our value added services.","Incentives as a percent of gross revenue at 20.9% are lower than our outlook range this quarter but in line with last year. Incentives were lower-than we expected, primarily due to deal delays but also due to low volumes in some parts of the world. We expect to see an uptick in incentives as a percent of gross revenue in the remaining quarters based on timing of deals.","Operating expenses grew 17%, primarily driven by personnel and marketing costs. Personnel expenses were lower in the first quarter of last year as we ramped up investments through the year. In addition, we increased our 401(k) match in the U.S. and acquired Freedom in the second quarter last year. Marketing expenses grew 24%, of which approximately 13 percentage point is related to ASC 606. Marketing growth is lapping low first quarter spend in fiscal year '18, leading up to the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup. As I mentioned earlier, exchange rates impact on some balance sheet items contributed 1 percentage point to expense growth and ASC606 adoption added almost 2.5 points.","Non-operating expenses were lower than expected due to higher interest income on our cash balances. In addition in the quarter, we entered into forward contracts, swapping some of our U.S dollar debt to euro denominated debt reducing interest expense. The euro forward contracts are a liability, partially offsetting foreign currency exposure from our euro denominated assets. Our tax rate for the quarter was lower than expected at 18%. During the quarter, the U.S. Treasury Department provided more clarity on the application of tax reform rule related to FDII and GILTI, which go into effect this year. This lowered first quarter tax rate by more than 1 point.","With that, a few perspective about the second quarter and the rest of fiscal year 2019. First, let me share growth in our business for the first three weeks of this quarter. Through January 21st, U.S. payment volume growth was 10% with U.S credit growing 8% and debit 12%. Process transactions grew 12%. U.S. credit payments volume growth has recovered from the dip we saw in the second half of December. Cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 2%, which is similar to the trends we saw in December. Adjusted for the cryptocurrency spike and the impact of e-commerce platform shifting intra-Europe transactions to domestic, cross-border growth was around 6%, again, in line with the December trend.","What are some of the factors driving this cross border slowdown? In the U.S. the inbound commerce growth rate is now negative. As the dollar strengthened in mid-2018 inbound commerce to the U.S. started to slow and this has continued. Commerce from Canada, Latin America, China, Australia and Europe, excluding the UK, has been particularly soft. Outbound commerce on the other hand continues to be very robust, helped of course by the strengthening dollar. Internationally, corridors that slowed significantly through December and January include outbound commerce from Canada, Mexico and Argentina, most parts of Asia, excluding Japan, Russia and sub-Saharan and Africa. Commerce into Brazil slowed sharply as is commerce into China. Growth within the EU is flowing as well as parts of the Middle East.","In terms of the causes of the slowdown, exchange rate and the period of reduced cross-border activity appear to be the primary drivers. As always, there are some unique factors in specific corridors. It is too early to determine if this slowing trend will continue to stabilize or turnaround. For the moment, we're assuming the January cross-border growth rates will persist through the second quarter and possibly beyond. The impact of the crypto currency spike will faced through the second quarter. The impact of that EU platform shifting intra-Europe transactions to domestic will continue but it has a minor revenue impact.","In October, when we provided our outlook for fiscal 2019, we have indicated that the cadence of net revenue growth would not be steady through the year. While our outlook for the year was for low double-digit net revenue growth, we anticipated high single-digit net revenue growth in the middle quarters with the lowest growth in the second quarter. This was driven by a variety of factors that impact year-over-year comparison like exchange rate shift, client incentive growth, and currency volatility trends.","The second quarter of fiscal year 2018 benefited from a sharp weakening of the dollar, resulting in an exchange rate tailwind of approximately 1.5 percentage point and 11% cross-border growth. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2019, we expect exchange rate to be a 1 percentage point drag, a 2.5 point swing year-over-year. The cross-border growth rate is in the lot of single-digit through the first three weeks of January.","As I mentioned earlier, some incentives have shifted into Q2 from Q1 due to deal delays. In addition, the positive net revenue impact from adopting ASC 606 will be much lower in the second quarter than it was in the first. Based on current exchange rate, recent cross border trends and the other factors I just mentioned, Q2 net revenue growth is likely to be at least a point lower than we had accepted in October. Some caution is call for given the many un-resolved tissues that are coming to ahead in the second quarter; continued uncertainty over how to stand-off between the Presented and Congress is resolved over the next three weeks; the upcoming deadlines for China and U.S. tariffs on March 1st and Brexit on March 29th.","There could be some volatility as we navigate through these complex issues and the uncertainty they create for businesses and consumers. We are maintaining our outlook for the full fiscal year at this point. We think it's too early to definitively conclude that a change in outlook has called for. We do think in the next several months could provide more clarity since many of the significant issues that have weighed on market for the past few weeks and months are coming to ahead. We hope as I'm sure you all do that these uncertainties are largely resolved by the time we talk to you again in April.","We've had a strong start to the year with 13% net revenue growth and 21% EPS growth. As we have in the past, we'll love to pull all the levers we have available to deliver on the commitments we have made to you.","With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.","Mike Milotich","Thank you, Vasant. We are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from David Toget with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Toget","Thank you. Appreciate all of the helpful call outs. Could you give us some sense of what some of the positive factors might be for the rest of the year with respect to cross-border? You've definitely called out all the risk factors. What could be possibly in the plus column?","Al Kelly","We look at domestic volumes around the world in the last quarter, and they actually were quite good. Three of our regions had double-digit growth. And if you exclude China from Asia Pacific, it also grew double-digits. And Canada and Europe are about 8.5% growth. And domestic volume is seemly holding up quite well. Even in the U.S. where we saw some slow down in face to face retail and gas at the back end of quarter, categories like restaurant and QR continues to hold at very healthy level. So I think that, as Vasant said in his remarks, we\u2019re not exactly sure what the dynamic is with cross-border and whether -- and we practically don\u2019t have enough of a trend volume to really draw any conclusion. But we do think that underlying economics look pretty good, especially when looking domestic performance. But we do think that people have been spooked a bit by all of the different geopolitical factors that we discussed when you look at two of their largest economies in the world, the U.S and the UK, suffering through a shutdown and Brexit, that\u2019s got to add and he said it's for an ongoing period of time. It's got to have some impact on how people think about their travel outside of their domestic country.","Vasant Prabhu","I mean the other factor clearly as we've always said exchange rates matter a lot and clearly some stabilization or even weakening of the dollar would be a meaningful tailwind. You saw that last year, we had a weakening trend going into our second fiscal quarter, and we had a sizable impact on our cross border growth rate. So it\u2019s a combination of we think. Some of the uncertainty is that we're all coming to ahead in the next few weeks and at least recent trends in the dollar could be helpful as we look ahead. So we'll wait and see.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess I got two questions on cross-border. One, that gap between the international revenues and the volume growth widened? Can you just call out what specifically that was, and whether or not it sustained sales over the next few quarters? And then secondly, as far as cross-border volume trends, has that ever shown to be an indicator of global macroeconomic trends. What leading indicator has that been by the data that you've seen? Thanks.","Vasant Prabhu","In terms of the 11% growth in international revenues relative to the cross border volumes you saw, it all depends on which corridors cross border trends are -- where are the strong corridors and the weaker corridors. As we said in the comments, some of that slowdown 2 points of it was all intra Europe, and in some cases it was linked to e-commerce platform reorienting acquiring. That while its affects we reported volume in that intra-Europe transactions that considered cross border for reporting purposes, the way the economics work from a revenue standpoint, doesn\u2019t really change very much. So those are relatively benign changes that don't have a revenue impact, that\u2019s one part of the reasons. The other is if you look at currency volatility last year in the first quarter versus this year, we did have relatively low volatility last year relative to this year, and that helped a bit in the first quarter. Volatility was higher in the second quarter last year, so it won't help as much in the second quarter. So those are some of the factors.","Al Kelly","I would say there's a third factor, which is we said in our remarks that we saw the decline happened through the quarter. So they're at the beginning parts of the quarter. We saw a performance that was more similar and what we had been seeing in the prior quarter. So what we're calling out was a trend that we're starting to see towards the back end of the quarter, and into the first three weeks of January.","Vasant Prabhu","And there was a second question. ","Sanjay Sakhrani","Around being the cross-border leading indicator?","Vasant Prabhu","As Al said, I mean the domestic volumes are quite robust as you saw, and even the three weeks in the U.S. after what was some softening in the second half of December recovered to if you adjust for conversions and gas prices very much to where they were in the first quarter. So there is no evidence in the domestic volume, the broader economic weakness. It is strictly right now in the cross-border trend. So I'm not sure we would be able to tell you that it is a leading indicator of anything other than perhaps uncertainty about certain more recent events that Al referred to.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ryan Cary","I wanted to ask about how you were thinking about U.S. credit volume growth going forward. It sounds like growth moderated towards the end of the quarter. And while it seemed to recover a little bit through the first three weeks of January, it seems to still be a little bit below recent levels. Is there anything in particular to how you are thinking about it going forward for the rest of the quarter and maybe even beyond? Thanks.","Al Kelly","The Cabela's conversion started to happen in the latter part of the first fiscal quarter. So if it looks lower than it does, you have to adjust it for conversion, which will impact the full quarter in the second quarter. If you adjust for conversions and you adjust for gas prices, or you leave gas prices in, because the effect is roughly the same as it was in the first fiscal quarter. We are pretty close to where we were running in the first fiscal quarter. So in that sense, the small reduction you see in the growth rate for the first three weeks is more linked to the impact of conversions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Just on the given what you talked, and thanks for all of that detail around the changes in consumer confidence. So I'm just curious is the defensiveness of the business is -- can you maybe update us on the ability for Visa and you're willing this maybe to protect the bottom line if macro does take a turn for the worst. I know that business has changed, your investments have changed, etcetera. I just want to know that if you could comment on it?","Al Kelly","We will continue to do all we need to do to make sure that we are delivering for both -- for investors both in the year and the out years. So that certainly mean being very, very careful about as appropriate and as we see, whether this is a trend or it's not a trend or it reverses, we don't know. But we certainly do some sales tightening, but it would be balancing act, because it is important that we continue to invest in areas where we think we're going to get sustained good performance in the out year. So we absolutely will look at all of our investments and all of our expense lines to make sure that we\u2019re battening down the hatches where we need to. And I think if you go back historically and look at some past periods, we demonstrated our ability to do just that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Harshita Rawat","My question is in B2B. So with the last year or so, your peers have accelerated your partnership and investments in the states of Billtrust, the Bottomline partnerships, B2B Connect rollout and your Virtual Card business still be growing very nicely. So my question is, what has changed in the market place and your approach to B2B in the last few years to trigger your investments in this space? And my follow up to that is, has this lead to the rethink of your strategy and buy versus build to grow after this enormous market?","Alfred Kelly","I think what really more happened is that, we made a concerted effort, probably starting 18 months or so, now maybe a little bit longer than that to really double down and invest in B2B and really run as a business unit. We have a head of B2B as of 18 or so months ago that reports to Ryan McInerney, our President. We actually built in entire team, focused on it. We are fully confident and thinking about the three different segments that exit within B2B small businesses, big side business and large multi nations. As you know in this space, it is not homogenous. Each, industry vertical is different with different needs and we\u2019re increasingly conscious of that.","We\u2019re certainly looking to build more partnership and I think that we made to your question around build versus buy. I think we\u2019re in the mode of -- we\u2019re very committed to this business and where we will look at every opportunity to both build, capabilities and products that we think our clients would value and that would help digitize more payments and move them away from cash and check and wire transfers. But we will also be both opportunistic as growth is pro active if necessary and looking at potential acquisitions.","Vasant Prabhu","As you know, there are new capabilities that Visa Direct has offered us that apply to the B2B space. There are new capabilities that B2B Connect offers us that we applying to B2B space. And then as Al said, some important partnership in the last few months has also added to our capabilities. So, it\u2019s a continuous focus that we had for a few years, but as technologies evolved our capabilities have expanded.","Operator","Next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","I had a Visa Direct related question. I mean the growth rate there over a 100% is pretty extraordinary within Visa World, and I think we were looking at U.S debit volume as now sequentially accelerated for five straight quarters which I think is heavily Visa Direct driven. So just a more sort of strategic or positioning question, can you compare and confess the functionality of Visa Direct verses Fast ACH meeting in which ways is Visa Direct better or different? And what's prohibiting Visa Direct from being applied into used cases like bill pay or payroll or electronic checks that are heavily ACH today?","Alfred Kelly","So Visa Bank, it will be -- now, Visa Direct is definitely going to contributing to debit growth in the U.S. and even outside of the U.S. Looks, it is not exactly the same as real time payments types of capabilities would probably two gaps. One is around the ability to reach as all bank accounts in the world. And the second is kind of the packet of information that's it travels with it. But Visa Direct is operational today, it can deliver most of that again cross-border transactions to this 2 billion Visa debit cards are around the world, and many of those are enabled for fed funds. It's global it's been able to over 70 countries and this last time we said Visa Direct and we send funds through Visa Direct over a 150 countries.","Things like ACH are market specifics so somebody would have to stream together a group of countries at partnership for acquisitions, which certainly can be both tricky and time consuming. Visa Direct runs on as part of this and that sort of has the leverage of all of our AML KYC types of capabilities as well as our cyber security types of capabilities that were able to leverage all of that. So I'd say that Visa Direct is a great example of strategy to continue to improve and use VisaNet, our core authorizations process -- authorizations clearing and settlements, but that doesn\u2019t mean that as warranted, we will be looking to get involved in adding value and planning in the real time payments space as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mike Del Grosso with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Mike Del Grosso","Similar to the previous caller on Visa Direct, can you comment on some of the growth drivers and use cases within that? Is it still to P2P that's the predominant used case? Are you starting to see uptake in healthcare and disbursements et cetera?","Alfred Kelly","So as a reminder, at least that as a moment, there is a number of used cases, P2P is one, disbursement is another. Bill pay is other and payments to largest is four. I think as we initially got into and powered things like Venmo and Square Cash and Zelle and other P2P platforms around the world. P2P was the first scale used case of Visa Direct, but increasing flushing this gig economy. There is a lot of applications that have been developed to facilitate end of shift, end of day, end of week kind of real-time payments to the people working in the gig economy.","We're certainly seeing some growth in the Bill Pay and we've got a whole sales force out else looking for other used cases and signing of it partnership. So I think that as we continue on, you're going to have a wider range -- array, I should say of used cases that are contributing significant levels of growth to Visa Direct and we\u2019re continuing. We\u2019re already seeing that expansion and the growing of the breath of new stages for the product.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open.","Dave Koning","Just two quick things. I guess cross-borders have slowdown in the last, I guess, few weeks and last quarter. Was at more travel related or was that more e-com? And then the second question, was the ASC 606 impacting the other revenue segment?","Vasant Prabhu","Yes, the ASC 606 impact in total was about a point on revenue growth and the biggest chunk of it would be the other revenue line. That\u2019s where most of it should show up and then some of it on the incentives line. So it's mostly between the other revenue line and the incentives line. So, it's higher other revenue due to this and somewhat lower incentives because they are reclassified due to this and I explained most of it.","In terms of the cross-border growth, we gave you a fair amount of color in the comments. And by and large, it\u2019s a cross-border segment but perhaps a little more on the face-to-face segment than in the card, not present segment. Other than that it's along the line of the things we described.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Maurer with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open.","Craig Maurer","Two quick questions. First, could you comment on corporate card or business spend, is that can be a leading indicator for the consumer economy? And secondly, what was the -- what is the specific capabilities you\u2019re targeting by going after Earthport? Just to understand what might or might not come Visa's way depending on actions you take?","Alfred Kelly","Craig, on the latter as I said, given that we're governed by the U.K takeover code, we're just not able to response to any question or anything to do with Earthport at this point in time.","Vasant Prabhu","In terms of over card spend, at least first fiscal quarter, there were no indications in the corporate card spend to suggest a change in trend.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Bob Napoli","Question on just on cross-border and I guess the trends there and the battle I guess over your M&A offer to acquire Earthport and your competitor going after the same. What is -- are you seeing -- do you expect to see more market share shifts in cross-border? And are the stakes being raised from a technology perspective? What are you going after? What do you need to really build that business and make that a consistent growth business that's obviously a very profitable business for you?","Alfred Kelly","Bob, I will just add through this, inside of more of a strategic level. The cross-border is important to us. We look at many partnerships and any at all technology that would where we can get value and participate in the movement of funds from one geography to another geography. So in short I would, I'd be safe to say that, we certainly wouldn\u2019t leave any rock unturned. And that said, we were doing that in Q1 of '18. We're going to do it in Q1 of '19 and we're going to do going forward. We did it in the last quarter. If that's all related to this very recent trend that we've seen in terms of cross-border performance, so we are not running through anything differently because of what we're seeing in terms of attacking and being committed to cross-border, nothing is going to change. But we saw the slowdown just as if it accelerates. There is nothing we would change. We would be continuing to be very, very focused on it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.","Don Fandetti","So, Vasant, on the '19 guidance for reve growth, I guess what's the most sort of important factor you are looking at? Is it the cross-border I mean your overall volumes were relatively solid? And are you -- do you have a little bit of wiggle room? How close are you -- can you just dig in a bit on that?","Vasant Prabhu","So I don\u2019t think there is much more we would add to what we said in the comments. We have started the year with 13% revenue growth and that was better than we might have expected. Yes, we've seen some cross-border slowdown in the last few weeks. It is, as we said in the comments, it's too early to tell whether this trend is going to moderate or turnaround.","Fundamentally, all other dimensions of business really are tracking as we expected, when you look at same volumes transactions growth et cetera. There really wasn\u2019t any meaningful change in trend. So, based on all that, as we said in the comments, don't see any reasons to adjust our full-year outlook at this stage as again. The one change kind of been in one particular area and it's too early to know what happen there.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller","Just a little more clarification on the spread between revenue growth and the volume growth in cross-border, I know you touched a bit on Europe being a contribution to that. I think you said it was couple of hundred basis points. Was there other variables on maybe pricing or anything else? And then just thinking about keeping that gap bridged going through the year assuming cross-border where to say and the range it is now on the revenue side, is that sustainable? And then actually just quickly on e-com contribution to cross-border today versus where it's been in the past?","Vasant Prabhu","In terms of the delta, I mean, they real move from quarter-to-quarter between volume and revenue growth. In terms of pricing, we told you what kind of pricing we are doing this year and most of the pricing will become effective in the second half of the year. So, yes, it will impact the international revenue line to some extent and that could have an impact in terms of the delta between volume growth reported and revenue growth reported.","On the margin, levels of volatility, differences within one year to another would have some impact. The biggest impact really is which corridor is a most effective, which one is a strong, which one is weak. And all those factors go into whether as a delta between volume growth and of course exchange rate of course, big factor.","You've seen areas there that gap is really widened one way or another if it anyone exchange rate, so of all the factors I mentioned exchange rates is probably the most significant variable that drives the difference between volume growth and revenue growth on the international revenue line.","Operator","Our next question today comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","James Faucette","I wanted to ask a higher level question and that\u2019s around ongoing investment in FinTechs by some of the market participants from China et cetera. Have you seen any change or potential disruption from around the world in some of the places that AliPay and Tencent and another are investing, as they try to also get into the payments area outside of China? I know we heard about investment in places like India and Latin America et cetera. And so I\u2019m wondering, if you're seeing any change in opportunity set or competitive environment from that perspective?","Alfred Kelly","I think, outside of China, I think it's early days to comment. And in fact as you probably know, there has been a lot of changes inside of China that both AliPay and WeChat obviously deal with in terms of the PBOC pretty much for description and on then forcing processing through a local Chinese switch. They're in fact making them hold to our capital related to the balances in the stage wallet. So they are putting some changes on the yield, they can offer under mutual fund. So, there is whole bunch of changes as they might be somewhat preoccupied with in terms of the deal with from a change prospective in China itself.","That said, I still expect them to continue to look to grow outside of China mostly in Asia. I will tell you that our business in India was up over 30 points in the last quarter and we\u2019re continuing to -- we're continuing to be the market leaders in India. We're continuing to grow acceptance point, as you heard in my remarks, we saw, renewed two deals with two of the very large banks in India. So, certainly, we\u2019re very pleased with the fact that our business is still moving along and growing at a very healthy pace in one of the market that at least prevailing wisdom is. That is the target for basically FinTechs players AliPay and WeChat.","Mike Milotich","And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today.

And as always, thank you for joining us. I plan to walk you through 3 key areas during today's call. First, I'll provide a brief update on Visa's financial performance and outlook, including some perspective on key environmental and event-specific factors that could impact our business over the balance of fiscal 2012.","Following that, I'll walk through our progress of growing Visa's core business both in the United States and internationally, including an update on U.S. debit. And finally, I'll discuss Visa's investments and innovation, which can help us expand our core business and generate new revenue streams.","Visa's global enterprise outpaced our own expectations during the first quarter, an encouraging opening to our fiscal year. Net operating revenues were $2.5 billion, a 14% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by robust growth in our international businesses, continued resilience in U.S. credit, sustained cross border spending and strong e-commerce growth. Net income for the quarter was $1 billion, a 16% increase over last year. This equates to diluted earnings per share of $1.49 or a 21% increase over the first quarter of 2011.","Overall, our first quarter performance clearly demonstrates the strength and resilience of Visa's global model and our ability to grow even in a challenging global economy. While we look ahead to the rest of fiscal 2012, it is clear we must carefully navigate a complex and uncertain business environment. ","We see signs of modest global GP -- GDP expansion for the rest of our fiscal year, with emerging markets continuing to grow at rates faster than the global average. That being said, we are closely watching the economic conditions that could impact our business, including continued volatility in Europe.","Additionally, we are still working through the implementation of debit regulation in the United States. I will provide details shortly. But it's fair to say, the dust is still settling.","Overall, Visa is successfully executing its plan, and I continue to be encouraged that the net impact is consistent with our guidance outlook. ","Taking these macro and issue-specific factors into account, as well as our better-than-expected first quarter, we are raising our FY '12 revenue guidance to low double-digit growth from high single to low double-digit growth and our adjusted diluted earnings per share guidance from mid to high teens to just high teens.","As I stated last quarter, we are reaffirming our belief that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to the U.S. debit regulation, and growth in 2013 will accelerate off of 2012 levels. And based on that outlook, we continue to deliver our commitment to return excess cash back to shareholders.","We used $1.6 billion of our operating cash to reduce the as-converted Class A common stock by 16.2 million shares during the 3 months ended December 31, 2011. Of the $1.6 billion, $75 million was used to repurchase Class A common stock in the open market, while we deposited $1.57 billion of our operating cash into the litigation escrow account previously established under the retrospective responsibility plan.","Looking ahead, our board has authorized an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization. ","Before moving on to our business update, I'd like to briefly address the merchant litigation in the United States.  Although I'm constrained to discuss the details due to the confidential mediation process, I can tell you that I believe that with the court's assistance, progress is being made towards resolution of all issues.  After our latest escrow deposit in December, we now have an uncommitted balance of $4.3 billion in our litigation escrow account, which is consistent with our view of the current status of mediation discussion.","Visa is unwilling to agree to any significant or long-term credit interchange rate reductions or any settlement agreement that doesn't provide a full resolution to that and other key issues. Although progress is being made, there are uncertainties, which continue to exist. And accordingly, in our judgment at this time, the company believes that the loss is not probable and estimable under GAAP. ","Now let's turn to the business update.  During the first quarter, Visa continued to accelerate the migration to digital currency by successfully executing our growth strategy of expanding our core credit, debit, prepaid and commercial businesses, expanding acceptance, extending our international reach and aggressively investing in innovative next-generation payment technology.","Worldwide, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes grew 12% and 9%, respectively, on a constant dollar basis this past quarter. ","In the United States, volumes on all Visa products grew 7% during the quarter. In regard to our U.S. debit business, I feel very good about where we are and the progress we've made adapting our business to the new debit regulation. We are making the best of an obviously negative event.","That being said, I'd like to share some important observations. Historically, we have always been a clear leader in the U.S. debit market and thus, are the primary participant with downside risk. As we have acknowledged previously, regulation will reduce Visa's U.S. debit volumes. The new legal requirements are changing competitive dynamics and requiring all issuers to place competitive marks on their cards in order to comply with the law. While the law doesn't require compliance until April, some issuers have already begun to make a change. ","The deceleration of our U.S. debit volume growth during the first quarter was early sign of this impact, driven by slower growth in PIN transactions and an expected deemphasis by issuers of debit card marketing and debit rewards programs. ","A key driver of this slower growth was one major financial institution's decision to remove Interlink from the back of their cards, which began in the fall as part of their own plan to comply with the regulation. They and Visa will be able to compete for PIN transactions with the PIN authentication available on Visa check cards.","While we are taking these impacts seriously, let me also be clear about a few additional facts that give me confidence about our long-term growth as we advance our debit strategy in the new environment.","To begin with, we are making steady progress advancing our strategies with issuance and merchant routing. We are aggressively pursuing a backup card strategy that adds Interlink to many existing cards that currently carry competitive brands. In fact, we're poised to sign new agreements with major financial institutions to secure backup card placement. We look forward to updating you on our progress securing these decisions in the coming quarter.","At the same time, we remain on track to maintain our front of card issuance relationships, and in fact have extended the majority of those major relationships to 2015 and beyond. Signature transactions generate a far larger share of our U.S. debit revenue and offer greater revenue yields. This is particularly important as we see no sign of a wholesale shift to PIN debit by the merchant community and our signature debit volumes were resilient during the first quarter.","On a parallel track, we are moving forward with strategies to compete for merchant routing decision. One key aspect of that plan is Visa's previously announced program for modified acceptance economics in the United States, which we believe will offer merchants greater incentive to route transactions over our network and an opportunity to lower their per unit transaction's cost. As a next step in our implementation plan, we will share specifics with acquirers and merchants later in the month. ","Our updated 2012 guidance takes all of these factors into account, including some loss of debit share and I'm confident that we have appropriately scoped the impact of Durbin. ","As stated earlier in my remarks, we expect that 2012 will take the brunt of the impact related to U.S. debit regulation and we still expect growth in 2013 to accelerate off of the 2012 levels. ","Bottom line, I'm confident we are moving in the right direction. We have a smart debit strategy and we are executing it successfully.","Now let's focus on credit products in the United States, which performed very well during the quarter. Payment volumes increased by 10%, the eighth consecutive quarter of positive growth and third consecutive quarter of double-digit performance in that category. Additionally, affluent credit in the United States post a particularly strong payment volume growth, increasing more than twice as fast as the overall category during the 2 most recent quarters.","A key differentiator and important contributor to our success is our unsurpassed portfolio of co-brand products, which are also outperforming the category and clearly driving consumer loyalty and gaining further traction in the market. We also grew our portfolio by building on existing long-term relationships and winning several important new U.S. credit mandates during the quarter, and are excited for those to appear in the market in the near term.","Prepaid also continues to be another area of strength, posting robust volume growth during the first quarter. We signed a number of agreements that will drive future growth, including multiple mandates in 2 of the fastest-growing segments in the prepaid category, general purpose, reloadable cards and employee benefit programs. ","For example, we extended our relationship with Green Dot, the largest program manager in prepaid. In addition, our government prepaid programs continue to thrive. The Washington D.C. Department of Employment Services recently announced that all new recipients of unemployment insurance benefits will have the option to receive automatic payments on Visa prepaid cards.","In addition, we recently added Connecticut, South Carolina, Georgia and Louisiana to the list of states offering programs to distribute state income tax refunds on Visa prepaid cards. ","Overall, approximately 40 states are using or are in the process of implementing Visa prepaid card programs to disperse a range of benefits through more than 80 programs. In fact, approximately 30 of 38 state unemployment insurance card programs and 31 of 49 state child support programs can be delivered off Visa cards today. Building on that, we are rapidly expanding our government activities to key geographies worldwide.","Now let's turn to Visa's International business, which continues to be an increasingly important growth driver for our organization. International geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis and drove approximately 66% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter, and now, represent 46% of Visa's net revenue. This means we continue to make steady progress towards our stated goal of deriving 50% of Visa's revenues from International businesses by 2015.","Yet again, our performance in Latin America stands out with continued strong growth. Payment volumes grew by 22% on a constant dollar basis during the quarter, and we are building on that momentum by winning several important client mandates. ","In Mexico, Visa signed an extensive partnership contract with BBVA Bancomer to expand our long-standing relationship across a broad suite of products and services. This client is Visa's largest issuer and acquirer in Mexico, as well as the largest financial institution in the country.","Turning to CEMEA. We were pleased to win a major long-term mandate with Al Rajhi Bank, covering around 50% of all payments volume in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The agreement, the largest we've ever signed in the Middle East, is exclusive for debit and prepaid and covers the vast majority of that institution's credit product.","We're also continuing to invest in the long-term growth of Africa. Without question, Visa's existing product offerings and our unrivaled network provide us with a strong foundation to push our financial inclusion agenda forward. Additionally, Fundamo and our partnership with Monitise, provide us with a footprint and technical expertise in emerging economies. I firmly believe no organization is better positioned than Visa to lead forward the migration to digital currency on the African continent. ","An example of our progress was our November launch of a prepaid account that can be accessed through a mobile phone, offering consumers in developing countries a secure, reliable, globally inter-operable electronic payment account. MTN group, a leading telecommunications provider in Africa and the Middle East, plans to offer the new Visa product to MTN MobileMoney customers across its markets. As part of the launch, the new product will first be available to customers in Nigeria and Uganda. ","Additionally, Fundamo is supporting our unique partnership with the Rwandan government to drive access to financial services for our consumers in that country.","And in Asia Pacific, we continue to build steady momentum in our prepaid business with 2 prominent examples coming from Australia during the quarter. With Australia Post, we executed a multiyear exclusive agreement for their general-purpose, reloadable and travel products.","We also want to mandate with ANZ, where a multicurrency travel program allowing consumers to load up to 10 different currencies on a single card and lock in exchange rates, giving a cardholder even greater control over their travel budget. Importantly, Visa processing services was a critical part of our agreement with ANZ helping advance Visa's overall strategy of expanding processing penetration worldwide.","Lastly, let's talk about Visa's innovation agenda. We continue to invest in new technologies that will increase the number of transactions on our core business products, add incremental value to the merchant community and create new revenue opportunities for both Visa and our clients.","In the United States, Visa is focused on offering consumers a seamless and secure payment experience, whether they're paying at a point-of-sale, with a card or phone or buying digital or physical goods online. The key to that approach is V.me, our newly branded wallet service in global acceptance mark, which is a top priority for the organization.  And we are moving swiftly towards broad commercial availability in 2012. ","As I said previously, our top priority with V.me is to advance our Click-to-buy and Touch-to-buy functionalities, including aliasing capability. This functionality will immediately increase ease-of-use and convenience for consumers while offering merchants and financial institutions the greatest business value. Longer term, V.me will offer our clients a range of payment-related capabilities that can be tailored to meet each organization's specific needs.","So where are we? During the quarter, we took an important step towards consumer availability, initiating a beta version of V.me with close to 1,000 Visa employees and certain key partners. In the coming weeks, we will be expanding the beta group and start the implementation with a few brand-name merchants. Of course, scaling V.me will require buy-in from the broad merchant acquirer and issuer community. ","To that end, we are directly engaged with more than 100 major merchants to discuss and test the product. We are also integrating V.me with our CyberSource gateway, which will quickly enable access for 380,000 online merchants. In addition, we will extend this capability through our other acquirers and reseller partners.","At the same time, we are engaged in productive conversations with several major issuers, who are showing genuine enthusiasm for the product as an offering for their clients. I look forward to providing updates in the coming quarters.","We are also making platform enhancements that pave the way for broad adoption of the payment-related services on mobile devices in the near term. Today, we announced that hundreds of financial institutions using a combination of Visa issuer processing platform, Visa DPS, and monetize global applications, can immediately offer a range of payment-related mobile services to their account holders. These can be accessed via almost any mobile device and operating system. This effectively makes our DPS platform a one-stop shop for mobile services within the issuing community.","Immediately available services, include monitoring account balances, transferring funds between accounts and instant alerts on mobile devices. And we have plans to deploy additional offerings, including mobile check deposit, NFC payments, mobile offers and support for V.me.","We are also investing in mobile money solutions outside the United States. Here, Fundamo is a key to our efforts as they are a global leader in deploying mobile payment platforms for developing markets worldwide. During the quarter, Fundamo secured deals with mobile operators and banks in several geographies around the globe, including Nigeria, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Pakistan.","On the e-commerce front, Visa is clearly benefiting from an increasingly strong secular trend towards online shopping, and our acquisition of CyberSource have placed them, favorably positioned Visa to accelerate that growth. In fact, CyberSource's billable transactions totaled 1.2 billion, a very strong 25% growth rate over the same period a year ago.","We secured a number of new business wins with major partners in the United States, including American Apparel, AutoTrader.com and ShutterPlay. Outside the U.S., CyberSource continues to gain traction.","For example, in China we've expanded our relationship with 99Bill, one of that country's leading electronic-payment service providers, a prime example of how Visa is partnering with leading local providers to deliver value to the payments ecosystem in that country.","99Bill has just gone live with CyberSource's broad management solution, CyberSource Decision Manager, and is using CyberSource services to complement their existing security systems to process cross border transactions safely as they expand business overseas.","So to sum up, Visa has continued to demonstrate the underlying strength of our business model. Visa continues to grow. We have expanded our core business lines. We have expanded our footprint in international markets both emerging, established. We have increased our investments in innovation to help us carve out new revenue streams for the future. And we have taken important steps in our relationship with the merchant community to help foster greater cooperation in the future. ","Each of these achievements helps us continue to deliver against our stated mission of offering more payment choices to more people in more places around the world.","And now, I'd like to turn the call over to Byron, who will walk you through the financial details of our quarter. And then we could take some of your questions. Byron?","Byron H. Pollitt","Thank you, Joe. I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. First, Visa's 14% net revenue growth in the first quarter was once again broad based and encouraging, with solid 8% growth in the U.S. and a very strong 22% growth rate in rest of world. Approximately 66% of the quarter's revenue growth came from outside the United States, and non-U.S. revenue in the quarter was 46% of Visa's total. ","Second, U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 8 consecutive quarters of positive credit unit volume growth. Most recently, the months of November, December and January comped at 12%, 10% and 10%, respectively, which continued the strong growth we have now seen for 2 years.","Third, client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance, as a result of lower-than-anticipated Durbin-related incentive and a lower level of deal activity in the first quarter versus the out quarter.","Fourth, note that we are reporting the quarter using a 36% tax rate, above our full year guidance of 33%  to 34% on an adjusted basis. We will begin reporting at this lower level once California officially adjusts its tax rate calculation, which we anticipate will be in fiscal Q2. ","Finally, fifth, for EPS calculation purposes, the as-converted share count reduction, driven by the escrow deposit took effect on December 29 and therefore, had no noticeable impact on the fiscal Q1 EPS calculation, but will have a full effect for the balance of the year.","Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the December quarter followed by our results through the end of January. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal first quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for fiscal 2012.","Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%, modestly below the September quarter's 13%. We saw the following breakdown in the December quarter: in the U.S., payment volume growth was 7%, a modest decrease from the 9% growth we saw in the September quarter. This was comprised of 10% credit growth and 5% debit growth. So we are beginning to see some modest effect on debit from the recently-enacted bed [ph] rules.","Rest of world payment volume on a constant dollar basis grew at 15%, supported by double-digit growth rates in both debit and credit. ","More recently, in the month of January, U.S. payment volume growth came in at 7%. Credit growth was 10%, while debit was 4%. Although not yet available based on the trends we saw during the fourth quarter, we expect rest of world payment volume growth will continue to exceed the U.S. by a comfortable margin.","Global cross border volume delivered a solid 13% growth rate on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, with the U.S. growing 11% and the rest of world 14%. ","The recovery of inbound travel to Japan, the Middle East and North Africa continues, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears to be on track.  In January, cross border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15%, with uptick in the U.S. growth rate to 13% and rest of world to 17%.","Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.6 billion in the fiscal first quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period compared to 9% growth in the September quarter. Here again, we are beginning to see the impact of the new debit rule.","For the month of January, processed transaction growth moved back up to 9%. ","Now turning to the income statement.  Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.5 billion, a 14% increase year-over-year, driven by strong growth in global payment volumes, better-than-expected data processing revenues and lower-than-anticipated client incentive.","The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was a positive 1%. ","Moving to the individual revenue line item.  Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 14% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the September quarter. Data processing revenue was $951 million, up 13% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa processed and CyberSource transactions.","On that note, CyberSource posted a 25% gain in transactions over the prior year's quarter, benefiting from Visa's e-commerce transaction growth, which approximated 24% for the quarter.","International transaction revenue was up 19% to $748 million, reflecting continued strength in cross border volume, above average currency volatility during the period and modest strategic pricing adjustments outside the United States.","As I highlighted earlier, client incentives came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance, but consistent with our full year outlook at 17% to 18%. ","Total operating expense for the quarter was $929 million, up 7% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel, network and processing costs associated with investments in our growth strategy. Our operating margin for the quarter was 64%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. This is largely due to expense timing as we expect a ramp-up in investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. ","Capital expenditures were $66 million in the quarter. We expect CapEx to ramp up over the course of the year and remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. ","Finally, as noted earlier, our tax rate for Q1 was 36%. However, we expect the benefits previously discussed from a lower state rate and foreign tax credit to be applied in future quarters' results, retroactive to Q1. Thereby, more accurately reflecting our full year guidance of an adjusted 33% to 34% range.","As Joe mentioned, we were active buyers of our stock during the quarter, repurchasing approximately 800,000 shares at an average price of $89.91 in the open market. The escrow funding of $1.57 billion, resulted in a change with the conversion rate of the Class B share, which equates to a reduction in the as-converted Class A common stock of 15.4 million shares effective December 29.","At the end of the December quarter, we had 672 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis, which incorporates the impact by the escrow funding and open market purchases. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 690 million for the December quarter.","Visa remains committed to returning excess cash to shareholders. And to this end, as Joe mentioned at the outset, our Board of Directors authorized a new $500 million share repurchase plan.","Finally, we are making 2 changes to our guidance for fiscal 2012. The outlook for net revenue growth is now in the low double-digit range. And for adjusted diluted EPS growth, it is now high teens. All other guidance metrics remain as presented last quarter.","As the year unfolds and we have additional clarity around the results of our Durbin debit strategy, as well as U.S. global and global economic momentum, we will be in a better position to refine this guidance as necessary. ","And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Craig Maurer with CLSA.","Craig J. Maurer - Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Research Division","I had a question on the tax rate beyond the current year. Could we see that fall below your adjusted 33% to 34% range considering the changes that are coming? And secondly, marketing was dramatically below what I was thinking about for the quarter. So I was hoping to get your thoughts there regarding what opportunities did present themselves in the quarter and if your thought process changed for the year.","Byron H. Pollitt","For tax, it's a little early to make that call since we've got this year to play out. But we will, rest assured, we will address tax guidance for the coming year in the next couple of quarters, which is our practice. With regards to marketing, no change. Think of this as timing. Our guidance hasn't changed. We have the Summer Olympics coming up, and we are rephasing our marketing spend to coincide better with the Olympics and the promotions that come in advance. So you should expect to see some movement on the marketing line in fiscal quarters 2 and 3 commensurate with that.","Operator","The next question comes from Darrin Peller with Barclays Capital.","Darrin D. Peller - Barclays Capital, Research Division","I mean volume trends looked like they've held up pretty well, especially into January. And now we have a guidance change especially on the -- on both the top line and on EPS. Do you think that the guidance is more -- or the change is more reflective of really more benign impacts of maybe the debit regulations as was included in your previous guidance? Or is it more macro-driven? And I guess just the follow-up question to that would be is there more room around the rebates? Maybe -- the 17% to 18% is just conservative on the rebates because maybe the debit environment or the Durbin environment effects were not as bad as expected?","Byron H. Pollitt","So let me take that. This is more a reflection of how some of the risks that Joe and I called out on the last quarter's earnings call, how some of those risks are playing out. Recognizing that we have a one quarter lag on our service fees, that means we've already got a line of sight into 7 months of that revenue. Cross border volumes have held up very well. With regards to both the U.S. and the global economy, both have demonstrated sustained momentum. The exciting drama unfolding in Europe has yet to really play out on the volumes. And so the guidance adjustments are more a function of having a portion of our year with a clear line of sight. And some of the risks we were most concerned about we're getting well into the fiscal year, and they haven't materialized to the degree that -- we had to at least contemplate when we gave the initial guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Joe, thanks for the color on the issuer loss. Was this the ultimate result of a holistic view by the issuer that under no circumstances would they pursue a dual strategy? Or was this a case you wouldn't go as low as they wanted on price? And secondly, could you give us a sense of what portion of your exclusive PIN debit issuers still has to make a decision? What type of win rate have you assumed in your guidance?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well getting back to the particular issuer that we talked about, it was -- I think it's fair to say that it was just a decision about how they were going to comply with the law and knowing to a certain extent that accepting PIN numbers on signature cards as we've always done was an opportunity. I think it was just their way of rationalizing how they wanted to go forward. It weren't a price issue. And then what was the second part of the question? I'm sorry.","Byron H. Pollitt","How many still have to make a decision.","Joseph W. Saunders","Yes, on removing Interlink, I think most of them have made their decision. There is no other major issuer that has Interlink on the back of the card that's contemplating taking it off. And we have had several wins on putting the Interlink mark on the back of non-Visa debit cards, and that will manifest itself certainly no later than April 1. But I can't really talk about it. We're in the final stages of several contracts, and they don't like us to disclose who they are.","Operator","The next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Everything looks really clean here. I just wanted to ask on the client incentives. Byron, you said they were running below the 4-year targets. Should we expect it to spike again around the April 1 exclusivity day? Just trying to get some help with the quarterly spread. And just as a follow-up to that, Joe, you said that the dust hasn't settled. Is it fair to interpret that to mean, how should I say it, that you haven't started playing defense yet with your MPS or the V PIN strategy? Are the issuers, and the acquirers to open the both? Just wanted to get a little bit of color on that.","Joseph W. Saunders","The second part of the question first. And then Byron can answer the first part of the question. When I said the dust hasn't settled, I also suggested that I'm very happy with how we've implemented our strategies and I am very happy about that, and things appear to be playing out quite well in that regard. But how we get to the end of the year and we see exactly what the actual results are, there is some ambiguity, although changing our guidance and expressing a degree of confidence would suggest that we're pretty happy with where we are and what's going on.","Byron H. Pollitt","Tien-Tsin, I would say that it's clearly weighted to the second half of the year after April 1. If you think in the context of -- a portion of these incentives are assigned to merchant routing, and they trigger when the routing is successfully sent Visa's way. That's going to weight a portion of the incentives that really hasn't -- that isn't as relevant in the first 2 quarters of the year relative to the second. And then the rate of deal activity, which has nothing to do with Durbin, but has to do with the ongoing course of our business, primarily credit, both in the United States and outside the United States, that level of deal activity was just less than we anticipated in the first quarter. And so that will just carry forward into quarters 2, 3 and 4. So we are -- we reaffirmed our guidance as 17% to 18%. We still feel good about that. No real call-outs, just timing.","Operator","The next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.","James E. Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP, Research Division","So Joe, you mentioned that you've been happy with your strategy implementation. Byron, you mentioned that the Durbin incentives were lower than you had modeled. I guess if you had to summarize it at this vantage point, has Durbin turned out to be better, worse or the same than you had originally contemplated?","Joseph W. Saunders","I think it's modestly better than what we had contemplated. I think that the implementation of our strategy has put us at the better part of that, which is what I've said about the regulation pretty consistently. So I don't -- I just -- I don't know how to put it in total perspective because as I said earlier, we got to see what happens. In some cases, there's been accelerated early adoption. And in some cases, there's been less early adoption. And I think it appears like it's going to even out, and it appears like things will occur in a manner that we've anticipated. When I say that, I'm not really factoring in the potential positive effect of some of the things that we've done to drive volume to us over time. And we will have to see how that works out with the -- through the acquirers and the merchant community.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess one question for Joe and then another for Byron. I guess Joe, what kind of impact do you expect in the model, with the change in pricing that's going to go on, on April 1? And I know it's going to be a change in pricing for all products. It's not just debit. I know it includes credit. I'm just curious on what kind of impact do you think it will have. And then Byron, when we look at the international revenues, they're now, for 2 quarters in a row, growing faster than the cross border volume growth. Is that just better pricing that we're getting? What is driving that phenomenon the past 2 quarters?","Byron H. Pollitt","So let me answer the international one first. So we reported nominal growth at 12%, and there was a 19% increase in revenue. Whenever there is significant above-average currency volatility, then our revenue stream trends up. And then -- and so that's the primary delta that you are seeing. It doesn't have anything to do with our pricing. It's much more a function of currency volatility, and that has largely been courtesy of Europe and the unfolding drama around the euro. With regards to -- let me see if I understand the question. On balance in U.S. debit, when you combine the fixed acquiring network fee with the lower variable transaction fees associated with U.S. debit, this constitutes a net price reduction. And that has been completely folded into our guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from Rod Bourgeois with Bernstein.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC., Research Division","So have your common switch plans and network participation fee plans met any meaningful obstacles? And could you provide more specifics on how the common switch and network participation fee will be implemented presumably in coming months here?","Joseph W. Saunders","I think that what we've done, we've announced 2 quarters ago, and we've consistently talked about, I think any time you change the paradigm that there's probably some consternation somewhere along the way. But in general, we've met with -- it's been pretty benign, and we've met with favorable receptivity. I would say out of our largest merchants, there are a significant number of them that have signed contracts with us that anticipate the fixed fee. And they're fine with it. I mean I suppose that doesn't mean that they won't complain about it later, but that's kind of the history of our business. As it relates to that, we're putting -- officially we'll put out the specifications for that in about the -- in the next week. As it relates to activate -- fully activating the PIN capability on the Visa debit card, that would begin on April 1. And all of those things are going along as we anticipated, as we had planned. We're very happy with the way that it turned out. And as you might expect, I mean there's been a lot of water that's gone under the bridge. They're both complicated paradigms. As Byron says, we feel that we're in a much better position in the long run with a modest fixed fee and a lower variable fee. We believe that, that suits merchants in a much more compatible way than in the past because they can take advantage of economies of scale. It is not price increases. As we speak today, as it relates to the PIN capability on the signature cards, that seems to be the way things are moving. It's a capability that we have, and we're very comfortable with that as well.","Operator","The next question comes from David Togut with Evercore Partners.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc., Research Division","Joe, could you highlight some of the innovation you have planned on the credit side? You indicated that a credit volume growth was twice what debit was in the U.S. in December and much of the growth came from the affluent. So how do you see the competitive battle shaping up in U.S. credit versus MasterCard particularly on the affluent side?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well when I look back over the last 2 or 3 years, I mean I'm very comfortable with how we fared and what we've done. Based on the number of things that I talked about in my remarks, I'm very bullish on where we're going to wind up in 2012 as a result of some new transactions that are on the cusp of occurring. That doesn't mean that I don't consider MasterCard to be a formidable competitor because they are. It doesn't mean that every time we get involved in a transaction, that we'll win and they'll lose. But I'd have to say as it regards to credit, we're in a pretty good position. Remember, we've talked the last 2 quarters about the United-Continental merger and our win in that regard. I think as I mentioned in my remarks, we have the best array of co-branded partners, period. And that is what's driving a lot of the growth. So we feel like we're in a very good position. We don't feel that, that's a position through which we can rest on our laurels. We do believe that V.me and the wallet and the single click is going to make a difference in the credit card world, as well as the debit card world. So I think we're trying to move forward in a very measured way and we're pretty excited about our prospects. And the same goes for our international business.","Operator","The next question comes from Ken Bruce, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Bruce - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","My question actually kind of follows on to that, to the last one in. In terms of the trends that you see within debit and credit, is it -- are you able to tell if this growth in credit is -- whether it be affluent or a broader growth in credit usage or if there's actually consumers making a conscious choice to pick up a credit card versus a debit card? Just as you think about those different trends, are you seeing anything that is fundamentally where consumers are choosing a credit card over a debit card or if it's just that a selection that issuers are pushing more credit cards versus debit?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well remember the credit card volume has been growing quite robustly for several quarters now. And so you certainly couldn't attribute what's happening in that product totally to Durbin and people switching. And it's too early to tell, looking at the volumes exactly, what kind of switch there may be. Anecdotally, of course you know that rewards have been removed from debit cards and rewards exist on credit cards. So there are probably -- I mean just logically, you have to assume that there's some movement in that regard. Some of that is constrained by the credit worthiness of individuals and their credit lines. And so it's pretty complicated environment and it's a little bit difficult to say. Obviously issuers seem to be pushing their credit businesses a little bit more strongly or a lot more strongly than they do their debit businesses at this point in time, which is what one would expect. So I think that the jury is still out about how much something moves from one to the other. But I think it's pretty clear that you're going to see strong credit card growth at least from Visa in the foreseeable future.","Operator","The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Byron, this is directly for you. I guess just in terms of the numbers, and I apologize if I missed any of this. But the 9% processed transaction gross versus the 13% data processing revenue growth, obviously, the effects of Durbin and some of the impacts there on debit are a big part of the decline of processed. But the spread relative to the revenue growth was actually much better than expected. So just some color in terms of why that spread went  the way that it did and for how long would this actually continue to persist before you see that in your portfolio anniversary?","Byron H. Pollitt","So the debit processing fees grew at 8%, but we reported at the gross level data processing fee growth of 13%. Of that delta, I would say 60% of it is due to the addition of CyberSource and PlaySpan transactions into the data processing line. And the other 40% is due to value-added services that show up in the other fee category of data processing. And so those are -- that explains 100% of the premium that we are earning above the growth -- underlying growth in data processing transactions. And I would expect that, that premium -- certainly, the CyberSource and PlaySpan piece will continue. We'll have to see how that plays out in the second half of the year as we see much more impact from, or potential impact from implementation of the Federals.","Operator","The last question does come from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities Co. Ltd., Research Division","I'd like to follow up on some of your comments about Fundamo and your investments in MobileMoney. Does what you're doing there influence your relationship with Western Union in any way? And can you update us on whether you expect to be able to deal with some of the AML issues that arise in mobile money transfer? And just more broadly, can you comment on where you see the cost of electronic-money transfers going especially in comparison to that 500 to 600 basis points of revenues per dollar volume that Western Union has traditionally generated.","Joseph W. Saunders","I don't think that there's an absolute connection between Fundamo and Western Union and the Western Union-type of business. Remember, I think Fundamo is an incredible part of our future. I think that using mobile technology as an access point to Visa prepaid cards in emerging economies, where there's a lot of under, under-banked people is just one of the most incredible things that I've seen coming along in quite some time. As it relates to money transfer and Western Union, we are much more heavily involved with Western Union today, and will be in 2012 than we really ever have been before. And we are doing a number of things with them and some of the -- as it relates to money transfer in some of the emerging economies. And I'm going to kind of leave it -- leave Western Union at that. But we also, as you know, do business with MoneyGram. And I mean we're pretty invested in money transfer business for the unbanked. We are aware of the issues that surround the transfer of money and the protections that it requires and so forth and so on. And we're doing things through people that have those infrastructures. And we're happy where we are right now. Let me say we're happy to be doing what we're doing, and we will continue to endeavor to.","Jack Carsky","Well thank you all for joining us today.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.","Byron Pollitt","Thanks, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, we continue to experience solid constant dollar payment volume payment volume growth in the low double-digit range both in the US and in internationally. That said, we see no signs yet of any acceleration in economic recovery and cross-border volume growth remained soft in the mid-single-digits.","Turning to revenue, as expected and previewed on our call last quarter, revenue growth further moderated growing 7% year-over-year on a constant dollar basis or 5% nominally which reflects the two percentage points of FX headwind we have experienced since the beginning of the fiscal year.","As a reminder, the current Q3 is lapping 17% nominal revenue growth in the prior year quarter which benefited from a number of favorable one-time adjustments.","It is worth noting that the international revenue grew it only 1% this quarter despite cross-border constant dollar volume growth of 7%. While unfavorable FX is a partial explanation, the bigger impact is the significant reduction in currency volatility which has a direct impact on our international revenues. We expect both of these factors to reverse overtime.","Looking ahead to Q4, we expect a rebound in nominal revenue growth on the order of 2 to 3 percentage points compared to Q3. This rebound is about 2 percentage points than we anticipated at the time of our last earnings call primarily due to a 1 percentage point drop in cross-border transaction growth and unusually low levels of volatility across a broad range of currencies.","So, that means for the full fiscal year 2014, we now expect revenue growth in the 9% to 10% range on a constant dollar basis with guarded optimism that the moderation in cross-border volume growth has dropped. After FX impacts that translates into nominal revenue growth of 7% to 8%.","Client incentives for the fiscal third quarter came in lower than we had anticipated at our last earnings call due primarily to the timing associated with several major deals which have now been either signed or we expect to sign in the fiscal fourth quarter. With this in mind, we are narrowing our full year guidance for client incentives as a percent of gross revenue to around 17% from the prior range of 16.5% to 17.5%. Let me also point out that mathematically this puts the fourth quarter at north of 19%.","In terms of EPS, on a fiscal year 2014 basis, we are narrowing our guidance for diluted earnings per share to be in the 17.5% to 18.5%. Lastly, we remain confident in our future growth prospects and fully committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of $5.6 million shares during the quarter at an average price per share of $207 in change resulting in a total cost of $1.2 billion. This leaves an outstanding open to buy of $1.9 billion at the end of June and as always we will take advantage of market movements to repurchase at attractive prices.","Now, let\u2019s turn to payment volume and transaction growth. Let me start with what I stated last quarter though we are seeing a sustained economic recovery, there are no signs yet of acceleration either domestically or internationally. Global payment volume growth for the June quarter in constant dollars was 11%, a 1 percentage point decline from the March quarter, the U.S. grew 10% and international grew 13%.","Drilling down further for the June quarter, U.S. credit growth was 12% slight improved to 14% growth. U.S. debit was 8% in Q3, a 1 percentage point improvement compared to Q2 through July 21st, U.S. debit is flat at 8% growth. Taking together U.S. payment volume growth through July 21 was 11%, up 1 percentage point from the Q3 level.","Global cross-border volume delivered a 7% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter slightly down from 8% in the March quarter. U.S. and international both grew at 7%. Through July 21st, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis held steady at 7% growth with the U.S. growing 6% and international registering 7% growth.","For the June ending quarter, the sequentially downtick of 1 percentage point in cross-border was broad-based and spread across China, Russia, Ukraine, Venezuela, Argentina and the Middle East as you might expect, given political tensions and the early on-set of Ramadan.","Speaking of Ramadan, when interpreting to Q4 cross-border trends keep in mind that the timing of Ramadan in 2014 benefits August at the expense of July. ","Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $16.7 billion in the fiscal third quarter, an 11% increase over the prior year period, same growth rate as Q2. The U.S. grew 9% while international delivered 20% growth. Through July 21st, processed transaction growth moderated to a 9% growth rate. The notable drop in July is largely due to the lapping of significant debit wins in Brazil in June 2013 where our debit processing penetration went from zero to well above 50%.","Now, turning to the income statements. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in service and data processing globally and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by a 2 percentage point foreign currency headwind.","Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9% over the prior year and was driven by moderating global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.3 billion, up 11% over the prior year\u2019s quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions both in the U.S. and internationally. ","As highlighted earlier, international transaction revenue was up 1% to $860 million versus 7% constant dollar volume growth over the prior year period, as a result of a broad range of currencies experiencing volatility well below the 10 year trend line in contrast to the year ago quarter when volatility was near record highs. We would expect a return to a more normal volatility pattern in the coming quarters.","Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, down 3% from the prior year. Certain expenses have slipped to the fiscal fourth quarter while some specific personnel and professional fees those sequentially higher than the prior quarter were comping off of higher levels of the expense in the year ago period. We expect elevated marketing investments in the Q4 more comparable to Q2 levels tied to the FIFA World Cup in combination with significant investments in the support of the recent rollout of Visa Checkout. Operating margin was 64% for the third quarter, in line with our annual guidance of low to mid 60s. Capital expenditures were $109 million in the quarter. ","At the end of the June quarter, we had $624 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on an as converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled $628 million. ","Finally, given our year-to-date results and our outlook for the balance of the year, let me recap our 2014 full year guidance. Constant dollar net revenue growth of 9% to 10% which when combined with 2 percentage points of negative FX impact; yield nominal revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Client incentives around 17%; operating margin in the low to mid 60s; tax rate between 30% and 31%; EPS growth in the 17.5% to 18.5% range and free cash flow of about $5 billion.","Before I turn the call over to Charlie, let me provide some early perspective on fiscal 2015. In short, we are approaching 2015 bullish on the long-term but cautious in the short term. Here are some of the underlying observations and assumptions in forming our planning for next year. ","First, while we expect U.S. and international payment volume growth to remain healthy, we have not yet seen acceleration in global economic growth. Cross-border transactions appear to be troughing in the 6% to 7% growth range on a constant dollar basis. As a perspective, we know that these growth rates can recover significantly without notice and that the notable declines in Latin American growth rates lap in January of 2015 and the market declines related to the Russian-Ukraine will lap in March, everything else equal once these events anniversary to pick up in cross-border growth could be in the 2 to 3 percentage point range.","As the currency volatility, not sure when this trend reverses. We only know from an historical perspective we are overdue for a correction and such shifts and trend can be quick and sizable. Consistent with past strategies, we remained focused on growing revenues for converting more cash volume to electronic payments with a growing emphasis on digital.","In addition, we expect the successful growth in our client payment volumes for both issuers and merchants to result in higher levels of planned incentives as measured by percent of gross revenues.","Turning to Russia, while this situation is still very much influx, we anticipate being a part of a commercial solution that will be implemented in 2015 which will likely resolve in the loss of about 50 million in domestic Russian processing revenue.","Looking further down the income statement, we see no step function change in our tax rate at this time. That said, we are working diligently on a more fully realizing our opportunities related to foreign tax credits.","Finally, consistent with past practice, we expect to deploy our excess cash flow in 2015 to service our dividend and to repurchase our shares. In sum, we remain bullish on the future but recognize that in today's economic environment we must work through several challenges before we can once again resume more normalized rates of growth. As is our practice on the Q4 earnings call, we will provide more color on 2015.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Charlie.","Charles W. Scharf","Thank you very much, Byron. Byron did cover the financial results in a fair amount of detail but I just thought I'd just pass on a few quick thoughts.","First of all, the quarterly results did come in where we expect. The revenue growth being impacted by the year-over-year comps with the strong U.S. dollar and the tepid growth from cross-border payment volume in these specific geographies was what we expected. And we reiterate that we are confident that these headwinds we do not feel are permanent.","More importantly for the long-term, global payments volume and processed transactions remained healthy and strong. Also our issuer contract pipeline is very strong. So, all in all we are gratified to be able to deliver 50% earnings per share growth given the environment and what we've discussed.","Let me turn out for a second and talk about Russia. As you all know by reading the newspapers and watching the news, the situation continues to evolve. The recent additional sanctions have not forced us to curtail business with additional clients and as of today, our domestic and international business continues.","This concludes completing term sheets and contracts regarding our brand relationships during this quarter with significant Russian clients which we're gratified about but we continue to focus on developing a domestic processing solution and we're actively engaged with the Russian government and the Russian banks to develop a commercial solution which will allow us to continue serve our Russian clients.","Most limiting provisions of the new law going to effect in October and we are working to have a solution implemented by that time. Having said that and as Byron mentioned, we do expect to lose a portion of our domestic processing revenues over the next year which will reset our base from which we expect to achieve good growth.","Now, let me turn for a second and talk about what we're seeing in our client activity around the globe. We did have a good quarter regarding issuing co-brand contracts just a few significant examples. In U.S. we renewed our credit card relationships with the American Eagle Outfitters and high hotels and resorts. ","In Canada earlier this month, we launched a new relationship with CIBC for Tim Hortens which is the largest QSR in Canada. It's a significant co-brand offering and a no fee rewards space reported by innovative product features and real-time awards. It's called the Double Double Visa Card, it leverages the first of its kind dual button technology that combines a CIBC Visa Credit Card for payments with a classic Tim Card for rewards. Cardholders simply press CIBC Visa button on the front of the card to pay for their everyday purchases anywhere Visa accepted or they can choose to press the Tim Card button and then use the same card to redeem their Tim cash for their favorite coffee and menu items at Hortens. New card is also, also offers the convenience of Visa payWave and the security of chip and pin technology that consumers in Canada enjoy today. On the issuing side, we also renewed a multiyear agreement with the Royal Bank of Canada an important and long-standing client of Visa.","We also signed a number of other significant new multiyear agreements around the globe. In Australia, we will be the exclusive card net worth for a Woolworths money credit card partnership. Woolworths is Australia\u2019s larger retailer. In China, we renewed our credit partnership deals with China Industrial Bank, China Minsheng Banking Corporation, and Shanghai Pudong Development Bank. In Korea, we signed a new debit partnership agreement with [Pona SK] and a new credit debit agreement with [Woori] card. In Saudi Arabia, the Saudi British Bank will convert their debit card portfolio to Visa from a competitor and bank Saudi frenzy has renewed their credit, debit and prepaid agreement. In the UAE, Visa signed new credit deal with Mashreq Bank including an exclusive card for high net worth individuals.","Turning to CyberSource for a second. We have discussed the weaker growth over the past few quarters increasing our rate of growth here it will take some time it\u2019s one account at a time and as Byron mentioned we are investing here to rebuild the higher growth rates.","We recently announced a strategic global partnership with Amadeus, a leading technology provider for the global travel industry. Amadeus has integrated CyberSource's fraud management system decision manager into the Amadeus payment platform which can help travel organizations globally accept more bookings while identifying potential fraudulent transactions and lowering operational costs.","Turning to payment security for a moment, earlier this year we formed a payment task force in partnership with other networks, merchants, issuers, acquirers and device manufacturers. We see real collaboration here which is terrific. We continue to work through a common roadmap for enhanced security in the U.S. topics include EMV, tokenization, end-to-end encryption and coordinated communications. The Group is working very well together and we would expect the Group to have some things to talk about publicly in the near future.","Let me talk for a few minutes now about our work in digital commerce. First of all, there is a lot of clutter in the market about who is doing what in the digital payment space. It can be confusing for sure. We have a very specific point of view and a set of strategies here. Simply put we are keenly focused on achieving the same success in the digital world that we have had in the physical world. This mean focusing on tangible activities in the marketplace that help accelerate digital commerce with Visa as a platform partner.","As in the side our card not present volumes today are growing three times as fast as card present which we feel is still just a fraction of the opportunity in this space. We are focused on two different but related things. ","Number one, bring digital payments to the physical world and number two, enabling digital payments in the connected world. To do this, we are materially changing how we do business. Historically we would only allow access to our capabilities through issuers and acquirers and for them it wasn't particularly easy. Today we're simplifying access for our traditional partners but we're also enabling a much broader set of partners to access these platforms in ways we have not allowed historically so, they can build experiences that use our payment of capabilities. This includes partners such as merchants, technology companies both big and small, mobile operators, device manufacturers, other payment companies, social networks and the broader application developer community. Including these partners means exposing web services so they can connect with us.","To help drive innovation, last week we opened a 100,000 square feet of innovation center in San Francisco. The space is all about collaboration, it\u2019s one of a series of physical spaces which we will have, which provide a physical environment where we can sit side-by-side with partners traditional and new big and small to create experiences using our capabilities.","We're also investing in younger companies such as DocuSign and [Loop]. As a group investments like these and there are more to come keep us close to innovators in our space. Being part of the dialogue is important. Bear in mind, we are not looking to pick exclusive winners here, but we do want to enable a series of people who we think can help drive payment electronification.","To support our digital activities today we announced Visa Digital Solutions. This suite of services extends our support for mobile payments to enable retailers, financial institutions and developers to create new ways to pay via mobile devices. Specifically, we published specifications in software development kits to make it easier for financial institutions, merchants and developers to create new ways to pay using our products on mobile devices using Visa payWave and QR codes. ","We have also published APIs and SDKs to enable merchants and developers to embed simplified payments within their web and mobile sites as well as the mobile applications using Visa Checkout which I\u2019ll talk a bit more about in a moment. These services are now available and there will be more coming throughout the year.","The second category is aimed at protecting consumer account information. Our new token services are part of this. I\u2019d mentioned this before but most people are focused on the security benefits of tokenization and they are real. But with tokens new players and importantly non-traditional payment providers such as developers and merchants can build applications that access payment information in a safe secure manner not possible before. This means on digital devices wherever there is an Internet connection regardless of the form factor including ones that don\u2019t exist today. Developers will be able to integrate Visa payment capabilities.","Merchants, developers and banks will start offering token-based payments in September of this year. We are also launching a more robust developer center in early 2015 but we\u2019ll extend the capabilities we exposed to the developer community. ","In addition to all of this we\u2019re creating a suite of services to enable banks to issue and manage Visa accounts and secure \\virtual clouds. This again allows developers to create commerce opportunities to integrate our payments products and capabilities wherever there is an Internet connection.","Last week, we launched Visa Checkout replacing V.me in the marketplace. We've learned a lot over the past year and a half through candid conversations with issuers, acquirers and merchants. In addition to consumer research on the topic of digital wallets and digital acceptance. Our goal is simple, we want our clients and their customers to be able to use our products in the digital world as easily as they can in the physical world. This means we\u2019ve designed Visa Checkout to be the Visa Card in the digital world that means a simple buying experience for consumers, clear branding for issuers and simple integration with merchants, it also means preserving the roles in the payments chain as they exist today. Visa Checkout accomplishes all of this. ","For the consumer they can pay with the username and password with just a few clicks whatever they see their card and Visa Checkout online. For the issuer clear branding throughout the Checkout experience and for the merchant easy integration of a product one which will help increases the rate at which sales are consummated online. As I said Visa Checkout is simply a Visa Card in the digital world. ","As I mentioned earlier with this launch a new mobile software development kit is also available allowing developers to quickly build and implement an in-app Checkout experience for iOS and Android based devices. We will drive broad awareness for Visa Checkout through a significant advertising campaign recently launched in the digital and social channels and on television later this year. The campaign will feature participating merchants and a broad range of consumer offers and promotions. We\u2019re thrilled with our partners who are part of the launch. On the financial institution side they include more than 180 financial institutions and organizations, big and small, the list includes U.S. issuers such as Bank of America, BB&T, BBVA Compass, CSCU which is the card services for credit unions, Chase Citi, ICBA Bank Card, Navy Federal Credit Union, PMC, Regions, U.S. Bank and Wells Fargo. ","We\u2019re also thrilled to have great merchants as partners in our launch some of which are following Neiman Martins, Staples, Pizza Hut, United Airlines, Petco, Wine Enthusiast, Adorama, Jos. A. Bank, Rakuten, Ticketmaster and Live Nation, over 170 merchants are live in Australia, Canada and the U.S. representing approximately 20 billion in total addressable payment volume. The sales pipeline is also very strong with over 40 merchants at term sheet and or negotiating master service agreements representing an additional $37 billion in addressable volume including some great sizable brands. ","In summary, our job at Visa is to help pro-commerce by providing a platform to integrate but we think is the best payment brand instead of capabilities in the world into new buying experiences simply and securely. These experiences will certainly make it easier to pay by eliminating physical cards overtime but the driver of behavioral change will be the experiences that can now be created on mobile devices that cannot be created on plastic, because the mobile device is connected and interactive and these experiences will become the real reason to pay digitally overtime. ","We believe that you will start to see these experiences in the near future and are excited about what they mean for everyone involved in commerce and will be an important part of our future.","We look forward to discussing these specific experiences and their positive impact to Visa over the coming quarters.","And with that operator, I think Byron and I are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Yes, sir. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Thanks guys. Just wanted to ask about the cross-border little bit more since obviously that remains a high priority focus area for folks. Can you give us any commentary whether some of the slowdown has been more on the consumer side relative to the commercial side? And then just any thoughts on the gap between your growth in this metric and that of your biggest competitor? At least through the March quarter we don\u2019t know what they\u2019ve done for the June quarter. But it just looks like that gap has gotten little bit bigger. I\u2019m curious if you guys have done any market intelligence to get a better understanding of that, and is there anything structural there we should be thinking about?","Charles W. Scharf","So let me start off with the first part of the question. It\u2019s very corridor specific. So let me just highlight a few of the corridors that we saw the deceleration in cross-border from Q2 to Q3. And many of these will come as no surprise. Generally from Russia to the European countries, from Argentina, Venezuela to the European countries. The European countries to Ukraine, Russia to Ukraine, Ukraine to the European countries.","So from that standpoint those are the key quarters that moved the needle. We know that it is pretty broad based and in this case many of these are just situationally specific. With regards to second part of your question, recognizing that Visa, Inc. does not have Europe. We are comfortable that at least half the difference in cross-border growth rates is attributable to Europe and the remainder we have under study. We also know given the ebb and flow of certain portfolio movements that some of that is country-specific and we are very focused on reversing those trends in the coming quarters.","Jack Carsky","Next question.","Operator","Thank you sir. Our next question comes from Sanjay from KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani \u2013 KBW","Thank you. I guess I had a question on the hedges and the volatility observation or point. Could you talk about what would happen if volatility doesn\u2019t come back into the FX market? I mean, does that serve as a headwind for period of time then?","Charles W. Scharf","So let me separate hedges and volatility. Because the two are completely independent to each other. When we speak of hedges this is simply basically a 12 month program where we try and dampen the fluctuations in FX when we translate net revenue or earnings positions earned in foreign currencies back in to our financial statements.","Cross-border is impacted but to a modest degree and these are hedges in the traditional sense, simply in put in place to dampen the volatility of naturally occurring changes and currencies relative to the dollar overtime. The volatility is a different animal. Every year, if we look back over the past year, we will have performed currency translations services for over a $150 billion in value in order to facilitate the settlement of transactions where Visa Card is -- whose account is denominated in one currency is used in a country where the currency is different and so over the course of the year as I indicated we do over $150 billion of those kinds of currency translation services. ","The way we earn a very small spread on those transaction. The way the spread is calculated, it's an algorithm that is based on the actual volatility of our currency in a given day. Those that volatility is something we have studied over a long period of time. There is during the course of a year often quite a bit of volatility but the amount tends to revert back to a mean overtime. So we would expect what we're seeing and as example if we were to look at the month of June, June had the lowest volatility that we have seen in 15 years. So from that standpoint we view this much more as of the moment that it should resume back to sort of normalized volatility levels which has been our experience since we've gone public. And that's how we're anticipating this trend for the future.","Jack Carsky","Our next question Charles.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jim, Jim from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jim Schneider \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on your commentary regarding incentives for the fiscal '15. Specifically how many of your top 10 issuing clients are expected to come up for renewal next year?","Charles W. Scharf","So, what we would typical do on the Q4 call is give you a sense of the full year expectations for incentives so you can expect that on the Q4 call in October. It is our practice to give incentive projections or guidance on a yearly basis not by quarter and we would characterize our pipeline of deals as it was healthy this year. It's a healthy pipeline of renewals next year as well and the impact -- the expected impact will characterize that in a range and share with you all on the fourth quarter earnings call.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Charles?","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thanks. Charlie just first a higher level question. I mean you mentioned in your remarks, I think in the press release that longer, you believe Visa should be able to grow the revenue in the double-digit range, can you just highlight and perhaps rank for us what the key drivers you think would be that would enable the growth to improve given the higher base which we're growing now? And then maybe just near term, on the near term side Byron is a follow up to that question I mean I guess what people are trying to figure out is if there is higher level of incentives in fourth quarter is actually new business that could drive that part of that acceleration next year? Thanks guys.","Charles W. Scharf","Yeah. So, let me start with -- start this which is -- again the way we look at our numbers, as we look at what our revenue growth is excluding the items that we talk about here as headwinds. And again I said this in my remarks, we do believe that these headwinds are not permanent and so if you just look at the headwinds that we've had far in the foreign currency translation and the currency volatility, the impact on the comps year-over-year and this growth in cross-border payments which we should point out can move either way very, very rapidly and we've got amazing data to back that up.","When you just back out these headwinds which we do believe are temporary, our growth underlying all that is still very, very strong which you can see in the transaction processing growth and the overall payments growth.","So, as we -- so we talk about generating reasonable returns over a period of time, there is the long term which is affected by the things we're doing in the digital world we think which is certainly helpful but then there is this other defined period once we get through these headwinds and the issue that we have is we don't know exactly when they are going to reverse but we're very confident that they will.","Byron Pollitt","With regards to the second part of your question recognizing that a typical contract with last five years some longer. We entered into contracts with the expectation that they will drive growth over that five year period. How we structure the incentives makes a big difference with regards to what kind of growth we may or not see in the first quarter as we've talked about over the years, some of the deal renewal entail more meaningful upfront payments that from a gap standpoint we might have to record more fully in the income statement versus amortize over the term of the contract. And so there is a lot that goes into how you structure deal and then how it\u2019s translated onto the books. But since Charlie\u2019s comment was based over the -- and we see our self in the longer-term returning to double-digit revenue growth, the answer is we would expect these deals to build on a foundation that would drive growth over the term of the period that what enabled us to achieve that objective.","Jack Carsky","Next question Charles.","Operator","Yes, sir. And next question comes from Moshe from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great, thanks. Charlie when you talked about tokenization, could you talk about whether that is something that is going to kind of bring revenues into the system and will those be revenues that go to the networks did they share I mean could you talk a little bit whether those are they just going to be something that\u2019s going to an additional form of security?","Charles W. Scharf","Yeah, I don\u2019t think the answer which is yes it\u2019s an additional form of security for sure. We think of it as driving more network volume that we otherwise wouldn\u2019t be able to get because other people can now participate and embed payments in different applications and experiences out there because it\u2019s safe and secure because of the tokens. This isn't a question of getting paid specifically for tokenization. It really is about driving more volume through our issuers or merchants and ultimately to us as well as part of that.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smitti from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you. Charlie I just wanted to follow-up on a statement that you made earlier about your new strategy on the digital front, I\u2019d thought I heard that you say you allowed new ways for parties to access your network directly so, does that mean eventually merchants and other technology partners will no longer need to connect your network through in wire? And if that\u2019s the case well settle the transaction?","Charles W. Scharf","","No, I didn\u2019t say that, what I said was that that we are exposing the capabilities so that different parties including merchants can embed Visa payments into their experiences but very importantly it preserves the role that issuers, acquirers play in the system today. So, what we're trying to do is again historically we've had great relationships with issuers and acquirers still do, but anyone who is trying to build an experience for an application would have to then go through multiple issuers and multiple acquirers to get that experience to market in a meaningful way and by exposing our capabilities directly to them, it allows more people to be creative relative to helping drive digital commerce in a way that uses our payments as a platform for them but it keeps the flows of information, the flow of data and the flow of economics the same as it is today in the fourth party system.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Thanks for the clarification.","Jack Carsky","","Next question Charles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities","Yeah, I just want to follow-up Byron your comments on \u201915. I didn\u2019t hear any comments on the operating margin do you still expect to get leverage in \u201915 on the operating margin? And then secondly, just an update on the Chase migration volume that is expected are we a quarter way through just trying to get a sense of how much we're through in that migrating of that volume? Thanks so much.","Charles W. Scharf","The only thing before Byron answer the question, let me answer that operating margin it\u2019s -- we really have to think about incentives as a meaningful cost of doing business here as well.","Byron Pollitt","And the two should be viewed in combination and with the exception of -- what happen to our incentive line after the great recession that has gradually moved up and the activity and a few comments on H1 performance highlighting the most significant points. ","Charles W. Scharf","But even beyond the three months because I think -- the way we think about where we are is we are not in an environment where it\u2019s very easy to predict the next quarter or the quarter after that just given what\u2019s going on in the world and these trends that we\u2019ve seen which affect our revenue numbers materially.","Again as I said before, we feel very confident that the headwinds will dissipate. We know that at some point the economy will be more helpful across the globe, what we don\u2019t know is the timing. And we certainly can\u2019t sit here today and tell you what it will be a year from now. And that is still only half way through next year. So as the world evolves and as these issues evolved and we get closer to the time period, it\u2019s obviously by definition easier for us to talk about it.","Byron Pollitt","Just a quick word on Chase. The current quarter\u2019s result to the extent that they include any of the conversions it\u2019s not material. And remembering this will hit the service fee line and we report the service fee line on a one quarter lag. Before we see much impact from the conversion it will really be for us that December ending quarter which will be the first quarter of the next fiscal year. But at the present no material impact on the quarter\u2019s results and frankly not a material impact on the Q4 results either.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Charles?","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin from JP Morgan Chase. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase","Great. Thanks. Just wanted to I guess clarify what\u2019s driving the software revenue outlook for the fourth quarter? Just wanted to make sure I caught it correct. It sounds like it's lower cross border plus lack of volume acceleration I don\u2019t think it\u2019s incentive driven. Just wanted to clarify that. And then my -- the question I wanted to ask was actually on Visa Checkout and the strategy there to get consumer signed up and to use Visa Checkout versus whatever PayPal or any other digital payment method you can think of. Because if we get questions all day today about Apple and other initiatives I\u2019m just trying to understand how that\u2019s going to play out versus something else? Thanks.","Byron Pollitt","Okay. So let me take the first part. With regards very specifically to the Q4, which is really how we're then going to finish out the year, it compared to where we were on the third quarter call, what\u2019s different primarily is a downtick in the cross-border, so if you have that right and continued depressed, historically depressed volatility levels from a currency standpoint. And for those were -- our position has moved a bit more conservative from where we were on the prior quarter call. It doesn\u2019t have anything to do with incentives because what didn\u2019t get booked this quarter. Our assumption is that it'll get booked in the current quarter. And we're already signing deals to validate that. And remember our incentive guidance was 16.5% to 17.5% and we narrated to about 17%. So we're right down the middle of the fair way.","Charles W. Scharf","But as we sit here and just think about from this quarter to next quarter we are not assuming any kind of meaningful change in these headwinds that we\u2019ve talked about which again are possible and will happen, we just don\u2019t know the timing and just given the math that Byron said next quarter\u2019s incentives will be higher than this quarter's incentives and he talked about that during his remarks. And the Visa Checkout question. I don\u2019t remember what the exact question was? The question Tien-Tsin are you still there?","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Chase","Yeah, I am here just wanted to clarify Charlie just in the strategy to get consumers signed up for Visa Checkout versus some all the other stuff that's out there PayPal and I guess Amazon is talking about, just trying to understand how you'll solve the consumer side of equation? And then I guess if I can get a chance here if you can address Apple and iBall or whatever all the press has been talked about with your partnership there I think that would great and how that would fit with, with your digital strategy? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf","Sure, so, listen I think on the answer to the first question about my words is why Visa Checkout for an consumer and how we're going to activate the consumers around the world to use this product as opposed to something else. From our perspective what\u2019s different about this versus the other things that you mentioned are the relationships that we have with banks, right. Again we've got two point 2 billion cards around the world and we think about the people who were willing to support this with their names in the press release, a bunch of them come to a launch event that we had here, these are amazing names. These banks talk to their clients regularly and over the next six months you'll start to see banks do different things to enable their customers in a very proactive way to use Visa Checkout. So, it's one thing for us to sit here and say we're going to try and do it, that would be very, very difficult, the reason why we're confident that will be successful because we do it in partnership with the banks because it's their clients. We provide support. Our marketing and advertising is going to do that again, we've got some really need stuff in the digital and social channels. ","As Byron mentioned in his remarks we are going to -- we intend to spend a significant amount in marketing including TV as we go into the back-to-school season and then again for the leading up to the Christmas. So, it\u2019s going to be hard not to know what Visa Checkout and why you should have it and so, we are pretty about that. And Apple I am not going to address anything specifically out there but again we have we have said this before we talked to a whole range of people who historically work doing significant things and payment and those that are and we're very excited about some of the things that we talking to potential partners about and over the next three months, six months, nine months, we hope some of those things will actually be in the market place you will be as excited about as we are.","Jack Carsky","Next question Charles.","","Operator","Next question comes from Bob from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Robert Napoli - William Blair & Company","Good afternoon. Just wanted to follow-up a few of the 2015 comments. We talk a lot -- you talk a lot about currency volatility, can you maybe put some numbers around is that 1% of revenue effect versus your guidance and then in talking about 2015 your tax rate it was little, the full year tax rate for this year you are expecting it flat and then you are still getting double-digit payment volume growth as people think about revenue and higher as the double-digit payment volume growth do you still expect to be able to attain that next year?","Charles W. Scharf","Let me start off on the currency volatility we don\u2019t we are not record with talking about specific amounts that this is as you can imagine a part of, it's pretty fundamental to the Visa global acceptance composition that we be in a position to perform currency translation services so, this is something that we have done for ever and we do it in a way that actually delivers a pretty attractive cardholder proposition as a part of the disclosures for someone that receives the Visa Card they are told that they are guaranteed a wholesale rate and I am hard for us personally to think of any other situation where a consumer, a cardholder would have available to them a wholesale currency translation rate. That\u2019s what we do we take a very small spread on that to cover our operations and it's related how much the spread is related to currency volatility and I have talked about that from time-to-time on currency I mean on earnings calls. It rarely has this level of impact but as we said earlier we are at levels of currency volatility that we haven't seen in 15 years tax rate.","So, with the guidance of this call we have given very specific guidance of 30 to 31 and have indicated that next year not to expect any step function rate. We did have an important tax adjustment last quarter that represented both a catch up and a permanent ongoing reduction in our tax rate because there was a catch up one might naturally wonder whether that impact is something that would be onetime and then the rate might naturally gravitate back up in the following year. Hence in my remarks I mentioned that we are hard at work and fully realizing foreign tax credit opportunities. And so we expect that to help inform the rate for next year and underpin the comment that we don't at this point expect any step function change in the rate.","With regards to double-digit payment volume growth, we certainly on a constant dollar basis this is the level of payment volume growth that is being produced with pretty anemic growth in economies. And so, as we look at the payment volume growth this is one of those factors that we think looking forward have certainly more upside than downside when never knows for shore but one I think would agree that the economic growth we've been experiencing over the past several years has been pretty anemic and hopefully nowhere to but up.","Robert Napoli - William Blair & Company","Great. Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Charles?","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig from CLSA. Your line is now open.","Craig Maurer - CLSA ","Yeah. Good evening. Charlie, I wanted to ask you theoretically about the future with technology and the changes you're bringing to the online world that are absolutely focused on better securities you said, what are your thoughts about the sustainability of card not present interchange rates for banks when clearly those rates were predicated on higher fraud levels?","Charles W. Scharf","Listen, I am not going to talk about what we would be thinking about anything specific on interchange on a going forward basis. What I will remind and I know Craig we talked about this but it's always a good reminder to everyone. I don't know a lot of industries out there that price their services for anything other than the value received and the value received from products like ours in the card not present world is extraordinary. And we know the number of businesses that wouldn't that exist if it wasn't for our products. And if people want to go back to a COD world, we can certainly try that.","So, as we sit here and continue to improve security and continue to build payments into people applications all with the point of view of helping them grow, we're going to be making sure that we think about looking at both sides of equation looking at what goes to the issuing side and to the acquiring side what is fair in terms of value received. And that could possibly evolve overtime. But again it's the value equation on both sides.","Jack Carsky","Next question, Charles.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Christopher Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Byron I just want to explore one thing on your comment about the Chase business not appearing in the numbers in a material way, just looking at the volume from credit that was 12% year on year U.S. credit. 12% year on year growth in the June quarter and you said I think 14% through July 21st does that reflect any Chase business or is there some other dynamic going on there?","Byron Pollitt","It does but as it relates to conversion it's really not a material driver of those numbers. As the conversion picks up speed later in the year, we would expect to see more of an impact but currently it's not material.","Jack Carsky","At this point Charles, we have time for one last question.","Operator","And our final question comes from Ken from Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Kenneth Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch ","Thanks. Good evening. Thank you for all the color you\u2019ve given us on the issue around cross-border I am hoping you might entertain one more question. You has pointed out last quarter that some of these quarter headwind is slowing volume obviously there is quarter is going to pick up and it\u2019s going to work out as it works out on the actual foreign exchange volatility side. Has this been something that has been, the volatility is dampening over time and it just became much more acute in the more recent quarter? And if you look back what would be kind of the right reference point just think about in terms of what volatility would look like, if you would?","Byron Pollitt","Honestly, we don\u2019t have a very good explanation. When you look at the patterns, volatility they are often event specific. During the period where Greece was rumored to be potentially exiting the Euro there was quite a bit of volatility in the Euro and that cross referenced against quite a few currencies.","We thought that we would see some volatility return during the week where a Malaysian airliner was shot down. We have an event in Gaza and Portugal was in the news with regards to the stability of its participation in the Euro","And yet those type of events which would have historically created volatility didn\u2019t. The one common denominator that we\u2019ve seen over the past several quarters is just an exceptionally strong dollar and our hypothesis is that that may have something to do with it. But honestly we\u2019ve done a lot of analysis and look for a lot of correlations and just haven\u2019t been able to find one that offers much in a way of the respectable (inaudible)","Charles W. Scharf","","But as Bryon said, what we saw recently are the lowest levels that we\u2019ve ever...","Byron Pollitt","In 15 years. ","Charles W. Scharf","15 years.","Byron Pollitt","So you can gravity for a while but not forever. And so in looking at 15 years\u2019 worth of data there are periods of comp that occur regularly during the course of the year. And then again looking at that timeline of data these can reverse very, very quickly often without notice. And so if past this prolong then it\u2019s just a matter of time before we hit an inflection point and it will go back to something more closer to lead way.","Jack Carsky","And with that we'd like to thank everybody for joining us today.

And I know you'll enjoy working with him in the months and years ahead. So, I welcome and congratulate Mike, and now let me turn to our financial results.","Visa had a terrific second quarter that greatly exceeded our expectations. Revenue growth was 13%, and many of our key business drivers accelerated compared to the first quarter. The broad-based improvement in global economic growth that began last year has well actually continued. Payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis accelerated by more than 0.5 point versus the prior quarter, fueled by debit spending globally. Debit growth of 11% was up 2 percentage points versus last quarter with both U.S. debit and international debit growth accelerating by similar amounts.","Credit growth was flat to the last quarter at 10%. Year-over-year payments growth was between 9% and 17% across our six reported regions and countries, which is an indication of the broad-based global strength we are seeing. Cross-border growth on a constant dollar basis accelerated more than 2 percentage points versus the prior quarter, driven by faster growth in virtually every region. Growth both in and out of Europe and the U.S. was strong. Growth inbound to the U.S. reached double digits for the first time in more than four years.","Globally, both card-not-present and face-to-face growth accelerated by approximately 2.5 percentage points versus the prior quarter, with card-not-present growth continuing to outpace face-to-face spend growth. Investments in talent and markets around the world as well as marketing focused on the Winter Olympics and the upcoming World Cup led to double-digit expense growth on an adjusted basis.","Our tax rate was 19% due to the execution of a specific state tax initiative and U.S. tax reform. EPS growth on a GAAP basis was 523%, but adjusted for two special items last year, growth was 30%. These strong results have led us to raise our full year outlook for both revenue and profit.","We had a number of deal wins in this quarter. Visa and Capital One executed a new agreement that continues our partnership in the affluent consumer and small business space. Capital One is one of our largest issuers, and we're excited to continue our partnership.","Also in the U.S., IKEA has selected Visa as the network for their new co-brand program. We signed a multiyear debit issuing agreement with CIBC in Canada. In Asia, we renewed our consumer credit and commercial partnership with Shinhan Korea, the largest issuer in Korea. We're partnering with Citi and P-Crom (05:00) to launch the new exclusive co-brand card in Taiwan, and we also renewed a number of our largest partnerships with clients in Japan, China and Thailand.","We renewed Banco Davivienda our second largest client in Colombia. And we renewed our debit agreement with Mashreq Bank (05:21) in the UAE. We also returned approximately $2.5 billion of capital to shareholders in the second quarter consisting of $2 billion of share repurchases and nearly $0.5 billion through dividends. Vasant will take you through our results and our revised full year outlook in more detail when I complete my remarks.","Let me turn to Europe. Our technical migration in Europe is well underway and off to a great start. The clearing and settlement migration was completed successfully over the months of February and March with no major issues.","Over 500 clients were migrated. Authorization migrations begin later this month. Unlike the settlement migrations, which occurred in two major tranches, the authorization migrations will occur client-by-client over a longer period of time. We remain on track to complete the technical migration by the end of the calendar year.","The conversion of European client contracts to commercial incentives is largely done. For the few deals that are outstanding, the terms are finalized, but the contacts are taking longer than expected to be signed. We expect to be finished in Q3.","Overall, we are quite pleased with the business we have secured. We reviewed and transitioned over 100 contracts to new commercial terms, many highly contested by our competitors. Of course, we would have liked to win them all, but retaining almost all of these clients does exceed our assumptions made at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition. Now that we're done transitioning our existing clients to incentive contracts, we can shift more focus to growing our business in new ways in Europe.","In terms of digital advancement, last week, we introduced the Visa Digital Commerce program, which will provide consumers with a simple experience with more security and less friction to utilize their cards for digital payments. Our vision is to create a consistent and secure digital shopping experience across browsers and devices that largely eliminate the need to enter card, account numbers and passwords.","Online shopping should be as simple as it is in the physical world, making the checkout process easy with a single pay button. We aim to de-clutter the checkout page to streamline the checkout process. The program will incorporate our token technology and is based on the EMVCo Secure Remote Commerce framework. We're going to provide more updates on an ongoing basis as we move forward. The Visa Digital Commerce program is consistent with our other initiatives and investments to reduce friction from digital payments while maintaining high security standards.","A few examples of other actions we've taken to reduce friction from digital payments include: our partnership with PayPal, which began in the U.S. and has extended to Asia and Europe, which eliminates ACH steering while also enabling PayPal users to cash out to their Visa card utilizing Visa Direct. In fact, overall, our partnership with PayPal has gone well, and we continue to discuss ways to work together, including collaborating on a number of tokenization initiatives.","Our acquisition of CardinalCommerce about a year ago enhanced our authentication capability while also reducing transaction latency and improving the customer experience for merchants. Netflix, one of Visa's top digital merchants globally, recently expanded their card-on-file token program to include countries in both Europe and the Latin America regions. And with card on file tokens now being provisioned in countries across all Visa regions.","Visa Direct continues to gain traction in markets globally. We are beginning to see the network effect taking hold as scaled originators, such as acquirers and technology platforms, continue to use Visa's capabilities to push funds in real-time over our network. This network effect, combined with broader consumer and merchant awareness, is fueling geographic expansion and rapid growth across all use cases.","P2P, for example, is growing rapidly in a number of markets around the world. Our issuer clients as well as third-party providers, such as Square Cash, PayPal, Venmo and Facebook have enabled their customers to send money to one another using cards.","Disbursements continue to grow in a number of different industries such as ridesharing, insurance and alternative lending. Companies such as Wirecard, Worldpay, Adyen and Stripe are enabling their clients to use these capabilities.","Instant merchant deposit for small merchants continues to expand. PayPal Braintree recently joined existing partners such as Worldpay, who launched in 2017; and Square, who was the first to launch in 2015, to enable their merchants to receive their funds within minutes by initiating a push to their card.","And finally, bill payment, where consumers can pay credit card, utility and telecom bills by initiating a push of funds from their debit card. The application of this capability can vary from market to market, so let me share two examples with you.","In Singapore, four of our top seven issuers have embedded our capability in their digital banking channels, including mobile apps, to allow customers to pay their credit card bills issued by another financial institution with a push of funds from their debit card.","In India, consumers can pay for utilities and telecom services by scanning the QR code on their bill with their banking app, and funds will flow from the consumer's bank account to the merchant via Visa Direct.","Turning to B2B, we continue to make progress on our strategy of enhancing the value that Visa brings to business payments, both through Visa capabilities and through partnerships.","In March, we acquired Fraedom, a Software-as-a-Service company, providing payments management solutions for financial institutions. Fraedom was a partner of ours for almost 10 years and underlies Visa's IntelliLink Spend Management, a core platform for Visa's commercial and small business clients. Fraedom will strengthen and expand Visa's business solutions. We're already seeing increased interest from several large issuers about our B2B capability following the announcement of the acquisition.","In February, we expanded our partnership with Amazon Business, launching in Germany with Degussa Bank. The partnership brings together information from Amazon Business purchases and Visa's processing, helping business clients spend less time on purchase reconciliation.","In January, we announced a partnership with NovoPayment, a Miami-based fintech that enables digital financial and transaction services through a cloud-based platform that supports mass disbursement and collections. The partnership will help drive digital payment services for B2B transactions in Latin America and the Caribbean. Our initial pilot with NovoPayment has helped two leading urban delivery services automate real-time disbursements to delivery personnel.","Relative to contactless, we continue to make great progress in contactless. Twelve months ago, approximately one in eight domestic face-to-face transactions that run over our network globally were contactless. Today, contactless accounts for almost one in five transactions globally. Just in the past three months alone, contactless penetration has increased by 9 percentage points to 37% in Russia. It's increased 7 percentage points to 56% in the UK. And it's increased 4 percentage points to 52% in Canada.","Just yesterday, Transport for London announced that on average, around 2.5 million contactless journeys are made across London's bus, tube and rail services every day. Since early 2016, the proportion of pay-as-you-go journeys made using contactless has risen from 25% to more than 50% today. And more than four of every five contactless journeys on Transport for London is made using Visa.","In February, we announced 14 new technology partners from across 10 countries that will participate in the Visa Ready for Transit program to promote commuting with contactless.","Visa Ready helps accelerate the adoption of new technologies by ensuring solutions meet Visa's security standards and specifications. New York, Sydney, Miami and Boston have all announced that they plan to introduce contactless payment in the coming years.","Spurred by the Tokyo Olympics in 2020, Japan's largest retailer, AEON, will introduce checkout terminals supporting Visa contactless payment at approximately 100,000 registers at AEON Group stores between March of 2019 and March of 2020, including supermarkets and drugstores nationwide.","The U.S. is in the early stages of adopting contactless, but we are laying groundwork to enable the market. In our experience, this groundwork stage takes 12 to 24 months. And once sufficient momentum is built, contactless adoption tends to take off rapidly.","For example, it took 24 months to go from 1% to 7% contactless penetration in Australia and then another 24 months to go from 7% to 50%. That experience is not unique to Australia as we've seen similar trajectories around the globe. In the past 12 months, contactless penetration has increased from 32% to 64% in Denmark, from 31% to 53% in Spain, and 5% to 37% in Russia.","In the U.S. in the past year, we've enabled an additional 10 of the top 100 merchants with contactless, bringing contactless to a total of 56 of the top 100 merchants.","We are also increasing consumer awareness. This quarter we launched a national marketing campaign through our Olympics sponsorship that prominently featured contactless, which was seen by nearly two-thirds of U.S. adults.","And speaking of the Olympics, the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang were a success for Visa this quarter. As the official and exclusive payment technology partner of the Olympic Winter Games, we deliver unique value to our clients when they leverage our partnership.","Over 350 bank and merchant partners across 32 markets and in five languages utilized the Visa sponsorship to support their local strategies. We work together with our clients to come up with all kinds of unique campaign, so let me share a couple of examples with you.","In collaboration with Lotte Card, the financial arm of South Korean-based retailer Lotte Department Store, Visa unveiled three limited edition wearable payment devices, stickers, badges and gloves that could be used for contactless payments. And approximately 100,000 wearables were sold between November and March. Another major Korean partner issued over 500,000 official PyeongChang 2018 themed cards in the months preceding the games.","And similar to the Olympics, our FIFA sponsorship can also be leveraged by our clients. And for the upcoming World Cup in Russia, we expect more than 550 bank and merchant partners in over 100 markets to utilize our FIFA sponsorship.","So, a few closing points. Visa recently celebrated our 10-year anniversary as a public company on March 19. The business has flourished in that time. Cards in force doubled from 1.6 billion to 3.3 billion. Payments volume almost tripled from $2.7 trillion to $7.8 trillion, and our net revenue did triple from $6 billion to $19 billion. Our total shareholder return for the period was 837%, which is 5x the S&P 500 during the same period.","Core to our success is Visa's ability to anticipate future trends and evolve. Even with our success to date, there is still tremendous room for growth with tens of trillions of dollars in opportunity across consumer cash, checks and B2B.","We continue to execute on our growth strategy and look forward to the next 10 years. The progress we've made in the first half of fiscal year 2018 furthers our confidence in the long-term investments we're making to drive profitable growth in the rapidly changing payments environment.","With that, let me turn it over to my partner and our CFO, Vasant.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Thank you, Al. The strong growth trends we started the year with accelerated in the second quarter and our results exceeded our expectations. Net revenues were up 13%. On a GAAP basis, which includes special items last year related to the reorganization of Visa Europe and other Visa subsidiaries, EPS was up 523%.","Adjusting last year's results for these special items, EPS was up 30%, including a 10 percentage point benefit from the impact of U. S. tax reform. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year positively impacted net revenue growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points and EPS growth by approximately 2 percentage points. Our earnings release provides you with a schedule that adjusts GAAP net income and EPS for these special items.","A few points to note, a robust global economy continues to drive double-digit constant dollar payment volume growth. Cross-border growth accelerated, helped by a weaker dollar. Inbound commerce into the U.S. grew at double-digits for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2014. Outbound commerce from Europe was also up double-digits, as the euro and pound have strengthened. Acceleration of cross-border growth in these two important corridors was faster than we expected.","We have completed our post acquisition initiative to restructure all important client contracts in Europe to competitive commercial terms. While all terms have been agreed, the signing of some contracts will happen in the third quarter.","As a result, client incentives were lower than we expected in the second quarter, adding 1 point to net revenue growth and $0.02 to EPS. These delayed client incentives will largely be recognized in the third quarter.","Our tax rate in the second quarter benefited from the successful resolution of a state tax initiative we have been working on for several years. In addition to a recurring benefit in our effective state tax rate, we recognized a non-recurring 2.5 point reduction in our tax rate this quarter for prior years.","Based on our outperformance in the second quarter, we are raising our outlook for the year. We now expect low double-digit net revenue growth and adjusted EPS growth in the high-20 range. As we indicated previously, U.S. tax reform add 9 to 10 points to our EPS growth rate.","We bought back 16.9 million shares of Class A common stock at an average price of $120.39 or $2 billion this quarter. Year-to-date, buybacks totaled 32.4 million shares at an average price of $115.73 or $3.8 billion. This leaves $7.5 billion available for share repurchases as of March 31.","Moving now to a review of key business drivers in the second quarter, payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 11%. U.S. payments volume growth of over 10% was 0.5 percentage point higher than last quarter. U.S. consumer debit accelerated 2 percentage points with strength across retail and every day spend segments. U.S. consumer credit growth remained robust at 11%, with continued strong growth in travel categories.","International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 11%, up 1 percentage point versus last quarter. Growth was strong across Asia, driven by China and Japan. Growth stepped up in Latin America, helped by Brazil. Growth in Europe remained stable and strong. Cross-border volume growth accelerated 2.5 percentage points on a constant dollar basis to over 11%.","The drag from an e-commerce payments platform shifting acquiring of UK cardholder volumes to the UK from another EU location which we mentioned in the past three quarters, reduced cross-border growth by over 2 percentage points. We will fully lap this change in the third quarter. Partially offsetting this drag we are lapping a settlement delay in Europe last year. As a reminder, some volume that would normally have settled in March shifted into the first week of April last year.","This contributed 1 percentage point to cross-border growth this quarter and will reduce growth by the same amount in the third quarter. The impact of each of these items on net revenue was de minimis.","Growth of inbound commerce into the U.S. reached double digits for the first time since the first quarter of fiscal 2014, helped by a weakening dollar as well as initiatives to grow cross-border volume that are bearing fruit.","Outbound spend from Europe, excluding intra-Europe transactions, also accelerated into the double-digit driven by the stronger euro and pound. Outbound spend from the U.S. and inbound volumes into Europe continued to hold up despite these currency shifts.","Other markets with notable inbound commerce growth include Russia, the Middle East and several countries in Southeast Asia. Outbound commerce accelerated from Mexico, Japan and the Middle East.","Processed transactions growth was flat to last quarter at a healthy 12% with acceleration in the U.S. offset by lapping India demonetization and some new business in Europe in the prior year's quarter.","Through April 21, U.S. payments volumes are up 9%. Constant dollar cross-border volumes grew 6% as reported. Adjusting for the impact of the settlement delay in Europe, cross-border volumes grew 10%. Processed transactions grew 9%.","The shift in timing of the Easter holiday impacted growth across all three metrics during the first three weeks of April. We expect the impact of the Easter shift to be de minimis for the quarter. As I mentioned earlier, the settlement delay will reduce reported cross-border growth by 1 point.","Turning now to financial results, net revenue growth of 13% was significantly stronger than expected. As a reminder we have reached apples-to-apples revenue growth comparisons for Europe, Costco and USAA. Service revenue grew 13% with strong performance in the U.S., slower China dual branded card runoff and some recent renewals performing better than expected.","International revenue increased 19% with accelerating cross-border growth particularly inbound to the U.S. as well as favorable exchange rate shifts. Data processing growth of 15% benefited from a higher proportion of cross-border transactions and the overall strength in U.S. payments volume.","Client incentives were lower than we expected this quarter at 20.3% of gross revenue. Contract signing delays in Europe are the primary reason. This translates to an additional $0.02 of EPS in the quarter which we expect will be offset due to higher client incentive in the third quarter.","Compared with the second quarter of fiscal 2017, however, client incentives are up 25% as many of the contract conversions in Europe were completed during the second half of fiscal 2017. Our Europe contract restructuring initiative is complete.","Deal terms have been agreed with all clients and we expect the remaining contracts to be signed in the third quarter. This was a large and complex initiative that is executed very well by our team in Europe.","We are pleased with the results relative to the expectations we had at the time of the Visa Europe acquisition. We look forward to building upon the client partnerships that we have solidified through the contract conversion process.","On \u2013 as reported on a GAAP basis, operating expenses grew 4%. As a reminder, the second quarter of last year included a non-recurring contribution to the Visa Foundation related to the reorganization of Visa Europe and other Visa subsidiaries. This charitable donation was recorded in general and administrative expenses.","Adjusted to exclude this special item from the second quarter of fiscal 2017, operating expenses grew 17.6%, primarily driven by personnel costs and marketing. The second quarter of the last fiscal year was the low point in our head count post the global restructuring, including the reductions in Europe.","The year-over-year increase reflects the investment in personnel we have made since then directed at our key growth initiatives. In addition, this quarter included the increase in our 401(k) matching contribution for U.S. employees and higher employee incentive accruals tied to better than expected year-to-date performance.","We stepped up marketing investments for the Winter Olympics and in preparation for the FIFA World Cup, which kicks off during the third quarter. Professional fees reflect increased investment to accelerate strategic initiatives in Europe and the deployment of Visa Direct.","Growth in network and processing expenses included Europe integration costs. Amortization related to acquisition, CardinalCommerce in February of fiscal 2017, and Fraedom, which closed March this year, contributed to higher D&A expenses.","Finally, exchange rate shifts, particularly the stronger pound, added 1 percentage point to expense growth. Non-operating expense was $13 million higher than the second quarter of last year, driven by new debt issuance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.","Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 19%. This includes a 6 percentage point reduction related to U.S. tax reform and the benefit from the successful resolution of a state tax initiative I mentioned earlier.","With that, I'll move to our outlook for fiscal 2018. Given stronger than expected growth in the first half, we now expect full year net revenue growth in the low double digits on a nominal dollar basis.","This includes approximately 1 percentage point of positive foreign currency impact. Given that the weakening of the dollar accelerated starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the exchange rate tailwind moderates in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year.","We're narrowing the range for incentives as a percent of gross revenue to 21.5% to 22%. We expect incentives paid to be higher than prior expectation since our volume growth is better. However, our incentive as a percentage of gross revenues are now expected to be in the lower half of our original outlook range since gross revenue will be higher.","Third quarter client incentive growth will be higher than prior expectation due to the delay of some contract signings in Europe. Full year operating expense growth is forecast to be in the low double-digits, adjusted for special items in fiscal 2017.","The increase in expense growth is driven by larger marketing investments, the acquisition of Fraedom, and higher employee incentive accrual related to better-than-expected performance. We anticipate an additional 1 point of foreign currency impact, primarily due to the strengthening of the pound.","Given the FIFA World Cup and some seasonality in personnel costs in the third quarter, coupled with the ramp-up of investment initiative, we expect double-digit expense growth to continue in the third quarter. Expense growth should moderate to the mid-single-digit range by the fourth quarter.","Our tax rate, including the impact of U.S. tax reform, is expected to be between 21% and 22%. This reflects the lower tax rate realized year-to-date.","Bringing all this together, we now expect EPS growth in the low-60s on a GAAP nominal dollar basis and the high-20s on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis. This includes 1.5 percentage points of positive foreign currency impact and a 9 to 10 percentage point benefit from the impact of U.S. tax reform.","As a reminder, we will adopt the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of fiscal 2019. If applied to second quarter fiscal 2018 reported results, the impact of the new standard would have been small. The impact to fiscal 2019 is partially dependent on the terms of new incentive deals executed and will, therefore, vary.","We will continue to assess the impact of the new standard throughout this fiscal year and provide an update if we believe that the application of the new standard to new deals in aggregate could have a more significant impact on reported results. As a reminder, the new accounting standard has no impact on cash flows or the economic value of our business.","Finally, let me add my welcome to Mike Milotich in his new role as our Head of Investor Relations. I worked closely with Mike since I joined Visa and believe he'll be a valuable resource for all of you. Mike has a deep understanding of the strategic and financial aspects of our business. You will find Mike a pleasure to work with. I look forward to introducing Mike to you all over the coming weeks.","With that, I'll turn this back to him.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, Vasant. We are now ready to take questions, Katie.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question today comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks and good evening. I had a question around pricing and the demand environment in Europe in particular. There seems to be some suggestions, I think, in the market that scheme fees on acquirers are rising pretty quickly and have been so for the past couple quarters. And I'm just wondering is there a dynamic that you guys have been able to take advantage of recently?","And then secondly, on the clearing and settlement, that sounds good that you guys are done there. Once you get authorization migrated, is there a meaningful opportunity from a product perspective that we should be thinking through? Thank you.","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Well, first of all, Dan, on the pricing front, when we first made the acquisition of Visa Europe, we took some pricing. We've subsequently taken some pricing. And as I look out, I think there's pricing opportunities. I'm talking about Europe now, pricing opportunities in Europe looking forward as well.","In terms of the migration, I think once we get through \u2013 I mean, first of all, once we get through, one of the biggest benefits that is going to be available is that VisaNet being a global system and with us having four data centers around the world, we're going to be able to ensure real fallback for our clients and for our business in Europe. Prior, it was one system running in one data center. So that's one big advantage that we will have in terms of backup and security.","And I think beyond that, there's going to be opportunities in some of our risk tools and in loyalty for sure, where we'll be able to offer new and different capabilities to clients in Europe that they wouldn't have had on the old legacy system.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Donald J. Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, Al. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sort of how you came to the thought process on the shared single button digital wallet approach. I know you've been working on Visa Checkout for a while. And can you talk a little bit about how it will work from a logistics standpoint?","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","All right. Well, first of all, Don, this is something that the EMVCo standards body actually developed, of which we're a participant. We actually believe that the \u2013 we're very excited about this. I think that \u2013 I think I talked to some of you about this in the past. I think that there's way too much clutter in the e-commerce checkout environment.","And it's just not good for users, and it's not good for merchants. It creates too much friction. There's consumers who don't know what to do. And after they actually make a decision to buy, it's too confusing for them and they fall out of the buying process. And that's just lost business for everybody in the ecosystem.","So because of the simplicity, because of the security and because of what we think is going to be a much better user experience, Don, we're very excited about it. We're committed to it and are doing everything we can to move forward to make it a reality.","Well, we've been committed to Visa Checkout. We'll remain committed to Visa Checkout, especially in certain geographies and in \u2013 for certain merchants where they see value. But I think the ultimate future as I see it in e-commerce, and it will take time to bleed it in throughout the entire ecosystem, is a move to this EMVCo standard, which creates a single button, which is much more analogous to the situation that you see in the physical world where there's a single terminal and all products run through that terminal.","In essence, we've had in the e-commerce world a moral equivalent of multiple terminals, if you will. And I think that's just terrible. It's lousy for the merchants. It's a bad experience for consumers. So, we're excited about this Secure Remote Commerce framework and standard that EMVCo has come up with.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wonder, Al, if you can kind of frame-up the opportunity as you see it in China and India in particular, obviously big, well-highlighted, cash-centric markets. And wonder if you can just give us a sense of Visa's strategy. I know China has been particularly challenging but to address may be India. And what kind of timeline you think there is for sort of material contribution from potential electronic payments growth there.","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Andrew, let me start with China. I mean, we continue to be very excited about China. We have an application into become a international payment provider in China, and we're hoping that the People's Bank of China and the Chinese government look favorably upon our application, and we can begin the process of moving toward being ready in cooperation with the government in China to be a domestic player.","In the meantime we're continuing to work with our over 50 bank partners in China to continue try to grow our coverage in China as well as obviously facilitate as much cross-border volume from traveling Chinese as they leave the borders of China.","In the case of India, India is in a different place because we are very pleased with where things are in India. And India, post demonetization, has really attracted huge interest, so.","And that makes sense because the cash displacement opportunity is really great there. The reality is we're the market leader. We've got over 50% share in credit and debit and we've continued to grow in 2018 despite the fact that we're growing over some huge numbers that were related to demonetization in 2017.","We're really working with the Indian government on the Bharat QR code and scaling that. I think we're up in somewhere in the area of 450,000 merchants that are enabled for this standard QR code. We're growing overall acceptance. We've doubled from the fourth quarter of 2016.","We've doubled the number of POS terminals by the end of last year to 3 million. We're continuing to partner with our issuers there in terms of building awareness and usage and we're also \u2013 we're partnering with clients there on digital solutions, tokenization, contactless, scan and pay.","So, I see China as something we're excited about but something that's probably still a couple years away in terms of us being a player there and being able to start to produce any kind of volumes never mind meaningful volumes.","But India I see as a long-term play. They're a country of nearly 1.4 billion people and I think we've barely scratched the surface in terms of the opportunity as kind of as big as the numbers feel from a relatively close to a standing start. I think that it's an exciting opportunity for the industry. And as the market leader in India, we see it as a very exciting opportunity for us.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Ryan Cary - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","This is Ryan Cary on for Jason. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping to dive a little deeper into the international growth in the quarter, which came in well ahead of what we were modeling. Is there anything worth calling out that surprised you to the upside?","And it looks like the spread between volume growth and revenue growth also widened pretty materially. I'm assuming there were some benefit from FX in there but was there any pricing benefits in the quarter? Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, several things in there so I'll take them one by one Jason if I can get to them.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Ryan.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","...or Ryan, sorry. Sorry about that, Ryan. I guess Jason is elsewhere today. So why was it better than \u2013 it was better than we expected. Coming into the year, as you know our inbound business to the U.S. has been a weak business for several years because the dollar was strong.","And coming into the year, we hoped that with the weakening of the dollar, there would be some improvement in that business. And we projected a step-up in the growth rate. We were pretty much in line with our expectations in the first quarter but the acceleration continued pretty fast into the second quarter.","And in many ways the inbound business to the U.S. has grown faster than we expected. So the recovery has been \u2013 come in earlier than we might have projected. That's one reason.","The other reason is the outbound business from Europe, business that is leaving the EU in total, also grew in the double digits for the opposite reason because the euro and the pound are now stronger. Those two clearly were much stronger than we expected and they're very important corridors for us. The revenue impact is greater because the mix of business is better. Because the inbound business to the U.S. for us is an attractive business, and the mix of our cross-border business suddenly got better.","There was no pricing that was any \u2013 new or different than anything that was in place prior to coming into the quarter. Certainly, exchange rates were a little better, so that certainly helped that line more than other lines. And then overall, I mean, adding to these two corridors, the cross-border business, because of strong global economy has been strong just about everywhere in the world.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Ashwin Shirvaikar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. So, thanks for taking the question, good quarter. My question was with regard to debit volume growth in the U.S. If you could break down what's driving this increased macro or in the spend trend any particular wins to call out? And also just to clarify, is Visa Direct classified here?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yes. So the debit growth was clearly very strong. And at this point, as we told you earlier, it's not benefiting from any conversion type benefit. This is real apples-to-apples growth and, therefore, quite heartening to see it as strong as it was. As we've dug into it, it was pretty broad-based. We're seeing growth, as I mentioned in my comments, across many segments of retail and across all the everyday spend categories. We essentially attest it to a pretty strong consumer profile in terms of propensity to spend. As a business shifts more to e-commerce, that clearly, also helps in many ways. And then as far as overall sort of the underlying sort of mix of business, that also remains very good. So all in all, just about every aspect of the debit business looked very good this quarter.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks so much. Good results. I guess, I wanted to follow-up on a couple of the questions on international and whatnot. I'm curious, Al, in your travels, has the nationalism sort of theme being settled (46:19)? I know you're making a push towards localizing a lot of the business. I heard your answers around China and in India. But just bigger picture, I'm curious if the whole nationalism sort of pendulum has shifted in any way in your mind?","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Tien-Tsin, in the last five weeks, I've done a trip to Korea, I've done a trip to China, and I've done our trip to the Middle East and Northern Africa. I still see quite a strong nationalism theme. I think from my perspective, which I've said before, this business, this payments business is a very local business. So clearly on one hand, the solution set that we need to go to market with our issuer clients and our merchant clients is different market by market, and that's a positive thing. And we recognize that and we're putting more resources as we add personnel, adding more people out in the actual countries because that's where the action is.","The negative or the watch out of nationalism is what happens in terms of regulation and domestic processing. And does that grow around the world? And what are the rules as it grows? There's domestic processing in a number of markets, some of them it's a very fair playing field where the government is not mandating that you must process on a local processor but it's yet just another option. In a couple of countries, it's not quite an even playing field and we continue to push and work with those governments to try to get it there. So that's what I'd say I was seeing, Tien-Tsin.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. I was wondering whether you would talk a little bit about whether you're thinking about any sorts of incentives whether it's a carrot or stick type incentives to kind of encourage the move towards that single pay button. And just as a related thing, since you did link in the discussion with PayPal to Visa Direct, is have you ever given any kind of metrics on the size or growth rate of that channel for you?","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Hi, Moshe, it's Al. We're in the top of the first inning here on the Secure Remote Commerce and the single pay button. We're just getting familiar with the standards from EMVCo and trying to understand exactly what we have to do and what merchants have to do in order to make it a reality in the marketplace. I think that our kind of immediate focus is to get very familiar with the technical aspects of what needs to happen in terms of getting it set up.","My personal belief, and we'll have to see how this plays out, is that this is going to come as a really, really positive news for both consumers and merchants. And I think that if done correctly, which we hope that it is, that adoption is going to \u2013 the curve of adoption is going to be quite quick.","That said, there have been cases in the past where to accelerate progress we have thought about and used incentives, but we're nowhere near being able to make a decision on that at this point. And I'm hoping we don't because I'm hoping that it's such a very clear improvement in the user experience and the friction, it goes out of the system that people will adopt very, very quickly.","In terms of your second question, which I think was around volumes related to PayPal and Visa Direct. We haven't provided any color on that as of this moment.","I would say that we're pleased with the way adoption of Visa Direct is continuing. As I said in my remarks, right now, there's a few use cases that we're focused on. And we're pleased with those use cases and we're trying to increase in essence the distribution of those use cases over time. We're hoping to actually look to add further use cases, which will further expand the universe of places where Visa Direct can be used. So I think there's a tremendous amount of upside relative to Visa Direct as we look out over the next couple of years.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Vasant, you talked about sort of the stronger economy driving some of the more robust trends. I was wondering, in the U.S., was any of it discernible from tax reform? Like have you guys seen any impact as it relates to tax reform?","And then on the shared button comment, as far as costs are concerned, are there any cost savings as a result of not having to go full force with Visa Checkout? Or are there other costs that we have to contemplate, given the new initiative? Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Right. In terms of are we seeing any impact from tax reform on consumer spending, I would have to say that it's hard for us to isolate those kinds of impacts. So I don't think we have a point of view on that, and it's probably a little too early in any case. So I'm not sure I can tell you anything specific on that front.","As it relates to the button, as Al said earlier, many of these questions are relatively premature given where we are. In terms of Visa Checkout, we remain as focused on it as we were. We will use Visa Checkout in those parts of the world where it clearly is a valuable option for people, especially outside the U.S. In the U.S., there are merchants who would see value in it. We would definitely use Visa Checkout as a solution there.","Once this single button solution is available, then we'll just have to see how that plays between the Visa Checkout option and the single button. In the meantime, we will have to spend some money to develop the single button option from a technology standpoint and all that.","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","I think, Sanjay, it goes back a bit to Moshe's question as well. Look, if this gets \u2013 if the pace of adoption is quick, then the reality is that \u2013 and we don't have to either do incentives or do big advertising to promote it. Obviously, that's a good thing.","In the case of Visa Direct, we obviously have spent quite a bit of money in promoting it and pushing it. That's why we've gotten over 30 million users of Visa Direct.","But I think it remains to be seen until we play this out a little bit more over time as we become more familiar with what's going on, based on the data we're seeing, we'll certainly give more color and commentary on it. But it's just \u2013 it really is early.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","James Eric Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, thank you. We recently saw a bulletin saying that MasterCard had increased its assessment fees on payment volumes. So I was just wondering what your general thoughts were on the trajectory of Visa's pricing going forward, particularly in the U.S.?","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Well, we generally don't talk a lot about what our pricing plans are. We obviously look \u2013 we have a dedicated pricing team. We look at pricing on everything that we do from the pricing to issuers, the pricing to acquirers, the services that we make available to our issuer and merchant customers, and we look at the price value equation, we look at the competitive set, and we make judgments on an ongoing basis. And I think that's the most I'd say about it.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question and welcome, Mike. I just want to ask a question for you, Al. You talked quite a bit about contactless payments and adoption rates across the globe.","Can you maybe just give us a sense about the details of your plans around the U.S.? You talked about some enablement for on the merchant side. But what are you doing to get that stronger on the bank issuer side? Any plans you can articulate there?","And then maybe share with us your expectations, say, maybe two years out about what the penetration rate could be or look like in the U.S.?","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Well, Jim, I think the U.S. market \u2013 I think I've talked about this before but maybe I haven't. The U.S. market is a bit different. It's a little upside down in terms of how this opportunity has \u2013 presents itself.","Usually, around the world, the issuer side of the equation has been ahead, and we've had to kind of pull the merchant community along, which I actually think is the harder lift.","In the U.S., we kind of got the opposite situation, where we've got nearly 60% of the top 100 enabled. We've got virtually all the terminals being shipped today are enabled for contactless.","The whole transit system push, which is happening at a fairly large clip in terms of interest is a stimulant. So in our case, in the U.S., the reality is that we need to catch up on the issuer side, and that's a smaller constituent group versus millions and millions of merchants.","So we're in lots of discussions with our issuer partners. And I think that there's a lot of interest on the part of our issuer partners to move to contactless. Nobody's too anxious to do a mass card replacement, but I think as cards start to get replaced, you'll start to see more contactless evolve. That said, as I said in my remarks, this is at least a year or two to get this off the ground before you start to get the beginnings of movement. And then if the U.S. is like other markets, which I have no reason to believe it won't be, I think that, we'll \u2013 in a couple of years, we'll \u2013 if we're in the single-digit that we'll start to see real acceleration then over the next couple of years.","And I'm hoping maybe because it's really \u2013 progress is more going to be driven by issuer side movement that maybe the adoption could \u2013 curve could be actually a little bit quicker than we've seen in some of the international market. But that said, I'm not going to get into predicting this right now as to exactly what level of penetration it would be in a couple of years. But I could tell you this, we're excited about it and we're pushing on it.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Last question, Katie.","Operator","Our final question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Vasu Govil - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. This is Vasu Govil for James Faucette. Just two really quick ones. One on Visa Direct, you guys talked about a lot of traction there. Could you maybe talk a little bit about what geographies you were seeing more traction in? Is it mostly in the U.S. or what international geographies you're seeing more traction?","And then from a P&L perspective, where are these volumes and revenues getting captured? And then quickly on \u2013 just following up on the nationalism question before, recently, I think the Central Bank in India is considering some regulation that all user data needs to be stored only in the country. So, what would that mean for Visa in terms of your ability to process transactions there? Thank you.","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Okay. So I think there were three questions there.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Visa Direct.","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","So Visa Direct is a product running on VisaNet. So, it is a true global offering. I mean, it \u2013 because VisaNet is global, Visa Direct is global and it's operating in a large number of markets around the world, including Europe, now that we've got VisaNet starting to run in Europe. So I mentioned in the remarks that today probably P2P remains one of the bigger use cases for Visa Direct, but there are other disbursement use cases that we're looking at and are coming onstream that are also producing volumes on Visa Direct. I think your second question was where is it captured?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Where do we see most of the volume?","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","It's payments volume, right? And some of it is \u2013 it's mostly domestic, but there are some cross-border, so it's mostly showing up in service fees and data processing.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Right and the U.S. certainly is among the better developed markets. You were asking the question from a geography standpoint, and we're starting to see volume in Europe and other parts of the world. And as we've told you, our goal is to have 1.7 billion or so debit credentials enabled by the end of this calendar year on a global basis going all the way to 2 billion. And then there was one","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","And then the last question on India. Yes, the RBI, the Central Bank of India has issued in the last 10 days or so a data localization rule. We're still get \u2013 starting to get \u2013 trying to get our hands around them and understand what it means. They're looking for some form of adoption in six months, which is a tough timeframe. So it's early, again, very early there. We're in almost daily discussions with our tech team, with the government in India, with the RBI in India to try to get a sense of what are they really trying to accomplish and what might be the best way to get there. So, again, more to come as we continue our dialogue with the folks in India.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today.

Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted on our IR website.","Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.","Al Kelly","Mike, thank you; and good afternoon everyone and thank you for joining us today. 2020 is off to a strong start with Visa\u2019s first quarter performance. It\u2019s a reflection of our focus on clients and commitment to moving money globally, seamlessly and safely. In our time today, let me first touch on our results and then discuss how we\u2019re going to grow our core C2B or consumer payments business and capturing new payment flows, which is all part of our network-to-network strategies.","To start, our first quarter results, we had a terrific quarter and the business is performing well. We reported net revenue growth of 10%. But if you adjust for exchange rates and very low currency volatility, our net revenue growth was approximately 13%. Our EPS growth was 12% or 14% on a constant-dollar basis, excluding the impact of acquisitions made after Q1 last year.","Key business drivers were largely consistent with the fourth quarter as we expected. For the first time in our history, total network volume this quarter was over $3 trillion. Payment volume grew at 8% globally, 10% excluding China and the UK. Cross-border volume rose 9% on a constant-dollar basis and we processed nearly 38 billion total transactions on our network, up 11%.","Let me touch briefly on holiday spending, starting with the United States, the growth was similar to the 2018 and 2017 holiday seasons, which were both strong years. Credit growth was slightly better than last year and debit growth slowed slightly due to lapping tax reform, which had a positive impact on U.S. debit growth throughout all of last year, including the holiday season.","E-commerce grew three to four times faster than non-e-commerce. E-commerce also drove more than one-third of all consumer spend, up two percentage points versus last year. Retail spend growth was stronger than last year, fueled mostly by e-commerce. However, that was offset by slower growth in travel and restaurant spending. To give you a brief sense of the holiday season in the other major markets, Brazil and Canada saw slightly stronger growth than last year. The UK growth was similar to last year's level, and growth in Australia slowed slightly.","Now let's look at the core business overall for the first quarter. We are growing our core payments business in three ways; through large clients and markets; number two, making progress to capture the opportunity in emerging and other markets through new partnerships, including wallets and fintech; and three, all while helping the ecosystem remove friction.","We continue to have significant renewals and wins amongst some of our largest financial institutions. These have renewed our issuing agreement with Capital One effective January 1 of this year. We're very pleased to continue our longstanding relationship with Capital One.","We recently renewed our agreement with DKB, our largest issuing bank in Germany, and we're looking forward to developing new service as a product within this exclusive innovation partnership. In the Caribbean, we\u2019ve renewed a multiyear contract with Royal Bank of Canada for credit and debit. This agreement also includes some new debit wins covering 17 Caribbean countries and territories. In Latin America, we're pleased to have won the credit and debit business for Santander in Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay.","This leadership position with financial institutions also extends to the merchants, as we are a leader in co-brand with 13 of the top 20 portfolios globally. This quarter we could take it to solidify our leadership position. In the United States, we were selected for the new Venmo co-brand credit card reflection of our strong partnership with PayPal. The opportunity for this product is quite significant as Venmo has over 52 million users currently.","We're excited to continue growing our longstanding co-brand relationships with Caesars Rewards and Harley Davidson. Sony has relaunched both of their co-branded credit cards connected with the Sony Rewards program. Together, Sony and Visa are partnering in a number of ways to grow these programs and bring compelling offers to their cardholders. We already had a strong relationship with Costco as their co-brand provider in United States, Taiwan, South Korea and Mexico, and just this corner secured the China co-brand.","In Europe, Visa extended our co-brand partnerships with Norwegian Air Shuttle and S-Group, respectively. In CEMEA, we renew the Emirates NBD\u2019s credit business and half of that portfolio is represented by the Emirates Skywards co-brand program exclusively with Visa. And the rest of the portfolio is bank branded credit.","Our wins are not limited to just large issuers and merchants as we continue to make progress to capture the opportunity in emerging and other markets through wallets and investments. In Africa, we have recently taken several steps to help accelerate the shift to digital payments. On the credential side, mobile money wallets are already prevalent across Africa. But without a virtual or physical debt or credential associated with them, many international online services are unavailable to users. To help solve this problem, we announced a collaboration with MFS Africa, which is Africa's largest digital payments hub connecting through one API to more than 180 million mobile wallets on the continent to distribute Visa payment credentials across the continent.","In an effort to build acceptance, we recently announced an investment and partnership with Flutterwave, a Pan African digital payments platform that enables multipayment acceptance and processing. Together, Flutterwave will further scale its consumer payment service called Barter and its merchant acquiring service called Rave through Visa products such as Visa Direct, Visa QR and Virtual cards.","In addition, Visa established its strategic partnership and will acquire a minority stake \u2013 equity stake in Interswitch, a company focused on the digitization of payments that processes more than 80% of domestic transactions in Nigeria, and sales payment processing across 23 other countries in Africa, and operates the largest domestic debit card scheme on the continent with 23 million cardholders.","Our partnership will help accelerate Visa deployment of payment experiences, leveraging interswitches, processing and integration capabilities and scale their bill pay services across Africa. As we grow our business in emerging markets and with new players across the globe, we\u2019re ever focused on improving the point-of-sale experience and reduce the friction for the entire ecosystem. In the card-present environment, we continue to see meaningful momentum in tap to pay what we consider to be the most friction free way to pay in person.","We have reached a point, where one in every three card-present transactions that runs over our network is tapped versus one in four a year ago this quarter. This past year, we doubled the number of countries, whose face-to-face transactions are at least two thirds contactless. Transit continues to be a key user case and an important way to habituate tapping behavior. In New York city on the MTA, Visa crossed two million taps in November, from the beginning of the pilot and three million in January. The MTA recently announced the tap to pay expansion to their entire system by the end of 2020. And we are currently pacing a 350,000 Visa taps a week on the MTA and nearly, one in every 10 transactions in the New York Metro area is a tap to pay on a Visa card.","We also launched Africa\u2019s first contactless transit system in Johannesburg this quarter, in addition to launches in Ho Chi Minh city as well as Taiwan, Sweden, and Ukraine. In the e-commerce environment, click-to-pay or what we once called Secure Remote Commerce, speaks s to streamline the digital payment experience across networks offering greater security and improved sales. You may recall, we launched with a select number of merchants in October and by the end of December more than 40 merchants had adopted the new click-to-pay solution.","Now that the holiday season is over, we recently completed the migration of 5,500 U.S. merchants to click-to-pay. We expect to complete the migration of the remainder of Visa Checkout merchants in the United States over the coming months. Additionally, all 50 million consumers, who are already enrolled with Visa Checkout, were automatically converted to click-to-pay. Globally, we continue to make progress on securing the ecosystem with tokens. Introduced in 2014, tokens have expanded into 107 countries equating to six billion tokenized transactions in 2019. We now have over 750 million tokens globally.","Over the past 18 months, Visa Sign, it is now live with the majority of large e-commerce platform for card-on-file tokenizations, including Adyen, Raintree, CyberSource, PayPal, Stripe, as well as some big e-commerce companies including Amazon and Netflix, amounting to hundreds of millions of new tokens, which is accelerating the pace of e-commerce transactions now processed over the Visa token service. Collectively, we have secured merchant and partner commitments for tokenization in the e-comm space that will add up to approximately $1 trillion in Visa payments volume.","Putting it together, our core business remains strong as we continue to win with traditional players, new players, and speak to remove friction. Outside of our traditional C2B business, we\u2019re making progress and capturing new payment flows. in the card-based B2B space, we had several wins in the first quarter. In Singapore, we\u2019ve won the government procurement card for Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation or OCBC with the Singapore government mandating the digitize payments by 2023; OCBC is targeted to capture a significant public sector procurement volume. Within the CEMEA region, Visa signed a partnership with NEC payments, a digital banking and payments processing platform to expand NEC\u2019s regional and international issuing business focused on virtual card for B2B payments such as travel and insurance.","In Hong Kong, we partnered with Neat, a fintech offering digital business account services to be an exclusive partner with Visa\u2019s issue virtual commercial cards. Visa Direct serves P2P, B2C and even B2small business with over 700 million transactions in the first quarter of 2020. This quarter, we wanted to highlight significant progress in the B2B cross-border space.","MoneyGram announced it is now live enabling international transfers that rely on Visa Direct, the new service, which has been available within the United States in September; it\u2019s starting with transfers to Spain and the Philippines. TransferWise, the global technology company for international payments will also begin offering its customers the ability to send, receive funds in real-time to Visa Direct. The integrated capability currently available in six countries including Spain and Poland will soon be available across more countries in Europe.","Our continued progress with Visa Direct speaks to our network of network strategy, where consumers did business as in governments to move money to anyone anywhere, each new network endpoints be it a car, the consumer or a business account or a wallet, compounds the value of the capabilities we offer to partners and improves the customer experience through a single Visa connections.","As I talk about network, it\u2019s hard not to mention Plaid, although I\u2019m not going to cover into too much detail until the transaction closes. We see Plaid is having the potential to deliver real value to Visa in multiple ways. We have received a number of questions on their revenue model. So, I thought I would cover it quickly. Similar to us, we have a usage base revenue model, pricing is structured on a pay per API call basis, and varies by product depending on the type of financial data consumed by the customers at the fintech, which speaks to the power of their network. We are truly excited about the acquisition.","To close, we\u2019re off to a strong start in the first quarter with much to be excited about as we look forward. We are deepening partnerships with traditional players in markets and expanding assets with new players. We\u2019re removing friction in the ecosystem and we\u2019re making significant progress to capture new flow. This is all part of our network of network strategy as we continue to focus on clients and moving money globally, seamlessly and safely.","I want to take a quick moment to mention our Investor Day on February 11 here in San Francisco, which will simultaneously be webcast. You will hear from for knowledgeable and deep bench of leaders will discuss our view on the evolution of the ecosystem and how we intend to deliver Visa\u2019s future growth to our customer \u2013 consumer payments business, new flows and value-added services. The formal presentations should run from about 8:00 AM to 2:30 PM Pacific Time and we look forward to your participation.","With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.","Vasant Prabhu","Thank you, Al and good afternoon everyone. We had a strong start to fiscal 2020 with results coming in consistent with our expectations, excluding acquisitions and investment gains, constant-dollar net revenue and EPS growth about 11% and 14% respectively. Exchange rates reduced revenue growth by over one point and EPS growth by approximately one and a half points. The four acquisitions completed in the last six months, increased reported revenue growth by approximately half a point and expense growth by approximately three points.","starting in fiscal 2020, we're providing adjustments to our GAAP numbers each quarter to help investors\u2019 better track ongoing business performance. Non-GAAP results will exclude three items: 1) the impact of equity investment gains and losses 2) amortization of acquired intangible assets or acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2019 and forward, and 3) certain non-recurring acquisition-related costs. Prior non-GAAP results were also adjusted to reflect this change.","this quarter, the impact of non-GAAP adjustments is de minimis. In addition, you will find a helpful schedule on the first slide of our earnings presentation. In addition to GAAP and non-GAAP results, we provide the growth rate impacts of exchange rates as well as the inorganic impact of acquisitions. in other words, the revenue expense and EPS impact that acquisitions had on our reported numbers this year, which were not in our reported numbers in the first quarter last year.","A few highlights from the quarter. Key business driver growth rates, payments, volume, process transactions and cross-border volume that's stable and consistent with prior quarters. Net revenue grew 10%. However, the underlying growth trend in revenues is masked by two significant drags related to currencies. First, a stronger dollar reduced nominal net revenue growth rates by over one point. second, currency volatilities were at the lowest level we have seen in over five years. as maybe expected, the sharp decline in currency volatility had a significant impact on international fee revenue.","If you adjust for the drag from unusually low currency volatility and the drag from the strong dollar, underlying net revenue growth is robust at approximately 13%. Constant-dollar payments volume growth of 8%, slowed by one point compared to last quarter. This trend \u2013 this change in trend is driven by differences in processing days when compared to the first and fourth quarters of last year. The processing day impact was over one point in the U.S. and several points in Canada.","excluding the processing the impact, Q1 payments volume growth was similar to last quarter and second quarter service revenues associated with these volumes will be in line with our expectation. constant-dollar cross-border growth rates, excluding volumes within Europe, were also stable at 9%. our reported constant-dollar cross-border growth rates accelerated 2.9% as we are now lapping the pan-European e-commerce platform, which re-oriented acquiring across countries last year, converting transactions from cross-border to domestic.","As we have discussed in the past, this shift at minimal revenue impact to Visa, has cross-border transactions within Europe, have revenue yields similar to domestic yields. We repurchased 13 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $179.71 with $2.3 billion in the quarter. Our board has authorized a new $9.5 billion share repurchase program. with this additional authorization and the $1.7 billion of remaining authorized funds as of December 31, 2019, we have $11.2 billion available for share repurchases. including our quarterly dividend of $0.30 per share, we returned approximately $3 million of capital to shareholders in the quarter.","Turning now to our key business drivers and financial performance. payments volume growth in constant dollars was 8%, credit was up 6%, debit was up 11%, growth excluding China and the UK was 10%. as a reminder, Chinese domestic volumes are impacted by dual-branded card conversion, which have minimal revenue impact. U.S. payments volume growth was up 8% with credit growing 7% and debit 9%.","Excluding the processing day impact I described earlier, growth accelerated almost one point due to a partial lapping of the Cabela\u2019s conversion and multi-higher fuel prices. Underlying consumer spending growth was largely consistent with the last quarter.","International payments volume growth in constant dollars was 8% and 12% excluding China and the UK. Growth in CEMEA remains robust 22% with strong growth across Russia and the middle East. Latin America also remains strong at 17%, given by some wins and strong performance of existing clients.","Asia Pacific excluding China grew 8% decelerating over two points primarily due to slow growth in Japan, Australia and Hong Kong. Europe excluding the UK grew 12%. UK growth remains weak and slowed one point after improving in each of the last two quarters. process transactions continue to grow at 11%. constant-dollar cross-border growth of 9% was up two points from the last quarter that\u2019s stable that 9% excluding volumes within Europe. Both travel and e-commerce growth were in line with the last quarter excluding volumes within Europe.","Outbound commerce accelerated from Russia, Africa and across Europe, which was offset by weaker growth out of the U.S. and Asia. Inbound commerce accelerated a bit into the U.S., but decelerated a little into Europe, which is consistent with the weakening dollar, compared to the pound in Europe. Growth into China and Hong Kong remains weak.","Net revenues grew 10% or 11% in constant dollars excluding acquisition. The impact of our acquisitions on revenue growth was approximately half a point. Service revenue growth is consistent with the last quarter at 9%. data processing revenue growth was also in line with the last quarter at 16%. international transaction revenue grew 9%, decreasing two points from the fourth quarter despite its smaller exchange rate drag due to the unusually low currency volatility. other revenues grew 22% slowing 13 points from the fourth quarter as we lap ASC 606 impacts from last year, partially offset by faster growth in our value-added services. client incentives were in line with our expectations at 22.4% of gross revenue, up 30 [ph] basis points from last quarter.","As we told you in October, the expected client incentives to step up from our fiscal 2019 exit percentage, the lower end of our full-year outlook range in the first quarter due to the level of deal activity this quarter and last year.","GAAP operating expenses were up 14%. excluding the amortization of acquired intangible assets and nonrecurring acquisition-related costs from the four acquisitions that closed in the last six months. Non-GAAP expense growth was 13%.","Personnel expense growth is primarily driven by increases in stuff to drive our growth initiatives, which we\u2019ve stepped up in the second half of last year. Acquisitions and some nonrecurring expenses also contributed to personnel expense growth.","Marketing expenses decreased 1% due to the timing of some spending as well as the reporting change that shifted some expenses to the general and administrative line. The impact of acquisitions added two points from non-GAAP expense growth. Exchange rates reduced reported expense growth by approximately one point.","Non-operating income\/expenses include equity investment gains of $13 million, which we are now excluding in our non-GAAP results. Investment income also includes a small non-recurring benefit, which is exactly offset in personnel expenses with no impact on earnings.","Excluding these non-recurring items, investment income is lower this year due to falling interest rates and lower cash balances. Our tax rate of 17.7% was lower due to some items that are unique to our first quarter each year. This was anticipated and reflected in our outlook for tax rate this year.","Moving now to our outlook for the second quarter and the full year. First, let me share business driver growth for the first four weeks of the quarter. Through January 28th U.S. payments volume growth was 10%, with U.S. credit growing 9% and debit 12%. Processed transactions grew 13%. Cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis grew 8% or 7% excluding cross-border volume within Europe. Cross-border volumes in the last two weeks of January are negatively impacted by the shifts in the Chinese new year with potentially some initial effects of the coronavirus outbreak.","As we look ahead to the second quarter of fiscal year 2020, we\u2019re assuming stable growth trends on key business drivers, payments volumes, processed transactions, and cross-border volume. The exchange rate drag on net revenue in the second quarter could be approximately 1 point, 50 basis points better than our prior outlook and consistent with the first quarter due to some weakness in the dollar since September.","More than offsetting the small benefit could be the unexpected drag from currency volatility. The unusually low currency volatility so far this fiscal year continues to persist into January. As maybe expected \u2013 as expected client incentives as a percent of gross revenue will climb to the upper half of our outlook range of 22.5% to 23.5%. Count by the extra day in a leap year, second quarter net revenue growth rates are expected to be in the low-double digit and modestly better than the first quarter.","Our second quarter revenue outlook does not reflect the potential effects of the recent coronavirus outbreak in China. It is too early to assess this impact. Second quarter expense growth is also expected to be modestly higher than the first quarter. As we had indicated in October, expenses will grow at the highest rate for the year in the second quarter as marketing expenses ramp up relative to a low level of spend last year. Also as the dollar has weakened the exchange rate benefit on reported expense growth will be about 1 point, 50 basis points lower than we had anticipated in October.","Our non-operating income\/expense in the first quarter had a run rate of around $65 million, when you exclude the $13 million gain from equity investments and the small non-recurring benefit I mentioned earlier. The run rate of non-operating expenses will be somewhat higher in the second quarter due to lower interest income as a result of lower cash balances and lower interest rates. Our tax rate outlook for the second quarter remains unchanged at 19% to 19.5%.","Overall, we\u2019re maintaining our outlook for fiscal year 2020. I will mention a few adjustments and trends that they're monitoring. On the net revenue front, we are still expecting low-double digit net revenue growth in constant dollars. Based on current exchange rate and future expectations, the currency translation drag could be at the lower end of our previous 1 percentage point to 1.5 percentage point range at approximately 1 point. The four acquisitions we\u2019ve completed in the past six months are still expected to add around 0.5 point of net revenue growth.","As we highlighted in October, a significant factor impacting fiscal year 2020 net revenue growth is the unusually high volume of renewal activity. In fiscal year 2019 we renewed 30% of our payment volume, with 15% renewed in the fourth quarter alone. And we indicated fiscal year 2020 renewal activity could be front loaded, with another 15% to 20% of payment volume renewed in the first half. Since then, it has become apparent the renewal activity in fiscal year 20 could be even higher, with three to four large unplanned renewals now on a discussion. We could bring this year level of renewal activity almost on par with last year.","We are pleased about this since in most of these situations, we will most likely not only renew our existing business but could also gain a larger share of these clients over the term of our new contracts. One major client renewal is already complete, and the other could get done in the next two or three months. As such, we now expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be at the high end of our outlook range of 22.5% to 23.5% in FY2020.","Excluding acquisitions and last year\u2019s MDL-related special item, our outlook assumed four expense growth in the mid-to-high single-digit range in constant dollars or 7% to 8%. This climbs to low double-digit growth when you add in the four acquisitions we have closed on in the past six months, which contribute three points to four points to expense growth. Based on current exchange rates and future expectation, nominal expense growth is likely to benefit by one point.","As such, our expense growth for the year is expected to be in the double-digits, with 50 basis points \u2013 which is about 50 basis points higher than we expected in October. As I indicated earlier, non-operating expense at a run rate of approximately $55 million in the first quarter. This expense will move modestly higher in each successive quarter this year due to declining interest income from lower rates.","Our full year outlook for tax rates remains unchanged at 19% to 19.5%. Q1 tax rates were lower than the full year outlook due to some items that are unique to our first quarter each year and were largely anticipated in our full year outlook. Excluding the four acquisitions, our outlook for adjusted fiscal year 2020 EPS, constant-dollar growth remains in the mid-teens, built off fiscal year 2019 EPS of $5.40. Four acquisitions are expected to dilute EPS by $0.05 or $0.06 a one point drag on EPS growth.","Based on current exchange rates and future expectations, exchange rates could reduce EPS growth at approximately one point. Including the acquisition and exchange rate impacts of 2 points, our outlook for adjusted fiscal year 2020 nominal EPS growth would be in the 12% to 14% range. We still expect for the fourth quarter to be the highest EPS growth quarter. Our fiscal year 2020 outlook does not include any impact from the planned acquisition. We will update our outlook when we have more clarity on the timing for closing on the transaction. When we announced the acquisition, we gave you some preliminary estimates of revenue and earnings of revenue and earnings implications for fiscal year 2020 and 2021.","With that, I'll turn this back to Mike.","Mike Milotich","We're now ready to take questions, Jordan.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg","Hey, good afternoon, guys. So just wanted to start on the incentive side, I mean the guidance change here is really only half a point, I mean if people were previously modeling the middle of the range. I'm just wondering if you expect to make up for that half a point through better gross revenue or does it feel more like you just may land net revenue slightly lower within that overall unchanged low-double digit guidance range, especially since the currency volatility has fallen off as you guys pointed out?","Al Kelly","Yes, a couple of things, Jason. Yes, we'll see how incentives play out for the year, but the way it looks right now, the renewal activity will be higher and so we are signaling that it could be at the upper end of the range. And as you said, if people are in the middle of the range, that's up a point higher. On the other hand, we are signaling that if exchange rates stay roughly in the range they're in on where people are expecting, that is about at the lower end of the range too. So you pick up some of it there.","In terms of currency volatility, we were able to absorb most of it in the first quarter and still get very close to as you saw what our expectations were. We're factoring that into our second quarter outlook. What is going to be for the second half? I think we'll wait and see. It's not something you can predict further out and the time will tell.","Mike Milotich","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Dolev from Macquarie. Your line is now open.","Dan Dolev","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. So a quick question on cross-border, it looks like a nice uptick. Can you maybe talk a little bit about that? Thank you.","Al Kelly","Well, I guess, remember last year, Dan, you had a number of things going on, especially at the back end of the quarter with a government shutdown, Brexit, U.S.-China trade talks, et cetera. So we were expecting some uptick off of some of those factors that had a negative impact on cross-border at the time. And so we're back up in what I think we would expect to be a fairly normal range at this point.","Mike Milotich","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Thanks so much. Everything was really consistent here, but just looking at the regional volumes, just a couple of questions or clarifications. On the Asia front, it looks like it\u2019s slowed to the 4% zone. Curious what was the outlook here based on what you see? And then with Europe, I'm pretty stable, soften and tends to go low end of the 8% to 9% range. But I know you guys have made a lot of investments there. What are your expectations for European? Can you sort of break out of this zone based on some of the investments you've made? What do you see there? Thank you.","Al Kelly","Yes, I might start and I'm sure we'll add. In Asia, we highlighted three areas. Japan was really more of a quarter-over-quarter comparison. There were some changes in consumption taxes in Japan that seemed to push some spending into the period ahead of the tax going up. So it was pushed more into the last quarter. And so it's \u2013 we don't think that's an ongoing issue. The other one was Australia. Australia, you had some of the wildfire impact. And that seems to be one of the bigger factors there. And last was Hong Kong, and you saw \u2013 you know what some of those are. We have seen impacts in Hong Kong from some of the protests going on.","So that was pretty much it. Across the rest of Asia, the trends are very good. In Europe \u2013 UK is a big chunk of our business and the UK has been very weak and actually slowed through the elections and had a very relatively weak holiday season and slowed by a point in the quarter. If you take the UK out, growth was a pretty healthy 12% in the rest of Europe.","The only thing \u2013 I'd add two points, Tien-Tsin, one is the consumption tax that Vasant referred to. Now the government has decided to re-date some of that consumption tax when people do contactless transactions in Japan as part of the government's push on the cashless going into the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. So that actually going to turn out to hopefully be a good thing, not only stimulate spending, but to stimulate tap-to-pay spending.","The other point on Europe; as Vasant rightly pointed out, the UK has been a bit of a drag for us, but we've been extremely focused on the continent and had some \u2013 we've had some good wins in fintechs and some good renewals. And those things are in the pipeline and I feel pretty good about where Europe's going to head over the next couple of years in terms of growth.","Mike Milotich","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller","Hey, thanks, guys. Just a couple of quick ones. One is on the, look, the improvement in volume we're seeing in January seems to really underscore the comments you made around like nuances in Q \u2013 calendar Q4, like the processing day. Just if you can comment on what you're seeing in terms of the consumer given, are these improvements into January just timing or do you actually see a healthier type of spending trend?","Al, just one quick follow-up also was around the rebates incentives given, so many are being done now. Can you just comment on the types of returns you're expecting to see for those? Are these longer contracts than they used to be? Are they coming with more value added offerings? Something along those lines would be great.","Al Kelly","Well, I think Darrin other than in the UK consumer has held up pretty darn well. And our volume in this last quarter when you factor in the processing day change, which is kind of a bit of an anomaly, but if you look in September, the last day of September in 2018 was a Sunday and a lot of merchants that acquires whole volume on a Sunday. So what ended up happening, a bunch of one day worth of \u2013 a lot of volume for one day got pushed into the first quarter of 2019. We did not have that same phenomena this past quarter because the last day of September this year was a Monday. So we just simply had a dynamic that it was \u2013 was hard to grow over. And so when you actually adjust for that, our growth quarter-over-quarter was pretty similar.","So in general, I think the consumer has held up quite well and there's no reason to see it go down other than, again, depending upon where this coronavirus ends up going and who knows at this point. Just to be clear, when you have to have rebates and incentives, when I was referring to the rebate, that was a rebate being given by the government in Japan. I don't know whether that's what you\u2019re referring to. But in general, we are trying to obviously strike the right balance in terms of incentives that we do in deals, try to make many of them as many of those incentive dollars growth-oriented as possible so that as partners\u2019 volume picks up, their incentives picks up, but we're also getting the associated volume with them.","And as \u2013 it\u2019s probably no guarantee, we obviously push for contracts that are as long as possible. There's \u2013 to some degree, most of them kind of fall in a five- to seven-year cycle. Every once in awhile there's some 10-year deals. And then there's issuers that like to do deals every couple of years and those would tend to be more of the issuers that have dual issuers. So, it\u2019s always a bit of a balancing act to try to get to the right level, but I think we try to structure these incentives in smart ways, where they\u2019re growth oriented, they\u2019re focused on consumption of different numbers of Visa products, and try to build relationships with issuers that go well beyond just an issuing relationship to encompass Visa Direct to encompass tokenization, et cetera.","Mike Milotich","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Hi guys. I wanted to ask about Capital One, I know Mastercard also announced a renewal with Capital One. So maybe, you could help us sort out of that contract breaks and if this is a net positive for both networks. And then just secondly, Vasant, on expense growth, I think your comments last quarter was expected to be similar to the fourth quarter, which I think was around 11.4% that came in a little bit higher. Was there any pull forward in expenses, because I think operating margins at the street we\u2019re expecting were a little higher than they came in. Thanks so much.","Al Kelly","Bryan, let me just try to point on Capital One and then I\u2019ll let Vasant comment on acquisition. Look, Capital One has been a classic dual issuer and it \u2013 always, it depends on what portfolios each network happens to have and how they perform at any given point in time. But there were big terrific banks with a lot of innovative people on your team. We love working with them. and so it\u2019s a good thing for us and I\u2019m sure that next, I would say it\u2019s a good thing for them as well.","Vasant Prabhu","Yes. Expense growth was a couple of points higher than we might have expected. Some of it is exchange rate. So, as you saw, the exchange rates were somewhat better than \u2013 the exchange rate impact was somewhat better than we expected on revenues, which means on the expense side were somewhat worse, I think that was about a point. And as we \u2013 as I indicated in my comments, there were a few other non-recurring types of things that added another point. So, in general, they want any real surprises, they will pull forward of investments that it was just a couple of these kinds of items.","Mike Milotich","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Trevor Williams from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Trevor Williams","Hi, good afternoon, and appreciate you taking the question. This is a little bit higher level, but I\u2019m curious internationally with a couple of government-backed systems like Mir in Russia and Troy in Turkey that mandate domestic processing. I guess first just, how you see your role in the economics you can earn in both of those markets over the longer term. And then second, more broadly, if you\u2019re comparing today\u2019s backdrop to, I don\u2019t know, five or 10 years ago, just what kind of threat you guys think nationalist\u2019s payments agendas could pose to the international business going forward? Thanks.","Al Kelly","Trevor, some of these domestic \u2013 our processing platforms with domestic teams are not terribly new. Our objective is to work closely with both regulators to make sure it\u2019s an even playing field and then work closely with our clients to make sure that we get a fair share of business. Many times our processing network of VisaNet actually just playing a simple has a lot more richness to its various offerings. And people we\u2019ve had cases, where banks see that and preferred to process with us, because of the investment, the level of security, level of innovation. So, we\u2019ll continue to be up against this kind of \u2013 this backdrop, but I think, it\u2019s still allowing us to grow at healthy levels and we\u2019re trying to partner in a thoughtful way as much as we can.","Your question about the backdrop on nationalism today versus and years ago, I think you\u2019d have to say, it has become a little bit more pronounced simply, because it wasn\u2019t that nearly as prominent, a decade or so ago. But again, I think our job is to continue to innovate more closely with regulators and with our clients to have as much of an even playing field as possible and continue to show that processing on Visa or minimally partnering with Visa as your team has good advantages to it that people want to work with us.","Mike Milotich","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Harshita Rawat","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Al, if I look at a long-term history of your growth versus your largest competitor, it\u2019s been quite stable more recently though the last one or two years, you\u2019ve seen some Delta open up between your metrics and your peers. So, can you talk about some of the drivers of this and more importantly, if you look out next few years, can we expect the gap to narrow, because of what you\u2019re doing with fintechs internationally in order to strengthen Visa direct?","Al Kelly","Thank you, Harshita. Look, both companies that perform extremely well on a number of dimensions, look at the most recent quarter, we\u2019re very pleased with our results. And look, Mastercard had a great quarter and they\u2019ve had some good quarters, the last couple of years as have we. That said a few points, first of all, volume metrics are \u2013 don\u2019t have any standards attached to them and it\u2019s really difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison between the two companies and really understand what\u2019s going on fully in terms of the volume.","On the revenue side, revenue Deltas have been a bit smaller in a number of the recent quarters is huge mix differences in our business. We\u2019ve had a very big position in the United States and we want to trade that for the world. It\u2019s just playing simple and much more mature market that doesn\u2019t have the same high double-digit, mid double-digit, even over 20% kind of growth prospects to it. But we\u2019re certainly pleased to have the partnerships with the banks that we have in the position that we have in the United States.","The last one I\u2019d make is I \u2013 my expectation is based on the investments that we\u2019re making in value-added services, in new payment flows, in working with fintechs, working with neobanks, working on engagement with our existing customers, building out our effective footprint that I\u2019m quite confident that overtime, we\u2019ll close that gap and continue to perform very well for our investors.","Mike Milotich","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good afternoon guys. A question on Visa Direct, you mentioned the greater than 700 million transactions in 1Q. You\u2019ve highlighted previously the Visa Direct was growing in the triple digit. So, I guess question one is it still growing that rate and then also how are the yields tracking in Visa Direct? I mean, is it sort of comparable to debit? I know there\u2019s a lot of cross-border in there too. And last one, Al, related to Visa Direct, I promise that you mentioned a few new partnerships as you complete the Earthport integration. What are some of the major use cases for Visa Direct you\u2019re seeing rolling in as we move through 2020? Thank you.","Al Kelly","So, first of all, Lisa, our growth of Visa Direct remains incredible. It didn\u2019t quite get the triple-digit growth this quarter, but it was a very, very high single-digit, double-digit and close to that level. In terms of yields, we really haven\u2019t talked much about it. but to your point, this addressing is going to increasingly have some more cross-border transactions that will run over that, that platform and that our push platform. and that is obviously a very \u2013 a very good thing for us. I think when we talk about use cases, I think they\u2019re going to fall into some of the same topics they fall into today P2P disbursements, remittances and I think that those businesses will continue to grow. And you\u2019ll see on Investor Day that we\u2019ll highlight a good number of Visa Direct use cases with quite a few specific examples. So, we look forward to taking you through on 11th.","Mike Milotich","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from David Togut from Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","David Togut","Thank you. Good afternoon. Given the ongoing weakness you\u2019re seeing in UK volumes and the incremental one point deceleration you called out, could you update us out on your growth pivot moving employees out of London and into some of the higher growth markets of Italy, Poland and Germany, and when might this growth pivot accelerate your volume growth in Europe?","Al Kelly","So, David, we don\u2019t have any active plans to kind of move people out of the UK. We\u2019re just playing simple as we grow the business, adding employees on the continent and certainly, adding the vast majority of employees, where we would add in that region or in market offices on the continent. First, I\u2019d also comment that I\u2019m certainly hopeful now that at least there is some clarity around the Brexit outcome that we might find a new normal in the UK that would allow their economy to pick up. Certainly, I was in Davos last week and certainly, the officials in the UK that I talked to feel as if it\u2019s on the verge of starting to come back. We\u2019ll see what happens.","in terms of the continent, in many of these markets, we\u2019ve been behind playing simple. And over the last four or five quarters, we\u2019ve been \u2013 after we got the integration behind as we started in investing in fairly significant ways and we\u2019re winning deals and trying to build our credit business, build our acceptance footprint. And so it takes a little bit of time for the pipeline to work its way into the numbers. But I think over the next couple of years, we\u2019ll start to see some real payback for the progress that we\u2019re making now on the continent of Europe.","Mike Milotich","Next question please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. I appreciate your commentary on the coronavirus, but I was wondering if you could dimensionalize the cross-border China business and maybe, any impact it may have and sort of how you could address it? And then secondly, on the three to four unplanned renewals, is there any context as to why it\u2019s happening that banks are choosing to renew early? Thanks.","Al Kelly","So, on coronavirus, it\u2019s \u2013 let me start, it\u2019s certainly just too early to know. When we look at our numbers, we see some declines. But Chinese New Year this year was earlier this week, January 25, and last year in 2019, it was February 5 and spending slows around the holiday. So, we\u2019re given that we\u2019re about 12 days earlier this year, it\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s really impacting the volumes at this stage. As said, that\u2019s definitely going to be impacted. I mean, when planes are being halted both in and out of China, and you\u2019re probably reading as we are that companies were telling their employees to stay home. So, even for the e-commerce world, employees are staying home, who\u2019s picking and \u2013 who\u2019s picking goods and shipping them. So, I think for sure, there\u2019ll be some impacts and \u2013 but we\u2019ll have to see how pronounced it gets and how long it goes. I\u2019m not into predicting game for that at the moment.","In terms of the early renewals, what tends to happen is probably about half the time, it\u2019s us and half the time, it\u2019s the client, who says as we\u2019re talking to them about deepening our relationship and we\u2019re talking about to them about all the dynamics that are going on in payments and\/or we\u2019re talking to them about building a deeper relationship by them consuming more and more of Visa\u2019s capabilities and solutions. If a deal is going to be up in a year or a year and a half or two years \u2013 excuse me, that\u2019s no longer than that. But if the deals are going to come up and say you haven\u2019t had the two years or less, one of the two of us also the client will say, why don\u2019t we just get our deal done and extend it out a number of years, so that we can focus on all of these capabilities and we can work together on trying to grow the business versus starting down a path, where we\u2019re starting to consume \u2013 the client is starting to consume more Visa products. And then we have to halt everything while our teams on both sides go into negotiation mode and it just goes down the wheels of progress.","And I think what\u2019s happening, because payments is just more complex than it was four or five years ago, and the number of offerings is greater than it was, even two or three years ago. I think that this is what\u2019s kind of driving this, I don\u2019t want to call it a phenomenon, but driving this occurrence. and this year, as Vasant said in his remarks, there are four decent-sized financial institution that were not scheduled to be up this year. They were not built into our numbers or incentive. One of them is already done, I referred to it in my remarks, which we saw then they on the deals that we did with them in South America. So there's three others where there's live discussion going on right now and it's too early to tell whether a deal definitely gets done or not, but my expectation is that more likely than that, at least a couple of them that were not planned will get done.","Mike Milotich","Next question, please?","Operator","Next question comes from James Faucette from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","James Faucette","Thank you very much. I wanted to ask about the acquisitions that you've been doing, and perhaps the changing reporting, what that may indicate. In the past, Visa has done a lot of investments in companies and fintech, et cetera, even before fintech was coined as a term, but it seems like you've picked up, at least in the last year the pace of acquisition. Is this part of \u2013 should we expect more acquisitions and you'd be more active in actually acquiring companies that then you have been the past? Or is this maybe a little bit anomalous? Just wondering how you're thinking about incorporating some of the development that's happening outside Visa into Visa proper?","Vasant Prabhu","Well, I think I will add some more things. We'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but just a quick response to that question. I don't think we are deliberately stepping up the level of acquisition activity or investment activity in some kind of change of direction. Our approach has always been, we build any core capability and if it is faster or cheaper or the talent that we can get from the outside that would be valuable. Then you would consider acquisitions and there's a logic to every one of those we did. On the investment side, typically, when it's complementary capabilities, we prefer to partner and we do lots and lots of partnerships, as you know. Business has built on partnerships. Occasionally, we get into a situation where a company may like us to invest or we want to invest because we do want to enhance our relationship, get closer, have a better commercial agreement, get some exclusivity and so on.","The reason the volume has gone up to some degrees because as you know, there's a lot of activity nowadays in terms of companies with business models and capabilities that are very valuable to us, either as capabilities for us to own or capabilities to partner with. So it reflects what's going on in the marketplace too. And it will \u2013 the pace of activity will depend on exactly applying the criteria I just mentioned. It could go up if we find more than meets our criteria or it could go down.","Mike Milotich","Next question, please?","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Perlin","Thanks. Al, you went through a pretty exhaustive list of breaking down core versus new flows and then reduced friction has kind of three big tenets of growth. Where I'm trying to, I guess parsed out, how do you break those down? I mean, it's core like 80% of the growth as we think about the next couple of years. Then layering in these other two to three assets? Or how should we kind of parse out that as we kind of think through all of these opportunities for you? Thanks.","Al Kelly","Well, yes, Dan, on Investor Day, we'll talk a lot about all three of these. To be very honest, we don't have a debt mix that we're trying to get to across the three items that you cited. We're trying to make sure that we do as well as we possibly can against all three, to try to make sure that we're delivering a sustained good level of revenue growth. And some of it will depend on what's happening at a particular point in time and economies and where we end up choosing to put investment dollars. So there's a lot of factors that go into it. But we're not setting out to hit some certain mix. We're setting out to do a really good job in our core business. We're doing to try to extend the business through new payment flows and value-added services. And with the acquisition of Plaid extend of business and our network and network business even further. So that's really what our objective is. Dan.","Mike Milotich","And one last question Jordan.","Operator","Our last question comes from Dave Koning from Baird. Your line is now open.","Dave Koning","Hey guys, thank you. When we look at cross-border, the reported volume growth all through last year was pretty slow and I know that has to do with just currency, right? But the revenue growth was way, way above volume growth. This quarter volume growth has gotten better, but the disconnect, I guess between volume and revenue has gotten smaller. Like that gap between volume and reported revenue growth has gotten smaller. Why is that? And should it be closer? Should it stay closer like that throughout this year?","Vasant Prabhu","Yes, the delta between volume growth and revenue growth are driven by a variety of factors. The most important of currency related, right? Most of the time the delta is driven by currency impacts. Clearly pricing plays a role. So there was some pricing in there that was causing the revenue growth to be faster than volume growth. Currency effects can then move in one direction or the other. And then when volatility is moving in a big way and this quarter, we had a very big move. If you're looking at volatilities, we are at five years lows now, not seen since 2014. Historically, those have corrected over time, so that we think is a transient thing. But when volatility has declined, the revenues related to those volatilities are also in that line. And this quarter those had a big impact. If volatilities were the same year-over-year, our revenue growth would have been fairly comparable to last quarter on the international fee line.","Al Kelly","Thanks, Jordan.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, May. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa, Inc.'s fiscal first quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website as well.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the IR section of Visa's website. For historical non-GAAP pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Al.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Jack, thank you, and good afternoon or good evening to everyone. And thank you for joining us today. Let me start by saying how excited I am to be with all of you. I just completed my first quarter at Visa, and past my two-month mark as the Chief Executive Officer. I think, as many of you know, I've been a board member since early 2014, so I've been involved in the business and was a party in approving the company's strategy and priorities. I also understand the majority of the opportunities and challenges around the world. My objective from day one has been to make this CEO transition at Visa seamless for our clients, our partners, our employees, and our shareholders.","I have no big plans to change our strategy in the short-term, but as a key player in a dynamic payments ecosystem, we certainly have to be prepared as necessary to adapt to our thinking as facts and circumstances change. Over the last couple of months, I've spent the majority of my time traveling to meet our valued clients, regulatory personnel and talented employees. During this time, I met with or talked to over 50 clients. I've also visited with regulators or government officials in nine countries and visited 12 of our global offices. I have to say it's been exhilarating and enjoyable. It has also reinforced my belief in our great global brand and the first-class group of clients that we have globally.","Let me begin by sharing a few early observations since I joined the Visa team. Then I'll highlight the business momentum we saw in the quarter and close with some thoughts around our strategic pillars as we move forward. First, I would say, we have a fantastic leadership team. I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with them and working with them on a day in and day out basis. I will also tell you that we have a talented group of employees after visiting with a number of them in our offices around the globe. We need to continue to foster a healthy culture that tracks, retains and develops the best talent to maintain this high level of company performance.","Second, we certainly have strong relationships with our issuer clients, our acquirer clients and the merchant community of clients, and we're constantly looking for ways to build upon those. It's been very valuable for me to hear their perspectives on Visa and how we can be a better partner in addressing their business needs going forward. We need to identify areas where we can remove friction from the process, and enabling digital payments as we pursue partnerships. At the same time, we recognize that this industry is very competitive, and the regulatory environment continues to evolve in many markets around the world.","Third, we're in a growth industry, and there's a huge opportunity in front of us. The global opportunity to digitize cash and check is enormous. We have a vibrant core business in developed regions with even more growth opportunities in the international and emerging markets with low penetration rates. Governments and emerging middle classes are leading the way to digitize more payments in developing countries, while e-commerce is displacing cash and check in developed countries. Through our focus on technological innovation and partnership development, Visa is well positioned for sustained growth going forward.","As a market leader in payments technology, we're enabling new forms of digital commerce and supporting the new businesses in mobile payments, the Internet of Things, data security, and the sharing economy. Our global network connects over 16,000 financial institutions to over 44 million merchants, with strong commercial partnerships built over many years, and a brand that's recognized by consumers for acceptance, security and convenience. I'm gratified to see that the business strength and fundamentals that I knew as a board member continue to be realized in our financial results.","With that, let me highlight some of these now. So in the fiscal quarter just ended, we saw a healthy overall growth in terms of payment volume, cross-border commerce, transactions, revenue and earnings leverage as the business performed better than our internal expectations. We grew net revenue by 25% and adjusted EPS by 23% versus prior year's adjusted results. Transaction growth, strong cross-border activity, higher currency volatility, and client incentive delays all contributed to our revenue outperformance.","This is the second full quarter with Visa Europe in the results, which makes it a little more complicated, but Vasant will take time later to cover the financial results in greater detail. Our operational metrics are improving, and we're on track to meet our financial goals. In terms of co-brand partnerships, issuer renewals and other competitive deals, they are a normal course of business, and as usual, we've had very good success in the last quarter. We have a lot of momentum in the business and have exciting days ahead of us.","We're executing on our 2017 operating plan, and are pleased with the progress to date. When I look out longer term, we remain committed to our strategy in the six guiding pillars, three of which I look at as foundational, and three of which are keys to growth. The foundational elements of our strategy are first and foremost to retain and attract the best people. In my mind, and based on my experience, success starts there. Winning teams and organizations have the best people, so we need to build upon the solid foundation and high performing culture we have here at Visa.","We continue to strive to be an employer of choice where we can constantly attract the best talent, develop our people, and recognize their achievements as we are clearly doing excellent and wonderful things here. Second is transforming technology. We want to constantly be on the leading edge and push the pace of innovation. As part of extending our network and enabling easier access, we're pushing toward open access software for our clients and partners. We're providing an open platform for developers to access our APIs to quickly launch new products and experiences.","We're adding technical resources in many locations around the world, and also building a European innovation center in the UK that will open at the end of this month. The third foundational element is championing security. It is an imperative that there is a high level of trust in the payments ecosystem, and we are committed to be an industry leader when it comes to security. One way we're doing that is through tokenization. We continue to make excellent progress with Visa Token Service, which is now live in 27 countries, and more than 1,300 financial institution partners are participating globally. We've enabled launches of many financial institutions' wallets, as well as the various pays in several additional countries in this past quarter.","Now, let me turn to the three growth elements of the strategy, the first being expanding access to our network and services globally. Expanding and providing access to our network drives value for our clients and partners, consumers, merchants and governments. Around the world, we're developing supporting new products and methods of acceptance, while recognizing local market conditions. Through these efforts, we have provided payment accounts to countless numbers of people who previously didn't have access to the formal financial system.","Second, growth element of our strategy is deepening partnerships. Partnerships are critical in the payments world, and we strive to be the best possible partner we can be to enable growth opportunities for all parties in the ecosystem. We need to continue to build close relationships with our issuing partners. Likewise, it is very important that we work hard and demonstrate a commitment to our acquirers and the merchant community in each market, and find ways to deliver additional value there. Being a trusted partner is a key to our business success. So we always want to look to strengthen these relationships, and we will continue to do just that.","And the third element is digital expansion. E-commerce enabled by mobile and other form factors is a significant opportunity, and we are definitely investing behind it. As payments move from the physical to digital world, we're leading the way in developing solutions for our clients, our partners and consumers. One great example of this is Visa Checkout. We now have over 18 million consumer accounts in 23 countries, and over 1,500 financial institutional partners participating around the world. More than 300,000 online merchants have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $173 billion in addressable volume.","Another key area for Visa is the acceleration of international markets. The integration of Visa Europe is tracking well. It's still in the early innings, but we're encouraged by the progress and see meaningful growth opportunities. During the quarter, we continued our focus on local market priorities alongside client engagement. The vast majority of our payments volume in Europe remains under contract. The European market continues to represent a large opportunity to displace cash, and we are accelerating digital innovation in Europe by continuing to rollout our token service in several markets as well as supporting many digital wallets.","A number of people have asked about the China market opportunity. Visa remains committed to China for the long-term, and we want to deepen our partnerships with our clients and partners to advance economic growth. We look forward to the opportunity to formally submit our license application, however we're still awaiting additional clarifications from the government before we can apply. It's our intent to move very quickly to set up our processing infrastructure once we have greater clarity from the PBOC around the timelines for their decision in granting licenses. The move to a more cashless economy in India also represents a large opportunity.","Concurrent with other measures, the new government has implemented measures to incent merchants and consumers to move to digital payments. These new measures include capped POS terminal charges, no POS import tax and duties, and in the last quarter we've seen nearly 75% increase in payments volume in India, and more than twice the number of processed transactions. We're working with a number of key stakeholders to sustain the momentum to drive digital payments in the Indian economy.","Examples include working with issuers to raise awareness and drive debit activation. We're also working with acquirers and merchants on digital acceptance solutions like mVisa to rapidly expand acceptance, and with key government bodies to facilitate longer term ecosystem growth. It is early days, but we're excited about the opportunity to expand electronic payments to consumers. Let me now share some thoughts on managing our capital and delivering shareholder value. Our number one priority with capital is to identify and find ways to grow our business. This can come organically or through acquisitions.","One example of the latter is the acquisition of CardinalCommerce which closed yesterday. This acquisition helps our clients and merchant partners to accelerate digital payments in commerce by improving online payment security. It builds on our strength in the sector, and augments issuer services and our CyberSource capabilities. In this dynamic payments ecosystem, we need to invest to drive future growth and maintain our market-leading position. Second, we will continue to deliver value by returning excess cash to our shareholders. In this last fiscal quarter, we returned nearly $2.2 billion, consisting of $1.8 billion through share repurchases and nearly $400 million through dividends.","As we've stated before, we have accelerated our share repurchases to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe acquisition. We will continue to be prudent as we think about ways of managing and allocating our capital. Lastly, we plan to maintain a healthy dialogue and good relationships with our investor community. I hope to meet and spend time with many of you as we move through the year. And to that end, we are in the planning stages to hold an Investor Day in June, so we will come back to you shortly once the dates and locations are confirmed. So as we begin this New Year, I'm excited about the many opportunities ahead. We're off to a really good start in our fiscal first quarter. I feel great about the future of Visa.","And with that, let me turn it over to Vasant to cover some of the financial details.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Thank you, Al. Fiscal 2017 is off to a strong start. First quarter revenue and EPS exceeded our expectations driven by accelerating fundamentals, which more than offset the drag from exchange rate shifts. On a GAAP basis, fiscal first quarter net revenues were up 25%, and EPS up 7%. Net income for the first quarter was $2.1 billion, and EPS $0.86 per diluted share. Adjusting for the $255 million non-cash gain in last year's first quarter from the write-off of the Visa Europe put liability, EPS was up 23%. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted both net revenue and EPS growth by approximately 3 percentage points.","There were four key drivers of our Q1 outperformance; first, constant dollar payment volume growth stepped up between 1 to 2 percentage points in most geographies; second, normalized for the impact of Visa Europe, the cross-border recovery accelerated by 2 percentage points globally from 10% to 12%, once again the acceleration was broad-based; third, normalized for the impact of Visa Europe, process transaction growth picked up by 1 point from 12% to 13%, driven significantly by India as well as the U.S.; fourth, timing of client incentives and delays in expenses added almost $0.03 to our Q1 results. Strong business fundamentals more than offset the negative impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar and a weakening euro. The balance between strong business fundamentals and unfavorable exchange rate shifts will drive our results as we look ahead to the rest of fiscal year 2017.","A couple of other points to note before I get into the details of our Q1 results and our outlook for the year. We did not issue $2 billion in debt as we had planned. We did issue $567 million in commercial paper to fund our stock buyback and operating cash needs. We have over $8 billion of offshore cash, which could be repatriated if it can be done tax efficiently. We will wait to see what the new administration's plans for permitting cash repatriation are before we issue a longer-term debt. In parallel, we continue to work on other strategies to bring cash back to the U.S. Until there's clarity on this front, we plan to issue commercial paper or short-term debt to fund our buyback and other onshore cash needs. We bought back 22.3 million shares of class A common stock at an average price of $79.77 for $1.8 billion in the first quarter. We have $3.9 billion remaining in our stock buyback authorization.","Moving now to a review of our key business drivers in the first quarter; U.S. payments volumes grew 12.4% in Q1 as credit grew 20.2% helped by Costco and USAA. U.S. debit grew 4.6% helped by USAA debit conversion, but hurt by Interlink volumes. Interlink volumes were down due to lapping a significant win in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, as well as PIN debit routing choices by acquirers and merchants. Excluding Interlink volumes, the U.S. debit growth rate stepped up by 3 points due to USAA and rising gas prices. Gas prices added approximately 1 point to both credit and debit payment volume growth in the U.S.","As reported, Q1 international payment volumes grew 70.5% in constant dollars. The step-down in the growth rate from the last quarter is a result of the exclusion of co-badge volumes in Europe. As you know, effective June 9, 2016, Article 8 of the EU Interchange Fee Regulation states that payment networks cannot impose reporting requirement or the obligation to pay fees on payment transactions where their payment brand is present, but their network is not used. Prior to this regulation, Visa collected a small service fee in a few countries, particularly France, on domestic payment transactions where Visa cards are co-badged with a domestic network.","Clients in Europe continue to report co-badge volume through the quarter ended September 2016. However, effective the December 2016 quarter, Visa co-badge volumes in Europe are no longer included in our reported payment volumes. Item 2 in our Operational Performance Data package will help you adjust for this change. As you can see, excluding co-badge volume, European payment volume growth stepped up from 7% last quarter to 9%. There was strength across Europe and especially in the UK. Payment volume growth rate in Asia was up 1.6 percentage points driven by India, Japan and Australia.","Our CEMEA region growth rate was higher by over 3 points helped by the Middle East and some improvement in Africa. The only region with a slowdown in growth was Latin America, pulled down by continuing weakness in Brazil. Adding in Europe to last year's payment volumes and adjusting for co-badge volumes, in other words on a comparable and normalized basis, constant dollar global payment volume growth accelerated by 1.5 percentage points in Q1 versus the last quarter. On a reported basis, cross-border volumes grew 140% driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis, constant dollar cross-border growth globally was 12%, up 2 points from the last quarter.","This information is provided in Item 3 of our Operational Performance Data package. U.S. cross-border growth in constant dollars hit double-digits for the first time since the first quarter of 2014. The strong dollar drove robust outbound commerce from the U.S., especially into Mexico, Canada and the UK. Our large U.S. acquired business was stable, benefiting from commerce in from Canada and parts of Latin America. The weak pound is driving significant inbound commerce into the UK from all parts of the globe. Euro zone cross-border growth rates remained healthy helped by a weakening euro. Cross-border commerce was strong across most of Asia, especially outbound from Australia and Southeast Asia.","Other high growth corridors were outbound commerce from Russia and Eastern Europe. Overall, the cross-border business was an important contributor to our Q1 outperformance. On a reported basis, global process transactions grew 44%, driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe. On a comparable and normalized basis, global process transactions grew 13%, up 1 point from the last quarter. U.S. process transactions grew 11% due to Costco and USAA. Demonetization in India drove the increase in international process transaction growth. European process transactions were stable. Through January 28, U.S. payment volumes are up almost 13% in constant dollars. Normalized for Visa Europe, constant dollar cross-border volumes grew 13% and process transaction growth was 14%.","As you can see, first quarter growth trends remain intact so far in Q2. A quick review of Q1 financial results. Service revenues grew 17%. Service revenue growth was helped by the announced price increase on U.S. acquired debit card service fees, offset by negative currency translation impact. Service revenue growth is lower than payment volume growth we reported in the September quarter, reflecting the fact that service revenue yields are substantially lower in Europe than in the legacy Visa business. Data processing revenues grew 28%. Once again, transaction revenue growth is lower than process transaction growth reflecting the lower yield on European process transaction relative to the legacy Visa business.","India demonetization doubled transaction volumes, but did not contribute much to revenues in Q1. As you may be aware, in response to a request from the Indian Government, Visa voluntarily charged no fees for processing through December 31, 2016. International revenues grew 44%. This is up from the September quarter growth rate driven by cross-border volume acceleration, higher than average currency volatility, offset by an unfavorable exchange rate impact. Other revenues grew 2%. Other revenues no longer include Visa Europe license fees.","Client incentives came in well below our guidance range of 20.5% to 21.5%. This is all due to timing of deals being done in the U.S., Asia and Europe. Many of these renewals will be executed in the second quarter, shifting these client incentive payments from the first quarter into the second quarter. Lower client incentives due to delayed deals added approximately $0.02 to our EPS in Q1. Expenses grew 16% due to the inclusion of Visa Europe. There were some shifts in marketing and technology spending to upcoming quarters.","In addition, as Europe completed the consultation process, new hiring, growth projects and integration activities were modestly delayed. Delayed expenses added $0.01 to the first quarter EPS. These expenses will be incurred through the balance of the year. Our tax rate was 30.5%, driving EPS of $0.86, up 23% on an adjusted basis. As we look ahead, two significant countervailing trends will drive our results; strong business momentum, especially cross-border growth is a tailwind; the strengthening of the dollar and the weakening of the Euro are headwinds. The cross-border recovery is broad-based and accelerated in the first quarter. We hope this will be sustained. This is a higher yielding revenue stream which improves our revenue mix.","Continued strength of the dollar is a risk to monitor. Treasury volatility staying above long-term averages as it did in the first quarter will also help. The broad acceleration in payment volumes globally is another reason for optimism. The counter trend is exchange rates. Based on spot rates and the forward curve, the dollar has strengthened around 4% versus our major currencies since September. The stronger dollar is a stiffer headwind than we expected. Our hedging program will offset some of the negative impact. The euro has weakened almost 5% versus the dollar since September. Since we did not own Visa Europe until late June, we are not hedged on our euro exposure.","In addition, the euro is now a functional currency for us, and we can only do economic hedges which could add volatility rather than dampen it. As such, we may choose to stay unhedged on our euro exposure. The weakening of the euro will hurt Europe results as reported in dollars more than we expected last September. This countertrend of favorable business fundamentals and unfavorable exchange rate shifts drive our fiscal year 2017 outlook.","For the second quarter, we are assuming payment volume momentum will be sustained. The strong dollar could cause some moderation in cross-border growth. Client incentive spend will step up with the deals that are shifting into the second quarter from the first quarter. We expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be well within our guidance range of 20.5% to 21.5%. Expense growth rates are expected to be higher than the first quarter as we ramp up spending in Europe, and delayed initiatives in technology and marketing move into the second quarter.","For the full year of fiscal year 2017, we are reaffirming the ranges we previously provided for nominal revenue and EPS growth. We expect that stronger business fundamentals will offset stiffer currency headwinds. We have increased the likely currency translation drag on our reported revenue and EPS growth rates by 1 point versus prior estimates. While client incentives were lower than expected in the first quarter, we expect client incentives as a percent of gross revenues to be very much in the 20.5% to 21.5% range for the year. Other elements of our outlook for the year, operating margins and tax rates, remain unchanged. We continue to work on tax and repatriation strategies related to the Visa Europe acquisition as we've told you before.","If and when we are able to execute a tax re-organization, we will let you know what its impact will be on future tax rates and cash debt management plans. Visa Europe revenue and operating income are tracking well despite the negative impact of the weaker euro. Integration plans are modestly behind schedule due to a longer consultation process. With the employee consultation process now complete, the re-organization is being executed. Technology integration planning is on track. Discussions continue with clients to ensure that our pricing stays competitive post the elimination of rebates, as well as to extend existing contracts.","Even as this process is underway, it is important to note that the vast majority of our volume in Europe remains under contract. In summary, fiscal year 2017 is off to a good start. Strong business fundamentals are helping overcome unfavorable exchange rates. We hope this trend will continue through the year.","With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, Vasant. At this time, May, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. First question is from Bob Napoli. Your line is now open.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you very much. Al, congratulations on a very nice quarter. You really have accelerated momentum since you've become CEO. So congratulations on that.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Team effort, but thank you, Bob.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","The question is on client incentives. Just the change in client incentives from last year to this year, what percentage of that is from the integration \u2013 from the Visa Europe acquisition versus other items like Costco or just general business conditions? And do you expect, as we look to fiscal 2018-2019, to see that percentage continue to increase?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yeah, as we said on our call last quarter, we said that it was roughly half due to Europe, and some of it is how the accounting works when you remove rebates and replace them with client incentives. And the rest was driven by Costco, USAA, and also renewals that we expect this year. So nothing has changed much on those fronts.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","As far as the longer-term outlook?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Sorry?","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Just the trend into 2018. Sorry.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Well, I think it's too early to talk about that. We'll certainly get into all that as we get to later in the year and talk about next year. But as you know, we're tracking below our range in the first quarter, so you should assume that it'll catch up in future quarters this year.","Robert Paul Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you very much.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, Bob.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We have from KBW, Sanjay Sakhrani. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. I was wondering if we could get more color on where you guys are with the pricing initiatives in Europe for the year.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","We're moving ahead with plans we had. And some of it, as we've told you before, we don't plan to announce them per se in calls like these. Certainly, in the market in Europe, people are aware of what we have done. As we said in our comments, we are engaged with all our issuers and acquirers in Europe on all these issues. There are ongoing discussions. We're happy with how things are going. And as far as that's concerned, we're very much on track in terms of everything we wanted to do.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","We have from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys. So just in light of the longer consultation period in Europe and a little bit of the delay in the integration, is 2% to 3% EPS accretion from Visa Europe still the right number?","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Yes, I think that's certainly what we're continuing to target, Jason.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","I'm sorry, we have George Mihalos. Your line is open, from Cowen.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Nice to see the encouraging trends pretty much across the globe. Just curious within the U.S. market, I know there's a number of deals that are still ramping up. But sort of on an apples-to-apples basis, are you seeing an acceleration on the part of your issuers in trying to push more credit products and maybe the volume you're seeing again on sort of a same store sales basis ex-Costco and USAA?","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","I would say that, given the continued amount of attention reward products are getting, we're certainly seeing that our issuers are very focused on the credit card segment for sure.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yeah, in general, credit growth rates when you normalize for all things that are, as you said, adds to our business, the underlying growth trend is higher in credit than debit, and is roughly stable quarter-over-quarter.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please, May.","Operator","Next question is from Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Yes. Hi. Thanks. I was hoping with all the noise in the numbers, you could help us see through to some level of organic growth for the European franchise. Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","We've tried to do our best to give you the business drivers. So if you go to our Operational Performance package, what you'll see is that European payment volumes grew 2 points faster than they did last quarter. So it was 7% growth last quarter, 9% this quarter, and that is Item 2 in the Operational Performance Data. So you can see that. And then in the commentary, we talked about cross-border being quite strong in Europe. We're seeing a huge amount of inbound commerce into the UK, certainly helped by the pound. Generally speaking, cross-border across Europe is quite strong, helped by the weakening euro. Europe is definitely a beneficiary of a lot of inbound commerce. And then in terms of transactions, I think you heard us say in our comments that transaction growth rates in Europe was stable. We're moving very well in terms of all the other actions we want to take in Europe as it relates to costs and so on. So all-in-all, as Al said earlier, we feel very good about both Europe's financial performance and also the accretion that we anticipated this year. We are on track to do as well as or better than we had assumed we would his year.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Thank you.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, Craig. Next question.","Operator","Next is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Just a little bit of a follow up on that and then on the incentive side again. First, can you help us understand, I mean, is there a way that you can just kind of tell us what the pro forma revenue growth rate would have been had you owned Visa Europe this time last year? And then part of your guidance obviously seems predicated on, as you said Vasant, incentives being notably higher than the run rate in both fourth quarter and now the first quarter was the same as a percentage of growth. I guess just, I mean, you had USAA and Costco both in there. I know a lot of the European banks were done already. I guess, just why would it increase at that level? Thanks again, guys.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Darrin, I'll start with it, there were a couple of deals that we thought would close in the first quarter that have just drifted into the second quarter, and a couple of them are big deals outside of the United States. And so we have a pretty good insight to what the second quarter is going to look like based on the fact that these deals are either have closed or were at the very last level of red lining the deal. So we have pretty good insight. So I think the guidance that you heard from Vasant is good guidance. In terms of the first part of your question, we're not in a position to start getting into a lot of the detail on Visa Europe individually. I think we're very excited to have moved to kind of a one Visa concept that as quickly as we possibly can. We're going to be happy to be able to talk about it on a total global company basis.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yeah. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to sort of divide up the report, the financial reports into, this is Visa Europe's performance separately. We try to help you as much as we could in the business drivers to give you a feel for how Europe is performing and how the business is actually performing on an organic basis if you adjust for Europe. And then I think the other question you asked was, why would we expect incentives to be higher this year than the fourth quarter of last year. It's a variety of reasons, some of which we walked through on the call last time. Someway it has to do with how the accounting for the rebates worked post the acquisition of Visa Europe. It's Visa Europe coming into our numbers. It's Costco and USAA being in there for the full year. And it's some of these renewals that we were anticipating this year that Al mentioned. So what we told you is what we still expect, and that's why we indicated that what you saw in the first quarter was a result of some delays, but the overall full-year expectation for client incentives does not change.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, May.","Operator","Next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thank you. I'll ask on the debit routing modification that caught a lot of news when it was announced in December. With you I guess taking up guidance here doesn't seem to be a big issue from a P&L standpoint. Just curious if you can maybe comment on how impactful that modification or clarification has been or could be to your P&L. Thanks.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Per the request of the FTC, we made the clarification. But I think that for the most part we were acting in the appropriate fashion. But we see very little impact of any meaningful level on the business whatsoever.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, May.","Operator","Next is from Dan Perlin, RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hey. So a quick question on India. You talked about significantly increasing transactions but not driving much revenue, and part of that was the function of the Indian Government asking you guys to kind of keep prices subdued for a little period of time. I'm wondering, as you think about the guidance that you just gave us, are you assuming more normalized pricing in that horizon, and if not, when would you expect that to somewhat normalize in your opinion? Thanks.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","I think we're assuming some pricing in that model. I don't think we're \u2013 I would say, we're being fairly conservative in what we expect to be able to gain in terms of revenue. This is, I think for us very importantly, and strategically this is a build opportunity that the government really has put out there in front of us. And so in my mind, at this point I'm much more focused on capitalizing on this opportunity and investing heavily behind driving both awareness for consumers and incentive for merchants to get signed up. There's only a very fractional amount of the merchant community in India that is enabled today to be able to accept electronic or digitized payments, and we want to try to get that number up as much as we possibly can. So I think when you consider the economics of the investments we'll make in India, plus a fairly conservative pricing, it's certainly not going to be a market in this fiscal year that's going to drive a lot of profit for us. But I think, it's a great year for us to make sure that we do everything we can in one of the two largest population countries in the world to get as good a position as we can to help us over the next decade.","Daniel Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, Dan. Next question, please.","Operator","We have one from Ken Bruce from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Kenneth Matthew Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good afternoon. My question also relates to Europe. I'm hoping you might be able or willing to compare and contrast the go-to-market strategy with the issuers, and what you're doing or what you plan to do in Europe differs from the U.S. You kind of pointed out that you've got a very incentive driven market here in the U.S. and you're able \u2013 and you've been very successful in terms of using the interchange framework here to drive a lot of issuer wins. Can you maybe just help us understand how you're attacking Europe differently?","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","So I think, Ken, Europe is almost a number of different segments in and of itself. I mean, the Europe for us right now is hugely dominated by the UK where we have most of the debit market taken up. Then there's four or five other markets across the EU where we have a reasonable amount of business. And then there's a number of big economies, certainly Germany being one example, where it's still a heavy cash society, where I think we've got a lot of opportunity in the medium to longer term to see more of commerce digitized or in some form of electronic form. Europe is also different than the United States in terms of processing, where there are in certain markets domestic processing schemes. And we've got a strategy to try to win more processing volume in Europe as well.","So we're engaging, I would say, hopefully, what I believe to be a thoughtful segmented approach with different issuers and different acquirers on a country-by-country basis because each of these countries is different, and having spent most of my life as an issuer on the issuing side of the business, I know full well that the issuing business is really a local consumer business, and you've got to figure out the right strategy on a market-by-market basis. So we're not going to have kind of a pan-European strategy. It's really going to be a market-by-market strategy within Europe.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Next question is from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is open.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon. Al, I just wanted to ask you if you wouldn't mind commenting on two areas that you did not explicitly mentioned in the strategy that you laid out; one is Visa's expansion into adjacent markets like remittance or potentially into B2B, and what your plans are there; and then, secondly, when you mentioned partnerships, you did not call out the big tech firms like Apple, PayPal, Alipay, et cetera. And so I'm just curious if you have a comment there. Thanks.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","On the latter, Lisa, I think I maybe shorthanded it, but I did say that we're working with all the pays, and so it's all of those pays. And we're in different stages of relationship with all of them. But obviously they're increasingly important people in the payments ecosystem as mobile devices become an important form factor in the digital world. So absolutely we're working with them. Look, I think there's a lot of vectors for growth for Visa, and the whole commercial space and disbursement of different kinds and business-to-business kinds of payments are very much on our radar screen. We have a group of people headed by a very senior person who's dedicated to this space now. We're not as strong a player as we'd like to be, but we are stacked up and spending a lot of time on this issue. And it's something that we do want to get a stronger position in the whole commercial and B2B space.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Next is from Moshe Katri, Wedbush Securities. Your line is now open.","Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Hey. Thanks for taking my question. One, can we get an update on the PayPal agreement in terms of where we are? And then in that context, going back to Visa Europe, have we seen any change in issuer attrition while you're renewing your book there? Thanks a lot.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Well, in terms of the latter question first, I think either in mine or Vasant's remarks, we talked about the fact that a lot of our issuer volume in Visa Europe is under contract. So we actually bought Visa Europe at a time where we've got a pretty good book of business that's going to be with us for a while. I mean, that said, as I said in my remarks, I'm very, very much a client-focused person, and we're going to work hard with every single one of our clients in Europe as well as around the world. But we do have a lot of good long-term relationships locked up. In terms of PayPal, I'd say that everything is progressing as planned. Our issuer clients who are very important to us, obviously, are engaged with PayPal, and they're working to migrate customers off of ACH back onto their cards. PayPal has been executing marketing campaigns and changes in their user experience to make it much easier for Visa card holders to pay with their Visa card, and to make it their default payment option.","Moshe Katri - Wedbush Securities, Inc.","Thanks.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Next question from Wasserstrom from Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. My question, Vasant, is just on the use of CP and short-term debt rather than the debt issuance that you had planned. What motivated that decision, particularly given that the rate environment presumably would be pretty good still for term debt?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Well, the fact is that we have offshore cash. And let's say we issue $2 billion of long-term debt, and we're able to repatriate somewhere in the region of $8 billion of offshore cash either because there's a change in the rules that allows it to happen tax efficiently, or because we are able to, as part of our \u2013 some thoughts and ideas we have on the re-organization in Europe, we're able to repatriate cash. We will have more cash than we need to keep for settlement guarantees and all that. And that excess cash is available. So that's the reason to wait a bit and see whether we want to use our own cash rather than lock in more long-term debt. I mean, this is something we monitor on a regular basis, and if there's any changes on that front, we'll certainly let you now.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, Eric. Next question, please.","Operator","Next question from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. I just want to ask in the U.S. debit market, you guys talked about some headwinds due to the PIN debit routing choices. Is that a shift from Interlink to other EFT networks, or are you guys seeing or think you're going to see a switch in the market towards more PIN versus Signature? And then just quickly, secondly on cross-border volume, what are you guys expecting exactly in the guidance, continue at these elevated levels or to fall back down?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","So on the first question, what we talked about was really that our Signature Debit business actually stepped up in growth rate by 3 points this quarter, and that's driven a lot by USAA. So really all we were referring to was switch away from our PIN debit volume, which would be Interlink volume. Some of it is because the Interlink volume declined this quarter as it did last quarter, some of which we told you was because we were lapping a significant win from the fourth quarter of 2015, and then some of it was because volume moved to other PIN debit networks. So it was all around volumes away from our PIN debit network, or hard comparisons for our PIN debit volumes versus prior years. So that was the answer on that one. What was the other question?","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Cross-border volumes.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Oh yes, cross-border volume, I think as I said in my comments, for the first 28 days of January, cross-border volume growth was certainly holding up. But the dollar has strengthened, so our go- forward assumptions assume that the cross-border growth rate is healthy but perhaps a little bit of a moderation in the rate of growth than what we saw in the first quarter. So we'll wait and see.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","From Jason Deleeuw, Piper Jaffray.","Jason S. Deleeuw - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks. I was hoping to get an update on Visa Checkout, what some of the current investments are right now on the consumer merchant side. And then what's the longer-term vision for Visa Checkout and how does that fit in with the partnerships with the other pays? Thank you.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Well, we think of Visa Checkout as a platform, and it's all part of us trying to make sure that we're a leader in terms of bringing potential solutions to the marketplace. We feel very good about the fact that we now are up to 18 million users signed up for Visa Checkout. It happens to also be a very active base of customers in terms of usage of Visa Checkout. We are facilitating more of our issuer clients to put their products side-by-side, embedded within Visa Checkout. And at this stage, the pays are out there obviously doing their thing as well, and we're going to continue to work with them. I think it's too early to tell how all of this is going to shake out. My personal view is that there are too many wallets out there. Consumers are not going to ultimately want to have 50 wallets, and we're not necessarily anxious to be in the wallet business per se, but we're anxious to take advantage of us being a trusted acceptance mark in the payments eco-space, and want to be able to make sure that we're taking a leading position in establishing Visa as a trusted mark, and as an important partner to our issuers in terms of them trying to establish as much volume as they can get in the digital space.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, May.","Operator","Next from Jim Schneider, Goldman Sachs.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe comment on the impact broadly that you expect from the Trump administration and other Congressional policies, both in terms of tax policy, regulatory impacts, or other impacts, and maybe talk about some of the largest positive or largest potentially negative things you can see in the future.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Jim, I think, it's too early to tell. I mean, we're barely two weeks into this presidency. And while the President has been active with executive orders, I think that as things start to settle down and we get into more specific policies and his cabinet is confirmed and in place and the legislature gets going, I think it remains to be seen what happens. I will tell you this, that we have a world-class group of government relations people who are already fully engaged as much as we can in the relevant conversations in Washington. But I think there's things that relate to trade, relate to taxes, all of which could play into our business. But I honestly just think it's too early to start to speculate. And we're certainly not building anything into our plans positively or negatively for that matter related to any policies that might come out. But I can assure you that we're watching it very closely.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, Jim. May, next question.","Operator","From James Faucette, Morgan Stanley.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Wanted to kind of follow up on that. You talked about having visited with a lot of customers as well as government officials, et cetera, around the world since you've taken on the CEO role. Can you talk and summarize a little bit what the particular regulators were asking from Visa, and kind of what their objectives are, and how Visa can help fulfill those? And I guess, kind of what's happened in India as it creates an interesting lens through which to view that. So maybe elaborate a little bit on some of those relations, et cetera. Thanks.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","So I've talked to regulators in both very developed markets as well as regulators in developing and emerging markets, and I think the content and tenor of the conversations is a bit different depending upon who you talk to. I mean, there are governments around the world who very much are seeking a close partnership with us. Their desire is learning how they can be helped in moving to a much more of a cashless society, how they can get many more of the people in their countries actually engaged in the financial system, how there could be greater financial literacy. And so in those particular cases, I would say that we're trying to take a very active role, and in some cases a very proactive role, in helping shape how the government thinks about what steps they ought to take. Including, by the way, in some cases working with governments to have them be a role model by making sure that they are moving away from paper in favor of a digitized world.","So for example, in Egypt, instead of vouchers being handed out, giving people prepaid cards so that they could in fact begin to start to have an experience with plastic. And what that does is it automatically starts setting up and incenting a whole merchant network to get built out as these people have to have a place to go, be able to spend their money that's on these prepaid cards, and merchants in this particular example who are involved in food and beverage, for instance, want to be able to get their fair share of that volume so they're very quickly incented to get to a point where they can accept plastic and be signed up as a merchant. In more developed countries, there are countries where the ship has sailed, and they've made decision on interchange as an example. Probably Australia and Europe being two real examples there where, I think, now it's just a matter of what does that mean and how does that play out for issuers and consumers in those markets.","I think, there are countries that I've talked to where there's pressure on both sides of, say, the finance ministers in countries where some of the merchant coalitions want to see lower interchange, but in markets, for example, where reward propositions are big on plastic, or on whatever form of payment vehicle it is, the consumer is going to get hurt in terms of those programs if interchange is lowered, because it's a two-sided market. The economics have to \u2013 there's only so much economics, and people will do what they'll have to do to make sure that they stay economically viable. So I think there's a number of markets where truthfully the government is trying to stay out of it and kind of let the free market system take over. And I think, in general, there's markets where the regulators are taking a very, very active role and in other cases I think a much more passive role. Again, often quite different depending on the specific country we're talking about.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, James. May, at this time we have time for one more question.","Operator","We have Tom McCrohan from CLSA.","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi. Thanks for squeezing me in.

Thank you.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yeah, we said it was $80 million this year. We'll wait and see how things go and give you any updates as we get towards the end of the year on future outlook. But at this point, really we wouldn't say anything different about the future.

Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky","Thanks Brad. Good afternoon. And welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal third quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","As always, this call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for the next 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This release can also be accessed through the Investor Relation section of our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.","Byron Pollitt","Thank you, Jack. Let me begin with my usual call outs and observations. First, some color on the third quarter\u2019s 17% net revenue growth. It is important to note that this growth rate benefited from the absence of significant one time client incentives incurred in the prior year. without these one time client incentives, revenue growth for Q3 would have been closer to 14%. That said, payment volume growth was broad based globally for the March quarter and we're seeing double-digit growth rates in the June quarter for both credit and debit on a constant dollar basis. Based on these trends, and with three quarters of the fiscal year now on the books, we are raising full year 2013 revenue guidance from to low double-digits to around 13%. ","Second, service revenue, though up 7% on year-over-year basis, it was down sequentially from the fiscal second quarter. This was primarily due to the signing of the 10 year Chase deal which was executed in fiscal Q3 but was retroactive to the beginning of Q2. This contract, as discussed on the Q2 earnings call, disproportionately impacted the service revenue line and resulted in offsetting reductions in gross service revenue and related client incentives. Because it was signed in fiscal Q3, the service revenue impacts for both Q2 and Q3 were recorded in the current quarter. This means that Q4 service revenue growth rate should be a more representative indicator of underling growth. ","Third, client incentives for the quarter, as a percentage of gross revenue, were 14.8%. As described previously, two quarters of Chase related incentive reductions were booked in Q3. This impact was constant inflation in our most recent full year guidance and we remain comfortable with client incentives as a percent of gross revenue in the 16% to 17% range for the full-year 2013. ","Fourth, now that we have fully left implementation of the Dodd-Frank routing rules, beginning in June, quarterly Interlink payment volume growth has turned positive for the first time in over a year. Going forward as we lapse a period during which Visa\u2019s post Dodd-Frank debit strategies took hold, we would expect healthy but moderating revenue growth rates for U.S. debit. ","Fifth, given our earnings result year-to-date and our expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter, we are increasing our fiscal 2013 adjusted EPS guidance from around 20% to the low 20s. Lastly, as we remain commitment to returning excess cash to our shareholders, during the quarter we\u2019ve spent approximately $1 billion to repurchase 6 million shares at an average price of approximately $177.00. this leaves $61 million remaining in our prior authorization. And as we announced earlier, our Board recently authorized a new $1.5 billion share repurchase program which will run through July of 2014. ","Now, let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the fiscal third quarter, followed by our results through July 21st. I\u2019ll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal third quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2014. ","Global payment volume growth for the June quarter, in constant dollars was 18%. Payment volume growth for the June quarter incomes in dollars was 13% above the March quarter's 9%. This was driven by sustained growth in all of our regions including the U.S. which saw some incremental benefit from the lasting effects associated with U.S. debit regulations.","More recently, in the U.S., through July 21, payment volume growth was 10% compared with 11% in the June ending quarter. Drilling down further, U.S. credit growth of 10% held at Q3 levels while debit, which also grew at 10% experienced a healthy but moderating growth rate as we lap the growing impact of the Visa's U.S. debit strategies.","Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 11% constant dollar growth rate in the June quarter which compares to a 10% rate in the March quarter. The U.S. grew 9% and the rest of world 12%. Through July 21, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 7% with the U.S. growth rate of 9% and the rest of world at 6%.","The slowing growth in July is most pronounced outside the U.S. and we believe is due in large part to the timing of Ramadan versus last year. Based on historical travel patterns, we estimate the Ramadan impact to be in the 250 to 300 basis points range for the month and if pass this prologue, we should see a bounce back in August.","Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled $15 billion in the fiscal third quarter, a 14% increase over the prior year period. The U.S. grew 12% while the rest of world delivered 23% growth. We have now fully lapped the negative impacts associated with U.S. debit regulation. Through July 21, process transaction growth was a positive 14%.","Lastly, please note that in our operational performance data pack, that was released with today's earnings results, we updated the cash volume in our LAC region to account for several quarters of underreporting by one of our largest issuers in Brazil. As a reminder, these cash volumes have no impact to our revenue.","Now, turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 17% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth globally in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, aided by significant non-recurring incentives in the prior-year quarter. Currency hedging resulted in only a modest foreign exchange headwind on net revenue in the quarter. Looking ahead, after factoring in our hedging program, we anticipate continued headwinds in the next fiscal quarter and for fiscal 2014.","Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.3 billion, up 7% over the prior-year period. On a sequential basis, growth was negatively impacted by the Chase agreement which as I previously outlined, resulted in lower service revenue offset by a lower level of incentives paid to Chase.","Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion, up 15% over the prior year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa, process transactions inside and outside the U.S. and strong cyber storage transaction growth. With the full lapping of the implementation of U.S. Debit Regulation, data processing revenue growth is now relatively on par with process transaction growth.","International transaction revenue was up 14% to $854 million reflecting solid strength in cross-border volume and some modest benefit from higher currency volatility. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives as a percentage of gross revenue for the quarter came in at 14.8%, positively impacted by the Chase deal.","That said, we anticipate a meaningful step-up in both incentive dollars and the percentage rate in Q4 due to anticipated deal activity both domestic and international which should put us within our 2013 guidance range of 16% to 17%. ","Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.2 billion, up 9% from the prior year adjusted results. This was primarily due to higher costs associated with investments in our growth strategy. ","Marketing expenses were up 4% from the prior year and stepped up from the prior quarter as we increased marketing to support a number of sponsorship campaigns including the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup in South America and the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics. ","Operating margin for the quarter was 61% and is consistent with our current guidance. Our effective tax rate for Q3 was 33.2% while higher than our full year guidance of 30% to 32%, the year-to-date figure of 31% is tracking to that range. ","Net income at $1.2 billion was up 16% over the prior year adjusted results. Fully diluted EPS was $1.88 for the quarter, up 20% over prior year adjusted results. Stronger than anticipated revenue and more aggressive share repurchases were key drivers and as noted earlier our full year adjusted EPS guidance is now low 20s. ","Capital expenditures $122 million in the quarter and continue to be in line with our full-year expectations. At the end of the June quarter, we had 645 million shares of Class A common stock outstanding on a S converted basis. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the June quarter totaled 651 million. ","Finally, in terms of guidance, other than our refinement of full-year 2013 revenue guidance to around 13%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth to the low 20s, all other outstanding guidance metrics for the full-year fiscal 2013 and 2014 remain the same. ","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie. ","Charlie Scharf","","Thank you, Byron, and good afternoon everyone. First of all, I just want to reiterate that we feel very good about our performance this quarter. There is very little new news in the underlining revenue trends as Byron has just described, which means that we continue to see broad based growth geographically and also by product. And these are at growth rates consistent with what we\u2019ve seen in prior quarters. ","People often ask us about what we see in the economy and what I guess we can say is we don\u2019t see meaningful changes to the path of the economic recovery. And while accelerating and certainly a more broad based recovery would be beneficial to us and our clients, we do continue to feel very good about our business and our ability to deliver strong results in the current economic environment. ","We did host our Investor Day on June 6th and I want to thank all those who attended both physically and listened in. we know it was a lengthy call but hopefully you found it productive. We certainly appreciate all the feedback that we received. Just a couple of quick reminders of some of these important themes that we covered. ","First of all, you know, we feel great about the strong foundation that this company has been built on. There has been strong historical growth. We have great partners and the company has a tradition of innovation. Second, the macro trends have and will continue to provide tailwinds. The opportunity to move transactions from cash to electronic means is still huge. And we believe we\u2019ll be there for years to come. This is true in both the developed and the developing parts of the world. As you pointed out on Investor Day, we have 22% share TCE in the emerging, I\u2019m sorry, within the developed markets and 9% in the emerging markets. So there is still much room to grow. In addition to us growing along with the growth of TCE across the world.","We love our core network. It\u2019s served us well and think it provides us tremendous opportunities to leverage and grow our business. Historically, what\u2019s really benefited us has been the global acceptance, the network reliability, safe and security and soundness, and our risk related tools are just a huge value added component to the network. While we continue to build on these historical strengths as we pointed out at the Investor Day, the future for us will be about using the network is a tool, to continue to create more value for issuers, acquires and merchants, and that include us building broader capabilities but also giving them access, it\u2019s our network as a device that connects to them together.","Third, the company has and continued to make huge investments in the future. We walk through some of the additional spending that\u2019s been done to the tune of an additional $700 million versus prior years, which are for the most part all geared towards growth opportunities.","And lastly, we talk about our evolving rules and practices, recognizing how the payments world is evolving. We recognize the needs to evolve our company. But we also feel strongly that we need to continue to preserve some core principles, those include the importance of the Visa brand, the safety, security and soundness of the payment system that we continue to protect and control our intellectual property, and that we enable clients of all sizes to compete. So in short, these of things that while we think we can continue to do more and more for all of our clients we think these things could also add value to the Visa network.","We turn now to little bit of an update on some of the regulatory and litigation items that are both been in the news and we\u2019ve spoken about. First of all in the United States on the MDL case. The deadline for the opt outs was May 28th. As expected I am sure you show lawsuits that were filed against Visa, MasterCard and in some cases the banks from retailers which opted out of the merchant settlement agreement last year.","The final figures are still being calculated but our estimate of the opt out is that they represent slightly above 25% of our U.S. credit volume. We continue to expect approval from a core sometime in the fall.","I do want to stress that these are proceedings that have been on going for a long period of time. We remain committed to figuring out how to work with merchants of all sizes to resolve all of our differences amicably and we as you heard from us we are focused on finding new ways to work with them in conjunction with acquires and issuers to support all of the individual constituents growth objectives.","Secondly, Canada, yesterday Canada\u2019s competition tribunal issue this decision to dismiss the competition bureau\u2019s case and uphold our no surcharge and Honour All Cards rule. We have and we\u2019ll continue to engage with legislators and regulators around the world to promote the understanding of a value of electronic payments to consumers, merchant and governments broadly.","Let me now turn to Europe, and as a reminder, Visa Inc. and Visa Europe are separate independent operating companies. First of all, let me talk about, in May we alerted you to a European Commission inquiry by the Director of General Competition related to inter-regional credit interchange rates.","That investigation specifically relates to the interchange applied to transactions between a non-European Union cardholder and the merchant located within the European Union. We continue to assess their claims and we are working in a productive and professional manager with them and hope to reach resolution but there is nothing more to report at this time.","Separately, the European Commission earlier today released proposed legislation for the payments industry in the European Union which had been expected. The proposed regulation covers a wide range of topics related to the European payments industry including domestic and intra-EU cross-border interchange rates, [co-batching] requirements, process requirements and point-of-sale rules such as Honour All Cards.","Most recent announcement submission appears to address issues similar to the Commission competition case, but the propose regulation would only applied to transactions when the issuer and an acquirer are located in the European Union.","We understand that proposed legislation is to beginning of what we expect could be a long process which could take 18 to 24 months. We\u2019ll continue to keep you updated if we learn of any more developments in either these two proceedings.","Also in Europe, I\u2019m sure we would get a question about the Visa Europe put and there is no update on that.","Let me move now and just talk for a second about a topic which has lot of you are writing about and has gotten a lot of press and that\u2019s tokenization. And to start with, stating the obvious which is we all know that transactions are increasingly moving to digital card, not present channels due to the growth of web commerce, mobile and digital wallet. ","As you\u2019ve heard from us in the past we\u2019ve been building our capabilities to deal with transactions like this both technically and through our rules and requirements, V.net and CyberSource are just two examples where we\u2019ve made significant investments to build capabilities in this space. And as we talk about tokenization I do want to just make a point that tokenization is not a new concept to us. Historically, we define the 16-digit account number [method] set and we effectively operate as tokens in the payment system today. ","The reality is the development of digital commerce and related risks makes the evolution of these existing tokens -- the evolution of these existing tokens to a more secure form very necessary in a way that works both in the physical and the digital worlds. We need to eliminate the flow of sensitive data that might be vulnerable to a breach and new entrance into the payment ecosystem has also brought into question whether the appropriate information will continue to flow between merchant, acquirer, issuer and consumer. And rightly so, the entire payments industry is focused on this. ","You read earlier this month about efforts that the Clearinghouse has underway with its 22 U.S. banks to do some work on this topic as well. We believe that we play a critical role in helping define the standards for token implementation broadly. We're working closely across the entire payment ecosystem defined very broadly to do this. This is an area where everyone needs to work closely together and it\u2019s paramount that we ensure transparency, security, and integrity so that the integrity of the payment system remains. Successful tokenization initiatives must also be interoperable and standardized and do several very important things. ","Number one is they need to deliver value to all stakeholders, that includes issuers, consumers, merchants, acquirers, payment gateways, and everyone involved in the digital commerce platform. It\u2019s got to be standards based, technology agnostic such that a tokenization solution builds on the existing open nature of the payments industry while also aligning with emerging payment innovation systems mobile and digital wallets. As I said before, it needs to deliver at least the same level as transparency and reliability that exists today. And equally important it needs to address the needs of everyone globally, not just in the United States. ","As I said before, we're committed to working on this broadly with all of our partners. it\u2019s something that we are working on and we feel very good about the progress that we're making with our partners on this one. ","In conclusion, I just want to also talk about the repurchase program that Byron mentioned. It\u2019s the ninth share repurchase program that the Company has authorized, since the IPO, our Board of Directors has authorized over 11 billion in share repurchase programs. And as we\u2019ve talked about I think almost on every call and at the Investor Day since I\u2019ve joined, we remain committed to returning excess cash to shareholders both through repurchase programs like this as well as further dividend increases. So, you know, having been here for nine months, as I commented at Investor Day, I remain more bullish as each day goes on when we look at the opportunities that exist in the industry and the assets and the ideas and the people that we have at Visa.","So with that, operator, Byron and I are ready to take any questions that are out there. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust. Your line is open. ","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust","","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question. Charlie, could you speak broadly about Visa\u2019s U.S. consumer credit share and how you feel you\u2019re positioned to expand share and continue above trend line growth especially as some of your competitors are potentially sharpening the pencil a little bit in the U.S.?","Charlie Scharf","","Sure. Listen, I think, we are blessed with just an outstanding U.S. credit franchise which has been build up through the years through terrific relationships for sure. We look at the partners that we have and look at their performance and certainly our performance has been helped by their strong performance and that\u2019s\u2019 true both on the issuer side, as well as on the co-brand side.","We\u2019ve also been certainly beneficiaries in the United States credit market as the affluent customer has recovered more quickly than the non-affluent customers and as we look forward more broad-based recovery is something which should be additive to the affluent business that we have today.","Ultimately, our ability to compete as effectively as we have within the United States revolves around all other things that we've been talking about here that we know we need to continue to build out. Those include what we are doing in the digital space. They include what we are doing in the mobile space, as well as just the continuing to provide the flexibility that we\u2019ve talked about in terms of our core product set.","So listen and I know from the prior roles that I played, the market has always been a competitive one. There always been networks out there competing for the same business. The pencil have been sharped for a period of time and as we think about what we've got to do going forward, we certainly expect that to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Perlin of RBC. Your line is open.","Dan Perlin - RBC","Thanks. I\u2019m just interested to know, how important, local market processing through, DPS and VPS is you guys, from a long-term growth perspective, it does represent an important enhancement to the yield as you\u2019ve talked about, you highlighted at the Analyst Day and it seems to be kind of coming up, with some pros and cons in various economies as you kind of outlined in your prepared remark. So if you could just speak to that point, I would appreciate it? Thank you.","Charlie Scharf","Yeah. Listen, I mean, as we talked about at Investor Day, processing we think is the second part of the equation that we can provide for our customers. When we process the transaction, when press -- when the transaction goes over our network, we are enable to, that give us the opportunity to do all things that we can do, both from a risk perspective, as well as being able to provide all the analytical information that we can provided back to the issuers in order for them to help grow their business.","Byron Pollitt","And I would just add the more of the, the more we integrate into the processing pipeline. The -- we have an opportunity to differentiate our service offering. So in the case of DPS, this creates an opportunity for us to introduce more innovative product services via mobile as an example and to add to phone trackers that expand the activation capability or opportunity for our clients. So where we can provide processing services like DPS which have the single larges debit scale potentially outside of China, I suppose. This is an area where we can excel in delivering client service.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Fandetti of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Don Fandetti - Citigroup","Yeah. Charlie, I\u2019m just curious if there are any updates on the Visa-Chase network deal in terms of timing. I think it was, there was going to be some type of pilot or something by the end of year and then also, I was wondering if you have any sense on the scope of that initiative, will it just be for merchants or transactions that are acquired through payment tackle that be broaden to other merchants indirectly?","Charlie Scharf","Okay. So, on the first part of the question, I continue to say this, which is, when it comes to what Chase merchant service is doing, there are series of questions that, you need to ask them about. What we are doing is providing the capabilities that we outlined several quarters ago. We are on schedule to deliver the ability for CMS to be in the marketplace by the fourth quarter. What actually winds up in the marketplace is really driven by them through their discussions with merchants. And again so that, that\u2019s a question for them. ","And the agreement holds that they need to have a direct relationship with a merchant in order to take advantage of whatever it is they intend to provide through CMS. And so, you know as I\u2019ve said I would, I would expect that sometimes as we get into next year that we would start to see some things in the marketplace and at that point we\u2019ll all be in a position to evaluate what we think the benefit of the mark. ","Operator","","Our next question will come from Chris Brendler of Stifel. Your line is open. ","Chris Brendler - Stifel","","Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I was wondering if you would give us an update on V.me specifically on merchant acceptance. It seems from my perspective that I haven\u2019t seen as broader acceptance as I would expect at this point. I think you had some concrete goals for top hundred retailers by the end of this year. Is there an acceleration coming? What\u2019s the issue? Is it difficult to get merchants to add V.me and then along those lines, MCX, is this something that you think potentially as a competitor threat. It seems to be gaining a little bit of momentum? And is V.me a key part of your strategy in combatting merchant mobile wallets? Thanks. ","Charlie Scharf","Let me start with V.me. You know I guess when we talk about V.me, you can\u2019t, and it\u2019s hard to separate out how we're doing with this issuers versus how we're doing with merchants because in our discussions with each, we really need to have to grow both sides in order to be successful. Right, it\u2019s the chicken and the egg which is, you know, merchants aren\u2019t going to want to spend the time and the effort and the money to establish V.me on their site unless they think there is a real need for it. And the issuers are going to be careful about marketing it to their clients until there is a meaningful amount of acceptance. ","Having said that, we now have about 90 U.S. national institutions as partners. they include BofA, PNC, BBBA, ICBA, and others. And some of those have started actively to market these programs. We have signed an additional 72 merchants this past quarter, bringing the total signed number of merchants to 253, many, many of which will go live in the coming weeks and months. So there is a lot more coming here. There is, you know, a fairly significant pipeline of merchants. As we continue to work with acquirers on this to get in the marketplace, we\u2019ll report back. ","And MCX was the second question. Listen, I think MCX we know what you know about MCX which is, you know you might know more than us. So, you know, our view on MCX is that we will learn as they continue to disclose what it is they're doing and we're focused on doing what we can to build the right kind of tools to work with merchants so that they want to do business with us. ","Operator","Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of JPMorgan. Your line is open. ","","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan","","Great. Thanks. That sounds pretty clean. I guess I\u2019d just ask about U.S. debit growth. That did bounce back nicely to 12%. Let's just look at the 10-Q. It says intra-link process transactions were up 25%. I notice it running down pretty sharply so that was a pretty big step up. I\u2019m curious is that sustainable and what\u2019s driving it? Did you clip on some new cars or is that paid, any details that would be great. Thanks. ","Byron Pollitt","","Now, Tien-Tsin, remember we're lapping the implementation of the Dodd-Frank, not suppose to say Durbin anymore, Dodd-Frank rules which took effect April 1st of last year. So it was in that quarter that we experienced the single largest negative growth rate in terms of intra-link volume. In fact, it was a 54% reduction in payment volume growth in the June ending quarter 2012 and then in the coming quarters as our strategies began to gradually take hold, we started to see a less negative growth rate. So one could deduce from that that in terms of actual year-over-year growth rate, it\u2019s considerable that the -- this June ending quarter might be high tide and then as we begin to lap the other quarters, the subsequent quarters that the relative growth will just have a tougher comp to deliver.","I\u2019d also just like to underscore that there is no way we\u2019re going to recover all that market share that we have considered as a result of the legislative change. So I think that there will be -- we still need a few more quarters in order to get to some sort of normalized state.","But as I said in my earnings commentary, in the subsequent quarters we still expect healthy growth rates in debit, U.S. debit. But everything else being equal they should moderate a bit as they begin to lap the strategies we put into place which in turn had growing effectiveness as time pass.","Byron Pollitt","Let me just add to that. So the follow up is we still think we have from our perspective a business, which can grow at a reasonable rate, understanding that we believe we permanently lost share because of legislation and those two things can coexist.","Operator","Our next question will come from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer","Thank you. Just regarding the EU proposal, I wanted to just get some context from you regarding whether or not it\u2019s having any bearings on your discussions with Visa Europe regarding their potential to exercise the put, as well as negotiation of these specific terms, meaning is this then somewhat of a stumbling back -- stumbling block getting clarity on the EU proposal?","Charlie Scharf","I think you\u2019ve got to ask, Visa Europe has a put. So, that means, we don\u2019t have a call and we it\u2019s -- and we can\u2019t proactively engage them in a discussion on price or things like that. So what impacts their thinking relative to their desire to put the company, you really have to ask them.","I mean I think it\u2019s a complicated set of circumstances. There is a lot going on in Europe right now. I think you can make arguments either way, whether it makes -- if you\u2019re sitting in their position, whether it would make you more willing or less willing, but it\u2019s their decision. So they\u2019re the appropriate people to answer the question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Two question. First, could you comment on China? There seems to be some movement in terms of issuers being allowed to issue cards in China. Some discussion regarding processing, I\u2019m just wondering if you could discuss there\u2019s been any sign of those discussions or your thought process around timing of when the market might become open to you?","Secondly, on incentives, like so you\u2019ve got two quarters of benefit from the Chase field in this quarter, I believe this what you said. But looking out to next year, is it reasonable to believe that you could come in as a percentage of gross revenue below the bottom end of this year\u2019s guidance due to the new arrangement or are other clients increasing and therefore that\u2019s a false assumption? Thanks.","Charlie Scharf","Why don\u2019t I start with China and unfortunately there\u2019s still not a lot of new news to talk about with China. The agreement with the WTO requires China to issue regulations by the end of July to open up the domestic market to foreign competition.","From what we\u2019ve seen, there has been some very small incremental things announced by the Chinese government but they have not been clear as we read the information to lay out a roadmap to open up the domestic marketplace. So we're waiting with everyone else until that happens. We have no better idea than anyone else, how, what form that will take, what time period. The opportunity for us, in what time period that opportunity would evolve. And so, you know, there is not a lot there. ","Now having said that we're still in the same place with, we feel, from a long term perspective, putting aside whether it\u2019s, one quarter, four quarters or eight quarters away, the opportunity to compete in a domestic marketplace in China with the capabilities that we have, we think could be significant over a long period of time. Unfortunately we still don\u2019t know what the time period is and what the requirements to participate will be. ","Byron Pollitt","Over to incentive.","Charlie Scharf","You asked an interesting question. There is clearly two forces at work here. One of which is the Chase contract where the pricing has been restructured so that it is more per transaction. There is still incentives related to the contract but not nearly at the magnitude that they were pre contract. At the same time, the vast majority of our issuers are in growth mode with their portfolios. The larger they grow their portfolios, the more incentives we pay. And that has been our business model for decades. ","And so, as is our practice, we will schedule those out over the next coming, the next two months. We will also take a hard look at what contracts are likely to renew in the coming year, which also raise into that copulation and then give you a report out in October. Let me just signal in the spirit of your question, that it\u2019s best, in our view, it is best to model incentives on a full-year basis recognizing that they can have a lot of variation between quarters and as I said in my earnings remarks, in Q4 we expect an above average level of deal activity as we move to the closing out of our fiscal year. And therefore we expect a higher percent as a -- incentive as a percent of gross revenue. And you should not consider that representative of the go forward trend. ","Operator","","Our next question comes from Tom McCrohan of Janney. Your line is open. ","Tom McCrohan - Janney","","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just a quick question on card not present (NYSE:CNP) given the growth of the eCommerce, how much Visa\u2019s volume today is card not present eCommerce volume and is the revenue yield on those type of transactions the same as for transactions that are card present? Thanks. ","Charlie Scharf","","Good question. That\u2019s not something that we're, that we have decided to speak about publicly at this point. Inevitably though I think that\u2019s something that we will be talking about much more in the future since that is the fastest growing channel that we have and by way of form factor within Form Factor, the fastest growing factor is mobile. And the two of them clearly are linked. So I would say we're short on detail today but more to come in the future. ","Operator","","Our next question will come from Moshe Katri of Cowen. Your line is open. ","Moshe Katri - Cowen","","Okay, thanks. Byron can you talk a bit about credit in the U.S., maybe compare what you\u2019re seeing on the corporate side versus on the consumer side of the business and if there\u2019re any changes during the quarter? ","Byron Pollitt","I would say that the, in terms of health, the corporate side is healthy but the factors that are fueling the really strong performance we\u2019ve been experiencing in consumer credit constitute more of a tailwind. When we look across the corporate spend, a lot of that has to do with the degree of recovery in the economies, across the globe. Our view is that the recovery, this is a technical term, is sluggish, which is one step above anemic and given that enthusiastic description, the very fact that we are seeing positive growth in corporate spend on cards in categories like airlines and the T&E components, we view as encouraging.","Having said that, there is for us in our view a significant opportunity to further penetrate a commercial sector, we have invested significantly in our commercial information platforms that support that part of the business with our commercial clients. And we believe with the investments we\u2019ve made in our IntelliLink platform that we are well positioned to experience meaningful growth in this market segment in years to come.","Operator","Our next question will come from Arvind Ramani of BNP. Your line is open.","Arvind Ramani - BNP","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Good quarter. I just had a quick question on your -- clearly the affluent has kind of -- has come back. But what are your assumptions for continued growth from the affluent market and also what\u2019s your view on the non-affluent market?","Charlie Scharf","So the affluent part of our portfolio really has been the driver of the credit spend that we have been recording over the past year. In the last quarter or two, we are starting to see some participation from the next income cohort down but it is not yet significant and therefore it\u2019s not a material driver in our results today.","As we look out into the coming year, when I describe the economic -- underlying economic growth as sluggish, if I would relate that to the U.S., creating 200,000 jobs a month, which is kind of the minimum to make any progress against unemployment. We would describe that as non-anemic but as sluggish growth. And -- but it is creating new jobs and those new jobs ultimately translate into spend.","And so our outlook is that the non-affluent spend will contribute more but not significantly more to the payment volume spend in the coming year. That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. And when we gave our guidance for \u201814, the limited guidance at this point, that was the assumptions that underpinned the growth rates we expressed.","Operator","Our next question comes from Smittipon Srethapramote of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Great. Thank you. International revenue growth was strong in relation to cross border volume growth. Can you talk about the drivers behind that and how much of the lift that you guys get from makeshift toward the tighter yielding geographies?","Byron Pollitt","Yeah. So I would say that there is a little bit of mix. There is a lot of volatility. So whenever there is significant volatility in the currency markets that translates into higher international revenue for us. That\u2019s something that can be -- can appear in one quarter and disappear the next relative to whatever an average volatility is.","We have been seeing with the strengthening of the dollar, the volatility in the Australian dollar, Japanese Yen to a lesser extent to Euro and Sterling, the turbulence in those markets is really -- and the associated volatility is the principal driver of the difference in international revenue versus the actual number of -- versus the growth in payment volume that we experienced.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Rod Bourgeois - Bernstein","Okay. Great. Just a two-part question about Europe. So if you were a network impeding in the vast majority of Europe, what do you like and not like about the EC\u2019s regulatory proposals that have recently been released. And do, the second part of the question is, is there any worry that Europe\u2019s regulatory moves might fuel merchants to push for regulation in other countries such as the U.S. and\/or emerging countries? ","","Charlie Scharf","Yeah, this is our view, if we were Europeans which we are certainly not, I guess when we read it the things that we like about it are I guess first of all there is recognition in the value of interchange. We can argue about what that number is but we\u2019ve heard lots of things through the years about whether interchange should exist or not exist in some parts of the world and recognition that it belongs, it\u2019s a statement in itself. And certainly I put no surcharge into that category as well. And, well then I would say which straddles both sides, the good and the bad, is level playing field. And so our networks that operate both three party and four party models fall into both sides of the camp. So on the one hand, it\u2019s a positive thing to bring some parts of their business into this level playing field. But the fact is there is still a meaningful part of the marketplace that there is just, you can argue an unfair advantage has been given and doesn\u2019t actually solve whatever the underlining regs are supposed to solve. ","The second thing I would put in the negative category is [co-bashing] and the third thing I would put is this, the splitting of processing from the brand. And the second part of Rob\u2019s question was \u2026","Byron Pollitt","","(Inaudible) is reasonable.","Charlie Scharf","Yeah and so I think it is the whole world, you know the world is a big place, but everyone sees what everyone else does, for sure. Everyone, so people will see what happened here in the U.S. on debit. We\u2019ve seen Australia. They\u2019ve been watching Canada. They\u2019ve been watching Europe. So it\u2019s certainly, you know you have to believe that when one significant part of the world does something that the other part of the world looks at it. You know in this case, you know remember this is proposed legislation. It will take several years for comments and for it to work through its process. So the things that have been decided here as best I can tell are not set in stone. And we\u2019ll see how these things actually evolve in the marketplace. ","Operator","","Our next question will come from Dave Koning from Baird.","Dave Koning - Baird","","Yeah, hey guys. Just looking at the 10-Q, rest of world revenue, not just the international line but actual rest of world revenue is up 24% this quarter. The last four it was up about 10% to 14%. And I think the explanation is some FX volatility probably helped on cross border part of that but it was a pretty big acceleration, maybe you can talk through maybe a couple of other reasons that that also accelerated so much. ","Byron Pollitt","There are two reasons that matter. You hit the first one which is the boost in international is reflective. We booked that into the rest of world line. and the second, if you recall, when I mentioned that the 17% revenue growth for the quarter benefited from significant non-recurring incentives that brought the growth rate down by several percentage points if you were to exclude those. All of those significant nonrecurring incentives were outside the United States. So they had the effect of amplifying the growth rate of rest of world. And those are the two main drivers. ","Operator","","Our next question will come from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna","Hi, a quick question on EMV. It looks like we're about 18 months from the deadline set in 2015. Are you seeing banks accelerate the issuance of EMV cards ahead of the deadline and any comments on EMV with regards to merchant acceptance would be interesting. Thank you.","Charlie Scharf","We certainly hear a fair amount being discussed about it. And we also have, I think, more issuers in the United States issuing Chip Cards due to the importance of making for an easy acceptance experience when people travel outside the United States.","I don\u2019t have the numbers in terms of the amount of EMV cards that are being issued today. It is bigger than it\u2019s been but it\u2019s not, by any stretch, imagination of the majority of the cards yet. But I did read something recently that suggested that the percentage of issuers that are attending to do it is growing but I don\u2019t think we know any more than that today.","And on the merchant side, I would say it\u2019s a similar conversation with the exception being to the extent that machines in merchant\u2019s facilities have to be replaced. They appear to be being replaced with machines that will accept the new form of card.","Jack Carsky","Brad, at this point, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Our last question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays","Thanks guys. Just want to jump in year-to-date we\u2019re clearly seeing a more meaningful margin expansion for this year again versus what we saw in the prior year, really prior to average margins. Average margins to the first three quarters are around 62.5%. So really more than 100 basis points expansion year-over-year. Is there anything unique about the years, quarterly revenues or maybe the operating leverage in the model on the past quarter is that shouldn\u2019t appear as there is something that we can expect this type of margin upside just from thorough operating leverage embedded in the model?","Byron Pollitt","Let me respond to that in two ways. First of all, I just want to anchor the group back into the guidance for \u201813 since we are talking margins and you begin with year-to-date. So we held our guidance at around 60% operating margin, which implies -- the math implies that the year-to-date is trending higher than what we would expect for the fourth quarter, which is why we kept it at around 60, so point one.","Point two, there is fundamental operating leverage in the business as you know. We have been very consistent in that we don't solve for operating margins. We don\u2019t have targets. We don't have internal requirements, what we do solve for our investments that drive shareholder value. It is the nature of our business that many of those investments are expense versus capital. And therefore as we continue to ramp up the investments that support our growth strategies, it is -- they often carry a significant expense component to them and would immediately put down downward pressure on the margins.","And I think it's safe to say that that philosophy of investing for growth and value both today and tomorrow is the philosophy we intend to follow. And that is -- that means some sacrifices of theoretically higher-margin, we\u2019re fully prepared to do that in the name of shareholder value.","Charlie Scharf","And let me just add one more thing to that which is, as it has been pointed out by bunch of you and also on this call, we do operate in a competitive marketplace. And it wouldn\u2019t be right for our long-term shareholder interest to be thinking about how our services should be priced based upon a commitment that we would make to you all to continue to increase the margin levels that we have.","We have to look at each transaction. How does the market price those transactions, what value do we think we\u2019re providing and have the ability to compete effectively if we think it makes sense.

Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Jack, thank you very much, and good morning to everybody. We're actually conducting this call from our New York City office, which gives us an opportunity to do a morning call, but I do appreciate everybody joining us early in the day and obviously very early in the day if you're on the West Coast.","I'm pleased to say that we had another very solid quarter of business performance, resulting in a strong finish to our fiscal 2017. We saw our broad-based business momentum carry into the fourth quarter as we'd outperformed our expectations.","Similar to prior quarters, we saw a healthy cross-border growth globally despite lapping what was a strong double-digit quarter last year. We saw a good domestic growth in multiple countries, including India, Russia and Australia. In the United States, our domestic business proved to be resilient despite concerns about slowing retail sales data over the past quarter. And although payments volume slowed in the U.S. due to expected lapping of notable partnerships, we did see healthy payments volume growth across all the regions with total growth in constant dollars of 10%.","Processed transactions sustained a solid growth rate of 13% globally. And we had a high level of contract and renewal activity in the quarter, driving client incentives to 21.7% of gross revenue, the highest percentage for the year.","All of this led to a strong fourth quarter financial results as we delivered net revenue growth of 14% and adjusted EPS growth of 15%. After I'm finished with my remarks, Vasant will go into greater financial detail on some of the comparisons and provide more background on the numbers.","Now let me take a few minutes to cover business highlights as we had a particularly active quarter in terms of partnerships and announcements. We completed two significant partnerships in Russia and our CEMEA region. We signed a multi-year partnership renewal covering a full portfolio with Sberbank, the largest bank in the region. And we renewed a multi-year credit and debit partnership agreement with Alpha Bank.","In Asia, we executed a multi-year credit deal with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China. In Europe, we continue to make good progress with our clients. This quarter, we reached our goal and resolved approximately 75% of contracts moving from rebates to commercial incentives. We expect the remaining 25% of contract to shift into the first half of FY 2018.","On the digital product side, we launched our new mobile solution mVisa in Kenya and Nigeria, and we've been working hard to bring merchants and consumers onto that platform. We announced a global partnership with Marqeta, an innovative card-issuing platform designed to drive new commercial and consumer payments experiences.","In July, we extended our strategic partnership with PayPal to Europe to accelerate the adoption of secure and convenient online, in-app and in-store payments across Europe. In August, we launched a national rollout of Visa local offers with Uber. This allows riders to earn Uber credit for making purchases using their Visa credit card at a number of local participating merchants.","We also announced partnerships with Fitbit and Garmin to enable digital payments through their wearable devices as mobile connectivity increases. And our push payments product, Visa Direct, continue to perform very well as we saw accelerating volumes with over 75% year-over-year growth driven by North America and the CEMEA Regions.","This month, we announced our partnership with Billtrust to help streamline the reconciliation of B2B payments. We also made a strategic investment in Billtrust to help support its efforts to grow the important B2B segment. And most recently, we announced Visa ID Intelligence, which is a platform that allows issuers, acquirers and merchants to quickly adopt emergent authentication technologies and to create more and convenient ways, which are secure for consumers to shop, pay and bank on their devices. So as you can see, we had a lot of exciting activity this past quarter.","Now, I'd like to look back over the last year, which was my first year at Visa, and I'm gratified with our ability to execute our operating plan guided by our strategic pillars. As a result, we have delivered excellent financial results every quarter this year. In terms of the drivers of growth, I'd highlight the following.","First, Visa has a strong and experienced set of issuer clients who have worked hard internally and with us to drive payment volume growth. We have a real and committed focus on client engagement around the world. New partnerships like USAA and Costco were obviously big contributors in the first three quarters of the year. Economic growth around the world has been strong, which has driven increased e-commerce in more developed countries and a combination of new solutions and positively activist governments has helped drive growth in less developed countries.","The good economies around the world also spurred healthy levels of travel, which helped grow our important cross-border business, where we saw healthy results in each of our five Regions. New solutions like mVisa, which I mentioned, for less developed markets and digital solutions like Visa Checkout, Visa Direct and Visa Token Services in developed countries are starting to take hold, although I would say it is still early innings.","Our growth has been robust despite exchange rate headwinds for most of the year, and these headwinds appear to be abating as we go into next year. And then the addition of Europe to the Visa lineup has been a real catalyst for growth in 2017.","And speaking of Europe, over the past year, I've been asked repeatedly how the Europe integration is going. So let me take a few minutes to give you some thoughts on this question, and I'll do so by briefly addressing Europe in terms of partnerships, revenue, expenses, people, regulation and technology. The overall headline is that we are pleased with the progress and running well ahead of where we thought we would be. We worked hard to bring the best of Visa Inc. from around the world to Visa Europe. At a recent client event, I said that the acquisition brought Europe to Visa and the world to Europe.","In terms of partnerships, our clients in Europe are eager to bring our global innovations to Europe as fast as possible. We have more to do for sure, but we've had many senior leadership reach out to our key clients and established an innovation center in London over the past six to nine months. We have already brought a number of our digital solutions to Europe as well as some of our strategic partnerships. We held a large European client event in Barcelona about a month ago, and the feedback from clients relative to the integration and Visa in general was very good.","In terms of revenue, we have worked hard to commercialize the business by selectively introducing new pricing and moving from rebates to incentives. And again, more to do, but we are off to an excellent start.","In terms of expenses, we moved faster than anticipated rationalizing our expense base to take out redundancies. In terms of people, we've reshaped much of the Europe leadership team. The CEO who steered the acquisition left in early 2017. And I asked a Visa veteran, Bill Sheedy, to take a multi-month temporary assignment as the head of Europe, and Bill did a simply wonderful job driving the organization through the integration and all the associated changes. Bill created a team that looks more like our other regional teams around the world by elevating some Europe talent, importing Visa people from other geographies into Europe, and hiring some terrific new people from the outside.","And speaking of new people from the outside, about four weeks ago Charlotte Hogg took over as our regional leader for Europe. Charlotte comes with experience at the Bank of England, where she was the COO, Santander UK, Experian, Discover, Morgan Stanley, and McKinsey. Charlotte has hit the ground running, and I'm confident that she'll be an outstanding leader of Europe. And Charlotte will be able to continue to lean on Bill, who will remain in Europe for the next month or so.","In terms of regulation, we certainly recognize that there is more regulatory activity in Europe than the other regions. Our strategy has been to engage actively with regulators, with whom we desire to build high-quality relationships, and with our clients to make sure we shape win-win outcomes wherever possible.","Finally, relative to technology, we are on or slightly ahead of schedule. The migration of the technology platform is a key priority for us, and we have focused much time and attention on it. Our objective is a smooth transition for our European clients to a global technology platform that will open up a wider set of solutions and products.","So five quarters in, revenues are tracking above projections, expenses are below, with a lower effective tax rate. EPS accretion in FY 2017 was in the mid-single digits, and the momentum is good as we enter 2018. So as we begin fiscal 2018, I'm excited about the many opportunities in front of us. 2018 will mark the end of the first decade of Visa as a public company and the commencement of the second decade.","Relative to 2018, let me offer a few thoughts. The fundamentals will continue to matter a lot, so we will be focused on lifting our game, our client engagement across the world. We will also continue on a journey that I began on the day I joined Visa, which is to build a world-class organization in terms of talent and leadership. We have put a number of building blocks in place in the last 12 months to drive improvements in all areas of the talent continuum, and we have significantly dialed up the emphasis on leadership and the expectations that I have of the leaders at Visa.","When we talk about fundamentals, cyber security is critical, and we will continue to invest to make our technology environment and the payments ecosystem as safe as possible.","We are mid-process toward a goal of empowering our regional and country management teams in a greater way. We want to push more decision-making closer to the markets and our clients. We do so because while we are a global company, we know that the consumer businesses around the world are indeed local in nature and therefore different. In doing so, we will ensure that there is appropriate level of staging, oversight, and accountability. We will invest against initiatives that are consistent with the seven pillars of our strategy. We outlined many of our growth strategies at our Investor Day in June.","In FY 2018, we will continue to invest aggressively in a set of focus priorities. Our areas of focus include driving greater and faster adoption of our digital solutions, expanding Visa Direct, extending acceptance around the world, driving cross-border growth, and advancing Open VisaNet.","Relative to Europe, we have developed a strategy that is consistent with our global direction but customized to the specifics of Europe. We are bullish on Europe and think there's a good deal of upside. We see tremendous diversity across the markets with countries that have large cash-based economies, balanced by others that have moved to near-cashless economies. In fact, immediately following this call, I'm headed to London for two days of strategy and action planning meetings with the Europe leadership team.","As we look ahead to the next decade, disciplined capital allocation remains critical, with the following prioritization. First, our top priority is to invest at healthy levels to drive robust organic growth in our core businesses. Second, we will explore selective acquisitions that bolster our capabilities and enhance the value we can offer to our partner banks, acquirers, and merchants. Third, we will return excess cash to you, our shareholders, through dividends and buybacks.","In FY 2017, we returned $8.5 billion to shareholders in the form of share repurchases and dividends. In FY 2018, with a higher dividend payout recently authorized by the Visa Board of Directors and stock buybacks in excess of $7 billion, we expect to return over $9 billion to shareholders, even as we invest at healthy levels in our business.","In closing, our expectation is that 2018 is only the first year of a multiyear plan that ensures our second decade continues to deliver superior shareholder value through long-term sustainable growth, much as we did through the first decade.","With that, let me turn it over to my partner, Vasant Prabhu.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Thank you, Al, and good morning to all.","We had a strong finish to fiscal year 2017. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter net revenues and EPS were both up 14%. As a reminder, this is the first quarter where we have Visa Europe included in our reported numbers in the prior year.","We closed fiscal 2017 with full-year net revenues of $18.4 billion, up 22%. Net income on a GAAP basis was $6.7 billion, and EPS was $2.80. On an adjusted basis, net income for the full year was $8.3 billion, up 21%. And EPS was $3.48, up 22%. All in all, a strong growth year, which exceeded our expectations, especially in Europe, which contributed with mid-single-digit EPS accretion.","Europe net revenues were ahead of our acquisition model projection, and operating expenses were below projection, with a lower effective tax rate post the legal entity reorganization we completed earlier this year. A few other points to note. Payment volumes on a constant-dollar basis, excluding Europe co-badge volume, continued to grow at double-digit rates globally. In the U.S., the step-down in growth rate reflects the lapping of Costco and USAA conversions in 2016. As a reminder, Costco started accepting Visa credit card in-store on June 20, 2016, and the first co-brand cards were issued.","USAA credit conversion was completed in September 2016, USAA debit conversion completed by October 2016. Strong cross-border constant dollar growth was sustained in the double digits. However, the weakening of the dollar, particularly relative to the euro and the pound, is starting to have an impact on the mix of cross-border business. Most notably, outbound commerce from the U.S. is slowing down as is inbound commerce into Europe, especially to the U.K. There is some improvement in outbound commerce from Europe, but no meaningful pickup yet in inbound commerce into the U.S.","These shifts will need to be monitored. Natural disasters have impacted our business. In Houston and Florida, it appears that business has largely returned to normal after some significant dislocations around the hurricane. However, the effects of the hurricanes on the Caribbean and the Mexico City earthquake are ongoing. Travel into and out of these locations continues to be below trend. As expected, we had a very active quarter on the contract renewal front. In Europe, we were able to achieve our goal of getting approximately 75% of the contract conversions from rebates to commercial incentives that we had set out to do resolved in fiscal year 2017.","Approximately 25% are shifting into the first half of fiscal 2018, largely driven by client timetable. We also had several significant renewals in China and Russia. As a result, client incentives as a percent of gross revenues were 21.7% in the fourth quarter, well ahead of the full year run rate of 19.9%. The approximately 25% of contract conversion that are shifting to fiscal 2018 in Europe reduced our incentives as a percent of gross revenues by 15 basis points in fiscal year 2017 and will add almost 50 basis points in fiscal year 2018. This shift, which amounts to around $0.03 of EPS, added 1 percentage point to our EPS growth in fiscal year 2017 and will reduce fiscal year 2018 EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point.","We repurchased 16.9 million shares of Visa stock in the fourth quarter or $1.7 billion at an average price of $102.54. In fiscal 2017, we repurchased a total of 76.1 million shares for $6.9 billion at an average price of $90.31. We also paid $1.6 billion in dividends, and our board has authorized an increase of 18% in our quarterly dividend to $0.195 per share. Finally, on September 11, we issued $2.5 billion of fixed rate notes with maturities ranging from 5 to 30 years with a weighted average interest rate of 2.78% and weighted average maturity of 14 years. On October 11, we redeemed $1.75 billion of our December 27 notes.","A quick review of the quarter's business drivers and our financial results. U.S. payments volumes grew 9% as credit grew 10% and debit grew 8%. As I mentioned earlier, the step-down in these growth rates was driven by the lapping of Costco and USAA conversions last year. Adjusted for the impact of conversion, underlying credit growth rates have been stable in the high single digits for the past four quarters.","Adjusted for Interlink, the U.S. debit growth trend was also stable. Reported debit growth ticked up from the prior quarter due to Interlink, where we are now lapping a routing loss last year. International payments volumes in constant dollars grew 10%, excluding Europe co-badge volumes in all periods. Growth trends remain stable and robust around the globe.","Global cross-border volumes grew 10%. It's important to note that cross-border growth hit double digits, normalized for Europe in Q4 2016 for the first time after several weak quarters. The cross-border growth rates held up in the fourth quarter despite tougher comparisons.","U.S. cross-border growth is slowing as the dollar weakens as well as some impact from lapping the Costco and USAA conversions. Cross-border growth in Mexico and the Caribbean was impacted by the earthquake and hurricanes. On the other hand, outbound commerce picked up a bit from Europe as the euro and the pound have strengthened.","Other currency shifts of the Russian ruble, Japanese yen, the Brazilian real, Aussie and Canadian dollars are also changing the mix of our cross-border business, which will need to be closely monitored. Transactions processed over VisaNet grew 13%, in line with the prior quarter when normalized for Europe. Through October 21, U.S. payments volumes growth was 8.7%, with U.S. credit growing 9.9% and debit, 7.4%. Cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis was up 7.4%. Processed transactions grew 12.6%.","Net revenues in Q4 grew 14%. While we have Europe in our prior reported numbers, it is important to note that rebates in Europe continued to be paid through the end of fiscal 2016. Exchange rate shifts helped reported Q4 net revenue growth by less than 50 basis points.","Operating expenses were flat to last year, which included severance cost related to the acquisition of Visa Europe and our global restructuring. Adjusted to exclude these special items, operating expenses in Q4 grew 8%, largely driven by personnel costs and expenses related to projects that were delayed into the fourth quarter, particularly in Europe.","Personnel costs were higher as hiring picked up post our restructuring in Europe and globally at the end of fiscal year 2016. We also incurred higher incentive accruals as performance exceeded our expectations. Professional fees ramped up in the second half around Europe technology integration as well as other key technology development programs.","Our Q4 tax rate was 31%. EPS was $0.90, up 14%. Exchange rate shifts helped reported Q4 EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point. For the full year of fiscal 2017, net revenues were $18.4 billion, up 22% with an approximately 1.5 percentage points negative currency impact. Full year adjusted EPS was $3.48, also up 22% with a currency headwind of over 2 percentage points.","With that, I'll move to our outlook for fiscal 2018. The many significant events of fiscal 2017 will have a meaningful impact on year-over-year growth comparisons in fiscal 2018. A few points to highlight before I get into the details.","First, unlike fiscal year 2017, fiscal year 2018 will lap a full year of Europe in our reported numbers. While the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 included Europe in both years, the ending of rebates to Visa Europe members did not go into effect until the first quarter of fiscal 2017. So the first quarter of apples-to-apples revenue growth comparisons for Europe is Q1 FY 2018. Second, in Q1 FY 2018, we get close to an apples-to-apples growth comparison for Costco and in Q2 FY 2018 for USAA.","Third, the India demonetization impact started in November 2016. As you know, this led to a more than doubling of our India payment volume and processed transaction. We begin to lap this in the latter part of Q1 2018. Fourth, as we indicated, through the first half of fiscal 2017, there were delays in Europe converting contracts to replace rebates with appropriate commercial incentive terms. As such, our client incentives were significantly lower than we had anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2017. As I mentioned earlier, approximately 75% of these contract conversions were resolved by the end of fiscal 2017, and the remainder will be done primarily in the first half of fiscal 2018.","As a result, client incentives in the first half of 2018 will be significantly higher than fiscal year 2017, with incentive growth moderating in Q4 2018. Finally, our U.S. price increases went into effect in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, and our international price increases went into effect mostly in the second quarter of 2017. We will lap these price increases in the first half of 2018. Fiscal 2018 price increases are smaller in scope and will go into effect in the second half of the year. All these factors have been incorporated into our outlook for fiscal 2018. They will also impact the quarterly cadence of net revenue and EPS growth.","Let me now get into some of the details starting with payment volumes. Payment volumes globally have grown around 10% in constant dollars for the past two years normalized for Europe. Thanks to Costco and USAA, U.S. payment volume growth stepped up to the double-digit range in fiscal 2017 and will tick down to the high single digits in fiscal 2018 as we lap both conversions. International payment volume growth as reported will now reflect Europe in both years. We have been providing payment volume growth rates normalized for Europe in our data pack each quarter.","Excluding Europe co-badge volume, normalized constant-dollar international payment volume growth rates were almost 10% in fiscal 2017. We anticipate some moderation in these growth rates in 2018 due to the dual brand run-off in China and the demonetization impact in India. Global second half growth rates are expected to be better than the first half, helped by some smaller conversions in the U.S., the ramping of Visa Direct volume, and lapping the declines in China dual-brand volumes in fiscal 2017. Overall, for fiscal year 2018, our outlook anticipates high single-digit constant-dollar payment volume growth rates globally.","Moving on to the cross-border business, cross-border volumes, as you all know, are dependent on global economic conditions and the relative strength of key currencies, in particular the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the pound. Through the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, the strong dollar, weak euro and pound dynamic led to very strong outbound commerce from the U.S. and high inbound commerce into Europe, especially the UK.","In the fourth quarter, these trends started to change as the dollar weakened, especially versus the euro and the pound. Assuming these trends continue, we anticipate a slowdown in U.S. outbound commerce, with a step up in growth of commerce coming into the U.S. and vice-versa in Europe and the UK. We're assuming this trend is accentuated through the year if dollar weakness continues.","Overall, our outlook anticipates high cross-border growth is sustained in fiscal year 2018, with a change in mix as described. International revenue growth rates are expected to be higher in the second half, when some pricing actions go into effect.","The other variable that impacts our international revenues is currency volatility. After high volatility in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 post the Brexit surprise, currency volatility has been subdued through most of 2017. Currency volatility has been running below the long-term mean. For purposes of our outlook, we are assuming that volatility stay at these levels through fiscal year 2018.","Normalized to include Europe for the full year, we had healthy double-digit processed transaction growth in fiscal year 2017, helped by the Costco\/USAA conversions in the U.S., the impact of India demonetization, and the processing win in Europe in the year. We expect a small step-down in growth rates in fiscal 2018 as we lap these items. We anticipate, however, that transaction growth will remain in the double digits, with generally steady growth through the year. Data processing revenue growth rates are also expected to be higher in the second half, helped by some pricing actions that go into effect.","On the client incentive front, we ended the year with incentives in the fourth quarter as a percent of gross revenues at 21.7%. Our outlook for fiscal 2018 is a range of 21.5% to 22.5%. Client incentives in the first half of 2017 averaged 18.8%, well below our expectations going into the year, primarily due to the delays in Europe. In the third quarter, this climbed to 20% as Europe contract activity picked up steam, finishing at 21.7% in Q4, which included several significant renewals in Russia and China.","With all the renewal activity in the second half of 2017, client incentive growth will be substantially higher in the first half of fiscal 2018, moderating significantly by the fourth quarter. This will be further compounded by two major renewals we currently anticipate will be completed in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as well as the completion of Europe rebate-to-incentive contract conversions, which have shifted into the first half of 2018. The Europe rebate-to-incentive contract conversions that shifted from fiscal 2017 to fiscal 2018 lowered FY 2017 incentives as a percent of gross revenues by 50 basis points and correspondingly increased fiscal 2018 incentives as a percent of gross revenues by almost 50 basis points.","When you put this all together, our outlook is for high single-digit nominal net revenue growth in fiscal 2018, which includes the currency translation tailwind of between 50 basis points to 100 basis points. Net revenue growth in the first half is anticipated to be a couple of points below the full-year run rate and in the double digits in the second half. Net revenue growth is expected to be highest in the fourth quarter and lowest in the second quarter. This is a result of all the factors I just went through.","In terms of currency translation tailwind of 50 basis points to 100 basis points, the dollar is not weakening across all currencies. We're benefiting from dollar weakness most significantly versus the euro. As a reminder, since the euro is a functional currency, we do not hedge our exposure to the euro. Relative to the pound, weakness of the dollar hurts revenues, but this is largely offset by the expenses we have denominated in pounds. The dollar is also weaker versus other important currencies like the Canadian and Australian dollar. As you know, we hedge some of our exposure to these currencies, which offset losses when they weaken and vice-versa.","The dollar, however, remains strong or continues to strengthen versus the yen and a broad range of emerging market currencies like the Argentinian peso. We are unhedged on many of these emerging market currencies since they cannot be economically hedged. The net impact of all this is the 50 to 100 basis point impact we currently estimate based on spot rates and forward curves. As always, currencies will fluctuate.","On the expense front, we're investing in a set of key initiatives that Al described, by partially funding these investments, by shifting resources from lower priority areas, as well as from savings we derive from better purchasing and other efficiency programs. In aggregate, fiscal 2018 operating expense growth adjusted for special items in fiscal year 2017 is projected to be in the mid-single-digit range.","Included in our expenses is another $60 million in non-recurring cost related to the technology integration of Visa Europe. In fiscal 2018, we expect to start migrating clients to the global Visa technology platform. We have also included expenses related to getting our processing infrastructure up and running in China. Of course, it remains difficult to predict exactly what the timing will be on incurring these China expenses.","Expense growth cadence through the year will also not be uniform. Adjusted expense growth will be in the high single digits in the first half and the low single digits in the second half due to various factors. Coming out of our organization restructuring at Visa Europe and globally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, personnel expenses were low in the first quarter of 2017 and ramped up through the year.","In addition, bonus accruals stepped up through the year as it became apparent that business performance was exceeding our expectations. We have the Winter Olympics in the second quarter, which will result in higher marketing expenses versus Q2 last year. The Europe integration cost is also first half loaded as we complete the technology platform harmonization and start client migration.","Finally, many of our investment initiatives ramped up through the second half of fiscal 2017, and spend rates on these initiatives will be higher in the first half of fiscal 2018 than they were in the first half of last year. The adjusted expense growth rate is expected to be highest in the first quarter and the lowest in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Our adjusted tax rate in 2017 was almost 30%, helped by the part-year benefits from the legal entity reorganization we completed midyear.","Our outlook projects 100 basis points reduction in our tax rate for fiscal 2018 since we will get the full year benefit of the tax reorganization. This tax rate outlook does not include any impact from possible tax reform. Putting all these components together, our outlook is for EPS growth at the high end of mid-teens on an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis. This includes 1 to 1.5 points of positive foreign currency translation impact.","As mentioned earlier, the underspend on client incentives in Europe with some renewal shifting into FY 2018 added approximately 1 percentage point to EPS growth in fiscal 2017 and will reduce EPS growth by almost 1 percentage point in fiscal 2018. With net revenue and operating expense growth rates fluctuating from quarter-to-quarter, EPS growth rates will, too. The EPS growth rate based on all these assumptions will be lowest in the second quarter, below the low end of the mid-teens range and at the highest level for the year in the fourth quarter, well above the mid-teens range. In the first and third quarters, we anticipate mid-teens EPS growth.","We know all this quarterly fluctuation does not make it easy for you to build your model. We wanted to give you as much color as we could, and we'll, of course, update our outlook each quarter as we normally do as well as provide a point of view on the upcoming quarter. For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, our outlook is for net revenue growth a couple of points below the full year rate, high single-digit operating expense growth and mid-teens adjusted EPS growth.","Moving on to capital, cash flow, dividends and buybacks. Capital spending in fiscal 2018 is likely to be around $800 million. This includes capital associated with the Europe technology integration, capital to set up processing operations in China and spending on hardware to support growth as well as capitalization of software from our technology development projects.","Based on our earnings outlook and capital spending, free cash flow from operations is anticipated to be in excess of $9 billion. Most of this free cash flow will be returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and buybacks. The Visa board has authorized an 18% increase in our quarterly dividend to $0.195 for the first quarter of fiscal 2018. In line with our stated dividend policy, this puts our payout ratio in the 20% to 25% range.","We anticipate buying back over $7 billion of Visa stock during fiscal 2018. As you know, we've been buying stock in excess of our normal buybacks from free cash flow since the Visa Europe acquisition to neutralize the impact from stock issued to Visa Europe members. In fiscal 2018, we will complete this aspect of our buyback program.","As I mentioned earlier, we issued $2.5 billion in debt in three tranches with a weighted average maturity of 14 years. After redeeming our December 2017 two-year notes, gross debt now stands at $16.75 billion. Our gross debt-to-EBITDA ratio is in the 1.2x to 1.5x range we are targeting, but towards the lower end of the range as EBITDA has grown.","Since we stretched out maturities and added some indebtedness, interest expense will increase 10% in fiscal 2018. After we completed our legal entity reorganization, we have returned a net $5 billion in offshore cash to the U.S. At the end of September, total cash on hand including marketable securities stood at $15.3 billion.","This includes cash from the September debt issue. We used $1.5 billion of this cash in October to redeem all of our two-year notes. We're monitoring developments from the tax reform front as we develop strategies to return more cash back to the U.S.","We will adopt the new revenue recognition standard on October 1, 2018, the beginning of our fiscal 2019. If applied to fiscal 2017 reported results, the impact of the new standard would have been immaterial. The impact to future years is partially dependent on the terms of new incentive deals executed going forward and will, therefore, vary.","We will continue to assess the impact of the new standard throughout fiscal 2018 and provide you an update if we believe that the application of the new standard to new deals in aggregate could have a more significant impact on reported results. As a reminder, the new accounting standard has no impact on cash flows or the economic value of our business.","In summary, the power of the Visa business model enhanced by the acquisition of Visa Europe delivered 22% net revenue and adjusted EPS growth in fiscal year 2017. Europe contributed with mid-single-digit EPS accretion.","At the end of the first year post-acquisition, Visa Europe is well ahead of our revenue projection, below our cost projection with a lower effective tax rate. If we achieve the goals we have for Europe in fiscal year 2018, cumulative EPS accretion will be in the high single digits, and operating margins will be at or above Visa Inc. margins. We're poised to deliver another year of the robust revenue and earnings growth we have come to expect from Visa while continuing to invest in our business at healthy levels to sustain this growth into the future.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","And with that, we're ready to take questions, Kevin.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, speakers. Our first question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you, good morning. I appreciate all the color on 2018, Vasant. I was just wondering if you could talk about what your expectations are for Visa Europe's accretion in 2018. And when we think about sort of where the surprises could be, it sounded like in 2017, it was on the expenses. Should we assume like in 2018, it could be more on the pricing side? Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yes. As I mentioned, it was sort of mid-single digits accretion in 2017 and cumulatively getting to the high single digits, so you could say once again, it adds probably in a low single digits accretion in 2018, so generally in that ballpark. So as you know, that's ahead of where we expected to be at this stage.","No, I would say as Al said to that, 2017 performance was driven as much by revenue as expenses. So the revenue picture has been strong in Europe for two reasons. The local economies, they have been strong, and cross-border was particularly strong in Europe in 2017 because of the weak pound and the euro, a lot of cross border into the U.K. especially.","And as we look at 2018, the economic situation in Europe at least as we look at it still looks very strong at a local level and the cross-border business is holding up. So it's going to be, again, I think revenue being a major driver of it. I don't know, Al, if you have something else.","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","No, I think that's fair. I think as I said, we're bullish on Europe, and I think it's a combination of what we're getting done on the revenue side and the expense side.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","And of course, we got the legal entity reorganization done, which meant that the effective tax rate on our European earnings is lower than what we might have expected immediately post the transaction.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just wanted to follow up on that. The high single-digit EPS accretion by 2018, that will be two years earlier than the original plan. I think it was for high single digits by fiscal year 2020. Just thinking about going forward into 2019 and 2020, is there some upside now to the original guidance on EPS accretion in Europe now that we're ahead of plan and there is probably more to do in the out-years? Thanks.","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Bryan, I think we're, at this point, laser beam focused on 2018 and trying to take this in one step at a time. I think we feel very good about where we ended 2017. We feel very good about where we think we're going to head in 2018. And hopefully, there's a trend there. But right now, we're focused on 2018 and getting to that next step in terms of the value that Europe is delivering to the entire Visa enterprise.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Perlin from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Dan Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks, good morning. So I had a question on the high 60s margin guidance for 2018. I appreciate all the expense color you guys gave. Historically, that's been a mid-60s number. And the question really is the business model at a kind of pivot point, whereby you really just can't kind of outrun the incremental margin anymore with really the pace of investment or is this just kind of a one-off, where we're going to be running in the high 60s? Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","I think as we've always said, we don't have margins as an objective. We focus on driving volumes. Clearly, the focus is on converting cash, driving volumes, driving revenues. As long as revenues are growing in the high single digits and with the appropriate level of investment given the nature of our cost structure, expenses are growing in the mid-single digits, you're going to get margin improvement. And margins are not an objective. It's an outcome. And Al?","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","I think the only other dynamic I'd remind you of, Dan, is that we're seeing based on the actions we're taking fairly good margin expansion in Europe, which is now a part of the overall mix of the margin number for all of Visa. But other than that, I would agree totally with Vasant's comment, which is we're going to invest at the level that makes sense and we feel good about and margins as an outcome, not a goal.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Fandetti from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.","Donald Fandetti - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, good morning. Al, sort of a longer-term question. If you look around the world at what's going on with Alipay and real-time payments, at some point, do you get worried that there could be some leakage to the secular opportunity or do you feel like that is something that's premature in terms of worrying about?","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Don, I think a good characteristic of any CEO is to be a bit paranoid. And while we just talked about very, very strong results in FY 2017, I can tell you that we are really laser-focused on the future and the fact that there are disruptive forces in the marketplace.","I think that as it relates to real-time payments, I think we feel like we've got a very good tool in our toolbox in terms of Visa Direct. And as I said in my remarks, we saw volume on Visa Direct rise 75% year over year. The likes of Alipay and WeChat have done a phenomenal job in China and have started to migrate to other geographies. And you can rest assured that it is something that we pay a tremendous amount of attention to, and we're going to do everything we can to make sure that we remain a key player at the focal point of the payments ecosystem.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Jason Kupferberg - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. I just wanted to ask on cross-border. Can you walk us through the reconciling items in Q4 between volume growth and revenue growth? At least in our model, the big revenue upside was on cross-border. And then just any thoughts or comments around the intra-quarter cross-border volume slowdown through October 21? I know it's only a few weeks of data, but any callouts there? Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","I'm not exactly sure what you're referring to as far as the volume and revenue growth aspects of the fourth quarter. There was nothing unusual in the fourth quarter. It was a pretty steady growth quarter. There should not be anything unusual there unless I'm not fully understanding your question.","As far as it relates to the first three weeks of October, we've said over and over again in the past that three weeks don't make a trend. Having said that, why is the number 7.4%? There's a little bit of shift in what are these intra-Europe cross-border volumes that accounts for probably 1.5 points or so of the difference from last quarter. Intra-Europe, sometimes acquirers and merchants can shift where they acquire the volume, and that can cause something that was considered an intra-Europe transaction to a domestic transaction. It doesn't have much of a revenue impact, but we do see that within the EU.","The other factors are really driven more by a strengthening dollar causing some slowdowns, as I said in my comments, on outbound commerce from the U.S. and some limited impact from what's happening in the Caribbean and Mexico. But again, there's a lot going on in cross-border with these currency shifts, and we'll just have to wait and see. We feel pretty good about it.","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","The only thing I'd add is again, a small impact, but it's the lapping of some of the U.S. conversions.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, Kevin.","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning, guys. Al, just a question about Europe. You gave pretty bullish commentary on the outlook for Europe, and in particular highlighting the disparity across countries there with card penetration or digital payment penetration. But that is the region also where there is prevalence in some countries of these bank transfer-based networks that have gotten a lot of traction. Can you walk through your view on how debit goes head to head versus these networks? What's the difference in functionality? What's the difference in the value proposition to the merchant, to the issuer, et cetera?","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","Lisa, thank you for the question. I think I mentioned I'm heading to London right after this call, and this is actually something that's on our agenda to discuss. The issue you raise is real. I think in the case of Europe, as a reminder, the bulk of our business or a large percentage of our business is in the UK. And as we actually look to penetrate further into the continent, we're going to have to make sure that we have strong offerings in credit as well as debit. And we, by the way, tend to be even further behind in credit in some markets than we are in the case of debit. And we're going to have to make sure that our value propositions are differentiated in certain ways to make sure that we are indeed a player. But there's no question that these country-based networks are something we're going to have to contend with.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. A two-part question, but first, I understand you have more tough compares in 2018, including higher incentives as a catch-up, but fourth quarter did sow some of that increase in incentives already obviously, and yet you were able to do 14% growth. So just are the other factors like pricing enough for the difference down to high single digits in guide?","And then just a longer-term part of the question is, I guess incentives are guided up again. If we took out the idea of a catch-up, again, bigger picture, should investors expect a more normalized growth in incentives after 2018 just based on pricing environment seeming to be somewhat stable in the overall market? So just bigger picture comments on incentives growth after the catch-up.","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","In the case of the first question, the guidance we're giving is our best assessment of where we see the business going at this point in time for 2018 with all of the various information that we have at our hands. In terms of the client incentives question, Vasant?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","On the first part of your question, which is your revenue growth was 14% despite incentives being 21.7%, I just want to make sure you heard what I said about the fact that in the fourth quarter of 2017, while we were lapping Europe in 2016, the rebates were still in place in the fourth quarter of 2016. So it's not apples-to-apples yet for Europe on the revenue front because the rebates stop being paid in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. So you really only have to get out of the first quarter of 2017 where you're comparing Europe one year to the other in a real apples-to-apples way. That's number one.","Number two, we went through some of the Costco\/USAA comparatives. So there are a couple of factors that make the fourth quarter that we just had have things in it that are not going to be like what you've seen in the first quarter and beyond next year.","As it relates to incentives, yes, some of it is the shift. But as you know, we just went through in Europe a large number of what we call contract conversions from rebates to incentives. All those now flow through the incentive line next year, so clearly that's a factor. And then we had, as you heard, several large renewals this year. That flows through. And we don't really want to comment on what happens in 2019 and beyond. But as Al said, we've given you the best picture we can of what to expect in 2018.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could maybe touch on the data processing line. That line has consistently done better than we expected. And I think on the last call, Vasant, you referred to the fact that you had picked up some specific wins. Can you maybe just kind of frame that line and the expectations for 2018 and beyond in terms of where you might be thinking of market share, in what regions and if Europe is specifically a possibility for further share gains there?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yeah. I wouldn't emphasize share gains per se. Yes, we had a gain in Europe, which did help the growth rate in that line. But data processing has been a very healthy business. It's a great business. As I think Al mentioned, we would like to increase processing around the world. It has been growing in that 13% range all year while clearly having Costco and USAA come in the U.S. helped that, too. As we look ahead, we said we'd see a little bit of a step-down because of these lapping effects but still healthy double-digit growth. Beyond that, there really wasn't anything remarkable there. It's just a good, strong, fast growth business.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette. Your line is now open. One moment please.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","...with regulators in Europe has been...","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","I'm sorry. You just came in with the first part of the question. Can you start again?","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Sure. Hey. This is James Faucette, Morgan Stanley. Al, it's a question for you. You mentioned in your prepared comments that your engagement with regulators perhaps is most active in Europe, and I'm wondering if you can just give a little bit of color as to what you view as the objectives of the regulators in Europe and the pieces that Visa can have that can help address the things that regulators are looking at. And I guess, as part of that, just give an update as to what you're seeing with your partners as \u2013 with PSD2, et cetera. Thanks.","Alfred F. Kelly - Visa, Inc.","So I think there's a number of objectives that the regulators have. They're looking for \u2013 to protect the privacy of consumers. They're looking to make sure that transactions are as secure as they possibly can be. They're looking to create and foster more innovation and allowing FinTechs to get into the stream a bit more, and that's facilitating the idea of opening up access to bank accounts around Europe as defined in PSD2. So I think that what the regulators are trying to accomplish is relatively clear.","I think where it all lands and what the various use cases that might develop is probably less clear. We focus on a couple of things. One is making sure that we are having good open dialog with the regulators so that they understand our point of views and have clarity around what exists that's good in the payments ecosystem and how the payments ecosystem is evolving.","Secondly, we're working closely with our clients, particularly issuers and acquirers, around Europe to understand what are some of the implications and frankly, what are potentially some of the opportunities, making sure that we help them as they try to meet the authentication hurdles that the regulators want people to achieve as well as understanding the implications of PSD2 and open access to accounts and what that might mean. And I think we have found ourselves having excellent dialog with clients throughout Europe, and it's something that we'll be continuing to focus on. I actually will meet with regulators tomorrow when I'm in London.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","And with that, we'd like to thank you all for joining us today.

Mr. Milotich, you may now begin.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Thank you, Katie. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa's fiscal third quarter 2018 earnings call. Joining us today are Al Kelly, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay will be archived on our site for 30 days. A slide deck containing financial and statistical highlights has been posted to our IR website.","Let me also remind you that this presentation includes forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and our actual results could differ materially as a result of many factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website. For historical non-GAAP financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and reconciliation are available in today's earnings release.","And with that, let me turn the call over to Al.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Mike, thank you and good afternoon to everybody and thanks for joining us today. We are very pleased with our third quarter results. Revenue growth was 15% as all of our key economic drivers remained strong. The healthy global economic fundamentals we've seen in the past few quarters have largely continued.","Payments volume growth on a constant dollar basis of 11% accelerated modestly versus the prior quarter fueled by faster growth in almost every region and higher credit growth. Cross-border growth on a constant dollar basis of 10% decelerated by 1 percentage point versus the prior quarter largely due to the stronger dollar.","Processed transaction growth was consistent with the last quarter at 12%. Expense growth adjusted for the U.S. litigation provision increase was 14% as we continue to invest in talent and deploying new capabilities in markets around the world. Adjusted EPS growth was 39%.","We also returned approximately $2.2 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter consisting of almost $1.8 billion of share repurchases and nearly $500 million through dividends. Vasant will take you through our results and our full-year outlook in more detail when I complete my remarks.","Regarding the U.S. interchange multidistrict litigation or the MDL provision increase of $600 million this quarter, we continue to make progress in resolving this litigation and have reached an agreement in principle with the class seeking monetary damages. That agreement is subject to negotiation of a full written agreement and those negotiations are ongoing.","Discussions with the class seeking injunctive relief are also ongoing. We will make an announcement related to any agreement if and when any settlement agreement is finalized.","Now let me share updates from around the world starting with Europe. We continue to be very pleased with our performance in Europe and feel there is substantial runway for growth moving forward as the integration nears completion. We see significant opportunity over time across three broad tracks: the acceleration of payments volume growth, country-specific opportunities and increasing yield.","First, we can accelerate our volume growth by displacing cash in key markets and increasing our share of domestic transactions. Cash still accounts for a sizable share of consumer spend in several of Europe's largest economies, such as approximately 60% in Spain, Italy, and Poland. Nine markets in Europe have an active or a large domestic card scheme, where we feel we have competitive advantages based on our innovative investments and digital capabilities.","We're also enabling Fast Funds for Visa Direct driving contactless payments and working more closely with FinTechs on new and innovative offerings. This quarter we announced the FinTech fast-track access program to accelerate speed-to-market by onboarding FinTechs with Visa in four weeks.","We also launched $100 million European investment program to support the FinTech ecosystem, building upon investments we've already made in companies like Klarna and solarisBank. Second, there are opportunities to gain share on specific markets within Europe as our current business is relatively concentrated. We plan to target faster growing markets and markets where we have lower share with investments in talent to support clients' innovative product solutions and enhanced marketing.","Finally, there's opportunity to increase yields in Europe. First, we are focusing more on higher yielding consumer and commercial credit volumes. Prior to our acquisition, Visa Europe as an association was very debit-centric and did not focus much on credit; second, driving client adoption of value-added solutions, leveraging our global VisaNet platform capabilities, particularly our risk products, processing and services relevant in a PSD2 environment.","Thirdly, we continue to see pricing opportunities in Europe. As we get closer to the end of the Europe technical integration work and the transition of our existing clients to incentive contracts, we are shifting our focus to these growth opportunities. I will talk more about the technical migration in a moment, but I'd be remiss not to mention the partial disruption of our European processing experience on June 1.","We, at Visa, hold ourselves to very high standards, so any impact on our processing for any period of time is unacceptable and we take it very seriously. That said, let me clarify a few points. It was not an outage, and in fact, approximately 95% of unique transactions attempted over the 10-hour period were completed successfully.","The partial service disruption was on Visa Europe's legacy processing platform and it was completely unrelated to the migration. Our global VisaNet platform was not affected. If you'd like more details, I direct you to our letter to the UK Parliament's Treasury Select Committee, which is posted on their website.","Now let me say a few words about the technology migration. We are very happy with the progress made to date. As you know we completed the clearing and settlement migration in March and the authorizations migration began in April. We now have over 50% of our processing volume migrated for authorizations, which includes a number of our largest European clients. We remain on track to complete the technical migration by the end of the calendar year.","To wrap up on Europe, the financial performance of the deal continues to exceed expectations. Vasant will get into more detail, but double-digit accretion we now expect in fiscal year 2018 is two years ahead of our original acquisition expectations.","Moving on from Europe, let me shift to other markets around the world, starting in Asia. In India, we continue to be the market leader with payments volume growth well over 20% this quarter. We recently announced revised debit pricing to address regulator-driven changes in debit economics as the market evolves, particularly on transactions under INR 2,000, an equivalent of roughly $30.","We expect incremental volume to largely offset this price reduction over time. We are also engaged with the Indian regulator to find possible solutions to best address their data localization concerns. So far this is a very productive dialogue, and we will keep you updated as our requirements are finalized.","In Thailand, our local debit network is now live. We are now one of three debit networks operating in the country, the other two being regional operators. Visa is the only network to offer a unified single brand acceptance both in Thailand and globally bringing a consistent end user experience to the consumers there.","The launch of our domestic network enables Visa to fully participate in the domestic payment market and continually drive digital payment innovations for consumers and businesses, while also fostering a financially inclusive ecosystem in Thailand.","In Australia, we've seen impressive payment volume growth of about 20% in the last few quarters relative to the market average growth of 7%. This is a direct result of successful portfolio migrations tied to significant long-term exclusive contracts struck with existing clients as well as our continued growth momentum in both debit and contactless. Over 93% of all face-to-face transactions are now contactless in Australia.","In Taiwan, more than 2 million Visa co-branded credit cards with Costco Taiwan and Cathay United Bank have been issued to date, which makes it the largest co-brand in the market.","Let me also share a few quick highlights in other regions. CEMEA is at the center of our Visa on mobile, formerly known as mVisa efforts (00:10:00). We are live and gaining traction in a number of markets, including launches in Ukraine and Kazakhstan and in Kenya, Pesapal, a leading payments facilitator in East Africa providing merchants online and face-to-face payment processing, integrated Visa on mobile into its payments processing platform. And it will be making it available more than 21,000 businesses for online and in-store payments.","To help support these small merchants grow their businesses, Visa is also rolling out a digital microlending partnership with Branch to provide preferential loan terms to qualified Visa merchants who accept Visa on mobile QR codes. Branch is a machine learning powered provider of mobile financial services to emerging markets and has the second most downloaded app in Kenya.","In Latin America, we made a strategic investment in YellowPepper, a mobile payments pioneer in the region, to help accelerate innovation in digital payment technology. The initial focus will be growing tokenized payment opportunities, increasing access to our APIs, expanding the usage of push payments via Visa Direct. Together, we're already working with more than 70 clients in the region.","In terms of advancements with Visa Direct, Visa Direct continues to grow rapidly fueled by geographic expansion, the enablement of new use cases and repeat customer usage. Volume has more than doubled in the past year and is beginning to have an impact on our overall debit volume growth, particularly in the United States.","The Visa Direct platform can deliver transactions to our 2 billion Visa debit cards globally, has cross-border capabilities and has already sent transactions to more than 150 countries this fiscal year.","More than 1 billion of those debit cards across almost 70 countries are enabled for Fast Funds. We are continuing to work with issuers around the world to upgrade the transaction speed to Fast Funds. Unlike many other real-time payment options, merchants and acquirers that already use our platform can now utilize global Fast Funds without any additional step once they are enabled as an issuer.","There are three partnerships related to Visa Direct that I want to highlight. One, we're partnering with MoneyGram, the second largest money transfer provider in the world, to deliver domestic and cross-border remittances utilizing debit credentials to receive funds. Cross-border remittances is a large attractive market that currently has a lot of friction for people receiving funds.","Second, we're partnering with Postmates, a logistics company that operates a network of couriers who deliver goods locally, to enable instant payouts to the delivery couriers in their fleet.","Third, OnDeck launched a new Instant Funding feature for lines of credit for small businesses. Once a business registers their Visa Debit card, they can make a drawdown and receive their money transfer in seconds any time, day or night.","Given that cash flow management is a critical issue for small businesses, the flexibility to receive funds when the bank is closed is very valuable. Not only is Visa Direct effective at capturing new payment flows, but it also stimulates our core business by increased spend per card. Based on a recent study of debit card users in the U.S., after receiving their first Visa Direct payment, they exhibit a continued level of incremental spend. And that transaction list was consistent for debit users with all levels of engagement, ranging from previously infrequent debit users to very active debit users.","Let me shift to B2B. We're investing in existing solutions while also expanding into new payment flows. B2B payments through existing solutions represents over 11% of Visa's payment volume and are growing at a faster rate than Visa overall. With the approximately $20 trillion market sizing for existing solutions, we see significant growth opportunity for virtual cards and Visa Direct in particular.","The virtual cards are increasingly important way which businesses transact with each other. We are now partnering with WEX, a leading commercial card issuer, serving the travel, insurance and media industries among others. This arrangement allows WEX and their corporate payment customers to use a Visa virtual card to enable global B2B payment.","Additionally, the Fraedom integration is going well and response from our issuers has been very positive. We're in advanced discussions to utilize Fraedom more broadly with issuers in North America, Europe, and Asia.","Lastly, we continue to expand our B2B offerings to new payment flows. While this is a very large market opportunity well beyond the size of what is currently addressable with existing solutions, it is complex and heterogeneous, and therefore will take time to fully capture the benefits.","We are starting by focusing on high-value cross-border transactions, which we view to be one of the largest single pain points in B2B payments today. We're addressing this with our B2B Connect solution. We are now in pilot and are on track to expand the availability of B2B Connect in the first half of calendar year 2019.","We continue to make great progress in contactless, a quick update. Global contactless penetration of domestic face-to-face transactions that run over our network was up approximately 2 percentage points since last quarter with 18 countries increasing at least 5 percentage points in the last three months.","There are now 10 countries where over two-thirds of their domestic face-to-face transactions are contactless and over 30 countries that are at least one-third contactless. And those 30-plus countries, which excludes the United States, represent 70% of the non-U.S. Visa domestic face-to-face transactions in Q3.","Transit continues to be a strong driver of contactless adoption around the globe. Announcements in the past quarter include both TransLink in Vancouver and Azienda Trasporti in Milan having enabled contactless payments at the transit gate.","Metr\u00f4Rio, Rio's largest transit operator with 240 million annual riders, announced that they will begin accepting contactless payments at the transit gate with the initial launch scheduled for later this summer.","Mumbai announced that its Integrated Ticketing System, which is used by 14 different transit agencies in and around the city that collectively carry 11 million people every day, will begin accepting contactless payments soon.","And finally in the U.S., the New Jersey Transit agency announced that they would be joining New York's MTA and Boston's MBTA in enabling contactless payments at the gate.","A quick update on Visa Digital Commerce Program often now referred to as the common button. Feedback continues to be very positive as we talked with more ecosystem participants, including merchants, acquirers, gateways, issuers, and digital platforms.","EMVCo continues to make progress on three major work streams. First is the definition of the Secure Remote Commerce Mark, which will be used in merchant shopping and customer-facing applications to indicate to consumers which merchants and cards are enabled for Secure Remote Commerce; second, user experience standards that define the checkout flow; and thirdly, technical specifications for ecosystem participants so that everyone can begin coding. We expect the detailed technical specifications to be published by the fall of this year, followed by the user experience and branding specs later this year, maybe into early next year.","We continue to work as quickly as possible with EMVCo to get the standards right. We don't expect the migrations of Visa Checkout will happen before the middle of next calendar year.","The FIFA World Cup in Russia was an overwhelming success for Visa over the past two months. The client and consumer experiences provide a unique opportunity to showcase Visa's innovative \u2013 innovation and connect both clients and consumers to the evolving portfolio of Visa's offerings. Over 500 bank and merchant partners across 103 markets in 24 languages utilized the Visa sponsorship to support their local strategies. The Visa brand was very visible, canvassing the field board for over seven hours on broadcast during the 64 matches of the World Cup, which is estimated to have exceeded three billion unique viewers.","Excluding those field boards, Visa had well over 5 billion digital impressions over the course of the tournament in 48 countries. The World Cup is on track to be the most viewed sporting event ever on digital platforms, setting streaming records in major markets including China, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.","Finally, a few closing comments. We're now almost one-third of the way through our fiscal fourth quarter, and it's shaping up to be another strong year for Visa. We're currently in the midst of many strategic discussions that will inform where we invest over the next couple years, which obviously will flow into our fiscal 2019 budgeting and investment programs. We're focused on sustaining our strong business momentum as we close out fiscal year 2019 (sic) [2018] and on October 1 launch into 2019.","With that, let me turn it over to Vasant.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Thank you, Al. We're very pleased to report another strong quarter, with net revenue growth increasing to 15%, driven by continued momentum across all three of our business drivers. As reported on a GAAP basis, EPS grew 16%. This includes a special item, which I will describe in more detail in a moment.","Adjusted to exclude this special item, EPS grew 39%, which includes a 10 percentage point benefit from the impact of U.S. tax reform. Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year positively impacted net revenue growth by approximately 1.5 percentage points and EPS growth by approximately 3 percentage points.","A few points to note. As we recently disclosed, based on progress in settlement discussions in the U.S. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation, we recorded a $600 million litigation provision and related tax benefit of $137 million in the third quarter. This special item is included in our reported GAAP results, with operating expense growth of 53% and EPS growth of 16%. Excluding this special item, adjusted operating expense growth is 14%, and adjusted EPS growth is 39%.","Related to this, on June 28, we deposited an additional $600 million into the litigation escrow under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan. Funding of the escrow triggers a conversion rate adjustment of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock, which has the same effect on EPS as repurchasing $600 million of class A common stock.","Growth across business drivers continued at double-digits. Payments volume and processed transactions growth remained strong and steady at 11% and 12% respectively, with cross-border volume growth decelerating to 10%, primarily due to a stronger dollar.","Client incentives are lower than expected due to some contract signing delays, as well as lower than forecast incentive levels. Contract signing delays added $0.01 to $0.02 to Q3 results. We expect higher client incentives in the fourth quarter due to these signing delays. Our tax rate benefited this quarter from the successful resolution of a tax audit. This is a non-recurring benefit of 2.9 percentage points in our GAAP tax rate, and 2.4 percentage points in our adjusted tax rate this quarter.","We bought back 13.6 million shares of class A common stock, at an average price of $128.80 for $1.8 billion this quarter. Year-to-date buybacks totaled 46 million shares, at an average price of $119.60 or $5.5 billion. This leaves $5.8 billion available for share repurchases as of June 30.","Including the impact of the conversion rate adjustment of class B shares to shares of class A common stock related to the $600 million deposit into the litigation escrow account, our effective year-to-date buyback totaled $6.1 billion.","Moving now to a review of key business drivers in the third quarter. Payments volume on a constant dollar basis grew 11% again this quarter. U.S. payments volume growth accelerated from 10% to 11% due to strong debit spending and commercial volume growth.","U.S. consumer debit growth accelerated, fueled by positive macroeconomic conditions, Visa Direct, and rising gas prices. Commercial volume has been accelerating steadily in the past three quarters, with gains across small business credit, large and middle market programs.","International payments volume also grew 11% on a constant dollar basis. Growth stepped up across Asia, driven by China, India, and Korea, and in Latin America, driven by Brazil. Growth across the Middle East and North Africa accelerated. Growth in Europe remains healthy. A strong dollar reduced this currency translation tailwind, especially in Latin America and Europe. As reported, constant dollar cross-border volume growth decelerated one percentage point from 11% in Q2 to 10% in Q3.","As a reminder, both Q2 and Q3 of fiscal year 2018 are impacted by lapping a settlement delay in Europe last year. This contributed 1 percentage point to cross-border growth in the second quarter and reduced growth by the same amount in the third quarter.","In addition, we have fully lapped the drag from an e-commerce payments platform shifting acquiring of UK cardholder volumes to the UK from another EU location. This reduced cross-border growth by over 2 percentage points in the second quarter and did not have an impact on the third quarter's growth.","The impact of each of these items on net revenue was de minimis. Both U.S. and Europe outbound commerce growth are down from their peaks, but continue at double-digits. Inbound commerce into the U.S. remained at double-digit growth rates, but decelerated with the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.","Europe inbound commerce growth also slowed but remained at double-digit levels adjusted for the settlement impact. Inbound commerce into Russia accelerated with the FIFA World Cup. Mexico and the Caribbean benefited from the continued recovery in tourism.","Cross-border growth was also strong across the Middle East and North Africa. The sharp weakening of currencies relative to the dollar significantly slowed outbound commerce into Latin America.","Processed transactions grew a healthy 12% for the third quarter in a row. Through July 21, U.S. payments volumes are up 11%, constant dollar cross-border volumes also grew 11%, and processed transactions grew 13%.","Turning to financial results, net revenue growth accelerated to 15%, service revenue grew 13%, data processing revenues were up 19%. International revenue increased 16%. Data processing and international revenues benefited from pricing, which went into effect this quarter. The currency translation benefit was lower this quarter versus the second quarter due to a stronger dollar.","While client incentive as a percent of gross revenue increased from 20.3% in Q2 to 20.8% in Q3, they were lower than we expected again this quarter. This was driven by lower than forecast incentive, as well as some contract signing delays. These delayed contract signings are expected to shift into the fourth quarter. As compared with the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, client incentives were up 20%, as many of the contract conversions in Europe were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017.","As reported on a GAAP basis, operating expenses grew 53%. Adjusted to exclude the special item related to the MDL provision, operating expenses grew 14%, primarily driven by personnel costs and marketing.","Headcount was still ramping up in the third quarter of the last fiscal year, following our global restructuring. This year-over-year increase reflects continued investment in personnel focused on our key growth initiatives.","Similar to the second quarter, this quarter also reflects the increase in our 401(k) matching contribution for U.S. employees, and higher employee incentive accruals tied to better than expected year-to-date performance. Marketing investment was higher than last year due to spending around the FIFA World Cup in Russia.","Finally, exchange rate shifts added 1 percentage point to expense growth. Non-operating expense was 34% lower than the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, driven by higher interest income on our cash balances, as well as a gain on the sale of an investment.","Our GAAP effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.2%. Excluding the $137 million tax benefit related to the MDL litigation provision, our adjusted effective tax rate was 18.2%. This includes a 6 percentage point reduction related to U.S. tax reform, and a 2.4 percentage point benefit from a non-recurring audit settlement.","Europe continues to exceed our financial expectations once again this year and relative to the original acquisition model. We now expect accretion from the Visa Europe acquisition to be at double-digit levels in fiscal year 2018. This exceeds our original acquisition expectations, and it's two years ahead of schedule.","The integration phase is nearing completion, also well ahead of schedule. As Al indicated, the complex process of converting clients to commercial agreements is complete, and the technology integration is on track for completion by the end of this calendar year.","With the integration phase complete, we're entering growth phase. We have many attractive opportunities for growth across Europe as Al described.","With that, our outlook for fiscal year 2018. There is no change to our outlook for net revenue growth, operating expense growth, and operating margin. As a reminder, we expect net revenue growth to be in the low double-digits on a nominal dollar basis, including approximately 1 percentage point of positive foreign currency impact.","Given that the weakening of the dollar accelerated starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, the exchange rate tailwind moderates in the fourth quarter of this fiscal year. At current exchange rates, the currency translation impact on the fourth quarter net revenues is neutral.","We expect to be at the low end of the 21.5% to 22% range for incentives as a percent of gross revenue. In the fourth quarter, client incentives are expected to be above the range due to the delayed contract signings.","As we discussed last quarter, full-year operating expense growth is forecast to be in the low double-digits adjusted for special items in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018. Since investments ramped during the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect expense growth to moderate to the mid-single-digit range in the fourth quarter.","Our adjusted tax rate including the impact of U.S. tax reform is expected to be between 20.5% and 21.5%. This lower range reflects the tax rate realized year-to-date and includes non-recurring benefits from our tax initiative of 1 to 1.5 percentage points this year.","We also had a 6 point reduction from U.S. tax reform. In fiscal year 2019, we will lose the non-recurring tax benefits, but gain 1 to 2 points from a full year of the new U.S. federal tax rate. On a GAAP nominal dollar basis, we expect EPS growth in the high 50s. On an adjusted non-GAAP nominal dollar basis, we are increasing our EPS growth outlook from the high 20s to the low 30s. This includes 1.5 percentage points of positive foreign currency impact and 9 to 10 percentage point benefit from the impact of U.S. tax reform.","As a reminder, we will adopt the new revenue recognition standard at the beginning of fiscal year 2019. If applied to fiscal year 2018 reported results, we expect the impact of the new standard would be a reduction in reported net revenue growth of approximately 50 to 60 basis points. This impact is partially dependent on the terms of new incentive deals executed in the fourth quarter and going forward and therefore will vary.","At this point, we estimate that the application of the new revenue standard may be a modest headwind in fiscal year 2019 and approximately 50 to 60 basis points reduction in reported net revenue growth. We will continue to assess the impact on fiscal year 2019, and we'll provide an update when we discuss our outlook in October. As a reminder, the new accounting standard has no impact on cash flows or the economic value of our business.","In summary, business trends remained strong globally. Revenue growth has continued to accelerate. Bolstered by successful tax initiatives and U.S. tax reform, our fiscal year 2018 outlook anticipates adjusted EPS growth in the low 30% range. This will result in adjusted EPS being up over 60% since the end of fiscal year 2016. The Europe acquisition continues to track ahead of expectations, driving double-digit accretion by the end of the second year well ahead of schedule. As Al described, we're making good progress on a broad range of initiatives that are laying the groundwork to sustain high levels of secular growth into the future.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Mike.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Thank you. And with that, Katie, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Al, you talked about increasing the yield \u2013 the increasing yield part of the upside in Europe from those three sources. Could you maybe dimensionalize the runway versus where we are today? And then just a clarification, Vasant, on the data processing revenue pricing change, did that happen at the early part of this quarter? And was it a specific region, or was it across the board? Thanks.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Sanjay, we, as I think you know, typically don't get into the specifics on pricing. But I would just remind you that Visa Europe, until recently had operated as an association and therefore had different motivation. So, we have said before that we think that there is real pricing opportunity as we look at Europe over the next number of years. And we've started to take some of that pricing and we'll continue to over time.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","On the data processing side, yeah, we did indicate to you, when we provided our outlook for this fiscal year, that the pricing this fiscal year would be in the second half of the year. So, most of the price increases around the world were effective April 1, and that's why you're seeing some of the impact starting this quarter. And we generally don't get into which region we took pricing in or how much and so on as you know.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question, Katie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Harshita Rawat with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Harshita Rawat - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question. Al and Vasant, I want to ask a question about India, which, in many ways, has become the next place to watch in payments. And as you know, there's a lot happening on the ground with local players, Internet giants and government-backed schemes. So my question for you is, what's your strategy to gain traction in this extremely competitive market, especially versus some very nimble local players and also local schemes, which have certain advantages?","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Well, thank you for giving us the opportunity to talk about India. I mean, we're very pleased with what's happening in India. The cash disbursement opportunity is great. I'd remind everybody that we are the market leader in India. We're well-positioned. We have greater than 50% share in India. We're continuing to grow at very healthy clips in 2018, and that's growing over very, very high growth in the prior year of 2017.","Our total focus is on growth, and the enablers of that are driving acceptance and driving innovation in the market. We're scaling QR code acceptance. We're partnering with issuers on driving awareness and usage, and we're working with issuers on things like tokenization, contactless, and scan and pay (sic) [scan to pay].","There's no question that India is a market where there is a number of competitors who have come into the space, but it is also a market that is in very, very early stages of its maturation in payments. And we believe that having been in India now for over 30 years and our various capabilities that we are well-positioned to get more than our fair share of growth as India matures over the next years, and frankly, decade plus. So we feel very good about it.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yeah, a few other things to add in terms of the competitors. Clearly, with some of the players now becoming payment banks, it changes the nature of the relationship we can have with them. Payment banks can do issuance of debit cards and prepaid cards. But they're not allowed to issue credit cards, but they can use debit and prepaid.","And a lot of people don't like to load wallets if they can just use a debit or prepaid card, far more convenient. So it's not \u2013 you shouldn't be surprised to see partnerships emerge with people that you might have thought of as competitors, because there's mutual benefit in that.","There's also the opportunity to have acquiring licenses granted to some of the payment banks, which opens up a large amount of acceptance that has been built over time in a proprietary kind of way. Similarly, with some of the other entrants, what everybody is doing is essentially creating the pay electronically habit, which is good for all of us. The rising tide lifts all boats, so there's generally benefit as you can see that our business is also growing at a very healthy clip.","So all in all, I mean, as Al said, it's very early days, and there would be a variety of new partnerships formed. We are talking to a whole range of players. And we would say you should stay tuned as things develop.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Saw the results. Just want to ask about the incentives. I guess, one of the comments about incentives coming in lower than expected was a lower forecast. So just trying to figure if that was lower volumes coming from clients, or was there something in the forecast that's changed when we think about it going forward?","And in the fourth quarter, does that become the kind of the high watermark in kind of looking at seasonally for incentives typically, so we should see as a percentage of revenue \u2013 of gross revenue that the incentives in the fourth quarter becomes kind of the highest percentage and then it kind of drops from there? Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","So two different questions. So on the first one, yes, the incentives coming in lower, a piece of it was clearly real reductions in incentives, i.e., incentives being lower than we expected. And that was because the incentive spend was not at levels \u2013 we make a bunch of assumptions when we do these things as to what we might need to do from an incentive standpoint.","And in this case, that was a real reduction from what we expected, and therefore we are saying, for the full year for example, we now expect incentives as a percent of gross revenues to actually be at the low end of the range that we gave you last quarter, we narrowed the range this quarter, we're saying it will be at the low end of the range, because incentives are actually coming in lower than we had forecast when we gave you our outlook last year. So that's a real reduction, it's not a delay.","In terms of the fourth quarter being high watermark, last year, the fourth quarter number was the high watermark, because we were doing this big conversion from rebates to incentives in Europe. And just based on historical trends in Europe, a lot of the deals bought down towards the end of our fiscal year. And so they were high in the fourth quarter.","This year again, we will probably have incentives being higher as a percent of gross revenue in the fourth quarter. I don't think you should view that as some kind of seasonality, it's just a reflection of what happened in the past couple of years, and just there timing was for renewal of certain deals and exactly what was going on in Europe and so on. So, I don't think you should carry that forward as sort of something that would happen every year.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Dan Perlin with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.","Daniel R. Perlin - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks. So I just had a question on this pivot to growth for you guys in Europe, and in particular, around some of the market share commentary, Al, you mentioned. Can you give us a flavor, at least some idea about what you're thinking in terms of target markets? And do those markets look more debit-centric, credit-centric? Should we be concerned about what that could do to yields as you start to make that pivot? And are there any real large sizable buckets that we could start thinking through in terms of investment as you make that pivot? Thank you.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Well, Dan, I'd say a couple things. I don't want to necessarily give away many, many details of our specific strategies. But, look, our business in \u2013 the business that we bought in Europe is obviously very concentrated in the UK and a few other markets and has 37 markets as we look at it in Europe.","It's also largely what we inherited was actually a debit business. And so I think as we look at pivoting now off of the integration work that has been really dominating a lot of time and management attention over the last two years to really look at growth, I think that looking at other markets beyond the UK and France and Spain, and markets like the Nordics, markets like Germany, markets like Italy, and looking at moving beyond debit to credit are very high on our list. I think additionally, we think there's the possibility to pick up some processing capabilities, where \u2013 pick up some processing where our capabilities might be better and richer than some of the offerings in the markets around Europe today.","I think as we think about some of our capabilities that we'll be able to deliver once we're fully migrated over to VisaNet and our ability to introduce the capabilities that exist on VisaNet ranging from risk capabilities to fraud capabilities to tokenization, et cetera, I think there's a great opportunity in the continent of Europe in various pockets to pick up volumes. So that's where I would say that we're looking at putting our investments, Dan.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan","Thanks. I'm glad to see the revenue acceleration here. I wanted to ask on Europe, just kind of a follow-on to Dan's question. Just now that you're ahead of schedule, two years ahead of schedule, has your total synergy expectation changed at all for Visa Europe? And is there anything to consider with Brexit and some other factors? I know there are some market review of a card acquiring business, I know that's not directly impactful to you, but anything we should consider today on Europe? Thanks.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Well, I'll let Vasant comment on the accretion. You know Tien-Tsin, we've looked at Brexit from any number of ways, and it's still unsure exactly where and how it's going to play out, as we all know, the politics in the UK right now is maybe not quite as interesting as the politics in the U.S., but it's awfully close. And how that's going to play out, who knows, but our view is that we don't see a lot of impact on our business from Brexit. We'll continue to look at it. We looked at it a number of times in depth, but we don't really see anything that concerns us there.","Vasant, do you want to comment on the...","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yeah."," ...accretion?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","On the accretion side, as I indicated in the comments, we are at double-digits right now, so that's higher than what we thought we would achieve over a period of time. I think we said high single-digits over a four-year timeframe. So it's higher than what we expected, and it is faster. Some of it is driven by things \u2013 we were fairly conservative when we did the acquisition modeling. Certainly, we've had better outcomes on pricing, overall volume growths have been stronger than we expected.","In addition to that, we were able to do the tax restructuring, and that created some real value. We've generally achieved all the other benefits we thought from a cost standpoint. So on all those fronts, things have performed better than we expected, and these are all very sustainable and will continue for sure. And as Al said, we see additional opportunity for yield improvement, and we will have some additional cost savings as we finish the technology integration.","But as with everything else, once you get into a business you realize what other opportunities you have. So clearly, we'll be investing in some of the growth opportunities that Al talked about. We're clearly going to be beefing up, as Al has said before, resources that are more in market rather than based at our hub in London, and we'll be increasing our investment in driving some of the growth initiatives that Al mentioned.","So things do change, but we did want to sort of give you a clean look at what our accretion was at the end of year, too, when it's still possible to cleanly look at what the business could have been without Visa Europe and is with Visa Europe. As you go further down the road, it gets muddier because things change. A lot of things change. But right now, at least, it's clean enough to give you a point of view.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson. Your line is now open.","Lisa Dejong Ellis - MoffettNathanson LLC","Hi. Good afternoon, guys. I have a question about Visa Direct and the applicability of Visa Direct for consumer bill pay, given how large a component of e-commerce consumer bill pay is, and also it's been a primary use case for competitive networks like fast ACH, et cetera. You didn't mention in your comments about Visa Direct any specific partnerships related to bill pay, so I'm \u2013 would love just some color on what the hurdles are to using Visa Direct for like online bill pay. And do you see that use case emerging and potentially diminishing the competitive threat from fast ACH?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","It's very much and a very important use case of Visa Direct. I think the only reason Al didn't mention it is because he was talking about some of the newer use cases. There are four core use cases that are driving Visa Direct volumes today. Certainly P2P, you're all familiar with that, that's a big one. Disbursements, we've talked a lot about that Disbursements of all kinds \u2013 healthcare, the gig economy, and so on. Bill pay is the third and really important use case, that's well underway. We're enabling a variety of bill pay merchants right now through Visa Direct. And then the fourth is faster payments to merchants. These are things like services that acquirers are offering merchants where they can get money faster than waiting for the normal settlement schedule. So those are four use cases that are driving Visa Direct as we speak. What we were talking about was some of the newer use cases that are being enabled in the future.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Dave Koning with Baird. Your line is now open.","David J. Koning - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks. So I guess just on the international revenue, a really nice driver has been, just how the growth has been mid to high-teens despite constant currency cross-border volume only growing like 10%, 11%, or so. I'm wondering, is that gap sustainable with pricing and mix? Or with FX coming in a little bit, should those two kind of converge a little and grow more in line with each other?","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","I'd say a couple of things and Vasant can add. As I look at our business, Dave, over the next number of years, a lot of our \u2013 the bulk of our growth is going to come overseas, and it's something we're putting a lot of time and attention to. And I personally spent a lot of my personal time overseas. And so, I think we're going to continue to see us invest in these markets, the cash opportunity \u2013 cash displacement opportunity is great. Some of the things we \u2013 just talking about Visa Direct and some of the use cases, the geographic expansion of Visa Direct into a number of these markets is going to be extremely helpful in driving volume, as well as some of the capabilities that we will continue to introduce in these markets that might be a little bit further along in some cases in the U.S. So it's going to continue to be \u2013 our aim is for it to continue to be a real source of growth."," You also had a question on the delta between the revenue growth and the constant dollar volume growth, yeah, it's a little harder for you from the outside to understand the drivers of that difference, and the three broad areas that can cause a difference: one as you pointed out is FX and that's clearly helped in the last few quarters and it helped more last quarter than it did this quarter. As you know, the dollar strengthened, so the FX benefit was greater last quarter on the international revenues than it is this quarter, but it was still a benefit. The second is mix. So I wouldn't underestimate the importance of mix, which corridors are growing does matter, some corridors are higher yielding than others.","For example, our cross-border volume growth includes what we call intra-EU cross-border volume. Intra-EU cross-border volume, as you know, does not have economics very different than domestic volume within the EU; and therefore when that grows faster than let's say the rest of the cross-border business that can be a drag and vice versa. So mix is a factor, which is harder for you to see from the outside. And the third is of course pricing; and this quarter we had some benefit from pricing.","So there's three different factors and they have a \u2013 they interplay with each other. You're right, as we get in the fourth quarter as the FX benefit moderates a bit, that won't help as much just as it helped less in the third quarter, but then there are the other factors to consider, too, like pricing and mix.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Wolfe Research LLC","Thanks, guys. So I mean, you're trending better than the first quarters \u2013 few quarters, so other than higher incentives just to be clear, is there anything else limiting your ability on the top-line to raise? I think it's just incentives to be clear.","And then, Al, I mean, cross-border seems to be trending better than last year, obviously, in the double-digits again. I just want to hone in for a moment on the sustainability on that kind of trend in your mind just given e-comm is a higher percentage mix now. And if that should hold up in your view, and then if incentives as a percentage of that could be \u2013 basically incentives as a percentage of revenue should be lower with cross-border being stronger? Thanks, guys.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Well, I'll take the second part of your question. I think that \u2013 I don't want to be in the predicting business, but I will tell you this that we want to be making sure that cross-border is growing at as healthy of levels it possibly can and e-commerce is in fact an enabler to that.","I think as long as \u2013 and in addition to that, as long as the economies of the world stayed strong and we're seeing people feel comfortable about traveling, that's certainly also going to greatly contribute to cross-border continuing to grow. It's an area of real emphasis for us and real emphasis for the work we do with our issuer. So it's an area of great focus, and we expect it to hold up.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","So on your other question about the revenue growth trajectory, I'll just repeat two things that I mentioned in my earlier remarks. One was in the fourth quarter \u2013 in the third quarter we had FX exchange rate tailwind of 1.5 percentage points, so it added 1.5 points to our net revenue growth. If you just take today's exchange rates and given that the dollar really started to weaken in the fourth quarter of last year, the FX impact on net revenue growth is close to neutral. So you do have that one change.","And then the other one you pointed out was incentives represent of gross revenue were 20.8% in Q3, and we said would be higher in the fourth quarter. So there are two factors that are different in the fourth quarter as we sit here today in terms of impacting the net revenue growth rate \u2013 the reported net revenue growth rate.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","Next question?","Operator","Our next question comes from Jim Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Al, relative to some of the comments you made before about the various applications of Visa Direct all the way from remittance, P2P, bill pay and direct deposit for merchants, et cetera, as you project forward over the next few years, can you give us any kind of sense about, say, four or five years out, how big a piece of revenue or percentage of total company revenue those various opportunities could be collectively for you at that point?","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","Jim, we're not going to make forecast three to five years out on anything. I would say this though, that obviously we've been talking about Visa Direct for a little over a year or year-and-a-half now. We're actually starting to meaningfully see it in our numbers. You're continuing to hear us talk about it in bullish terms.","I think it's important to emphasize that this is an operational capability that exists today. It's global. It's a capability that's attracting partners to us to try to talk about different use cases. Visa Direct is running on our VisaNet platform, and therefore has all the associated speed, security and scale that's associated with it.","And VisaNet has the capability to provide a bunch of services that's a lot of other real-time payment networks don't, including things like dispute resolution, chargeback, risk and fraud tools. So when I look at the opportunity, what excites me about Visa Direct is: A, it's grounded in our core VisaNet platform, but it has multiple tentacles for growth, both geographic growth as well as growth in use cases and its \u2013 and segments. It's a capability that supports P2P, it supports B2C, it supports government to consumers, it supports small business to small business. So I think when you look at it as a capability that cuts across ability to grow via segments, grow via geography, grow via use case, it certainly is something, Jim, that we're excited about and continue to \u2013 and we'll continue to invest against.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","We have time for one more question, Katie.","Operator","Our final question today comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","James E. Faucette - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much. I just wanted to quickly go back to a question that Tien-Tsin asked a few minutes ago and specifically on the UK review of some of the acquiring businesses. In that review it looked like they also said they may be looking at scheme fees, et cetera. Just wondering if you can help give a little light as to what you think they may be looking at, and kind of your discussions with that regulatory body as far as you've had them? Thanks.","Alfred F. Kelly, Jr. - Visa, Inc.","James, this is very early. It's not unusual at all for the regulators in the UK to be looking at any and all aspects of payments. This particular piece is focused on acquirers; it's not focused on Visa. And I think it's safe to say that we will be watching it closely, certainly providing whatever support we need to provide to acquirers as they address any queries from the PSR in the UK.","But at the moment, again, this is just very early days and there's really nothing to report. There's no real clarity about what, if anything, they're specifically looking at. Sometimes these things open as just simple queries as to wanting to get information. And other times they result in action and sometimes they result in inaction, and we'll just got to watch this and see how it plays out, James.","Mike Milotich - Visa, Inc.","And with that, we'd like to thank you for joining us today.

All participants are in a listen-only mode until the question-and-answer session. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, Head of Global Investor Relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky","Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Visa Inc\u2019s fiscal second quarter 2013 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s Chief Financial Officer.","This call is currently being webcast over the Internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. The replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for the next 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.","With that, and in contrast to what\u2019s been a historical pattern, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Byron.","Byron H. Pollitt","Thank you, Jack. Let me begin with my usual callouts and observations. First, Visa\u2019s 15% net revenue growth in fiscal second quarter was once again broad based as we continue to see strong credit and debit growth in the U.S. and the Rest of World, which is now supported by a return to positive growth in our aggregate U.S. debit business.","Second, client incentives for the quarter. As a percentage of gross revenue, we\u2019re 16.1%. Similar to last quarter, this was a result of lower than expected deal activity. However, for the balance of fiscal 2013, we expect lower incentive levels than originally projected. The new 10-year deal structure with Chase has the effect of simultaneously reducing both gross fees and revenue incentives with one largely offsetting the other. This contractual change which is now signed and in effect in combination with the timing and revenue mix have caused us to lower our full year client incentive outlook from 18% to 18.5% down to 16% to 17% for fiscal 2013.","Third, aggregate U.S. debit payment volume growth turned positive in the fiscal second quarter of 2013 versus a negative 3% in the fiscal first quarter. Of note, the month of March saw the onset of a significant positive inflection point as we lapped last year's adoption of the Dodd-Frank routing rules for U.S. debit. While interlink payment volume growth was in negative mid-teen territory, Visa debit payment volumes saw a 12% rate of growth.","Fourth, as a result of a more certain revenue outlook and earlier than planned share repurchases, we are increasing our fiscal 2013 EPS guidance from high teens to around 20%. Lastly, as we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders and through this end during the quarter, we spent $1.8 billion to repurchase 12 million shares at an average price of $157. This means through the first two fiscal quarters, we have spent 3.1 billion to repurchase 20 million shares at an average price of $152. As we begin the fiscal third quarter, our remaining open to buy stands at $1 billion.","Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the fiscal second quarter followed by our results through April 28th. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2013.","The payment volume growth rates which follow are unadjusted for the leap year in 2012. Normalizing the month of February would add about 1 percentage point of growth to the second quarter's results. Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 9%, on par with the December quarter's 9%. This was driven by a sustained growth in all of our regions, including the U.S.","We saw some incremental benefit from the early lapping effects associated with U.S. debit regulations. More recently in the U.S. through April 28, payment volume growth was 12% compared with 4% in the March ending quarter. U.S. credit growth held at Q2 levels while debit experienced improved growth rates.","Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 10% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter, which compares to 11% rate in the December quarter. The U.S. grew 9% and the rest of world 11%. Through April 28, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 10% with the U.S. growth rate of 7% and the rest of world at 12%.","Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13.9 billion in the fiscal second quarter, a 6% increase over the prior-year period. U.S. saw a 3% increase in transactions while the rest of world delivered 21% growth. Through April 28, processed transaction growth was a positive 15%, driven in part by the lapping of the U.S. debit routing regulations. Separately, CyberSource reported 1.6 billion transactions for the period, a 25% increase over the prior year.","Turning to the income statement; net operating revenue in the quarter was $3 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year driven by solid growth in global payment volumes, data processing revenues, international revenues, and as mentioned earlier lower than anticipated client incentives. Hedging resulted in no meaningful foreign exchange impact on that revenue in the quarter.","Moving to the individual revenue line items; service revenue was $1.4 billion up 10% over the prior-year period. Revenue growth was in line with constant dollar payment volume growth. Data processing revenue was $1.2 billion up 25% over the prior-year's quarter based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions inside and outside the U.S., strong CyberSource transaction growth as well as strategic pricing actions taken last year related to the restructuring of our pricing in the U.S. debit market.","International transaction revenue was up 13% to $831 million reflecting solid strength in cross-border volumes. As I highlighted earlier, client incentives as a percentage of growth to revenue for the quarter came in at 16.1% lower than we had anticipated on a percentage basis due to the timing of deals in the quarter. Looking forward the change in pricing structure related to the Chase contract in combination with deal timing and revenue mix now suggest full-year client incentives in the 16% to 17% range.","Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion up 13% from the prior-year. This was primarily due to higher costs associated with investments in our growth strategies. The rate of operating expense growth should slow in the second half. Marketing expenses were up 15% primarily due to a low-spend level in the prior-year largely related to the timing of the London Summer Olympics. Spend will step up in the fiscal third and fourth quarters as we increase marketing to support a number of campaigns including the FIFA Confederations Cup in South America.","Operating margin for the quarter was 63%, well slightly ahead of our full-year guidance of about 60% this margin level is consistent with how we plan for the year. Our effective tax rate for Q2 was 31.6% and it's fully consistent with our full-year guidance of 30% to 32%. Net income at $1.3 billion was up 17% over prior-year adjusted results. Fully diluted EPS was $1.92 for the quarter up 20% over prior-year adjusted results due in part to a strong commitment to return excess cash in the form of share repurchase. As noted earlier our full-year adjusted EPS guidance is now around 20%.","Finally capital expenditures were $111 million in the quarter and continued to be in line with our full-year expectations. The weighted average number of fully diluted shares for the fiscal second quarter totaled $660 million. Other than the changes to our client incentives and diluted earnings per share growth all other outstanding guidance remains the same.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to, Charlie.","Charles W. Scharf","Thanks, Byron and good afternoon everyone. We\u2019re happy with our continued strong performance and as Byron walked us through it was a strong growth across the world. Economic uncertainty does remain but our business model continues to prove itself through own environments and growth rates as Byron had mentioned have continued through April which makes us feel quite good.","We continue to build on some exciting partnerships around the world both traditional and involving emerging technologies. Just a few important examples of these I want to mention. We executed a multi-year co-brand renewal with South West Airlines one of our largest co-brands in the United States. We have talked about V.me before. We now have 82 U.S. issuers who have agreed to participate. We have more than 180 merchants signed, 20 of which are top 100 internet retailers and there are 37 merchants live today and more coming online as we talk.","During the quarter we also announced a broad based partnership agreement with Samsung covering Visa\u2019s payment capabilities on Samsung devices. Samsung phones will be preloaded with Visa payWave for contactless payments and the Visa Mobile Provisioning Service to securely download payment account information to NFC-enabled Samsung devices. These are just a couple of examples of some of the most important things that we executed in the quarter.","I want to turn and talk for a second about Europe. There's been a lot of discussion about a couple of items, so we thought we would walk through each of these one by one. First of all, let's just talk about our relationship with Visa Europe and the put. I guess I would say is we've read when you've read. We do not know what they'll do. And just as a reminder, they have a put, so it's their decision. We do not have a call.","The way we think about it, they have three options relative to our relationship. They can keep our relationship as is, they can exercise the put or they can propose an alternative which is different from the put. If they choose to exercise the put, there's a clearly defined process for that. If they were to propose something other than the put, we would consider it and if still inclined, we would negotiate it in normal course. But the process of the put would not apply. It was clear when I got here that we're always prepared if they choose to exercise the put to go through the process and have our points of view on that.","Having said all that, we believe that we compete effectively now but there is certainly a clear benefit over the long term to be one company, and I've talked about that before. I think it's true both for Visa Inc. as well as for Europe, but they need to come to that conclusion themselves. But I think most importantly in all of this is we're prepared to compete regardless of the structure, regardless of which avenue they go down. And if the situation changes, we'll obviously report back, but as of now what you read are the facts I believe.","The second issue is the EC enquiry. They are investigating intra-European credit interchange rates and inter-regional credit interchange rates, which is where a non-European cardholder uses their card within Europe. They're also investigating certain MasterCard rates as well. If the EC ultimately challenges Visa and MasterCard's conduct, we expect that would seek to prohibit Visa and MasterCard from setting default inter-regional interchange rates at their current levels.","In addition, the EC is investigating Honor All Cards, no surcharge rules, as well as the practice of blending merchant fees. We're in discussions with the EC and have nothing to report yet. There is a disagreement to the extent Visa Europe has an obligation to indemnify Visa Inc. on this issue. We're confident in our position that Visa Europe is obligated to indemnify Visa Inc. and we're engaged in conversations with them to resolve the matter.","Let me move and just quickly cover two regulatory and litigation items that you're all aware of. The first one is the MDL. The deadline for the opt outs is May 28 and we're confident that the judge will approve the settlement. On the Department of Justice, there is no update. We remain comfortable. Our actions are appropriate.","Let me move on now and just talking back to last quarter's earnings call. On that call, I talked about our need to become more flexible and the need to work more closely with merchants, and I'm going to talk a little bit more about this. Just a reminder, as we think about our opportunity we believe the number one opportunity for us is to move transactions from cash onto our electronic platform.","And we're confident that RSFs are of the quality and the scope that we believe we would get our fair share of transactions in the process. This really is about moving transactions away from cash. Our focus is on helping issuers remain competitive at the point-of-sale. The ecosystem is evolving and we need to evolve as well to make sure we remain competitive at that point. So to that end, we're evolving our rules.","We also aggressively continue to invest in new capabilities that we think will benefit everyone in the payments value chain. And a court example of this was effective February 1st we modified one of our rules to enable issuers and merchants to differentiate at the point-of-sale. This could take form in a whole series of things, but it could include things such as discount, offers or incentive. We like this change because it creates an environment where all four parties, consumers, issuers, acquirers and merchants now have the ability to work together to create their most \u2013 the most robust experience for all and all four parties will now be able to work together to use on network to help us grow Visa payment volume and the role we hadn\u2019t placed did not allow that to happen.","Lot of talk about the Chase contract and the Chase contract in reality is just one example of giving our issuers and acquirers an opportunity to create an environment to actually do what we just talked about, which is delivering more value to merchants and consumers. So we included a slide, but I thought I would walk through exactly just what it is. First of all, it's a 10-year renewable partnership. As part of this, we will create a distinct custom platform within VisaNet for the processing of their transactions, which I believe they are referring to is Chase Merchant Services or CMS.","This image of Visa\u2019s authorization clearing and settlement system will license to them exclusively for their use. The Chase transactions will still originate from the Visa branded card, but will be processed in one or two ways. The first way, it will be \u2013 would be just as happens today. The second if the card is used to the merchant with whom Chase has a direct agreement for CMS, the transactions will be processed over the platform provided for them by us.","Visa branding on the cards and at the point of sale remains the same. The CMS platform is customizable, but the transactions will continue to meet our safety, security and sound as standards and we can offer similar functionality to any other Visa client. Visa retains ownership and control of this technology and intellectual property which is obviously critical for us.","Chase like any other issuer today can negotiate interchange directly with merchants, whether the transaction is processed from CMS or VisaNet. Not sure that this is well understood that it\u2019s \u2013 that issuers have the ability to do this today, but they do in fact have the ability to do it and Chase any of the merchants, we will continue to have the ability. The pricing levels and mechanics for our dealer Chase are consistent with what would be available; the clients have Chase their size and scope for making a 10-year commitment. And obviously important for us, we Visa will gain additional consumer credit and debit volume.","Looking ahead, we will continue to develop new capabilities, enhancing our business practices because we want to help issuers, acquirers, and merchants of all sizes work more closely together to take full advantage of the opportunities emerging across the industries and to that end we are in active discussions with other partners on ways to use our network to help them differentiate. If clients are interested, we\u2019re willing to pursue customized arrangements that make sense to their own business needs. But we will adhere to certain core Visa principals which is the manner in which we had approached the Chase arrangement.","Just a few of these would be, number one, is it would have to support the Visa brand. We\u2019d have to support our safety, soundness, and security standards that we maintain. We would have to make control \u2013 maintain control over the IP, we would have to continue to enable clients of all sizes to compete in the marketplace. And probably most importantly whatever we do, we\u2019d have to add value to the Visa network.","The bottom line is we believe that what \u2013 that our approach here relative to Chase and our approach with all issuers, acquirers, merchants of all sizes, our steps that are good for the electronification of payments, good for all of our partners and therefore good for us.","There is a lot more we can talk about, but we do have plans for you all, the complete strategic update at our Investor Day, scheduled for June 6. At that meeting we intend to cover plans for what we are doing both in the developed and the emerging economies and we intend to focus a lot on e-Commerce, mobile solutions, and what we're doing in the technology space in general. So, we will leave a bunch of the discussions for that and still we have plenty of time.","And with that, I think we will stop and will open the call to questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Great. Thanks. I think the \u2013 revenue performance obviously very strong. I was just wondering if you could kind of talk about how you see that progressing. Obviously, it sounds like the incentives that you were talking about was lower incentives in the current period, and so can we take away from that that you're actually seeing kind of better combination, if you will, of kind of volume coming out of debit and some of the pricing actions that you've taken?","Byron H. Pollitt","So let me respond to that. First, just to be clear on the incentive piece, a large contributor to the reduction in the incentive guidance going forward and to a certain extent this quarter, when we signed the Chase agreement it restructured how we price so that as I said in my opening remarks, gross fees are coming down along with incentives and it's largely an offset. So while incentives for the balance of the year are expected to come in, in that 16% to 17% range, that in and of itself is not a significant contributor to the revenue performance for the balance of the year because we haven't changed our overall revenue guidance. So we are well positioned within the low double-digit range. And what we're seeing underlying that is strong, sustained performance globally. And we're two quarters now under our belt. And because of our quarter lag, remember that we actually have visibility to three quarters of service revenue. We have a much higher degree of certainty of how the year will flow out. And given the strength we're seeing outside the U.S. had good sustained recovery in our U.S. debit business as you've pointed out, and particularly as we enter into the April, May, June quarter, this will anniversary the Dodd-Frank routing rules. Notice I said Dodd-Frank not Durbin. And so while the debit business in the U.S. has sustained a meaningful loss particularly in the interlink, we're pleased with the way our mitigation strategies have unfolded and the way the business has been recovering over the past several quarters.","Operator","Our next question will come from Craig Maurer of CLSA. Your line is open.","Craig Maurer - CLSA","Good evening. Quickly, I was wondering if you could address any material pricing differences between Visa Inc. and Visa Europe that would have to be overcome should the put be exercised. And although I know it doesn't materially impact your top line, I was wondering if you could just clarify what's going on with the cash volumes in Latin America that seem to be off dramatically? Thanks.","Byron H. Pollitt","The pricing approach that Visa Europe pursues is one that's still very much based on a bank-owned membership arrangement. And so it's different than what we have here in the United States for Visa and globally outside of Europe. Having said that, Visa Europe is still not priced to be competitive with other competitors like MasterCard in that arena, and so we've not done a detailed analysis of what the comparisons are, but there is a presumption that to be competitive you have to price competitively. And we consider Visa Europe very competitive in that part of the world. So don't really have a comment on that. And with regards to the cash volumes in Latin America, don't have a comment on that either. And so we'll \u2013 that's when we'll have to take a look into and we'd be happy to get back to you through IR.","Charles W. Scharf","Let me just add to Byron's response on the Visa Europe question. As I said in the remarks, there's a very defined process that we would go through with Visa Europe where we look at the sustainable earnings power of the company. And I would presume a big part of that discussion would be what the sustainable revenue contribution would be as the model evolved and there is plenty of time throughout that process to have that discussion with them, if we get to that point.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bill Carache of Nomura. Your line is open.","Bill Carache - Nomura","Thanks. Good evening. So between about $1.8 billion of buybacks and over $200 million in dividend, it looks like your payout ratio was about 160% this quarter there about. As we look ahead, with final approval of the merchant litigation, which we expect, influence your mindset or attitude regarding capital return, perhaps just making you feel like you have a bit more flexibility there?","Charles W. Scharf","The answer is no. We have \u2013 we began life as a public company committed to return excess cash to shareholders. We have done that aggressively over five plus years. Every time that was an opportunity to in effect put money into the escrow on behalf of the U.S. bank shareholders. And do that in a way that it had the effect of share repurchase, we did that. Have that money not going into the escrow. I\u2019m fairly confident in saying that we\u2019d have ended up buying back in the open market, those shares.","And just the final point, you mentioned the buyback and the dividends for the period. If we think about our commitment in the following way. I think there is underscores not our commitment to return. We have guided $6 billion of free cash flow for the year. Roughly one billion of that six will be generated in offshore in ways that we\u2019d not bring back to the U.S. and subjected to taxes at least at this \u2013 any time in the near future. That leaves $5 billion. We have authorization to repurchase a little over $4 billion for the year of which we have basically bought back through the first six months $3 billion of the $4 billion and if you take four full quarters of dividend payments, you\u2019re approaching a $1 billion. So if have the share repurchases and set forward to the dividends of one, you get $5 billion of the $6 billion of free cash flow, in effect return to shareholders in the $1 billion that isn\u2019t is offshore.","Operator","Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani of KBW. Your line is open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods","Thank you. I was hoping you could discuss this merchant litigation that\u2019s been threatened in Europe, that you guys disclosed in the 10-Q, it seems like you feel like you\u2019re being in \u2013 you should be indemnified there as well. But I was wondering if can just flush that out a little bit. I guess, was that the part of the reason that would drive the banks to exercise the point. And then second, I just want to make sure I understood Byron\u2019s point about the Chase. With the gross revenue yield then come down next quarter, given the structuring of the deal, because if you look at kind of the year-over-year change, those were up in the second quarter? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf","You want to answer the second one first Bryon?","Byron H. Pollitt","Yeah, let me do the second one first. Everything else being equal, yes the gross revenue yields would come down isolated to that one factoring Chase, because you still have the transactions, but the way that they are being charged gross equals net, no incentives. And so incentives would go down, gross yield would go down.","Charles W. Scharf","And on the first point, let me take a shot at that for a second. So, there \u2013 the EC is investing \u2013 is investigating several different things. One of which is INTRA, European Credit Interchange, so this is where there is a card issued within Europe and its used inside of Europe. That affects Visa Europe, it does not affect us. For say, and they are also investigating inter \u2013 interchange, which is when it is a card issued outside of Europe and its used inside of Europe.","We obviously don\u2019t know since we\u2019re in discussions with them weird winds up, we have nothing to report on exactly the specifics of what they\u2019re thinking in relative to how it impacts their view of the put. I think honestly that is a \u2013 that\u2019s a question for them, whether its for Visa Europe or for the banks themselves. I would say \u2013 what we think about is what it does to our thinking about Visa Europe. And in the different scenarios that I spoke about, to the extent that we have to go through a valuation process to understand what the sustainable earnings of Visa Europe would be, that whatever the conclusion of this inquiry would be, would obviously help us \u2013 point us towards what the affect of this could certainly be. And if it's something outside of the put, we would obviously have to take into account as well. But when it's concluded, we'll know the specifics and we'll be in a position to understand the impacts","Operator","Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Co.","Thanks, guys. Just a clarification and a question. The clarification just in terms of other future deals, like the Chase deal, are you guys kind of waiting for inbound interest in terms of other issuers approaching you? Are you actually proactively marketing just two other biggest issuers? And then, just as my question also on the topic of the 10-Q, saw some language in there around CFPB taking a look at currency conversion fees on cross-border transactions, just any comments you may have on that? Thanks.","Byron H. Pollitt","Okay. So on the first question; we're not the type of organization that waits for our clients to call us. I mean in all seriousness, we talk with our clients literally day-in and day-out. So when this was announced, there were certainly extensive conversations that have gone on and continue to go on with clients of all sizes. And even before the announcement, the conversations that we've had were very consistent with the messaging that I laid out on the last call, which is that we want to be more flexible, we want to evolve our rules and we want to focus much more on working with merchants. So we are actively involved in talking to institutions of all sizes. I would describe them as very, very different types of conversations with people having different capabilities and different desires. And when I went through my introductory remarks, I kind of laid out what some of the principles are for us to follow, but if we can do things with them that would help them grow their business and help us grow payment volume, that's something we're very excited to do.","Charles W. Scharf","Let me take the question on the CFPB. As you might imagine we have quite a bit of experience globally working with regulators and it's not uncommon for them to reach out in a very informational way to try and understand how certain practices unfold within our ecosystem, and that is very much the nature of this dialogue with the CFPB. They have reached out and asked us if we would help them \u2013 help educate them on how the currency trading ecosystem works as it relates to credit and debit cards. And so myself along with a number of my colleagues have met with them personally. It was a very straightforward educational type discussion focused on the mechanics of how currency conversion works. I would describe the working relationship as very cordial, very sound. I would say at the same time that our engagement is ongoing and we will of course keep you all informed as this dialogue unfolds.","Operator","Our next question will come from James Friedman of Susquehanna. Your line is open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group, LLLP","Hi. Thank you for taking my question. Charlie, since it's spring, it's the season for this. I was wondering how you would characterize the general tone for new fees at this point. Should we expect more or less revenue growth coming from new fees this year than in prior years?","Charles W. Scharf","I didn't realize that spring was the period of time for new fees. I think I'll leave it at the revenue guidance overall that Byron gave, I think that's \u2013 for us to talk about in another level of detail of what we're forecasting for revenues would go beyond what is our practice and that's something that we wouldn't want to get into.","Byron H. Pollitt","I would just add to that. When we gave the original guidance that Charlie referred to at the beginning of the fiscal year, we said that it was that we would deliver our revenue the old fashion way through volume increases and that there would not be a material reliance on any sort of price -- pricing overall within the business plan for the year.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rod Bourgeois of Bernstein. Your line is open.","Rod Bourgeois - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.","Hey, great. So a two part question on the Chase VisaNet deal; can you just give us a sense of the reaction you\u2019re getting from other banks in the wake of that deal and also maybe the acquirer community how they\u2019re reacting. And if you see any major constraints on the ability of other particularly large banks to pursue a similar deal Chase VisaNet type deal? And then Byron maybe on the numbers, can you give us a sense on whether you expect to be revenue positive on the Chase deal over the next year after the -- clearly there\u2019s some discounting that\u2019s going on, on that contract. Will the volume gains from MasterCard at Chase offset the impact of the pricing discounts? Thanks.","Byron H. Pollitt","Let me start with the -- so why don\u2019t we start with the numbers. So the answer to the first part of the question was, do we expect to be volume accretive with the signing of this contract going into the \u2013 excuse me, revenue accretive going into the next year and the absolute \u2013 the question is absolutely yes, that when we factor in all the elements of the deal including those who reference we expect to have positive revenue growth with the Chase relationship in the coming year. And relative to the reaction of \u2013 from banks and acquirers to Chase, I mean I would honestly \u2013 I guess, I would say it was mixed initially and quite candidly it was probably confusing because there were not a lot of facts because there were terms disclosed at the point of a letter of intent not a final contract which is what we have signed now. So we have been able to have much more in depth conversations about what it is, similar to what we\u2019ve talked about here. And I think the conversation is very much at move to what is it, it's confusing, what does it mean and this is both on the bank side and the acquirer side to really what Visa do to help them customize and differentiate with their experience. So we\u2019re having that discussion, again from small institutions to much bigger institutions and acquirers alike and as I said, I think the overwriting concept here is; the world is changing around us. And there are lots of people that we compete with and people who want to compete with us that have strategies around working with merchants at point of sale and if we don\u2019t figure out how to evolve our model to encourage issuers and acquirers to do that then we\u2019ll be leaving great opportunity on the table and so we do have to be flexible on how we do it as long as we don\u2019t think that it violates any of the principles that I spoke about before and we feel very good that what we\u2019re doing actually does that.","Operator","Our next question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - J.P. Morgan","Thanks, good results. I\u2019ll ask a couple of the modeling nerd questions. Data processing fee that yield or revenue per trend, I jumped that quite a bit. The biggest we\u2019ve seen in a long time. What's driving that and I guess, going forward that will be impacted to some degree by the Chase deal and secondly the international transaction fee line looks like the revenue growth grew at a premium to cross-border volume for the first time over a couple of quarters, what's driving that as well? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf","So let me respond. So, on the data processing yield, as you all remember about a year ago as part of our Dodd-Frank debit mitigating strategy we restructured our pricing. We introduced a lower variable transaction fee. We introduced for the first time a fixed acquirer network fee. When we first introduced those in the way that we bill and record revenue we had to do that to a certain degree with some estimates, and since it was a new pricing structure. And as we conclude the March quarter, we pretty much got a year of this under our belt. And so we're now in a position where we can start to true up some of these estimates. And what you saw in the data processing yield line was some true-up there and a few credits. Going forward, I would say that the data processing yield is more likely to approximate what you saw in Q1 as opposed to Q2, still very solid but I think that's from a nerdy modeling standpoint; I think that's probably the guidance we were looking for. With regards to international, as we have talked about this particular line on several occasions before, there is always some degree of variability between volume and reported revenue. Part of it is revenue mix. Part of it is the amount of volatility we see in the currency markets. And in periods where there is a higher degree of volatility, often associated with saber rattling or conflicting claims on islands in the China Sea, anything \u2013 issues around Cypress, anything that royals the currency markets and creates more volatility, creates a bit more \u2013 has an impact on the revenue that we report. And so that was the case with international this past quarter. We had a step-up in currency volatility relative to what we've seen historically. And then we also had little bit of a tailwind with regards to the specific currency and their waiting during the quarter, some currencies just naturally yield more of a return across our fee base than others. So that's the reason.","Operator","Our next question will come from Bob Napoli of William Blair. Your line is open.","Robert Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C.","Thank you. Just two quick ones. What would be the strategy on funding the put if it were to be executed? And then secondly, I'd like a little update on CyberSource. It's been growing 25% for the last couple of years, it doesn't seem to be slowing and I just wondered if the revenue was growing in line with that? And what the operating profit margin is on that CyberSource business and any update on strategy would be helpful?","Charles W. Scharf","So let me take that. So in the event that we needed to consider funding for Visa Europe, let me just give you the following perspective. We currently \u2013 at the end of this quarter, we have roughly 2.2 billion of cash that is in offshore accounts not immediately required for working capital. That 2.2 would be available for use in a Visa Europe put situation. Once the put \u2013 if and when the put is exercised, we have 285 days to negotiate out and fund the transaction. During that period, we would generate in the normal course of business at least 3 billion of free cash flow. So before we ever get to debt, if any were to be required, recognizing we have no debt we've got 5 billion of cash readily available to deploy. And that's not to say that we would use all that cash because this might \u2013 again, if the put were to be exercised, this might be a good opportunity to actually put some debt on the balance sheet and lower our weighted average cost of capital. The second question was CyberSource. CyberSource was acquired, as you might remember, because it moved us closer to the merchant checkout page with regards to Internet transactions. The fastest growing channel we have today is Ecom and CyberSource gives us an additional value add in the transaction and a way of directly connecting to the acquirer to our network in a way that is very synergistic with the rest of our business. When we acquired CyberSource, it was primarily a U.S. business. The opportunity for us was outside the United States. And so we have invested aggressively inside resource to accelerate the expansion of that business outside the United States and as a result have been successful in sustaining its transaction growth rate at 20 plus percent ever since we acquired the business. And I can tell you that, that transaction growth rate is slightly above the pro forma projections that we presented to our board when we justified the purchase price. So we couldn\u2019t be more pleased with the role CyberSource is now playing in the Visa Inc global strategy as we zero in on capitalizing on the internet growth opportunity which is absolutely global in its scope.","Byron H. Pollitt","And I\u2019ll just add, as we -- all of our work that we\u2019ve got going on with merchants as I talked about, CyberSource and its capabilities are a tremendous advantage for us in those conversations.","Operator","Our next question will come from Julio Contreras of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Julio Contreras - Goldman Sachs","Hey guys not to beat a dead horse, but I guess I\u2019ll keep jumping on this Chase Merchant Services contract. Thinking through the reaction I guess, mostly as it relates to, kind of the independent or standalone merchant acquirers versus the bank owned merchant acquirers, how exactly would you distinguish the benefits to each one of these guys, especially if they don\u2019t actually issue their own cards?","Charles W. Scharf","Well, again I think, I guess the way we think about it is; what we\u2019re willing -- the importance of what we did with Chase is not specifically about the Chase structure. It's about what the intent we\u2019re trying to get at, which is to put issuers and acquirers together to work directly with merchants. So, to the extent that a bank owns an acquirer it obviously allows you to have that conversation under one roof, to the extent you have issuers who don\u2019t control their own acquirers hopefully now they\u2019re thinking about and that are in fact having conversations with acquirers about the types of things that they could do if they worked more closely together. The reality is, I think if you go around and talk to most issuers they would probably say that there wasn\u2019t a lot of conversation that went on between the issuing and acquiring side, and partially because of our rules that stood in the way of them working together to do something positive for the merchant. And so now that we\u2019ve given them the ability to do that, I don\u2019t -- it shouldn\u2019t -- you don\u2019t have to own your own acquirer in order to take advantage of the changes that we\u2019ve made. And I think quite frankly we\u2019ll see how it evolves. I think, going back to Rod\u2019s question earlier I mean, there are -- there\u2019s some people that look at this and say, okay, got it, understand it, but it don\u2019t believe it. I think it's too hard, I don\u2019t think it's going to be successful, I don\u2019t intend to change anything, and we\u2019ll wait and see. And if we get to a point of, hey there\u2019s something there then we\u2019ve got capabilities and we\u2019ll go forward with that. There are others that are more interested in thinking through how to take advantage of some of the things that we\u2019re willing to do. And I think honestly this will evolve over the next, it will take -- I am going to say a couple of years. It's not the type of thing that will be -- won't be very, very short. If they involved not just conversations between issuers and acquirers but you have to have conversations with merchants. They have to believe that there\u2019s a real value proposition there. They have got to do some thing different potentially in their stores with their customers, and that\u2019s not always the most obviously and easy conversation but again we think it's the right conversation to have, but it's a thesis that has to be proved.","Operator","Our next question is from Darrin Peller of Barclays. Your line is open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital Inc.","Thanks. Listen just to firstly clarify on the Chase deal timing again, and then a quick question on the stored wallet fee. So, first on Chase, did the deal economics actually show up at all on the quarter that was just reported, in terms of the incentives and the -- because you came in at 16% as a percentage of gross revenue, so it seems a little lower than the 18% plus. And then just a question on the stored wallet fee that MasterCard has announced, it seems like these are still not committed to doing that as far as at least we have seen. Can you just give us some idea and thought around that fee and really your interaction with for instance, PayPal and some of the ecommerce players that, that could affect?","Charles W. Scharf","Okay, let me take the first one. So, just to clarify the question, did \u2013 because the Chase deal was signed in April actually, it did not have any impact to the quarter just reported. So this is \u2013 it has a retroactive effect a little bit earlier, but that is all contemplated in the guidance that we gave for the balance of the year.","Charles W. Scharf","And on the staged wallet question, so first of all just on the actual staged wallet fee that MasterCard implemented, that's not something that we're currently contemplating but we're actively thinking through what has changed in the ecosystem and how we have to react to that. Our relationship with PayPal and people like them has evolved. It's complicated. They specifically are a very important customer of ours, but they have their own ambitions and we're mindful, I think, first and foremost of the impact that they have both positively and negatively potentially on our issuers because that ultimately will be what determines our success. And I think we are actively thinking about the right way to restructure the ecosystem in a way that works for everyone. And we've got nothing to announce now, but we will at some point.","Operator","Our next question will come from David Togut of Evercore Partners. Your line is open.","David Togut - Evercore Partners Inc.","Thank you. What is Visa's strategy to gain market share in the corporate card market versus MasterCard?","Charles W. Scharf","Byron, do you want to talk about\u2026","Byron H. Pollitt","So, in the commercial side this is \u2013 a lot of success in this marketplace is dependent on the sophistication of the platforms that you bring to bear to service corporate clients. It's a very information reporting intensive business. And we have made significant investments over the last several years in a platform we refer to as IntelliLink. We believe what we have today is a state-of-the-art and one that has been compared to where we were five years ago has been a game changer for us in terms of being much more successful in capturing commercial business, and it's largely driven by the investments in the sophistication of reporting multi-currency, multi-country and that's really the lead card we play.","Operator","Our next question will come from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.","Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research","Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my question. Just turning to U.S. credit, clearly you've had a great run recently; you've been posting above market growth. But what's important for us is to get a sense of how much longer this can continue. So on the vein, is it possible just roughly to parse your growth into maybe sources of three buckets like just having faster growing clients because of client-specific reasons, clients that are growing Visa volume faster because of the things you're doing with them. And then finally just share gains overall. And can you roughly bucket that for us? And then maybe sum it up with some texture of how much pent-up above market growth do you have in the backlog and the pipeline here to give us confidence that this can continue for several more quarters or even beyond that?","Charles W. Scharf","I guess I'll just start Byron and you can chime in. I mean, it's obviously \u2013 it's very hard right now to put things into the buckets numerically the way you spoke about. But I think when you look at our issuing base, we've certainly benefited from the partnerships that we have with the faster growing issuers out there. And you can say that that's luck on our part historically or it's that Visa targeted the right population of customers. And I think it stands for itself. Things don't happen by chance and we do have a very fast growing set of customers that we certainly benefit from. And the same thing is true relative to the co-brands that we have. Co-brands can put us just like anything else not all co-brands are equal, and we think we\u2019ve got the premier client base out there and we\u2019ve been clearly very big beneficiaries of that and would expect that to continue.","Charles W. Scharf","I will just add one other component to this, in addition to the quality and the growth delivered by the issuer that\u2019s also impacted by the quality of the card holder portfolio as measured by affluent income levels and we\u2019re very well positioned in the affluent portfolios and if you think about it, what has driven the credit card, payment volume, growth over the \u2013 certainly over the past two years has been predominantly affluent. And so being well positioned as the economy recovers this is an area where we\u2019re well positioned to sustain this kind of growth. It should be less volatile in that sense and so we certainly feel it has strong leg. Relative to the delta, that\u2019s a much harder one to frame.","Operator","Our next question will come from Brian King of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities","Yeah, hi guys. Just a couple of questions, I guess first on the EC enquiry, does that have any potential impact on Visa\u2019s fees or are we talking about Visa Europe fees and then on the Chase of Visa deal, I guess two questions one, are we talking about a material amount of volume that you guys expect the consumer credit and that I\u2019m just trying to get a sense if that\u2019s new cards just for new business or will that be some of the existing business. And then finally on the, I\u2019ve heard you say Charlie before that the Chase could have done this on-us transactions before so, then the question comes out, then why they\u2019re using Visa at all, and is Visa getting any money at all for allowing on-us transactions. Thanks so much.","Charles W. Scharf","Well, let\u2019s start there. What we said they could do historically was enter into pricing arrangements, directly with merchants relative to interchange. And again anyone can do that today, and that\u2019s not specific to on-us transactions. So, I am not sure then the rest of the question flow so if we didn\u2019t answer it, maybe come back and ask us the question again. But they and everyone else have the ability to go and negotiate interchange and they\u2019ve got the ability to do that in this agreement in a different format and different structure. On the size of the Chase commitment, again I think the best way to characterize that is what Byron said, which net-net all in all we think that we\u2019re still in a position to grow revenues and how we get there and what not is, not something that I think is appropriate for us to talk about. And back on the first piece, on the EC inquiry it is on interchange, and so that would be the direct impact of what it is they\u2019re looking at today.","Jack Carsky","At this point we have time for one more question operator.","Operator","Our next question will come from Moshe Katri of Cowen & Co. Your line is open.","Charles W. Scharf","Moshe.","Byron H. Pollitt","Moshe, are you there?","Operator","He disconnected. We can go on to a next question if you wish?","Charles W. Scharf","Okay, someone hit the lottery.","Operator","John Williams of UBS. Your line is open.","John Williams - UBS","Hey, you snuck me in. Thank you, guys. Thanks for taking my question.","Charles W. Scharf","Thank Moshe.","Byron H. Pollitt","Thank Moshe.","John Williams - UBS","I will. So I had a follow-up, I hate to beat the dead horse on Chase Merchant Services and forgive the basic nature of my question, but I think it's reasonable to say J.P. Morgan is not paying you guys very much in the way of assessment fees and so as you consider doing this deal, what was lacking in the relationship that made something of this magnitude necessary, I mean obviously you\u2019re locking up a large customer for a while but how does Visa actually benefit in an incremental way because it sounds like on one hand you might get more transactions but on the other hand the on-us transactions will stay on us. So if you could give a little more color on how you guys specifically benefit in incremental way that would be helpful. Thank you.","Charles W. Scharf","Yeah, I mean I\u2019ll give your point of view but again why, some of those questions I think are important for them. So specifically from our point of view, we don't believe that this structure was necessary to accomplish what the end goal is. The structure is something that we worked on together because it's something that was important to them, but that's \u2013 which is why we believe that this structure isn't specific to them that we could go accomplish the same thing by working with issuers and acquirers separately without this kind of structural transaction that occurred. The benefit in this, if we're successful at this is really related to the rule change that we made, which encourages and allows the issuers and acquirers to go talk to merchants directly and to ask the question what can we do for you or to propose an idea of we can do the following thing for you to help you drive more sales and drive more volume into your stores and in return for that presumably, there will be additional transactions that get directed to the Visa cards. Again, this structure we don't believe is necessary to do that, but it certainly allows that to happen and that's what was important to us.","Byron H. Pollitt","Let me just add on the economics, John, that this business has always been built on an economic business model that says the larger the clients, the larger the portfolio, the better pricing you get. And this was one of our largest clients, one of the largest portfolios. We had the opportunity to enter into a 10-year arrangement that has a set of economics that are consistent with how we have been doing multi-year contracts with other clients over the years, including Chase. And given the size of this portfolio and where we expected to be over the next five and 10 years, is there margin compression? Yes. But that margin compression is consistent and the same zip code is what we would normally have expected to have put on the table given the size of the portfolio and the kind of growth that we are expecting this partnership to produce. So from that standpoint, we are very comfortable with the economics of this deal.","Jack Carsky","With that, we want to thank you all for joining us once again. And just to reiterate what Charlie said earlier, we are hosting an Investor Day on June 6 here in San Francisco. Formal invites have been sent out, many people have responded. If you haven't and intend to do so, please do.

With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer.","This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.Visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today's call have been posted to our IR website.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren't guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available in our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the Investor Relations section of our website.","For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today's press release.","And with that, I'll turn the call over to Vasant.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Actually, Jack, it's Charlie. I'm going to start on the call.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","I'm sorry.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I appreciate it though. Good afternoon, everyone, thank you for joining us. There are a series of things that I'm going to cover before I do hand it over to Vasant. I'm going to talk a little bit about our second quarter results at a high level, make some comments about the press release we put out about Visa Europe [VE], some general business updates, and then some further comments on how we see the year playing out from here.","So first let me start with our overall results. We reported earnings per share of $0.71, but this includes a one-time gain on currency forward contracts used to mitigate some of the foreign exchange risk associated with the cash portion of the VE purchase. Vasant will cover that in a little bit more detail in his remarks.","If you exclude that gain, adjusted earnings per share of $0.68 grew 7% on a nominal basis and 12% on a constant dollar basis. If you remember, we raised $16 billion in long-term debt in December of last year in anticipation of the VE acquisition, and we absorbed $125 million in interest expense during this quarter, a $0.03 drag on our EPS growth for the quarter. This negatively impacted our EPS growth rate in the quarter by five points. After we close the VE transaction, we will obviously have VE operating income to offset this expense.","As we talk about the quarter, you're going to hear some themes which will sound very much the same as those we discussed on our last earnings call, reasonable underlying domestic growth offset by some headwinds. Our results adjusting for the leap year were very consistent with the prior quarter. And our growth continues to be subdued by the strength of the dollar on both translation and cross-border business volumes, continued low oil prices, and weakness in China, oil-based economies, and Brazil. But importantly, the U.S. consumer remains strong.","Operating revenue grew 6% nominally or 9% on a constant currency basis, reflecting a negative three percentage point impact from FX. Adjusting for the leap year, growth was basically the same as the prior quarter. Overall payments volume, cross-border volume growth, and processed transaction growth were consistent with last quarter excluding the one percentage point growth benefit from the leap year. Cross-border continues at extremely low levels.","Reported U.S. payments volume growth was 11%. International payments volume growth was 14%. Cross-border volume growth was 5%. Processed transactions grew 9%. And more recently, in April through the 14th, so recognize this is a short period of time, we're seeing similar trends, with U.S. payments volume growth at 10%, cross-border volume growth of 5%, and processed transactions growth of 8%. The bottom line is we continue to see reasonable growth rates but well below what we can produce in a more favorable macroeconomic environment.","We issued a press release today regarding the Visa Europe transaction. As we discussed the transaction with the European Commission, we received feedback from them regarding the earnout. Based on that feedback, we and Visa Europe have reached a preliminary agreement to eliminate the entire earnout. Instead of an earnout, we will pay an additional \u20ac750 million at closing and \u20ac1 billion plus 4% interest payable on the third anniversary of the closing, for a total consideration of \u20ac1.750 billion plus interest.","The transaction remains subject to negotiation of a definitive document and approval of the European Commission. It's possible that we could close the transaction towards the end of the quarter, but it could slip past the end of our third fiscal quarter. We think this is a good outcome for both parties.","We've had many months now to work with the VE team up close and feel terrific about our future together, and we obviously know more now than we knew when we first agreed to the deal. Transition planning is well underway, and we have great confidence in our ability to execute this well. Given the delay in closing, we won't be providing more detailed information on this call. The basic thesis still stands, low single-digit accretion in the first full year, growing to high single digits by 2020. These numbers exclude transition costs. Next quarter we will provide more detail on what to expect after we close.","A couple of words on China, there's no real update regarding the timing regarding of our ability to apply for a domestic license, but we have been making preparations to both make our application as well as be in a position to compete domestically. China continues to be a very important market us. We're committed to having a broader business in China that we will build over a long term, and we continue to invest locally in the country.","We announced several important partnerships this past quarter, which are great representations of our commitment to create local Chinese partnerships. First, we signed an MOU with China UnionPay, where we both agreed to collaborate on payment security, innovation, and financial inclusion. We're excited to work in partnership with CUP to lead the industry forward. The agreement provides an important platform for the two of us to work together to strengthen and create new value for the bankcard ecosystem, benefiting consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and technology partners.","We've also been active committing Visa resources to support the Chinese government's efforts to reduce poverty and promote inclusive finance. We announced a partnership with the China Foundation for Development of Financial Education and the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation to help support progress against these goals.","And at the end of March, we signed a cooperation plan with the China National Tourism Administration, establishing Visa as a strategic partner of the U.S. China Tourism Year. This collaboration between CNTA, the U.S. Department of Commerce, and Visa will result in a year-long series of events designed to enhance tourism, trade cooperation, and cultural understanding between China and the United States.","On to some updates on client activity; in the United States, the Navy Federal Credit Union, the world's largest credit union and one of our most important clients in the U.S., renewed a multiyear credit and debit agreement with Visa. We're very proud of our association with this great institution. Beginning June 20, Visa cards will be exclusively accepted at Costco U.S. and Puerto Rico warehouse locations and fuel stations. And we continue to expand our relationships with clients across the globe. Banco do Brasil, the oldest and largest bank in South America, renewed a multiyear credit agreement. And in India, SBI Card, the State Bank of India's credit card venture, renewed a multiyear credit card agreement as well.","We continue to be encouraged by the growth we see with Visa Checkout. We have nearly 12 million registered users in 16 countries and over 675 national institution partners participating globally. Later this year, Visa Checkout will be available to merchants and consumers in six additional markets, including France, India, Ireland, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. More than 250,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers, have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $113 billion in addressable volume. Visa Checkout customers are also more active online shoppers in general, completing 30% more transactions per person than the overall population of online shoppers.","In February, we launched Visa Developer Platform, an open platform that provides access to hundreds of Visa APIs and software department kits for some of Visa's most popular payment products and capabilities. It's still very early days, but we've had strong interest early on in the Visa Developer Platform, with thousands of new users building and testing new applications in our sandbox. We have a small number of clients in or near production launch on the platform, and we expect to see more soon.","Let me just give you a simple example of how the platform changes the way we work with our clients. Earlier this year, one of our largest clients outside the U.S. sent a small team to our office in San Francisco with an idea. They wanted to give their cardholders complete control over when and where their cards worked via their mobile app, the ability to turn their Visa card on or off for certain types of merchants or transactions. Working with our team and our new APIs, they designed, built, and launched a working prototype in three days and were ready to be in market in a few weeks. Before Visa Developer Platform, this would have taken months.","I'll move on and talk about EMV for a second. Six months out from the official kickoff to chip in the U.S., we continue on the journey of moving from mag stripe to chip. More than 265 million Visa chip cards were issued as of March of 2016, making the U.S. the largest chip card market in the world and larger than the UK and Brazil combined. 47% of credit cards and 30% of debit cards have a chip on them today. More than 1 million merchants now have chip-enabled terminals, or roughly 20% of all merchants. Based on client surveys, we expect 50% of merchant locations will be enabled with EMV by the end of calendar year 2016.","One of the main pain points in moving to chip is the additional time it takes to complete a transaction due to the time the card spends in the terminal. Earlier this week, Visa announced the launch of Quick Chip for EMV. The upgrade streamlines the processing of a chip card transaction to enable customers to dip and remove their EMV chip card from the terminal without waiting for the transaction to be finalized, allowing the consumer to put away their card in typically two seconds or less. The enhancement requires only a simple software update to the merchant's card terminal or point-of-sale system. Quick Chip is available free of charge to payment processors, acquiring banks, and other networks to offer to merchants. Several merchant processors and vendors plan to offer Quick Chip to their merchant clients in the coming months, including TSYS, Ingenico, Verifone, Equinox, and V2.","Before I turn the call back to Vasant, I want to say a few words about the back half of the year and our guidance. Vasant will walk through the specifics of the changes in our guidance, but a few quick comments. We've not seen improvement in the global economic environment. Relative strength of currency pairs is still unfavorable for us, and the price of oil has remained at low levels. As we discussed last quarter on our earnings call, our guidance assumed that these things would improve.","Since we're now in the third quarter, we're far less comfortable that volumes will meaningfully change, so we're officially reducing some pieces of our guidance, especially the third quarter. We could be wrong. We don't know what the global economy will look like beyond tomorrow. It could improve. And when things improve, we will be the beneficiaries. But as of today, with a few exceptions, our business volume growth is not accelerating or decelerating, but we're obviously still seeing meaningful growth.","We do know that there will be a turn at some point for the better. We just don't know when. So our mindset continues to be cautious in the short term due to the headwinds discussed earlier, but the long-term fundamentals of our business model remain strong, and our focus is on accelerating global electronic payments. Globally, an estimated 43% of all consumer payments today are still made with cash, which leaves us an enormous opportunity in addition to the growth that we see due to regular economic growth for PCE [Personal Consumption Expenditure]. Last week Visa published a white paper, located on our website, discussing the opportunities to accelerate the growth of global acceptance, and I encourage you to take a look at that paper. It's why we feel good about the work we've done. There's still great opportunity in front of us.","With that, I will turn it over to Vasant.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Charlie.","Much like our first fiscal quarter, the global macroeconomic environment remained uncertain, but our business performed well. A few points to highlight; first, net revenues grew 9% in constant dollars, with an expected three-point drag from the strong dollar. Nominal revenue grew 6%. The one-point step up in the growth rate relative to the first quarter was mostly due to the leap year effect.","Cross-border business was once again very weak but in line with the first quarter's growth rate. The deceleration of outbound commerce from China continues. Cross-border commerce out of commodity-based economies remained anemic. This has added to the negative effects of the strong dollar, especially on our large inbound U.S. business. However, currency volatilities were higher than the first quarter, offsetting some cross-border weakness.","Through the first six months, we managed our expense growth to 4% in nominal terms, well below the high single-digit rate we had planned in the first half. We have continued to hold the line on expenses while funding all our key growth initiatives, such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Developer Platform, and others.","During the quarter, we entered into currency forward contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk associated with the upfront cash payment for Visa Europe. As these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting, they are mark to market, with gains or losses recorded in non-operating income. We recorded a $160 million gain, which we have excluded from our reported EPS as a non-GAAP adjustment. These contracts are expiring in late April. When it became apparent that the Visa Europe transaction would not close before then, we entered into fully offsetting contracts at the end of March, locking in this gain. Coincidentally, this gain is almost equal to our interest expense in the quarter.","Lastly, we repurchased 24.2 million shares during the quarter at an average price of $72.23 per share, for a total of $1.8 billion. Year to date, we have bought back 49.9 million shares at an average price of $75.47, for $3.8 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had remaining stock buyback authorization of $4 billion.","Now a quick review of the quarter's business drivers; note that all growth rates are about a point higher due to the leap year effect. Global payments volume in constant dollars grew 12%. Despite considerable uncertainty and turbulence in the global economy, payments volume growth globally has been remarkably stable. U.S. payments volume grew 11%, with both credit and debit growing at the same rate. Accounting for conversions and the leap day, U.S. payments volume growth was slightly lower than the first quarter.","International payments volume grew 14% in constant dollars, consistent with the last quarter. Once again, the impact of the strong dollar reduced nominal growth in international payments volume to a paltry 4%.","Cross-border volumes grew 5% in constant dollars and were flat in nominal dollars. When you factor in the leap year, the trend was unchanged from the first quarter. Cross-border growth rates in constant dollars have decelerated from 9% in fiscal year 2014 to 17% last year, down to 4% so far this year. As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the first leg down was driven by the strong dollar. And then starting in September last year, growth decelerated sharply due to China and the commodity price collapse.","Cross-border commerce outbound from China has dropped from growth rates above 40% a year ago to single-digit levels in the second quarter. Commodity-based economies across Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa have also experienced sharp declines. This has hit our large U.S. cross-border acquiring business hard. Commerce into Europe has been strong, though we do not benefit fully from it yet. More recently, we have seen commerce outbound from Europe into the U.S. pick up.","Processed transactions totaled $18.5 billion in the quarter, up 9%. Both U.S. and international growth at 12% and 1% respectively were stable. Processed transaction growth rates will step up in the back half of the year as we begin to lap last year's transfer of domestic processing in Russia to NSPK.","Service revenues grew 8%, in excess of nominal payments volume growth of 5%. The pricing we took last year contributed three points to the growth rate. Next quarter we will lap the price increases, and this three-point tailwind will no longer help us. Data processing revenue grew 10%, in line with processed transactions.","International revenues grew 8%. Constant dollar cross-border volume growth of 5% was almost entirely offset by the currency translation drag. The year-over-year increase was largely driven by the pricing actions from last year. Currency volatilities were high in the quarter but only contributed modestly to growth, as we are now beginning to lap high volatilities from last year. Next quarter our reported international revenue growth rate will no longer benefit from the price increases. And as I mentioned, currency volatilities were unusually high in the second half of 2015. As such, going forward, reported international revenue growth will depend on the interplay between volume growth and the currency translation drag.","Other revenues were down 3%, primarily as a result of lower license fees generated outside the U.S. due to slowing payments volumes. Incentives were generally in line with our expectations, at the midpoint of our guidance range. Higher U.S. incentives due to acceleration of deals into the quarter were offset by lower incentives outside the U.S. due to lower volumes.","With expense growth in the mid-single digits, a tax rate of 30.1%, EPS of $0.68 after adjusting for the gain from our currency forward contracts, grew by 12% in constant dollars, and by a healthy 17% when you account for the interest on the debt we issued to finance the Visa Europe acquisition.","With that, let me turn to our outlook for the fiscal third quarter and the balance of the year, which excludes the impact from Visa Europe. We now expect net revenue growth in fiscal 2016 to come in at 7% to 8% in constant dollars, a couple of points below our expectations from last October. This is driven by three factors: first, no improvement in cross-border volume growth from current levels; second, somewhat weaker domestic payment volumes due to gas prices as well as weakness in large commodity-based economies like Brazil; third, client incentives likely to come in at the high end of our 17.5% to 18.5% range.","In October last year, as we told you on our call, we had hoped that cross-border trends would improve as we lapped the weakening of the dollar in the second half of fiscal 2015. However, cross-border growth dropped from the 8% range to the 4% range in the past six to nine months, as outbound commerce from China and commodity economies slowed sharply. This trend continues. As such, we are assuming little improvement in the cross-border growth rate in the second half. Recent weakness in the dollar should help over time, but it is too early to tell.","We have now lapped the sharp gas declines from last year. Last October, we had hoped that this would provide a tailwind for U.S. domestic volumes in the second half of fiscal 2016. This has not happened, as gas prices remain below the lows of last year. Given the recent failure of OPEC to agree on production caps, lower gas prices could persist. As such, we are assuming that U.S. payment volume growth will not improve from current trends in the second half. In addition, payments volumes remain soft in large commodity economies like Brazil and the Middle East.","Client incentives are projected to come in at the high end of our guidance range. In the first half, client incentives were around 18% of gross revenue. In the second half, we are likely to run at around 19%. Significant renewals and conversions are driving this trend, particularly in the U.S. Costco and USAA add more than 50 basis points to incentives as a percent of gross revenues in the second half.","A few other factors to highlight, these are not new but will impact reported revenue growth numbers in the second half. As I mentioned earlier, we will no longer benefit from the uplift in our growth rate we got from the price increases last year. We will lap the currency volatility peaks of the second half of 2015. There have been some delays in the rollout of USAA and Costco conversions. Given the quarter lag in recording service revenues, these Costco and USAA conversions are a drag on net revenues in the second half of 2016. In other words, incentive expense exceeded revenue recognized. This will of course not be the case in fiscal 2017. On the positive front, if the recent weakness in the dollar continues, the currency translation drag of three points could moderate.","Given softer than expected revenues, we will continue to hold the line on expenses, funding key strategic and growth programs while maintaining or reducing costs in other areas. As we had indicated previously, expense growth will be lower in the second half relative to the first half rate.","We expect a modestly lower tax rate of about 30% versus the low 30%, which will also help mitigate impact on net income.","As you look at the fiscal third quarter, net revenue growth in nominal terms could come in as low as 2% to 3%. In addition to the factors I just mentioned, we will lap an unusually low quarter for incentives in Q3 last year. Incentives were 16% of gross revenues due to deal delays versus an anticipated 19% this year. As we have told you before, incentive shifts from quarter to quarter can impact year-over-year comparisons. Nominal net revenue growth should revert back to the first half growth rate in Q4.","With a lower revenue growth range and including interest expense from the $16 billion in debt we issued last December, we now expect constant currency EPS growth in the low double digits. Interest expense will cost us over $0.09 this year, or almost four points of EPS growth. If you account for the interest expense, it puts constant currency EPS growth at the low end of the mid-teens range. The currency translation drag is approximately four points.","In terms of the impact of Visa Europe, for modeling purposes, we think it is best to assume the transaction does not close in our fiscal third quarter. As such, we will have interest expense in the third quarter but no operating income from Visa Europe to offset it. Should we close on the acquisition sooner, we will of course break out the impact. If Visa Europe is in our numbers for the full fourth quarter, in rough terms it will offset interest cost in the quarter. There will of course be a variety of non-recurring transaction related costs, which will also break out. We hope to give you a more precise perspective when we talk again in July.","As we look ahead to 2017, we remain optimistic that revenue growth rates will step up from current levels. We will begin to see the impact of Costco and USAA conversions kick in, and hopefully we will see some recovery in the cross-border business and gas prices, helped by a weakening dollar. Nominal dollar growth could also pick up as the dollar drag abates. Visa Europe will provide additional ballast, driving EPS growth back to levels you expect us to deliver.","With that, I'll turn this back to Jack.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Vasant. I got it right that time. Sam, at this point we are ready to start taking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. So it sounds, Vasant, like you're saying that the revenue weakness comes from the rebound that you were hoping for not really happening. I'm wondering. Can you talk a little bit? You mentioned the tax rate, but it seems like even including the interest expense that the impact on net income is actually fairly nominal. Are there other things going on, and can you talk a little bit about what you're doing to preserve or protect net income?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","As we've been doing most of this year, we are holding the line on expenses. I think when we talked to you last October, we had indicated that the expense growth would run I think in the high single digits in the first half and then moderate in the second half. It has, as you can see, run below that in the first half, and we said that the rate will be even lower in the second half. So clearly we are trying to mitigate some of the revenue softness with expense management. And then the tax rate is modestly lower than we might have expected last year. So those two things are mitigating the impact on EPS, but not completely. But other than that, really, those are the main pluses and minuses. I don't know, Charlie, if there's anything you would add.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question.","Operator","Yes, our next question is from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Hey, thanks, guys, just two quick ones related to Europe. First, any other regulatory impediments that you anticipate now that you took care of the earnout? And how much would you expect Visa Europe to drive acceleration in the cross-border volume given all the intra-European travel? I think you had given some pro forma data on that couple years ago. So I don't know if the relative figures would have changed, but any thoughts there?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I guess I'll take the first one. So we have to obviously go back and get approval for this transaction. But as I had said in my remarks, we have gotten feedback. It's specifically related to the earnout. And so what we've crafted eliminates the earnout in its entirety. So as with all regulatory approvals, we need to go through the process, but we would not have struck a deal that we didn't think could be approved.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On the cross-border question, if you go back three or four quarters and look at cross-border inbound\/outbound, one of the strongest markets for inbound travel and inbound commerce has been Europe. So had we had Europe in our numbers, clearly our cross-border numbers would have looked better. What's it going to be like next year? Of course, that's a different issue, and we'll talk about it in the next few quarters as we discuss Europe. But yes, cross-border inbound into Europe has been a strong business.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. I just want to make sure there's no other contingencies outside of the EC approvals, is there, to close this deal. And then just secondly, understanding it's a competitive market today, is there any concern that the removal of the earnout loosens the ties that the banks might have in the future with Visa Inc.? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So listen, on the second one, I think as I said in my remarks, we've had a fair amount of time to work with the Visa Europe team to understand their relationships with their clients. And I would just say that we would not have agreed to a deal that we didn't think was an appropriate price to pay relative to the value that we were getting. Our view is when you actually look at what the earnout was versus where we are today, we're confident in the value that we'll be getting and we will get the appropriate returns.","And on the first question of regulatory approval, there were three that we initially needed to approve, Turkey, Jersey, and the European Commission. And we will revisit the first two to ensure, and we will go through the process with the European Commission.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from James Schneider with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. As you think about the Visa Europe integration process, can you maybe give us an update on the process you're going to go through in terms of identifying synergies? And can you maybe talk about any synergies that you might look for in Visa Inc. in addition to those in Visa Europe?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, let me start and then Vasant can chime in. The work that we've had underway, and keep in mind, just to be perfectly clear, as we have done our work since the announcement of the initial transaction, all the work that we've been doing is just pure planning. They continue to run their business. We continue to run our business. But we've been working very closely together to understand what the best way to organize and run the company is on a going-forward basis.","So we've gotten to the point where we have pretty clear plans area by area across the company of what the expense base of an integrated company would look like, what timeframes would look like to get there. We have some more process to go through and we've got some specific processes we've got to go through within Europe to ensure that we do this properly. But when we first announced the transaction, we had done the work with some information but not the kind of information that we have had access to since the transaction was announced.","So as I said, we feel very comfortable that we have a better understanding of what those expense synergies will look like and over what time we will get them in addition to having a deeper understanding of what it will take operationally, and feel very good about our ability to get it done.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think everything we told you then as to what we can do we feel very good about, have much clearer line of sight on precisely how we would do it and over what timeframe. And then to answer the other question you asked, would we look at costs comprehensively and say what is the opportunity when you combine the two both within Visa Inc. and Visa Europe? Yes, we would absolutely do it that way across the functions.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and so just to be very specific, there are some things where we look at what's being done in Europe, and we asked the question. Are they doing it better and more efficiently than we're doing it elsewhere in the Visa Inc. franchise? And if that's the case, which it is in some cases, that could survive and we'll get the synergies within VI.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's right.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thank you; next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah, hi, guys. Just wanted to make sure. Last quarter you guys warned that if there wasn't a pickup on the economy front, we're likely to see potentially changing guidance, so not a real surprise here. But what I want to make sure is, is this all cyclical, or is there any share loss that you're seeing that's causing the change in guidance?","And then secondly, we picked up some news that you guys could be increasing your U.S. acquirer fee on Signature Debit on July 1, 2016. Just want to see if that has any impact on the model and if that's correct. Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","So let me do the first one first. So to answer the question, everything that we're seeing and everything that we've talked about we absolutely believe is cyclical. It doesn't relate to share in any way, shape, or form and we feel very good about the maintenance of the share that we have across the world.","And you're right, I'm glad you pointed it out because we tried to be as transparent as we could on last quarter's earnings call, where we said listen, it's the first quarter. It's very early. We don't know what volumes will be two, three quarters out from now. But our assumptions are that in order to make those guidance numbers, there needs to be an improvement. And things haven't deteriorated, but things haven't improved, so that's playing out exactly \u2013 not the way we would want, but given what's happened, the way we would expect. And so obviously, if things got better, then that would change as well. But we just don't see that. And so it's not something at this point, given that we're already in the third quarter, we think is prudent to think about.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And in terms of the U.S. acquired debit price increase of two basis points, yes, we have informed people about it. They will begin to see the increase in July. But as you know, we record these things on a quarter lag, so there's no benefit from the price increase in this year's revenues.","Also, just so that you're clear on it, this is not in any order of magnitude terms anywhere close to the price increase we took last fiscal year, so the impacts are more modest. It's clearly helpful, and of course we provide some level of remediation in the early months. So you should make sure that some of that is factored in as you think about all this.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Bryan; next question?","Operator","Our next question is from Darrin Peller with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks. So I just want to clarify. It sounds like despite the run rate for the first half of about 8.5% constant currency, the low growth in the third quarter is the timing of incentives, and it sounds like a little bit of a delay in timing on Costco\/USAA. Can you just \u2013 any reason for the slower implementation of those, and is the timing for those deals now around the fiscal fourth quarter or early next year?","And then just a quick follow-up on the incentive size. I guess when we go forward, had those been in line with the timing of incentives in the third quarter, would your incentive run rate still be in the midpoint of the range? Is that really what we should expect going forward? Thanks, guys.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the first one, it's hard to pinpoint it. And the implementation of the Costco arrangement is in a lot of respects out of our hands. Remember, they had an agreement that they had to unwind. There's a lot of work that Citi, the issuer, and Costco are working as well as us. And so given the complexity of unwinding an old agreement and moving forward on a new agreement is just complex. And in USAA's business, there's nothing specific other than I think it's them just wanting to do it in a timeframe which brings about the least amount of potential issues for their members, which we respect.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And on the level of incentives then, we are in the range we told you coming into the year. We are at the high end of the range. And the reason for that is we've had a significant number of renewals around the world and in the U.S. And of course, we've had a couple of big conversions. That's all in our view good news in that we are renewing important contracts and we have some significant new business. As I mentioned in the comments, the benefits from the conversions for sure are not showing up this year and will show up next year. But some of these, as we've told you before, there are timing moves from one quarter to another. And there's no question that the incentives are running at the higher end of the range because these renewals have mostly all now fallen into place.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Darrin; next question, please?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I would just say listen, I think to that point, and the reality is these are important renewals. These are very big clients and the new wins we've talked extensively about. And so when we talk about it in terms of how it impacts the numbers, if you just step back for a second and to the question earlier about share, we feel really, really good about what our client franchise looks like for sure across the globe.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, please?","Operator","The next question is from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi, thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it. Charlie, I wonder if you could maybe opine a little bit on mobile payments adoption, mobile wallet adoption in particular. It seems like some of the big banks indicated recently that it remains quite low and maybe a little disappointing. Are there any implications longer term for Visa's volume around mobile one way or the other? And how do you think about initiatives that Visa might undertake to accelerate mobile adoption which might benefit the secular shift?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I think it's interesting. I think we are doing as much as we can as an entity to insert ourselves in a way which benefits all of our clients and their clients into helping digitize payments in all forms of commerce, and that's how we think about it. We don't necessarily think about that we want to drive business from cards to e-com, to m-com, or anything like that. Anyone who tries to drive something towards what they think is good for them generally hasn't been particularly successful. And so what we want to ensure is that we continue to have the best solutions to pay in the physical world, that we've got the best solutions to pay in the e-com world, and the best solutions to pay in the m-commerce world.","And so if you look at the things that we've done all across that spectrum, whether it's the things that you see, such as Visa Checkout, some of the things that we've done with third-party players, whether it's Google, Samsung, or Apple, or whether it's things that you don't necessarily see, like tokenization, these are all aimed at ensuring that we are a preferred payment option in all of those different mediums. And quite frankly, the consumers and the merchants are going to be the ones to drive the adoption of these different forms of payment.","And so we're there to support them. We're there to be their partner. We're there to provide options. So the work we did on tokenization enables a lot of the things that you're seeing out there, but we don't prefer one versus the other. We just have to ensure that we're doing everything we can to be inserted into all forms of commerce in a way which is friendly for our issuers and acquirers.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Andrew; next question, Sam.","Operator","Our next question is from Matthew Howlett with UBS. Your line is now open.","Matthew P. Howlett - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, guys. Just as a follow-up on the cross-border, what is a normalized run rate? Maybe first start off with what you're seeing in terms of what corridor is it. It looks like the Asian region is coming in a little bit slower. Then, what do we expect is a normalized run rate and what should we expect long term?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","If you go back in time, as you know, double-digit run rates were very common. And then starting about eight quarters ago, you started to see some slowdown, mostly with the strong dollar. And that dropped the run rate down to the single digits, and it ran at about 8% \u2013 9% in constant dollar terms for a while. And then in October or so last year, we saw that sharp decline to 4%, and it stayed there. The biggest drivers are significant declines coming out of China, and that has not changed. In other words, the second derivative on that is still negative. It is continuing to decelerate, though still positive.","Canada, a major source of business for us in the U.S., has been declining for several years now. It has gone from a growth rate to meaningful negative levels. Then we saw a significant change in trend in the past few months coming out of all of the commodity economies, whether those are the African economies or the Middle East, big declines in those areas. And then layered on top of that are specific large economies like Brazil, which for a while which was a major source of outbound business to the U.S. and elsewhere; and other economies, like Russia, which you saw really slow \u2013 go down significantly last year.","So you've got three things going on at the same time, which may not happen often. One is a strong dollar, which hurts the largest part of our cross-border business, which is the acquired business into the U.S. Second is a significant growth engine called China slowing down. And third is large chunks of the global economy having trouble, like Brazil, like Russia, for a variety of different reasons. So you've got all three things happening at the same time right now.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","And just in terms of how it plays out mathematically is \u2013 remember, to the extent that the dollar strengthens, we start to see less spending as goods are no longer as attractive to buy on a cross-border basis. And so you're going from growth to shrinkage, and so on a percentage change basis it's significant. So the first effect will be at some point these things get lapped, assuming that it doesn't continue to get worse, and normal business grows at a reasonable level. And then if there is any kind of weakening of the dollar, then you start to see the spending patterns shift back to what they were, and that changes the growth dynamic significantly.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Sam.","Operator","Yes, our next question is from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna Financial. Your line is now open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi, thanks. It's Jamie at Susquehanna. I was just wondering, Charlie. Do you have any update on your conversations, negotiations with the aggregators that you had shared some perspective on last quarter? Thank you.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I don't, I don't. I think what I said is what I and we continue to feel. And if there's anything more to talk about, we'll let you know.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Sam.","Operator","Yes, our next question is from Lisa Ellis with Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, Charlie. Can you give an update, a little more color on Visa Checkout? How many of your large issuers do you have now auto-enrolling in Visa Checkout, and are you seeing a notable uptick in adoption as a result of that? And then similarly on the acquirer side, do you have any acquirer partners that are actively now helping you promote Visa Checkout with the merchants? Like at some point here, should we be seeing more of a steep acceleration in adoption?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Listen, I think to the last question first, I think it's \u2013 we don't \u2013 when we think about what the adoption curves look like, we're not looking for anything that looks exponential necessarily at this point. In fact, what we want to see is we want to ensure that there is continued growth on both sides of the equation, so not just the increase in the user base, but the increase in the merchant locations as well. And anytime those \u2013 if those growth rates get way out of line, then we live somewhat in fear of one side of the network getting ahead of the other.","So we have Bank of America who is very actively promoting Visa Checkout. That has just begun. So it's hard to draw any conclusions to what it means, but we love what they're doing. It is very simple. It's very creative, and we're excited about it. Beyond that, we're very focused on growing the merchant side. And the reality of the merchant side, Lisa, is it really is \u2013 it's merchant by merchant.","And so we can certainly \u2013 we've done everything that we can to make it a simple integration for merchants. But the conversation really is, it's not even necessarily \u2013 it's not the typical conversation that either we or an acquirer have with a merchant where we're talking about acceptance or we're talking about an assistant treasurer. The conversations with Visa Checkout are much more about the marketing areas. And so that is where we are focused on is getting the conversation to a different level with merchants, and we're focused on the top merchants, not necessarily the number of merchants or the size of merchants.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Lisa; next question, please?","Operator","Yes, our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thanks. Good afternoon, just a couple questions. The Costco card has pretty attractive rewards. I'm curious. Does that change the incentive equation for Visa in any way, meaning your role in funding those rewards?","And I want to ask a Visa Europe question just as part of the new deal giving up the earnouts. Do you get to then extend contracts with the major issuers from Visa Europe? I was just curious what the give-and-take is beyond what you discussed. Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. The first question was...","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Are we doing anything different with Costco because the rewards are better?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, no. Our deal with Costco is our deal with Costco, and their deal with Citi is their deal with Citi. And so we love the product that's out there. And even more broadly, we love Visa acceptance at Costco for all of our issuers.","And on the second item, the answer is no, there's nothing special that goes along with contract renewals or anything like that relative to the additional amount that we're paying. But I think \u2013 I guess the way I would think about this is we certainly when we entered into the earnout, wind up with a point of view of what we think we could pay based upon the results could pan out. And as I said earlier, we've had the opportunity to be able to have a deeper level of understanding of what that could actually be, as well as to have an understanding of what the relationships between Visa Europe and its client base are. And so I just don't know how to say it other than I think we feel very good about the deals that we've struck, just as I'm sure their members feel very good on a risk-adjusted basis they're getting more guaranteed of cash, and so these two things meet at a place where you get a transaction done.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and everything we've seen and heard indicates that the current members and the current big issuers and customers of Visa Europe actually see Visa Europe as being part of Visa Inc. and one Visa as a big plus. Makes Visa Europe much more attractive from their standpoint with all the capabilities that we are bringing. And in any case, we had always assumed that we were going to work with every one of these issuers to move the relationship from a member relationship to a commercial relationship. And those conversations will clearly be the important things we do with them as soon as we're able to.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","I guess I would just pile on a little bit and say, if there's a belief that banks have continued to do business with Visa Europe solely because of its ownership structure, that's a very risky thought process to go down.","As we all know, the payments business is extraordinarily important for financial institutions. And as we pointed out on these calls many times, these are financial decisions about the network that they're choosing, but they're also far greater strategic alliances that they're thinking through. And what we bring is just a tremendous amount more to the banks in terms of capabilities. So the relationships that Visa Europe has are very, very strong, and what we have is additive to that. So we feel very, very good about our ability to compete in an open marketplace with others for the banks' business.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Tien-tsin; next question, Sam?","Operator","Our next question is from Bob Napoli with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Robert Napoli - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you. Vasant, you had mentioned I think just on the Costco incentives and the high end of the range for client incentives for the back half of this year. As we think about 2017, I think you said that we would expect Visa to deliver earnings like investors are accustomed to. And I was wanting for some color on that.","And then is the Costco and USAA, are there portions of the fees that are one-time very large fees such that we shouldn't expect the high end of the range longer, that type of a range longer term, or should we think of the higher incentive range longer-term?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","There were several questions there. Hopefully, I remember them all. In terms of the Costco business, all I was saying was that it wouldn't have an impact on 2017. I'm forgetting all the questions. There were several questions there. Jack, can you help me?","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","The first piece was what are the returns or earnings you would expect.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Oh, right, you made some reference to earnings. I just want to make sure that we were just making sure people understood that this year we had two big things going on that hopefully we won't have to deal with next year. One is we have this interest expense, which clearly did not have offsetting operating income in the timeframe that we expected, and that was a meaningful drag on our earnings this year. And clearly, once the Visa Europe deal closes, we will have the offset. That was the intent of the debt issuance. So that was clearly almost a full point of drag on growth, and we just want to make sure people were aware of that.","Second, we have seen the headwinds that we talked about coming into the year. We are hopeful that they will moderate as we go into next year.","And then third, the conversions that we believe will add some additional ballast, so to speak, to revenues really aren't helping us, in fact, are a drag this year because of this lag issue. So all I was doing was pointing to those things. We'll talk about it next year at the appropriate time and give you our best sense for next year. I think we were just highlighting some of the elements of this year that were fairly unique.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Thanks, Bob; next question, please?","Operator","Our next question is from Chris Donat with Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Christopher R. Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I'm curious. With the software solution you've announced for EMV chips in the United States, do you have an opportunity to roll out the same software solution across the other markets that already have EMV? And would you do this for free or would you charge for it? Is there some potential revenue upside associated with it?","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. First of all, on the second one, this isn't about revenue at all. This is about just improving the customer experience.","And remember, around the rest of the world, I'd say two things. EMV is working; it's well accepted. And so we're addressing a very specific concern here as we go through this transition. And then the second thing is, in some of the major markets across the world, there's a very high degree of contactless \u2013 that's a card with a chip in it that can be used on a contactless basis, which are very, very fast transactions. And so we continue to promote that as well, and we don't have the issue outside the U.S. that we have in the U.S. as we go through this transition.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Next question, Sam?","Operator","Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, Charlie, so you've won two sizable deals with USAA and Costco. I was just curious if there are any other large portfolios or conversions out there that you're looking at.","And then secondarily, it sounds like you're a little upbeat on the U.S. consumer, but the volumes did slow a little bit. Wanted to get your sense there.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, so let me on the first one, and I talked about this a little bit. I think when it comes to our position, especially in the U.S., where certainly a lot of these big co-brands are, we love the position that we have. We aren't looking to gain share by being very, very active at targeting or anything like that. Costco is very unique. That was Costco looking, initially thinking about whether or not they wanted to change their issuer and their network. And I've spoken about USAA about how that actually came about. So what we're most focused on in the U.S. is continuing to do a great job and retain the great business that we have on the issuing program side.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And on the second part of your question around the U.S. consumer, I think it's important to point out that, I think to perhaps to everybody's surprise, gas prices today are actually lower than the lows reached last year. And in the second quarter, the gas drag was almost as bad as it was last year. It was at least a point on growth in the second quarter. And if it stays at these levels, gas is still a drag on U.S. payment volumes, almost not as bad as last year but quite high. So that's another thing that I guess most people might have expected coming in that you would get to see some kind of a tailwind. It isn't there, but it's anybody's guess though where gas prices go.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, but I think when you look at relatively stable growth in the U.S. consumer spend plus you talk to the banks about increased savings rates, you just draw the conclusion that the U.S. consumer is in very, very good shape. We can debate about the reasons why spend isn't accelerating, but it certainly I would say feels better than some of the stuff that we've heard. And the fact that savings increased at the right point when there's confidence, we feel pretty good that spend will move to higher levels. So if that happens, if the dollar versus currencies changes and all of a sudden our big cross-border business changes, these are things \u2013 back to one of the original questions, these are cyclical things that are out of our control.","So when we look at underlying numbers of transactions and we look at how we're doing on share, the numbers are still very, very strong, and that's what's going to drive the business in the long term once we move in and out of these different cyclical trends that we have.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And just one other thing to add, as Charlie said, the underlying transactional trends are very good. And on the margin, even setting aside gas, a stronger dollar is mildly deflationary, as you know, which plays through into payment volumes.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","Sam, with that, we have time for one last question.","Operator","And our last question is from George Mihalos with Cowen. Your line is now open.","George Mihalos - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great, thanks for squeezing me in, guys. I guess I'll ask a mobile payments question. And that would be, Charlie, any updated thoughts on the potential longer term to monetize tokenization and maybe bring us up to speed with conversations you're having with issuers about them running their own token vaults? We would appreciate any color there.","Charles W. Scharf - Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, we've been very, very consistent that we're not looking to monetize tokenization. Tokenization is a great enabler of different experiences that are out there. We think we're a logical place for the tokenization to take place, but we don't have to be the only place that tokenization is done. So there are some that would like to do more work themselves, create the infrastructure to do that. And we're working with people to ensure that people have that ability. But like most things, we have to compete because we are the right place with the right set of capabilities in a way that they trust more so than other places. And so for us, it's a service, it's an enabler, but not something that we're looking to charge for.","Jack Carsky - Global Head of Investor Relations","And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining today. If you have any follow-up calls, feel free to give Victoria [Hyde-Dunn] or myself a call.","Charles W.

And as always, thank you for joining us today. ","Visa delivered another quarter of strong financial performance, posting net operating revenues of $2.6 billion, a 15% increase over the same period last year. These revenue gains were driven by double-digit payment volume growth globally, continued outperformance of credit spend worldwide and a strong cross-border activity. ","Adjusted net income for the quarter was $1.1 billion, a 23% increase over the same period last year. This equates to adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.60, a 30% increase over the second fiscal quarter of 2011. ","Our performance reaffirms Visa's solid business foundation and strategy, including our diversified product and service offerings, our strong client relationships and our commitment to accelerating growth in key markets worldwide. ","With 2 strong quarters under our belt and insight into our fiscal third quarter service revenues, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. ","Visa's global business continues to expand at a healthy pace. A strong March quarter followed the solid results we posted in our first quarter and will drive service revenues in the current June quarter. During the March quarter, Visa's credit and debit payment volumes worldwide grew 14% and 7%, respectively. Cross-border volume also posted healthy gains, increasing 16% globally. Processed transactions grew 8%. ","In the U.S., payment volumes increased 6% for all products. Our star performer for fiscal second quarter was credit. Building on that, we continue to invest in new and expanded long-term credit relationships with our largest U.S. clients to drive growth in our core business. In fact, of the largest U.S. issuers that consider multiyear partnership agreements, we now have 9 of the top 10 signed into fiscal 2015 and beyond. From a volume perspective, that equates to more than 3\/4 of our U.S. credit volume secured into 2015 and beyond. During the March quarter, we also continued to have success, winning important new credit business from multiple U.S. issuers. ","On the co-brand front, I'm pleased that Visa has finalized a multiyear extension of our successful credit co-branded partnership with Alaska Airlines, a portfolio that benefits from a large number of affluent cardholders and a high cross-border usage. Additionally, we are now seeing early results of our previously announced contract with United Airlines. As a reminder, the recent merger of United and Continental Airlines resulted in the consolidation of their credit card portfolios under MileagePlus, and the combined entity has chosen Visa as the exclusive brand for newly issued MileagePlus cards. ","As for acceptance, we are expanding our popular Visa Easy Payment Service, our no-signature-required program in the United States for selected merchant categories. Under our current program, which is available to the majority of merchant categories in the U.S., merchants have the option to complete purchases up to $25 without requiring a cardholder's signature or a PIN. Building on the success of that program, we see an opportunity to help our merchant and financial institution partners better serve their customers, reduce their costs and grow their businesses. That's why beginning in October 2012, we are raising the limit to $50 for discount stores and supermarkets with the intent of expanding this service to additional merchant categories over time. ","Now let's turn our attention to Visa's Debit business in the U.S. where the new regulations are now in full effect. After more than a year of thoughtful planning, we have moved beyond the April 1 full compliance deadline. The next several months will be dynamic and highly competitive, but I'm confident with our position and comprehensive strategies. ","So far, the situation is playing out as we expected, and in line with our updated guidance for fiscal 2012 as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013. During the March quarter, U.S. aggregate debit payment volumes slowed to 2% growth and, as expected, has continued to decline in April. Interlink is bearing the brunt of the regulatory impact. ","To really understand what's happening in our Debit business, it's critical to look at our 2 products, Visa Debit and Interlink, independently. Visa Debit, also known as Visa check cards, saw a modest, albeit slowing, payment volume growth during the March quarter. This slowdown resulted largely from U.S. issuers deemphasizing debit reward programs in their own marketing activities. ","Turning to Interlink. We posted negative payment volume growth in each month of the March quarter. More recently, between the compliance deadline of April 1 and April 28, Interlink payment volume has experienced notable deterioration. Keep in mind, though, that in the March quarter, Interlink contributed less than 10% of U.S. debit revenue and about 2% of Visa Inc.'s overall revenue and was our lowest yielding product in the U.S. market. We believe we will experience the greatest impact to U.S. debit payment volumes and recalibration of market share during our fiscal third quarter. ","Looking ahead, as our revised debit strategies steadily gain traction, we expect to see improving trajectory in our fiscal 2012 fourth quarter. ","For one, the new regulations provided us with an opportunity to add Interlink to existing cards that currently carry our competitor's brand. More importantly, our comprehensive, integrated debit strategy also focuses on winning issue replacement and incenting routing decisions. ","On the issuer side, not only have we maintained all of our major issuer relationships for the Visa Debit, we signed 14 of our 15 largest U.S. debit issuers to agreements that go until at least fiscal 2015 with the majority spanning beyond that. ","As for our strategies to compete for routing decisions, our incentive program for merchants is on track. We've taken a tailored and surgical approach to win strategic volume and offered competitive incentives to merchants. ","Overall, while we are still at the earliest stages, I am confident that our comprehensive debit strategies are working and put Visa in a position to compete effectively in the redefined U.S. debit market. Of course, in any period of substantive change, ongoing communication and clarification with key stakeholders is essential. To that end, we have been directly engaged with clients, merchants, policymakers and other interested parties that share our desire for a healthy, competitive and viable debit segment in the U.S. ","On March 13, prior to the April 1 implementation date, the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division issued a civil investigative demand requesting additional information about PIN-authenticated Visa Debit and elements of our new debit strategies, including the fixed acquirer fee. In March, we met with the department twice and provided materials in response to the CID. We are confident our actions are appropriate and that our response to the DOJ supports that. ","But in a business as complex as ours, the department's request is not unexpected. Visa has received 4 other requests for information from the department since 2007, each of which took from 9 to almost 24 months to complete. All have been resolved with our full cooperation. We are continuing to provide materials and cooperate with the department. I will keep you updated if and when the situation warrants. ","So I will end my debit-related comments where I start. The impact of the regulation in the U.S. has been significant but almost exactly as we planned for. I am confident we fully scoped the impact of the regulation. Our updated guidance for the rest of fiscal 2012, as well as our guidance for fiscal 2013, take everything I've discussed into account. ","Bottom line, we are resetting our baseline economics for debit in the U.S. and positioning Visa to grow from here. And as I have said, throughout this process, we are fully engaged with our clients, we are focused on their needs and we are moving forward. ","Turning our attention outside the United States. We are steadily expanding Visa's international business and are ahead of our stated goal of driving 50% of revenue from international geographies by 2015. In fact, our international geographies posted healthy payment volume gains of 15% on a constant dollar basis in the December quarter, driving approximately 64% of Visa's revenue growth this quarter and now represent 47% of Visa's net revenue. ","Our Latin American region has experienced 9 consecutive quarters with payment volume growth on a constant dollar basis exceeding 20%. In fact, the March quarter delivered a solid 25% growth rate. We are seeing particularly good success in Brazil where we have reached an agreement with a large Brazilian bank that has traditionally maintained the majority of its business with one of our largest competitors. ","With this new agreement, we estimate that 50% of that client's card portfolio will be Visa branded in the next few years. ","We also recently reached an agreement with all of our major clients in Brazil that will dramatically increase the number of transactions over VisaNet. Today, about 63% of Visa's transaction in Brazil get routed over VisaNet. With this agreement, over 90% of our Brazilian transactions will route over VisaNet starting in the next few quarters. ","This important agreement directly advances one of our strategic goals: ensuring that a greater share of our transactions are processed on VisaNet. Simply put, carrying our own transactions on VisaNet delivers greater revenue to Visa. And, just as importantly, it allows Visa to deliver the overall benefits of the network and of our services, including better fraud detection and improved transaction quality to cardholders, merchants and our bank customers. ","At the same time, our Asia Pacific and CEMEA regions delivered a strong combined 16% payment volume growth for the 2 regions during the March quarter. This performance was driven by continued execution of our locally tailored growth strategies, which includes increasing penetration and usage of debit and premium credit products, expansion of our acceptance footprint and driving cross-border transactions. And to build on that, we signed several additional deals that will drive future growth in these rapidly expanding regions. ","On the innovation front, we have taken several steps to bring new products and solutions to market. Our innovation investments and acquisitions in CyberSource, PlaySpan and Fundamo are paying off and are allowing us to execute on our vision to introduce the next generation of commerce and electronic payments. ","This past quarter, we reached agreements with some of the world's largest mobile network operators and mobile device manufacturers to extend Visa's payment functionality to mobile subscribers. Vodafone, the second largest mobile operator in the world, plans to develop a virtual wallet with a Visa mobile prepaid account preloaded. The wallet will be offered to 390 million of Vodafone mobile subscribers in more than 30 countries. This agreement is the largest of its kind between a mobile operator and a global payments network. ","Orange telecom has agreed to offer their customers in 7 geographies across Africa and the Middle East a Visa prepaid account linked to their mobile phone number. ","At the same time, we continue to lead the way for broad adoption of Near Field Communication technology. Our previously announced agreements to license payWave technology to Google Wallet and Isis are 2 prominent examples, and we are actively engaged with handset manufacturers as they begin to deliver NFC-enabled devices to the marketplace. ","Examples of our progress from the most recent quarter include an agreement with Intel Corporation, which announced plans to make Visa payWave the standard payment application for Intel's soon-to-be launched mobile handset devices. Additionally, Nokia's new Lumia smartphone was tested in our labs and recently certified for use with Visa payWave. ","To further support issuers who want to advance NFC programs, we executed a deal with Oberthur Technologies to roll out Visa's mobile provisioning service, which provides issuers with a secure way to manage and provision credentials on any mobile device. ","It's been 2 years since we made the decision to acquire CyberSource, and I'm pleased to say that quarter after quarter, CyberSource continues to deliver exceptional growth and expand its e-commerce business around the world. For the most recent quarter, billable transactions totaled $1.3 billion, growing 26% versus the same period a year ago. ","At the time of the acquisition, we saw opportunity to further accelerate CyberSource growth by investing in that business and by co-selling Visa processing services and CyberSource merchant, gateway and fraud services. ","For example, in AP and CEMEA, we have successfully sold integrated solutions to major financial institutions, including Gateway Services and direct connect to VisaNet. Meanwhile, in Latin America, Cielo, which is one of the largest acquirer of processors in Brazil with approximately 70% of e-commerce volume in that country, announced its partnership with CyberSource to provide fraud management solutions to Brazilian e-commerce merchants. ","These examples demonstrate the effectiveness of Visa and CyberSource together, and we will continue to invest in this business to drive future growth. We continue to expect solid results in this part of our business as e-commerce growth remains strong in the U.S. and internationally. ","Perhaps one of the best examples to date of how Visa's acquisition assets are helping us introduce a new payment service is an agreement signed last week with Nexus, the largest telecommunications company in Malaysia. By combining Fundamo and CyberSource capabilities, we are providing Nexus with an integrated payment solution for use in set-top boxes that will enable consumers to purchase digital goods. Together, Fundamo and CyberSource fill the commerce need for a simple account checkout and authorization process. ","I'll close with perhaps the most comprehensive example of how we are a leader in the next generation of commerce, V.me. As a reminder, V.me is our next-generation digital wallet service and global acceptance mark, and another example of how we are applying our technology and expertise to deliver solutions that will benefit financial institutions, merchants and consumers. ","A year ago, I shared our vision for a service that would meet the evolving ways and places people are transacting by enabling customers to use one way to pay regardless of where they are or what device they use, while also delivering value-added services beyond payments like personalized offers and alerts. It was a big idea but one I knew we could deliver on. ","Today, I'm pleased to share that V.me is becoming a reality. The closed employee beta program I highlighted during last quarter's earnings call exceeded our expectations, and we are now applying those learnings as we open up V.me in public beta tests with selected merchants. ","This week, we are going live in beta with our first e-commerce merchant, reQ10sbuy.com [ph]. This is the first in a series of e-commerce merchants we expect to go live with between now and peak season. Our immediate priority is to drive toward consumer adoption, which will require engagement with both merchants and financial institutions. Bringing these groups together for a common purpose is a long-standing, core competency for Visa, and we are already making good progress. ","On the issuer side, we know our clients are working to deliver products and services that meet the needs and expectations of their increasingly digital customers, and we need to demonstrate that Visa is offering the best solution. As of now, we already have several large and midsized clients poised to offer V.me and are engaged in productive conversations with several additional clients. ","In parallel, we need to bring additional merchants onboard. To that end, our merchant sales teams across Visa, CyberSource and PlaySpan are moving quickly to build the V.me footprint. I anticipate that by the holiday shopping season, we will have enough merchants onboard to hold a full consumer launch in the U.S. It's an ambitious agenda, and flawless execution will be critical. I have every reason to believe we will be successful. ","And so to sum up, the examples I've highlighted today demonstrate that Visa is building off of our strong foundation, adapting to change and moving ahead. While the environment we operate in is both highly competitive and dynamic, we remain unwavering in our commitment to our clients, expansion of our core business, ongoing innovation and our guidance. ","Overall, I'm confident that Visa will be a strong, globally oriented growth company as we move ahead. ","And with that, let me turn the call over to Byron.","Byron H. Pollitt","Thank you, Joe. As is my practice, I'll begin with some overall observations and call-outs. ","First. Note that we recorded the quarter on an adjusted basis, having eliminated the positive effect to earnings from the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities due to the change in state tax rate. This remeasurement accounted for an incremental $0.31 to GAAP EPS. We also saw a benefit in the quarter from the catch-up effect of the lower, ongoing state tax rate that accounted for another $0.05. ","Turning to our actual year-to-date results. The adjusted tax rate now reflects a run rate consistent with our full year guidance. ","Second. Visa's 15% net revenue growth in the second quarter was once again broad based and encouraging with solid 10% growth in the U.S. and an even more impressive 21% growth rate in Rest of World. ","Third. U.S. revenue growth has been supported by 4 consecutive quarters of double-digit credit payment volume growth. Most recently, through the 28th of April, credit payment volume growth has comped at a very healthy 11% rate, consistent with continued U.S. economic recovery. ","Fourth. As expected and fully contemplated in our 2012 guidance, aggregate U.S. debit growth, though modestly positive for the March quarter, will turn negative in the June and September quarters. The impact of regulatory changes, primarily on Interlink volumes, picked up momentum during the March quarter and accelerated in April. As Joe mentioned at the outset, these trends will need to annualize before we see a resumption of positive growth in this U.S. product category. ","Fifth. Client incentives for the quarter as a percent of gross revenue were 16%, below our full year guidance but in line with our expectations for the first half of the fiscal year. We expect higher incentive levels in the second half of the year as U.S. debit-related merchant and acquirer incentive agreements take hold. ","Finally, sixth. As Joe mentioned at the outset, we are upgrading our guidance for fiscal year 2012 by raising EPS growth to high teens to low 20s and reaffirming our 2013 guidance. To be more specific about what this means for 2013, we expect to see improving debit payment volume trajectory over the 4 quarters and revenue growth to accelerate off of 2012 levels. As for EPS, given this trajectory and the effect of lapping the regulatory impact, we anticipate, at this point in time, growth in the high teens. ","Now let's turn to the numbers. As is our practice, I will cover our global payment volume and process transaction trends for the March quarter, followed by our results through April 28. I'll then cover the financial highlights of our fiscal second quarter and conclude with our guidance outlook for the balance of fiscal 2012. ","Global payment volume growth for the March quarter in constant dollars was 11%, unchanged from the December quarter's 11%. ","Several call-outs. First, credit in both U.S. and Rest of World picked up 2 points of growth versus Q1; second, Rest of World debit picked up 4 points of growth over Q1; third, these upticks balanced out the drop in U.S. debit growth from 6% in Q1 to 2% in Q2, thereby maintaining our overall quarter growth of 11%. ","More recently, through April 28, which also represents the first 28 days of compliance with the April 1 deadline for 2 unaffiliated networks, U.S. payment volume growth sits at minus 2%, comprised of 11% credit growth and minus 12% for debit. While still early days, these results are tracking slightly above our beginning-of-year projections. ","Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 60% constant dollar growth rate in the March quarter with the U.S. growing 13% and the Rest of World, 17%. We continue to see very strong results from our Asia Pacific, Latin America and CEMEA regions, and the longer-term sustainability of these trends appears solid. ","Through April 28, cross-border volumes on a constant dollar basis grew 15% with a U.S. growth rate of 11% and Rest of World of 17%. ","Transactions processed over Visa's network totaled 13 billion in the fiscal second quarter, an 8% increase over the prior year period, in line with the 8% growth in the December quarter. For the month of April through the 28th, processed transaction growth was a negative 1%. ","Four call-outs. First. Visa-processed transactions are continuing to grow at double-digit rates for U.S. credit and all of Rest of World. ","Second. As expected, the brunt of U.S. debit regulation is impacting our Interlink product, where transaction growth turned negative beginning in January. ","Third. Given the April 1 compliance deadline requiring 2 independent networks, we expect the negative impact on transaction growth to accelerate and reach a high point in fiscal Q3 followed by an improving trajectory in fiscal Q4 of this year. ","Finally, fourth. As a reminder, transactions lost on Interlink primarily impact the data processing fee line as this type of transaction does not earn service fees. The impacts to date on Interlink have tracked closely to our beginning-of-year projections for transactions, revenue and earnings. ","Now. Turning to the income statement. Net operating revenue in the quarter was $2.6 billion, a 15% increase year-over-year. The foreign exchange impact on net revenue in the quarter was neutral. ","Moving to the individual revenue line items. Service revenue was $1.2 billion, up 13% over the prior year period. This is reflective of strong payment volume growth in the December quarter, the revenue from which is recorded in the March quarter. ","Data processing revenue was $922 million, up 12% over the prior year's quarter based on strong transaction growth rates for both Visa process and CyberSource transactions. ","International transaction revenue was up 17% to $733 million, reflecting continued strength in cross-border volumes with mid-teen growth rates in both the U.S. and Rest of World. ","As I highlighted earlier, client incentives for the quarter came in at 16%, below the range of our full year guidance. Looking at the back half of the year, our expectation is for a step-up, consistent with our full year outlook of 17% to 18%. Ultimately, the final number will be determined in large part by the success of our incentive strategies with merchants and acquirers. ","Total operating expenses for the quarter were $972 million, up 13% from the prior year. This was primarily due to higher personnel expenses and costs associated with our acquisitions and technology projects to support our growth strategies. ","Marketing expenses at $170 million reflect a heavier weighting to the second half of the year, timed with the global promotion of the London Summer Olympics. ","Our operating margin for the quarter was 62%, ahead of our full year guidance of about 60%. As was the case last quarter, this is largely due to the expense timing as we expect a second half ramp-up in incentives, investment spending and marketing associated with the Summer Olympics. ","Capital expenditures were $61 million in the quarter. Given an expected ramp-up over the back half of the year, we remain comfortable with our current guidance of $350 million to $400 million for the year. ","Our adjusted tax rate for Q2 was just under 33% after removing the effect of the deferred tax liability remeasurement. Our expectation for a full year adjusted rate in the 33% to 34% range remains unchanged. ","Coming off the heels of a very active fiscal first quarter, we were not buyers of our stock during the second quarter. As has been our practice, we remain conservative and patient in our approach, taking advantage of short-term market disruptions to obtain more attractive pricing. ","At the end of the March quarter, we had 673 million shares of Class A common stock on an as-converted basis. Fully diluted shares outstanding totaled 676 million. ","Finally, we are raising our 2012 fiscal EPS guidance to the high teens to low 20s range as a result of better-than-anticipated, year-to-date financial performance, forward visibility into service fee revenues given the quarter lag on their recognition, strong cross-border trends and early traction on our U.S. debit strategies. ","And with that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Jefferies.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And I really appreciate all the color on the DOJ situation. I think that was very helpful. I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the new FANF  fee structure, which I understand just went into effect about a month ago. But what's been the reaction from the merchant community now that we're actually in implementation, finally? And do you anticipate any roadblocks with the implementation there, putting the DOJ situation aside?","Joseph W. Saunders","Well, this is Joe Saunders. We implemented that on April 1, so there hasn't been any reaction because I don't believe the fee has been billed to anyone yet. Although [ph], there hasn't been a lot of reaction to it. It is part of our -- the total structure we've put to deal with the Durbin regulation. We are not making money per se off of that fee. The combination of discounts and incentives that we have put together, I think, actually relate in a modest loss in the amount of $100 million a year. So we aren't doing this with the intent of raising prices. I don't think that -- well, I don't -- I know that we haven't had any difficulties in getting the structure going, so I think we'll have to wait and see how everything works out.","Operator","Next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.","Tien-Tsin T. Huang - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Just a follow-up to that, on the CID. Does it in any way change your desire to utilize the, I guess, you call it FASB [ph]? Or is it business as usual there with that product? And also, just the service fee yield. Byron, it was up quite a bit more than what we had modeled. Was there a price change there or a reclass? Or maybe just a mix change? Any help there would be great.","Joseph W. Saunders","Why don't you go ahead?","Byron H. Pollitt","Yes, yes. Let me start with the second one, Tien-Tsin. So there has been a mix change. If you look at the payment volume growth, nominally it's 11%. And our service fee growth was 13%. So if I look at it that way, roughly 1% of the -- or roughly half of the increase has been a boost in yield because of the lower mix of Interlink transactions, as I think you were referring to, and the -- our hedging actually produced another percentage point of gain and the rest, I would say, is noise.","Joseph W. Saunders","As it relates to the strategies that we've implemented, we just implemented them. I don't have any desire to change what we've done. But we put these in place in anticipation of an environment, and we'll look at them and we'll monitor them and we'll change them if it's appropriate to change them. Otherwise, we'll continue down the path. I think that it would be safe to say that we were more successful in dealing with the -- our relationships going forward and we could have projected in the past. So we'll just have to look at everything and take it all into consideration and we'll do what's appropriate. Once again, though, I mean, I feel that the guidance projections that we've made for 2012 and 2013 are safe to support in almost any environment of things that might or might not happen.","Operator","The next question comes from Glenn Fodor with Morgan Stanley.","Glenn Fodor - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just so I have the pattern right, so we have -- PIN went negative in January, the PIN growth trajectory. Furthermore, we're a further step down after April 1. You have incentives increasing in the second half. But then you talk about the drag on the PIN growth is supposed to ease by September. So it hasn't anniversaried yet because we haven\u2019t  reached next January or next April. So is the logic behind that, just so I have it right, because you're expecting these incentives you're going to pay out to sort of get that volume back to you? Do I have that right?","Byron H. Pollitt","You have everything right except the PIN piece. The -- you're right, the -- it's going to take 4 quarters to annualize. So when we referred to a positive trajectory, what we meant by that was the impact of payment volume on lag year-over-year will have its greatest impact in Q3. We would then expect continued negative comparisons through -- until we annualized but at an increasingly less negative rate as we progress through the 4 quarters. That would also be true for debit-related transactions. So PV and transactions.","Joseph W. Saunders","Let me just follow up on that and make perfectly clear one thing. And that is that we are never going to regain all of the market share that we had in the debit card business. Nothing that we say or none of our strategies suggest that, that will happen or could happen or -- and nothing that we've done or thought about or said anticipates that it will happen. The environment has changed by regulation. We're operating in a different world, and we're going to live forever with less share than we once had.","Operator","The next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette, & Woods, Inc., Research Division","I guess I had a -- you answered my question on just the market share but maybe on share buyback. I mean, I guess you guys didn't buy back stock because you felt the stock was somewhat fairly valued. But, I mean, did -- should we assume that if the shares stay at these levels, you wouldn't buy back any more throughout the remainder of the year?","Byron H. Pollitt","No, you shouldn't. We are a committed management team to returning excess cash to shareholders. I think if you take a -- and so -- and we remain committed to that. If you would take a step back, we had a very large, in our view, very large share repurchase in the first quarter. And so we time our purchases over the course of the year, looking for both opportunities to do that at attractive pricing but also, in the case of the first quarter, being responsive to an opportunity to put a significant increment of cash into the escrow account. So I think if you take a step back year-to-date, we're all -- we've already made sizable repurchases, and you can count on us to continue to return excess cash not just for this year but years to come.","Operator","The next question comes from John Williams with UBS.","John T. Williams - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a couple of quick ones. On the marketing budget, just as we think forward into the rest of the year, regarding calendarization related to the Olympics, and any other things we might need to think about and -- as we look at the marketing line?","Byron H. Pollitt","I'm not sure what else to add other than every 4 years, we have a particularly attractive opportunity to put significant media into 2 quarters, which is the third and the fourth. And knowing that, that was the feature of what we want to emphasize this year, we kept -- we phased our marketing in the first 2 quarters in order to accommodate that. We will reset marketing from a bottoms up standpoint beginning next year and, in October, give you a sense of what that will look like.","Operator","The next question comes from Bob Napoli with William Blair.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just Joe, I mean, just trying to clarify a comment. You said, on '12, '13 guidance, you thought it was safe under very -- under various circumstances. Are you suggesting that if you needed to adjust your strategy based upon the CID, that you still felt confident in your -- in the guidance? Is that -- am I reading that right or not?","Joseph W. Saunders","That -- the Department of Justice is certainly included in what I said, but it will include a lot more than that. But yes, absolutely certain.","Robert P. Napoli - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Okay. And, I mean, the CID, I mean, is mostly focused on -- I mean, I guess would you -- would you view it focused mostly on the 2% of revenue of that strategy, on that 2% piece of the revenue or more broadly?","Joseph W. Saunders","I mean, I don't know how to get into that specifically. You\u2019re asked general questions about what you're doing to react to the legislation, and it's the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department. So obviously, they must have a concern that we were doing things that might undermine that and -- but I don't really want to go any further. I mean, I'm not them, and I can't say that. We have talked to them. We provide information to them. And we have obviously very seriously considered various things that may or may not happen, and we've taken it into consideration and in our guidance.","Operator","The next question comes from Moshe Katri with Cowen.","Moshe Katri - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","You've had really impressive growth on the credit side, especially the acceleration we've seen from last quarter. Byron, maybe you can talk a bit more about the various moving parts in terms of the major drivers here? Can we talk about the consumer side versus the corporate side?","Byron H. Pollitt","Yes, our business is still largely driven by the consumer side for sure. The commercial side is growing at good rates. We are very encouraged by the numbers being posted on the commercial side because we think, first and foremost, that's a healthy barometer with regards to how businesses are doing and the continuity in the kind of payment volume growth we're seeing, particularly in credit. And if you take a look at the cross border, which is probably our most important leading indicator, the cross-border trends in both consumer retail as well as commercial are very strong. And so within -- and that is one of the indicators we look to when we put out our guidance, and one of the inputs that gave us confidence to raise our guidance for the year.","Joseph W. Saunders","Yes. On the consumer side, I mentioned in my comments the extension of our partnerships with a number of financial institutions that represent a significant portion of our volume. I mentioned the United-Continental arrangement, which is going to deliver new volume to us. I mentioned signing other financial institutions that we have done less business with in the past. I mentioned Alaska Airlines. And so the trajectory of what we're doing, we're very happy with, and we're very bullish about it. We're very pleased that this is happening at this opportune time.","Operator","The next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I hate to go back to the whole debit thing. But I guess I'm trying to understand how -- the market share loss is that extreme in the short run? I know the revenue impact isn't that large. But even in terms of just the transactions, if your -- if the process allows the merchant to route the transaction over the Signature network -- or has not yet been put in place? In other words, was that -- because otherwise, how is that market share loss that significant if that was already in place?","Joseph W. Saunders","The \u2013- [indiscernible] you suggest wasn't started until April 14 and isn't fully implemented and won't be for several weeks.","Operator","The next question comes from Bryan Keane at Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I guess I expected a decline in Interlink volume. But specifically, what's happened in Visa Debit volume that you expect in 3Q and 4Q? And I guess inside of that, how much of that is market share loss versus just banks maybe deemphasizing signature debit?","Joseph W. Saunders","It's hard to be a totally specific about it. I think that, that has leveled off, and we continue to look at modest growth. But right now, I would attribute the majority of it to the removal of all the rewards programs. I mean, there virtually are no rewards programs associated with debit cards anymore. And those programs did drive volume. And a de-emphasis in marketing these programs by the financial institutions. It's a combination of those 2 things that had an effect on it. There were some small pockets of cards that were put out that never had a PIN capability, and the regulation requires that, that change. And so people that simply couldn't use the PIN numbers, can now. Yes, it -- a combination of those 3 things, in our opinion, at this point in time is pretty much what's going on in the Signature business.","Operator","The next question comes from Andrew Jeffrey with SunTrust.","Andrew W. Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc., Research Division","Just to make sure I have this clear in my earnings addled mind, Byron, when you talk about total transaction volume in the back half of fiscal '12 in aggregate across the business, you're thinking about transaction volume being down, correct? And does that mix -- does the shift in mix away from Interlink change kind of what we should think about as the data processing yield as a consequence?","Byron H. Pollitt","Yes, it -- so my commentary on transactions was for debit, specifically, in aggregate. The -- what I think what will become increasingly important as we look at processed transactions is U.S. credit. And then, separately, what are we doing in the Rest of the World. And I think we indicated that we have very, very vibrant transaction growth rates in U.S. credit as -- and in Rest of World. And with regards to yield, we'll give this -- there is definitely going to be some disconnects in the way that you're -- that you look at this from a modeling standpoint because the -- I think one of the -- you heard this earlier. One of the natural effects of pulling out Interlink transactions is -- since it only affects the DP line, there will be a natural drop just because it will be generating last DP fees. But it's also removing payment volume for which there are no service fees. So that will actually boost the service fee yield on the transactions that remain. And we will give some thought as to how to talk about that with you all by the next earnings call to help sort that out. And if that weren't enough, we're going to take the -- I think we've already mentioned we're going to take the fixed acquiring network fee. And we're -- for the most part, that will appear in data processing as a line item. So we have some work to do to make this more transparent with regards to what will happen to those lines, what we think will happen to those lines. And we'll plan that for next quarter's earnings call.","Joseph W. Saunders","And as -- just as a reminder, the transaction loss in Interlink is coming from a business that a year ago generated 2.8% of our global revenue and last quarter generated 2% of our global revenue. It gives you an idea of the notion that there are different yields upon different types of payment volume.","Operator","The next question comes from Len DeProspo with Janney.","Leonard A. DeProspo - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC, Research Division","This is a question with regard to sort of the advertising promotion expense. I think the Olympics are going to happen entirely in your fourth quarter, but I assume you all will be doing some spending out of that. So could you just help us break out how much of that incremental spending will occur in the third quarter versus fourth quarter, maybe just percentage split?","Byron H. Pollitt","Yes, we don't typically provide that. But you are absolutely right. There is a considerable amount of promotional activity done with our banking partners, which has actually -- some of which actually started in our second fiscal quarter. It really ramps during the third quarter. And then in the fourth quarter, you have the last of the broadcast media that is fairly intensive around the Olympics themselves. So to be helpful here, we are holding -- we've said we are holding to our existing marketing guidance so that you have an order of magnitude and you now have 2 quarters in the can. And in terms of what our full year results are likely to be, I think we've bounded that pretty well. And between the quarters, we just -- as I said, we typically just don't break that out.","Joseph W. Saunders","Yes. You should also think about the fact that the advertising we do in the third and the fourth quarter supports the programs that many of our financial institutions initiate around the Olympics with Olympic theme cards, and that those initiatives generate more particularly credit card volume, which is the reason that we do this. We have, I think, almost -- on a global basis almost 3x as many financial institutions participating in promotions this year as we did 4 years ago.","Operator","The next question comes from Julio Quinteros with Goldman Sachs.","Julio C. Quinteros - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Guys, just to go back to the 2013 commentary, Byron, can you just walk us back through both the revenue expectations and the EPS expectations? I want to make sure we have the -- both of those numbers there correct.","Byron H. Pollitt","So on the revenue, what we said was our expectation is that revenue in '13 will grow off of 2012 levels. So whatever the growth rate in revenue is for 2012, everything else being equal, we would expect it to be somewhat higher in 2013. With regards to EPS growth, if you recall, back in the October earnings call when we reaffirmed the '13 guidance, what we said was we expected EPS to also grow off of 2000 levels, but our expectation at that point, and our guidance at that time on 2012, was that EPS would grow mid to high teens. We are now at high teens, low 20s. And as we indicated in the earnings call back in October, there were a number of components that got us to that EPS growth, one of which was a favorable step-down in our ongoing tax rate. And that represented plus or minus 5 percentage points of EPS growth. And so as we began to, in effect, outperform during the course of the year and raise our guidance, we wanted to make it clear that when we talked about 2013, our expectation was more high teens, recognizing that it wouldn't be likely or possible for us to lap that same kind of tax improvement on EPS, and  that way, we'd be substituting instead operating earnings for that tax benefit that we received in '12 that wouldn't expect to duplicate in '13. And so that's why we want to make very clear that, at least at this point in time, our earnings growth guidance should be in the high teens range.","Operator","The next question comes from Tim Willi with Wells Fargo.","Timothy W. Willi - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I wondered if I could just ask a question around the commentary around processing transactions in Brazil. Curious to what extent this has some impact on the conversation around revenue yield, if it's something we would notice if that ramps up over the next couple of quarters. And in conjunction with that, is there further opportunity with bank partners or other services around this agreement to continue to improve that yield if that relationship would mature further in years?","Joseph W. Saunders","The increase in processing on VisaNet in Brazil has a -- does have an effect on our yield because we're going to be receiving revenues for transactions going over VisaNet that we didn't before. It's going to ramp up over a period of time. I don't think that we're in position right now to tell you how that's going to affect our global yields or our global -- or even our global revenues in the short run. We're very excited about it because it puts us in a position in Brazil similar to the United States where not only are we going to be processing more transactions but we will be able to deliver other revenue generating services. And I think that you'll begin to see that manifest itself in our 2013 projection.","Operator","The last question does come from Chris Brendler with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","One clarification, Byron, in response to an earlier question, I think, on the service fee yield, the service fee as a percentage of volume. You had said it's a \u2013- it\u2019s a mix -- or about half of it is a mix issue and the other half is hedging. Just so I understand right, service fees are not earned on Interlink. So the mix we're seeing there is the -- dividing by a lower denominator? Is that what's causing the mix -- the issue -- that yield to go up? And then my unrelated question would be on V.me, do you expect to have anything in your marketing budget or any significant amount on your budgeting for that fourth quarter Christmas holiday launch? I mean, is this going to be a pretty significant launch this year? Or is it going to be more of a soft launch?","Joseph W. Saunders","You go ahead.","Byron H. Pollitt","Yes, let me take the first one. Yes, you have it right. What we have -- when you remove the Interlink transactions, you're removing transactions from the denominator, but you're not touching the service fees. So the yield automatically starts moving up.","Joseph W. Saunders","As it relates to V.me, we will have -- certainly have some advertising in that. But the advertising that we will do will be in conjunction with merchants that are coming on to the network and through financial institutions to encourage their customers to enroll. So I guess in that regard, it would be soft here, and, I guess, you mean [ph] national TV advertising in the fourth quarter.","Jack Carsky","And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining us.

This call is currently being webcast over the Internet and is accessible on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will be archived on our site for 90 days. A PowerPoint deck containing the financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s call have been posted to our IR website.","Let me also remind you this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance, and our actual results could materially differ as a result of a variety of factors. Additional information concerning those factors is available on our most recent reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC\u2019s website and in the Investor Relations section of Visa\u2019s website. For historical non-GAAP pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, related GAAP measures and other information required by Reg G of the SEC are available in the financial and statistical summary accompanying today\u2019s press release.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Al.","Al Kelly","Jack, thank you, and good afternoon to everyone and thanks for joining us today. We\u2019re halfway through our fiscal year for 2017 and we\u2019re quite pleased with the strong business results that continued into the second quarter. Similar to Q1, our business momentum was broad based with solid payment volume growth, a double-digit increase in cross-border revenue and healthy operating metrics from all of the regions. Despite geo-political uncertainty, our business continues to deliver sustained growth as we displace cash and capitalize on the opportunities in front of us.","We\u2019re performing well against our operating plan and our strategic priorities for the year. I\u2019m excited to see a high level of business execution continuing into this fiscal second quarter where we saw robust growth in payments, volume, cross-border business and processed transactions. This growth combined with client incentive delays led to better than expected financial performance. We grew net revenue by 23% and adjusted EPS by 27% versus prior year\u2019s results. We also reorganized some of our legal entities including Visa Europe and created the Visa Foundation with an initial charitable contribution. This provides us an opportunity as a company to expand our charitable giving and our philanthropic activity.","Vasant will go into this in a greater detail to highlight some of the normalized comparisons and also discuss the impact of the reorganization and the charitable contribution. We continue to work closely with our valued clients around the world. Well I do not plan to talk about renewals on every call. This was a particularly active quarter, so I do want to highlight some notable agreements. In North America, we renewed a multi-year credit, debit, commercial and prepaid partnership with PNC Financial Services Group. We also renewed a multi-year debit agreement with Citizens Bank and multi-year credit and debit agreements with First National Bank of Omaha.","And on the co-brand side, we renewed an important credit card relationship of Hyatt Hotels and Resorts. In Asia Pacific, we signed a ten year exclusive partnership with ANZ Bank. In both Australia and New Zealand, we also signed a commercial credit partnership with Citibank covering multiple markets in Asia Pacific. In Taiwan, we signed a multi-year credit and debit agreement with CTBC Bank Taiwan. In our Latin America region, Banco Popular de Puerto Rico, the largest bank in credit card issuer in Puerto Rico renewed a multi-year credit and debit partnership. In Europe, we signed a PAN-Nordic debit renewal with Nordea Bank and a commercial and consumer card renewal with BNP Paribas Group in France.","In addition to our renewals, we signed a number of key partnerships. We announced the IBM Watson partnership to help support payments in the Internet of Things and encourage the usage of tokenization. As a leading network, it is part of our role to look forward and anticipate. To that end and where applicable we want to ensure an on ramp for payments integration in the Internet of Things. This collaboration brings the point of sale everywhere Visa is accepted by allowing businesses to quickly introduce secure experiences for any connected device.","We also executed the PayPal partnership in Asia Pacific, which is similar to our partnership in the United States. This partnership helps ensure transaction data sharing and provides consumer choice for an improved consumer experience. More recently, we announced the launch of an enhanced transaction data capability for Amazon business customers in the United States. This enables participating issuers to provide their U.S. commercial account holders a comprehensive view of their Amazon business purchases including full line item details on purchases made with their Visa commercial card that integrate with popular reconciliation tools.","Our digital expansion effort showed great progress in Q2. Visa Checkout is sustaining tremendous growth, reaching more than 20 million enrolled accounts. Additional brand merchants are adopting Visa Checkout to improve their online shopping experience. And the growing list of over 300,000 merchants now includes Alaska Airlines, Avis, Marriott and Walmart amongst others. And our push payments products at Visa Direct and mVisa are continuing to expand globally in various markets.","This past quarter, I continue to spend a lot of time with clients, partners and government officials. Combined with my travel in my first few weeks, I\u2019ve had an opportunity now to visit most of our top markets and I plan to get to additional markets in the coming weeks and months. During almost all the visits I\u2019ve balanced my time between meetings with investors, employees, clients both issuer and merchant clients and government officials. I thought it might be helpful to share a few overall and a few specific impressions from these meetings.","In terms of overall impressions, the Visa brand and our reputation with our clients is very good. Clients appreciate the association with our people and our incredible brand. Regulation is present almost everywhere although it clearly differs from market to market. I validated what I already knew that the payment space is a local business driven by history, traditions and local regulations. The state of innovation, issuer relationships and acceptance penetration are specific to each individual country, so you must be local to win in the payment space. And my final observation is that opportunity abounds around the world.","More specifically, let me highlight some of our ongoing efforts in a number of countries. In Russia, we have a very good presence and enjoy terrific relationships with an impressive set of bank partners both state owned as well as private. As a developed economy, Russia is growing domestically and in outbound travel, which contributes significantly to our cross-border business growth. Where Russia has a domestic processor and a domestic scheme in New Year, the government understands the value of other networks and we are working well with the government\u2019s central bank as well as our issuer partners. Russia is also building excitement for the upcoming Confederations Cup this year and the FIFA World Cup in 2018, which represent opportunities for growth in this market.","China as I said before is a long-term opportunity. It\u2019s an important market and we will be patient. I recently enjoyed meeting a number of key influential people during my trip to Beijing. They were very helpful. That said it will take time to apply for and pass the various review steps before we obtain a domestic license. We are working on a path forward, which I discussed with key people and we received helpful feedback. Beyond the pursuit of a domestic license, the phasing out of the dual branded cards has begun to impact us in terms of payment volume and revenue and we expect to feel this impact a bit more as we look ahead.","Turning to Japan, I\u2019m very excited about the opportunities. Japan today is a huge cash society with a large number of credit cards, but a small number of debit cards. I had a chance to meet with over thirty clients and the enthusiasm was very high. I really believe that Japan will take off over the next few years driven by a positive and an active government in terms of driving payments to be more electronic or digital, growth in contact list and the emergence of e-commerce. The Olympics in 2020 will be a great showcase for digital progress as the games are largely going to be in and around the city of Tokyo.","In India, we\u2019re working with partners and government agencies to expand our presence. Post demonetization in November, domestic process transaction continues to grow significantly and was up well over 100% this past quarter. Today cash availability has largely returned to normal levels. Our transactions primarily come from domestic debit in low-ticket non-discretionary categories as we\u2019re driving debit awareness. We\u2019re also scaling up physical and digital acceptance through bank partnerships and new product introduction. Points of acceptance have increased 50% in the five months since demonetization and is now above two million.","Looking at the European business, we\u2019re gratified with the overall performance. Our acquisition of Visa Europe has provided our business with a truly global presence as we operate as one Visa worldwide. While we still have a lot of work ahead of us we\u2019re pleased with the business integration progress to date. We are in active discussions with our clients as we migrate to new commercial frameworks with incentive structures. The vast majority of payments volume continues to be under contract. We\u2019re also in the process of building a strong and stable European leadership team. Following the recent resignation of Visa Europe, CEO Nicolas Huss, Bill Sheedy has taken on the interim CEO role as of April 1st.","Bill is a 25 year veteran of Visa and is well known to the European team given his role in the acquisition and early integration. Bill provides invaluable leadership in business continuity as we integrate the European operations and while the form of search process is underway. We continue to work with our clients and partners to deliver on our innovation agenda in Europe and create new products, services and business opportunities. This past quarter, we met a number of successful contactless transit launches in the U.K. and Italy and Visa Token Service continues to expand with recent Android Pay launches in Poland and Ireland.","In February, we launched the Visa Innovation Center in London and so our strong client engagement with over 50 client sessions held onsite to date and a significant pipeline of demand ahead of us. We maintained our strong record of accomplishment of delivering value to our shareholders through a disciplined capital allocation plan. We continue to make investments in our core business. We invested in our merchant service offerings by completing the cargo commerce transaction in February. The 3-D Secure 2.0 standard and detection provides greater fraud protection and will increase approval authorizations in a channel that has historically had high or a higher level of denials.","In fiscal Q2, we delivered on our commitment to driving shareholder value as we returned over $2 billion of capital to shareholders consisting of 1.7 billion of share repurchases and nearly 400 million through dividends. We continue to accelerate our share buyback activity to offset the equity dilution from the Visa Europe transaction. Lastly at Tuesday\u2019s board meeting, we received approval to increase our share buyback authorization by $5 billion resulting in a total purchase authorization of $7.2 billion.","As we move to the second half of our fiscal year, we feel good about the momentum in the business and look forward to the future ahead. I\u2019ve enjoyed the opportunity to meet with many of our shareholders over the past months and I hope to meet more of you in the coming months. As a reminder our Investor Day will be held on June 22nd in San Francisco, so I hope you will be able to join us.","And with that let me turn it over to Vasant to cover some of the financial details.","Vasant Prabhu","Thank you, Al. The strong growth trends we started the year will continued through the second quarter. Second quarter net revenue and EPS once again exceeded our expectations. On a GAAP basis, fiscal second quarter net revenues were up 23%, EPS including special items related to the reorganization of Visa Europe was $0.18. Excluding these special items, adjusted net income for the quarter was $2.1 billion and EPS $0.86. Adjusting last year\u2019s results for a gain related to currency forward contract EPS was up 27%.","Exchange rate shifts versus the prior year negatively impacted net revenue growth by approximately 2.5 percentage points and EPS growth by approximately 4 percentage points. A few key points. Adjusted for the extra day in February last year, global growth rates in payment volumes, process transactions and cross-border volumes remained robust and generally in line with first quarter trends. Once again timing of client incentives added almost $0.03 to our second quarter results as some deal renewals were pushed out into the second half.","We completed our legal entity reorganization of Visa Europe and other of Visa subsidiaries to align our global corporate structure to the geographic jurisdictions in which we have business operations. This reduced our reporter tax rate to 28.6% after adjusting for two nonrecurring special items. Finally, we bought back 19.1 million shares of Class A common stock in the second quarter at an average price of $88.51 for $1.7 billion. In the first half of fiscal 2017, we bought back 41.4 million shares for $3.5 billion at an average price of $83.81. Our board has authorized a new 5 billion share repurchase program increasing funds available for stock buybacks to $7.2 billion.","Before I discuss our second quarter results and outlook for the year some more details on the Visa Europe reorganization and its impact. We are pleased to have completed a reorganization of Visa Europe and other subsidiaries. This has several implications. First, our adjusted tax rate in the second quarter was lower at 28.6%. As a result, our full year adjusted tax rate will now be approximately 50 basis points lower than prior expectations. Next year with a full year benefit from the new structure, we will have a further reduction of approximately 100 basis points in our tax rate.","Second, following this reorganization, we returned a net $1.3 billion of cash held by our foreign subsidiaries to the U.S. This transaction did not constitute a return of undistributed earnings and as such was not subject to U.S. taxes. This return of cash precludes the need for us to issue any debt until later this calendar year when the first traunch from our December 2015 debt issuance matures. We have the ability to return more cash held by our foreign subsidiaries and we\u2019ll update you as and when we do it.","Third associated with this reorganization the newly formed Visa Foundation received all Visa Inc shares, which are previously held by Visa Europe and recorded as treasury stock. The reorganization provided us an opportunity to achieve this goal in a tax efficient manner. The charitable donation, which totaled $192 million, was recorded in general and administrative expenses. There was an associated $17 million reduction in income tax provisions reflecting the tax benefit of the contribution. Both these items are nonrecurring and as such were treated as special items.","Fourth, as a result of this reorganization, we eliminated deferred tax balances originally recorded when we acquired Visa Europe in June 2016. As required by U.S. GAAP, we recorded these balances as part of purchase accounting for the acquisition to accrue for potential tax liabilities or assets if we ever sold Visa Europe. The applicable taxes are dependent on the geographic jurisdictions applicable to Visa Europe. In the reorganization, we changed our corporate structure.","It is therefore necessary to adjust associated deferred tax balances accordingly. This one-time adjustment has no cash consequences as no tax was actually triggered by the reorganization. As such this approximately $1.5 billion deferred tax adjustment was also treated as a special item. Our press release provides you with a schedule that adjusts GAAP net income and EPS for these special items.","Moving now to a review of our key business drivers in the first quarter. U.S. payments volumes grew 12% with credit growing 21% and debit 3%. Adjusting for the extra day in February 2016 would add over 1 percentage point through these growth rates. Even after you adjust for Costco and USAA, credit growth has remained strong especially spending on travel. Excluding Interlink, debit grew 7% in line with the prior quarter when normalized for the leap day.","Reported Interlink growth rates continue to be impacted by the lapping of a significant win in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 as well as PIN debit routing choices by acquirers and merchants. Gas prices added approximately half a point to payment volume growth in the U.S. As reported international payment volumes grew 68% in constant dollars. In addition to the leap day effect from 2016, international payment volumes are also impacted by the shift in Easter from fiscal Q2 last year to Q3 this year.","On a comparable and normalized basis, robust payment volume growth continued across the globe. Growth picked up in Latin America and remains strong in the CEMEA region. Asia sustained double-digit payment volume growth rates excluding China. Payment volume growth in China slowed as a result of a decline in dual branded card volumes as well as loan restrictions lowering real estate transaction volumes. In Europe, excluding co-badge volume in all period growth was steady at 9% despite the leap year and Easter shift impacts.","On a reported basis, cross-border volumes grew 132% on a constant-dollar basis, driven by the inclusion of Europe. Adding Europe to prior year results, constant dollar cross-border growth globally was up 11%. In the last week of March, we experienced settlement delays in Europe due to a technical issue. This caused some volume, mostly international volume, which would normally have settled in March to be settled in the first week of April. This reduced second quarter European and normalized global cross-border growth rate by 1 percentage point respectively, impacts on cross-border revenues was de minimums.","Strong cross-border growth trends adjusted for the leap year have sustained through the second quarter, held by the relative stability of the dollar and the euro. Once again, the strong dollar drove robust outbound commerce from the U.S. into Canada, Mexico and the U.K. Our U.S acquired business improved, helped by an acceleration of commerce in from Canada and Brazil. As a result, U.S. cross-border volume growth remained in the double-digits and was a percentage point higher than the first quarter rate.","Across other geographies, the UK continues to benefit from the weak pound, which is driving significance on inbound commerce. Outbound commerce from Russia accelerated especially into Europe. Outbound commerce from the Middle East continues to weaken, while commerce from sub-Saharan Africa is picking up steam. Cross-border commerce across Latin America was strong. Adjusted for the settlement delay, cross-border growth was steady across Europe. As reported, processed transactions grew 42% due to the inclusion of Europe. On a comparable basis, which includes Europe in prior year\u2019s results, global processed transactions grew 12%.","Adjusting for the leap year impact, processed transactions growth rates were stable. U.S. growth rates were modestly lower, primarily due to Interlink, international growth rate stepped up due to India and some new business in Europe. Even as cash available in India has returned to normal, transaction growth rates in excess of 100% have sustained through the second quarter. Through April 14, U.S. payment volumes are up almost 15%. Normalized for Visa Europe, constant dollar cross-border volumes grew 13% and process transaction growth was almost 17%. A word of caution: 2 weeks do not make a trend in the first half \u2013 then first half of April is impacted by the shift in Easter.","A quick review of our fiscal second quarter financial results. Service revenue grew 17% in line with first quarter growth rates. Service revenue growth was helped by previously announced price increases offset by a negative currency translation impact. Data processing revenues grew 25%, international revenues grew 41% impacted by lower revenues from currency volatility. Currency volatility declined through the quarter and is currently below the long-term mean.","Once again client incentives came in well below our expectations. As I mentioned earlier, lower than expected incentives added $0.03 to our second quarter EPS. Many significant renewals were completed in the quarter as Al described which will drive incentives higher going forward. Several important renewals have shifted to the second half. In Europe, we continue to work with clients to reset our terms post-renewal of rebates. We are comfortable with the progress, but given the large volume of contracts that have to be modified. This will extend into the second half. In the U.S., a couple of renewals, we\u2019ve previously estimated might be done by now will likely be second half events, mostly driven by client timetables.","Expenses grew 24% after adjusting for the Visa Foundation contribution, which is recorded in G&A. As expected, expense growth ramped up from the first quarter level and will continue to ramp as we step up marketing and technology spend as well as Europe integration costs. Personnel expenses are impacted by above-normal employee incentive accruals tied to better than expected year-to-date performance and several employees benefit costs that are seasonally higher in the second quarter.","Our tax rate adjusted for special items was 28.6% as a result of the completion of the Visa Europe reorganization, driving EPS of $0.86, up 27% on an adjusted basis. Looking ahead to the second half of fiscal year 2017, as you have seen, the key drivers of our results payment volumes, process transactions and cross-border volumes continued to grow at healthy rates all through the first half. The main headwinds this year have been the strong dollar and the weak euro. Fortunately, the dollar and the euro were relatively stable last quarter, and this headwind has not become stiffer.","A couple of trends are worse than we had expected last quarter and bear watching. Currency volatility is tracking below the long-term mean and well below last year\u2019s levels. Volumes on Chinese dual-branded cards are declining as cards expire and are not reissued. On the second half, we are assuming payment volume and cross-border growth momentum will be sustained. Client incentives spend is expected to ramp up with the renewals we just completed and deals that are shifting into the second half. Expenses will also step up above second quarter levels as we spend more on marketing and technology initiatives and as well as Europe integration.","Based on first half results and current trends, we\u2019re updating several components of our full year fiscal 2017 outlook. We now expect nominal net revenue growth to come in at the high end of our outlook range of 16% to 18%, with client incentives as a percent of gross revenue at the low-end of the 20.5%, 21.5% range. There is no change in margin expectations in the mid 60s. As a result of our Visa Europe reorganization, our tax rate after adjusting for special items is expected to be 50 bps or basis points better at approximately 30%. Nominal adjusted EPS growth also adjusted for special items is now projected to be at the high-end of the mid-teens range.","With that I will turn this back to Jack.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Vasant. Christine, it\u2019s time. We are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Bob Napoli from William Blair. Line is now open.","Bob Napoli","Now, thank you and good afternoon. So this is the second quarter in a row where the company has materially exceeded expectations. What this \u2013 I mean, there\u2019s a lot going on. What are the main surprises to Visa on the outperformance? Is it Visa Europe is a lot more accretive than what you thought? Is it a somewhat better economy, more market share? What is driving the upside surprises?","Al Kelly","Bob, it\u2019s Al. I would say number one, it\u2019s fairly healthy economies around the world where [indiscernible] in every quarter get fortunate where \u2013 when you look across the globe, you see fairly robust growth and that\u2019s what we had seen. I think I had said in the first quarter that we saw that with the exception of Brazil. Brazil was not terrific, but that are in the second quarter. I think the second thing is the fact that we saw more of the client incentives that we expected to happen in the second quarter are going to move to later in the year. So those will be the two things I\u2019d point out.","And then of course, cross-border growth has continued to stay very robust. As you saw, we\u2019ve had now three quarters in a row where cross-border has been in the double-digit range especially strong has been U.S. cross-border, both issued and the acquired holding up pretty well. And that, as you know, is a good business for us. So again it\u2019s strength of global economies.","Bob Napoli","Great, thank you. I appreciate it.","Jack Carsky","Thanks, Bob. Next question, Christine.","Operator","Next question is from Ramsey El-Assal from Jefferies. Line is now open.","Ramsey El-Assal","Thanks for my question. The lower 2017 incentives guidance, as you mentioned, is pushing forward some renewals that you thought were going to happen earlier in the year. Is there an implication that you\u2019re pushing out into 2018 things that would have occurred in 2017, because you\u2019re taking down the total 2017 number. And then I guess do you have any greater clarity on the potential effects of FASB rule changes on revenue recognition coming into effect next year, how that might impact this revenue \u2013 this incentive line?","Jack Carsky","Well, on the first point, we do our best to try to estimate these client incentives. We\u2019re in essence having to estimate 3 different things. One is the timing of when deals are going to happen; number two, what are going to be the terms of those deals once they\u2019re finally negotiated; and then number three, what are \u2013 once those deals are taking place, what \u2013 the actual volume performance is going to be. So it\u2019s relatively tricky stuff. That said, I think not only did we see some of the renewals we expected to happen in Q2 dip into Q \u2013 into the second half of the year. The other point is the one that Vasant made in his prepared remarks about the rebates being replaced by incentives in Europe. It\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of accounts, and it\u2019s simply taking us longer to get through all of the various work getting through the clients getting negotiated, getting through lawyers on both sides just playing it simple, taking longer than we thought. I\u2019ll let Vasant deal with this FASB question.","Vasant Prabhu","Yeah, on the FASB side, yes, there are new revenue recognition standards. I think you\u2019ve heard us say that there\u2019s no real economic impact from it. We are working to clarify how those standards are applying to us. We are working through what that impact on us might be. There are two possible places in which there could be changes in the reporting. One is what is classified under client incentives versus what is classified under expenses, and then how certain kinds of payments are amortized on client incentive contracts. Once again, as we go through that and we get clarity from the SEC and the FASB on a couple of open items, they will be able to do all the work and give you some sense of it. But at this stage, that\u2019s where things stand.","Ramsey El-Assal","Got it. All right, thanks a lot.","Jack Carsky","Next question, please.","Operator","And our next question is from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Line is now open.","Lisa Ellis","Hi, good afternoon guys. Can you comment a bit on your view on the impact of PSD2 regulations in Europe and more broadly the regulatory environment in Europe?","Jack Carsky","Well, Lisa, I think you know it\u2019s a little early to tell how exactly the PSD2 is going to play out. We\u2019re obviously engaged in talking to the regulators, talking to our clients and obviously having our own internal discussions about how things could play out. We\u2019ve been working with the regulators to make sure that the authentication process is done in a \u2013 with some pragmatic elements on it in terms of where you need \u2013 where you can use normal kind of risk authorization tools and techniques versus having two different forms of authentication, but where exactly it plays out is too early \u2013 I think it\u2019s a little too early to tell.","As relates to balance the regulation in Europe, we\u2019re continuing to make sure that we\u2019re complying properly with the breakup of scheme and processor. It\u2019s being perfectly blunt about it. It\u2019s a bit of a cultural challenge and that we\u2019re being forced to separate people and organizations that were accustomed for years to working together. But we\u2019re obviously doing everything that we need to do to make sure we comply. And then broader regulation around the world, we\u2019re tracking very carefully. Probably the most relevant recent news came out of Argentina, where they have regulated interchange effective now at a 200 bps for credit, 100 bps for debit, but it will slide down over the next five years and land at 130 credit and 60 on debit.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific, thanks. And if you don\u2019t mind me asking just the same question, but for India, can you give a little more color on exactly what\u2019s going on the ground? In India decisions being made with the government with the central bank et cetera around how the payment system is going to evolve there?","Jack Carsky","Well, we would have expected sometime over the last couple of weeks to have gotten clarity. There was supposed to be clarity no later than the end of March on kind of the next chapter of regulation or guidance in terms of how things would have to go forward. And there hasn\u2019t been, and we\u2019ve been told that it will be delayed likely into early May. So we\u2019re right now continuing to make sure that we put as much emphasis as we can on growing the number of acceptance points throughout India, both kind of a traditional POS as well as using mVisa side and QR codes.","And we made tremendous progress with merchant acceptance point up 50% in the country from November 8th until the end of the quarter. And it\u2019s still obviously very small compared to what it could be and will be relative to the population of India, but it certainly is a very healthy start from where we were in November. So we\u2019ll know more in May, but we\u2019re operating now under the pricing that\u2019s exists out there, which is 75 basis points, 40 basis points and 30 basis points depending upon the size of the transaction.","Operator","Thank you.","Lisa Ellis","Terrific, thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from David Togut from Evercore. Line is now open.","David Togut","Thank you. Good afternoon. How do your revenue growth expectations for Visa Europe compared now versus the time you acquired the business at the end of June? And in particular are there any countries you are more or less optimistic about from a growth standpoint?","Al Kelly","Well I mean as we told you before we are very happy with how Visa Europe has come along post the closing of the acquisition in June. In general it is tracking at or above our expectations whether it\u2019s revenue or accretion. Cross-border business certainly has been strong in Europe, payment volumes have been somewhat higher than where they were around the time when we closed on the acquisition. Our yields have been heading in the right direction most of the expense actions relating to consultation process are completed they are now working on the technology integration. So on all fronts Visa Europe is performing pretty much at or above our expectations.","Vasant Prabhu","On the second party of your question, where there is pockets of good potential? Our largest markets are the UK and France, and I think we look at Germany, Italy, the Nordic countries and Spain where we have a pretty good business already as well. A deadly place where I would highlight is where we think there\u2019s specific potential. But I think we feel very good about the potential in many markets across the continent.","Operator","Thanks you.","Al Kelly","Next question.","Operator","And next question is from Andrew Jeffrey form SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey","Hi, thank you for taking the question. Actually a follow-up on David\u2019s question, with regard to Europe Al could you elaborate a little bit on the timing of some of the yield and expense initiatives in Europe. .It sounds like we\u2019re going to start to see maybe even a little more of an impact in the second half of 2017 and extensively into 2018. So I\u2019m just wondering if you can get order of magnitude maybe?","Al Kelly","Well I think on the expense side we\u2019re about two thirds of the way through what we want to do. On the revenue side we\u2019re probably a little bit behind where we had hoped to be a taking a bit longer than we had hoped to kind of work our way through the deals that have to be reconstituted. We got some very good momentum going now, so I\u2019m certainly hoping that the pace is going to pick up here in the third quarter and into the into the fourth quarter. But obviously if we bring on a good amount of those deals in Q3 and Q4 it\u2019s going to create a good run rate for us going into fiscal 2018.","Vasant Prabhu","On the expense side, I mean the next set of actions is all around the technology integration. So the first thing that has to happen is technology platforms have to be harmonized. And then we can act on what we do with the technology infrastructure. And that would be, as we told you couple of years out. And on the on the client incentive side, as we get these new deals done, certainly that is one of the reasons why the expected higher rate of client incentives in the second half as this pipeline of rebates and client incentives adjustments make their way through and get done.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open. ","Darrin Peller","Thanks guys. Research Division with personal growth still a little higher than we thought, you still had strong margins, I think turning it about 68% for the first half. So just first what would drive the margin to the low end of 60% range I guess average out in the mid 60s for the year?","And then Al can you just tell us how you conceptually think about the company\u2019s margin plans I guess I don\u2019t guide in just for mid-60s, but just again as a CEO now, should we assume your strategy is to let operating leverage pass through up above 70% over the years to come or is there a different approach?","Al Kelly","Well I think that \u2013 I\u2019ll answer the second half of your question first and I\u2019ll let Vasant talk about the first part of your question. Well we\u2019re going to \u2013 my view is that to the degree that we have good opportunities to invest in future growth whether that\u2019s organic or acquisitions, we\u2019re going to do that. And that\u2019s going to be the first use of capital always for us. And from my vantage point if that means that for a period we\u2019re investing a little bit of our margin to promote growth because we think we\u2019ve got an abundance of good ideas. We\u2019re going to go ahead and do that. ","That said it is a high leverage business in the next 1,000, 10,000 transactions we don\u2019t really add much cost until we reach a point we got to hang another server up in our data center and we got a cost associated with that. We have very strong operating leverage in the business. And so to the degree that revenue continue to grow, the reality is that and the revenue has grown higher than our expenses because of our leverage the margin would naturally run up. But that doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re just going to sit by idly and have that happen. What ends up happening is going to be a result of decisions we make relative to the investment opportunities that are presented in front of us around the world.","Vasant Prabhu","In terms of a question on near term margins, your first question, just a few things I just want to point out that I had in the prepared remarks. One is that you saw that our expense is ramping. And that ramp is partially in personnel expenses, but also as we get to the second half there is going to be a further ramp in our marketing and our technology based on some programs that\u2019s second half based. In addition to that the Visa Europe integration costs are also ramping. So there\u2019s a set of costs that are ramping in the second half.","And then the second item is client incentives have been lower than the expected. We still believe that they will be in the range we gave you earlier although it\u2019s more likely at the lower end of the range which is higher than where they have been in the first half. So when you put that all together, it gives you a sense of where margins are likely to be in the second half.","Darrin Peller","Thank you.","Jack Carsky","Next question please.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks I just had a follow-up on some of the emerging market discussions. Al, you mentioned your China visits and how the road might be a little bit more complicated to get the licensing. Could you just talk a little bit more about the timeline you\u2019re expecting and whether or not there\u2019s other opportunities in that market to work with some of the players that are proliferating? And maybe just on India just to what monetization opportunity is? Thanks.","Al Kelly","Well, on China I\u2019m not going to talk about what we think might be the best path forward. It just became very clear to me as I talk to government officials, that even if at this moment, we had our ducks completely in a row and knew exactly how we wanted to proceed in terms of filing for domestic license it just is a very complicated review process. And in fact not all of the necessary steps are actually memorialized. One of the things that I found out is that hopefully the Chinese government by the end of the second quarter is going to publish a set of more clarifying rules about international entities and what would be required to submit for a license.","So this is Sanjay, I think it has been communicated in the past. This is a long term play. But I think we have to be patient because this is in a country of 13 million or 130 million people, it\u2019s almost 1.4 billion people and it\u2019s just simply going to take time.","I think in the short to medium term, the reality is that the insistence, what\u2019s an increasingly insistence on the part of the government for issuers to move away from the dual co-badge cards is in fact going to impact us in a negative way. It will impact us more meaningfully purchase volume, but we\u2019re going to see some impact on revenue. That said, we still expect that many of our partners are continuing to \u2013 as we know as come up instead of obviously renewing with dual-badge cards, they\u2019re renewing card a CUP card and a Visa card to facilitate international travel. So we still believe that cross-border traffic from Chinese citizens traveling outside of China will continue to be quite good.","Turning to India, again, I think this is a longer-term play, but it\u2019s a longer-term play that\u2019s right now got real wind at its back. And we\u2019re investing and we\u2019ve made it clear to our folks on the ground in India that we\u2019re behind them and we\u2019ll invest what\u2019s necessary to take advantage of the wind at our backs right now.","In terms of how big this is, I think there\u2019s a number of things that we have to watch. we\u2019ll have to see where the actual pricing actually nets out when we get the final words from the regulators, so that it\u2019s \u2013 make sure it\u2019s attractive enough. We\u2019ll have to see how the government in India continues or doesn\u2019t continue to have this sustained push behind the efforts here. But right now and until circumstances dictate that we should do otherwise we\u2019re full steam ahead in trying to drive coverage, build awareness relative to mVisa and our app and trying to drive as many through marketing, drive as many Indian citizens into this world of using their mobile phone to transact for the purchases at least for their everyday goods and items.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from George Mihalos from Cowen. Your line is now open.","George Mihalos","Great thanks for taking my question guys. Just wanted to build off of the last question as it pertains to China, and Al and Vasant, your comments around monitoring some of the China co-badge cards. Can you size for us what the potential impact could be maybe in terms of volume, for example, something that could be at risk?","And then second question, Vasant, I just want to make sure on the tax rate, I\u2019m thinking about it correctly. For 2017, you\u2019re talking about a 30% tax rate going to is it 29% in 2018? Thank you.","Vasant Prabhu","I\u2019ll take the tax rate. I\u2019m sure Al will add something on the cross-border side in China. On the tax rate I did say that we get a part year benefit from the reorganization we did in Europe, which is about 50 basis points this year. And we will get an additional 100 basis points on top of that next year with a full-year benefit of what we did.","As it relates to the dual-branded cards in China, we have incorporated that in our sort of thinking as we look ahead into the second half of the year. It is just something to be monitored. It is not that easy to predict. But we are seeing that the payment volume on these cards is declining as they come up for renewal and they\u2019re being renewed with, as Al said, the single currency card, which do then pick up some of the cross-border volume. I don\u2019t know Al, if you want to add.","Al Kelly","The only thing I wanted to add is it is difficult to tell. I mean the banks have been somewhat resistant to make this change, which has been a good thing for us. It\u2019s just that there is a bit of a push on them more recently. And I heard that from a number of Chinese bank executives when I was over there. But how quickly it moves is hard to tell. It\u2019s also just hard to tell what we\u2019ll happen with single Visa card issuance in essence a companion card to China Union Pay Card. And what does any impact that has on the cross-border volume which is, in many ways for us right now, the more important volume.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Tien-Tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang","Hi thanks. Just a clarification a question, just the client incentives. Is the guidance revision all timing-related? Are terms perhaps better than expected? And then my other question was just on the reported U.S. debit volume. I think it shows 3%. Some of that you said steady 7%, adjusting for Interlink. Just curious what\u2019s the outlook here? I know it\u2019s really complicated. Just trying to better understand what we could expect or see on the volume front and perhaps on revenue too with U.S. debit? Thanks.","Vasant Prabhu","I\u2019ll take U.S. debit real quick. The adjustment as you know, the leap year has an impact on it. And so that\u2019s one factor. Interlink, we have that lapping effect from something we \u2013 a significant win we had in the fourth quarter of 2015, that continues for I guess another couple of quarters. In addition to that, we had a few a certain amount of volume going away from us. So that was an additional factor. And then there was a small impact from some effects in February around delayed tax refunds going to people. So debit was in general a little softer this quarter than credit was.","There\u2019s an ongoing shift in from credit to debit in the U.S. market. That\u2019s been going on for a while. So that\u2019s a range of factors, other than that, things have been pretty stable in the debit market.","Al Kelly","And as it relates to incentives, I would say that it\u2019s primarily timing, because most of the impact is on deals that are not done yet. So the terms are still not fully set, and obviously the volumes haven\u2019t started to take hold. it truly is kind of the $0.03 impact of timing that Vasant referenced in his remarks. ","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Craig Maurer of Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Craig Maurer","Yes hi thanks. I\u2019m sorry to go back to it, but I just want a clarification on the China co-badged card piece. As I understand, the co-badged card when it was used domestically, was picked up by CUP and when used in cross-border or was picked up by Visa. So in terms of the volume loss, are you saying that UnionPay is capturing some share from you in cross-border volume. Once the cards are reissued separately and that\u2019s why you are seeing slowdown in purchase volume.","And the second question is now that we\u2019re about 6 months in, have you seen material success in your initiatives with PayPal to move ACA to over to Visa cards. Thanks.","Vasant Prabhu","So dual-branded card can be used within China, and it can be used outside China. It\u2019s CUP that processes the transaction in China. It\u2019s Visa that processes transactions outside China. When you we use the dual-branded card, if the cross-border \u2013 if the new CUP card that\u2019s issued is used outside China, then we would lose the transaction. But we\u2019ve working very hard with our issuers to have them issue the so-called single currency card, which as Al described as companion card, which we would like Chinese travelers to use when they leave China. And when they do that, we pick up that cross-border transaction too, but it\u2019s hard to know how much of that will stay with us.","As it relates to the domestic volumes, there\u2019s a small amount of revenue we make on domestic volume. When we lose that domestic volume when the cards no longer are dual branded and usable in China, we lose a small amount of revenue.","Craig Maurer","And on PayPal.","Al Kelly","I\u2019m sorry what was the question on PayPal?","Craig Maurer","If you\u2019ve seen material success in the six months since signing the deal and moving volume from ACH onto Visa cards.","Al Kelly","Definitely, they lived up to the spirit of what we want, and it\u2019s a process that we\u2019re going through. But we feel good about the early days, and it\u2019s a ramp over time, and we\u2019ll see. But we feel good that we\u2019re ramping in the right direction.","Craig Maurer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan Keane","Yes hi guys. Just a couple of clarifications. Just on the personnel costs, they are up a lot. I think it was 33%. That was up after \u2013 up more than the 14% in the first quarter. But I just want to make sure I understand exactly what that was. It sounds like maybe it was employee bonus accruals due to good performance. That\u2019s still a significantly higher number. So I\u2019m trying to figure out that number, what it was? And does that continue at that rate going forward?","And just on the clarification on the second point on client incentives, does the pushout impact fiscal 2018? Or is it the pushout that impacts second half 2017? Thanks.","Vasant Prabhu","So I\u2019ll take the personnel costs and the other one too. On the personal costs, yes, client \u2013 I mean, incentive accruals were higher based on performance. And that there\u2019s a certain amount of catchup you have to do when you make adjustments for the entire first half. So that\u2019s a big component of it. There\u2019s always some pluses and minuses there. Certain FICA related costs start hitting you in the first calendar quarter of every year. Of course, our first \u2013 our second fiscal quarter is the first calendar quarter. So there\u2019s an element of seasonality as well as increase in some of those costs.","So it\u2019s one big item which is incentive accruals and a variety of other smaller items. But in general, we told you that our costs will ramp through the year as certain costs pick up through the year. And some of that is built into what you saw in the second quarter, and some of that will continue. And incentive accruals will stay higher through the back half of the year too, based on what our performance has been, assuming it stays at levels we\u2019ve had.","The other question was\u2026. ","Bryan Keane","That was regarding the client.","Vasant Prabhu","[Indiscernible] look, it\u2019s early to tell. You make assumptions on what\u2019s going to happen. And clearly, some things are already looking like they\u2019ll be in 2018, which we have factored into our thinking. But if you could more move into 2018? It\u2019s too early to tell.","Bryan Keane","Okay, thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Glenn Greene","Thanks, good afternoon. Just two questions quickly. Maybe for Vasant, I know you\u2019ve talked about the recontracting of the Europe deals, and that was part of the reason for the timing of the incentives. But more broadly, can you tell us sort of what proportion of the European volumes have been contracted or remain to be recontracted?","And then another question that\u2019s not the same, but on pricing, how much of a pricing benefit did you recognize or see directionally in the quarter of that 25% of gross revenue? And did you see a full quarter impact on that pricing?","Vasant Prabhu","Yes I don\u2019t know if your second question is also about Europe. But as you\u2019ve said, as we\u2019ve said, I mean we indicated a while ago that we don\u2019t really talk about pricing actions we\u2019ve taken in any particular market. We sometimes talk about U.S. pricing actions because they are fairly visible to everyone. So we really \u2013 but those of you talk to people in Europe will get a sense of what is going on in that market. So from a price standpoint, there have been some actions taken and our yields our, we think, headed in a direction that you expect it to have them go. So that was as it relates to pricing.","In terms of the process of replacing rebates with incentives, as we\u2019ve said several times, there are contracts in place, and these volumes are under contract. What we\u2019re trying to do is to make sure that these contracts are commercially competitive in a world where the issuers with whom these contracts have been done prior to the sale of Visa Europe when they were owners of Visa Europe, are still competitive. Because when they were owners of Visa Europe, are still competitive. Because when they were owners, they got a payment called rebates, which was more of an ownership payment. As those payments go away, we want to make sure that Visa commercial arrangements from a commercial standing remain competitive, so that when they come up for renewal, we have competitive pricing.","So the contracts are in place. It\u2019s really the commercial terms that are being modified.","Glenn Greene","Yes, that\u2019s really what I was asking. I was just trying, where are you in that, moving all these arrangements to commercial arrangements?","Al Kelly","I think that we\u2019re in process. I think I said earlier, we\u2019re a little bit further behind than we thought we might be. But put it simply when you go get to each of these clients, have the discussions that are usually multiple discussions, and then getting it lawyered up, et cetera is taking a little bit longer than we thought. And so we still have a good amount of work ahead of us in the second half of the year. And that\u2019s why there\u2019s the impact that we talked about on clients incentives move timing being kind of what our estimate is of the $0.03.","Vasant Prabhu","Christine at this time we have time for one last question.","Operator","Okay, and our last question is from Chris Donat from Sandler O\u2019Neill. Your line is now open.","Chris Donat","Thanks for taking my question. Vasant, at the risk of annoying you with one more question on incentives, and think about 2018, is the safest place to start about our assumptions of what 2018 incentive ratio will be, the midpoint of the 2017 guidance? Because it was more like 19% for the first half of the fiscal year. It looks like it would be like 23% for the back half. And I know it\u2019s impossible to predict it accurately. We don\u2019t know all the terms. But anyway, I\u2019m just thinking is the midpoint of a full year for this year a reasonable place to start for next year.","Vasant Prabhu","Well it\u2019s too early for us to give you anything precise about next year. As you know, these things are best talked about in ranges. But we\u2019ve given you our best sense of what the range is likely to be this year and I believe that gives sense of what the range is likely to be this year and I believe Jack has told me that the ranges we\u2019ve given in the past, while one quarter or another, we may be below the range, perhaps one of these quarters will be above the range. We generally end up being in the range for the year. And that\u2019s our best sense of where the current range is for client incentives as a percent of gross revenues. Beyond that, it\u2019s too early to talk about 2018. We can tell you more about it as we get closer to the end of the year. ","Chris Donat","Understood.","Jack Carsky","Thanks Chris. Thank you all for joining us today. If anybody has additional follow-up questions feel free to give myself or Joon or Victoria a call. Thanks again for joining.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"22388":["Visa, Inc.

Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Visa, Inc.'s 2016 fiscal fourth quarter and full fiscal year earnings conference call. Joining us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa's Chief Executive Officer; and Vasant Prabhu, Visa's Chief Financial Officer.

Scharf - Visa, Inc.","Thanks very much, Jack, and good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for taking the time to join us.","Let me start with a few comments about our fiscal fourth quarter financial results. First of all, as you can see with the inclusion of Visa Europe, the quarter and our thoughts on next year will be somewhat complicated, but we will do our best to provide clarity on what's driving our results both in my remarks but probably more importantly in Vasant's remarks as he goes through the detail.","Overall, we feel very good about the solid financial results in the fourth quarter. The results were better than our expectations. GAAP EPS of $0.79 included two special items, the $110 million charge for severance costs and the $88 million non-cash and non-recurring gain for the remeasurement of the deferred tax liability related to the acquisition of Visa Europe. Excluding these items, fourth quarter adjusted GAAP EPS was $0.78 per share, an increase of 27%.","Net operating revenue grew 19% this quarter, including the full quarter of Visa Europe and a continued negative 3 percentage point impact from FX. While growth continues to be subdued by some of the same items we've spoken about previously, we're starting to see improvements as we expected, and our business model, as you've seen, continues to be resilient. I would be remiss if I didn't mention last week's 18% dividend increase to $0.165 per quarter. We continue to be consistent in returning excess capital to our shareholders.","Let me turn now and talk for a couple of minutes about payments volume. U.S. payments volume growth was 11% in the fourth quarter, up 1 percentage point from Q3. U.S. credit payments volume improved to 19% from 11% in the June quarter, primarily driven by the positive impact of Costco and USAA. U.S. debit payments volume grew at 3%, down from 9% in the quarter. The lower growth was primarily driven by Interlink, and remember, the impact to revenue of this is minimal. International payments constant dollar volume growth ex-Europe was 9%. Cross-border volume growth accelerated to 10% \u2013 when normalized for Europe, up from 9% in the third quarter. Process transaction growth was 12% and accelerated 1 point from the third quarter when normalized for Europe as well.","More recently, through October 21, U.S. payment volume growth was 12%, up 1 percentage point from the fourth quarter. U.S. credit grew 20%, up 1 percentage point from the September quarter. U.S. debit grew 5%, an improvement from the 3% in the fiscal Q4. Cross-border growth in constant dollars is 11% when normalized for Europe, and processed transactions was 12% when normalized for Europe. Just a few comments about Europe. The integration itself is going extremely well. We just couldn't be happier with the interaction between the two companies, and we are well underway to putting all of the functions together and operating seamlessly as one global entity.","Importantly, renewal activity continues to be very strong. We've signed multiyear debit agreements with RBS and Lloyds Banking Group and multiyear credit and debit agreements with Barclays and Nationwide. We have very good engagement with clients on our product and our digital roadmap, including Visa Checkout, which is being rolled out as we speak. Vasant will discuss in more detail how we're doing financially but things are playing out as we would've expected so far. And around rest of the globe, client activity continues to remain very strong. To name just a few, we renewed a multiyear debit and credit partnership with BBVA Bancomer, Mexico. We renewed our credit partnership with China Merchants Bank and China CITIC Bank. And in Russia, we renewed multiyear credit partnerships with Alfa-Bank and VTB24.","If you turn just to talk for a couple of minutes about Visa Checkout. We ended fiscal 2016 with over 15 million consumer accounts in 21 countries, and over 1,400 financial institution partners across the globe participating. More than 300,000 merchants, including some of the largest global retailers have signed on to accept Visa Checkout, representing $162 billion in addressable volume. In October, we rolled out a redesigned Visa Checkout experience to all global merchants. This new experience makes it easier for consumers to sign up and complete purchases on mobile devices.","We also announced earlier today that we're opening the Visa Checkout platform to clients and partners, allowing them to integrate their digital wallets into Visa Checkout for streamlined authentication and checkout. Leading Visa financial institutions and partners, such as Google's Android Pay, will take advantage of the new open platform by offering Visa Checkout to their customers for online purchases. Issuers, digital wallets and payment app providers can access a streamline set of APIs to easily integrate Visa Checkout open platform and immediately begin to offer payments to their customers shopping online on their mobile devices. For example, an online shopper who uses a digital wallet from a participating Visa issuer or Android Pay would simply click the Visa Checkout button on a merchant's checkout page and authenticate their identity through biometrics to complete a purchase.","Let me move on to another topic. We continue to invest in new products and services to help our merchant clients. In September, we announced Visa advertising solutions, a new suite of products specifically built to help merchants reach new customers and understand if their digital advertising efforts are influencing consumer purchases, purchasing decisions online and in-store. Visa Ad Measurement and Visa Audiences are products that integrate with ad tech platforms like Oracle Data Cloud, allowing Visa's merchants to easily access valuable insights when executing a digital ad campaign. Top quick service restaurants and retail merchants such as Banana Republic have used Visa Ad Measurement reports to understand sales impact and optimize their marketing campaigns. Visa Advertising Solutions are available to merchants through leading digital platforms such as Facebook, Google, Twitter, Pinterest, and over 200 other media networks.","We've spoken about this before, but I do want to highlight the success that we're seeing in our global network of innovation centers. In addition to One Market Street in San Francisco, we've opened innovation centers in Singapore in April, Dubai in May, Miami in June, and plans to launch one in New York in January as well as London and S\u00e3o Paulo.","In 2016 alone, we held over 600 client engagements globally with over 200 clients participating. These range from tours and demos to multi-day hackathons and in-depth co-creation sessions. These are forums where we can demonstrate where we think payments are going in each geography, but our goal is to develop real-time solutions with clients that they can implement very quickly.","Fast payments continues to be an important opportunity around the world, and we're having good success working with clients and partners to capture the opportunity using our Visa Direct push payment product platform. Annual Visa Direct PV exceeds $29 billion globally for the period ending September 16, and annual U.S. Visa Direct volumes topped $5 billion for the first time ending September 2016. Growth exceeds 250% from the same period last year. Globally, nearly 3 billion Visa cards are enabled to receive push payments. We're working with key partners, including EWS, FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry, Stripe, Ingo Money, Square, and Green Dot.","I also want to talk for a minute about how we're using push payments to electronify payments in developing economies. We recently launched a new service called mVisa in India, Kenya, and Rwanda, and we plan to expand to several other markets around the world during 2017. mVisa allows a consumer to transfer money to a merchant in real time with nothing more than their mobile phone, and merchants are able to start accepting Visa transactions immediately without any additional hardware. We've seen early success in several different categories, including small micro-merchants, local transportation such as taxi, and bill payment. You'll likely hear much more in the future about these efforts.","Tokenization continues to be a very important part of ensuring safe and secure mobile payment solutions. We recently announced new specifications that allow certified third parties to connect directly to our Token Service and become Token Service Providers. These TSPs will be able to provide a range of services for Visa tokens, including new account provisioning and life cycle management. By expanding access to the Visa Token Service to new partners, Visa issuers will be able to more quickly and easily offer secure digital payment services across a wide range of devices.","I'll let Vasant talk in detail about our outlook for 2017, but just a few comments from me. We enter 2017 certainly with fewer headwinds as we did entering 2016, and we do have some tailwinds. On the negative side, the global economy is not improving. Geopolitical tensions are high. The U.S. election is a wild card, and we continue to watch the impact of Brexit. But Costco and USAA meaningfully improved volumes, with USAA being an important contributor to revenues in the U.S., while Costco far less so. Cross-border volumes are both lapping decreases and have improved, and we will have a full-year benefit from Europe, which as I said, is performing as expected.","Since this is my last call, I do want to make just a few closing comments. I'm so proud to have been associated with Visa, its clients, its partners, and its employees. I hope you feel that this is a different company than four years ago and that the things we've done have positioned the company well for the future. We've focused our work on providing payments leadership and a platform which will enable our clients, all clients, to grow their franchises.","The competition is strong and the canvas is still being painted as the industry evolves, but our position is strong and our assets are exceptional. And always keep in mind as we think about what's going on around the world and we look at the risks and opportunity, this is a very global business. The competitive issues are different geography by geography, but opportunities exist around the world for us to grow our share. While there's always risk and many are trying to figure out how to advantage themselves as commerce moves to digital platforms, there is more opportunity globally than ever before for Visa.","Vasant?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Thank you, Charlie.","For the full quarter of Visa Europe and our numbers for the first time, we had a strong finish to fiscal year 2016. On a GAAP basis, fiscal fourth quarter revenues were up 19%, operating income up 15%, and EPS up 28%. We closed FY 2016 with full-year revenues of $15 billion, net income of $6 billion, and EPS at $2.48. On an adjusted basis, operating income for the fourth quarter was up 20% and EPS was up 27%. Net income for the full year was $6.9 billion, and EPS was $2.84.","For the remainder of my comments, I will be referring to adjusted results. A few points to note; first, payment volumes on a constant dollar basis continue to grow at double-digit rates globally. The secular shift away from cash continues at a fast clip around the world. Credit growth outstripped debit growth, helped by Costco and USAA. Second, cross-border constant dollar volume growth recovered to double-digit levels. The dollar has stabilized, helping our large U.S. acquired business. In addition, oil price stability and a nascent recovery in emerging markets has helped outbound commerce across most regions. Only Europe slowed due to general economic weakness as well as the impact of the Brexit vote on the euro and the pound. Easier year-over-year comparisons are also helping.","Third, we had two special items in the quarter that largely offset each other. We took a charge for severance costs associated with actions we are implementing across Visa, including the reductions we're planning to make at Visa Europe. The consultation process is underway in Europe, and we expect it will be completed before the end of 2016, after which we will begin to implement the agreed-upon plan. As we integrate Europe into the rest of Visa, we have taken the opportunity, as we told you we would, to look at our global cost structure and will make some adjustments. Offsetting this charge was a non-recurring, non-cash tax benefit from the reduction in the UK corporate tax rate, which reduced our UK deferred tax liability.","Finally, as you know, we issued preferred shares for the Visa Europe acquisition. We also bought back 20.5 million shares in the fourth quarter for $1.66 billion. We ended the quarter with a weighted average share count of 2.44 billion, up 54 million from Q3. For the full year fiscal year 2016, we bought back 92 million shares for $7.1 billion, at an average price of $77.13. This was approximately $2 billion higher than what our normal course buyback would have been last year. The additional buyback reflects our intent to offset the dilutive impact of the preferred shares issued, and will continue into early fiscal year 2018, as we previously indicated.","I'll quickly review business drivers and financial results for the quarter and fiscal year 2016; then spend most of my time on our outlook for FY 2017. At least for this quarter, we will highlight the impact of adding in Visa Europe where it is helpful to better understand our results. U.S. payment volumes grew 11% in Q4 as U.S. credit grew 19%, helped by USAA and Costco volumes. U.S. debit grew 3% due to lapping a significant new account win in our Interlink business in Q4 last year and the impact of PIN Debit routing this quarter.","Adjusted for Interlink volumes, the U.S. debit growth trend was unchanged from the prior quarter. As merchants make routing decisions based on incentive deals in place with various networks, we expect there will continue to be volatility in our Interlink growth rates. However, given the relative size of this business, the impact on our total revenues will be minimal. International payment volumes ex-Europe grew 9% in constant dollars. The tick down from the prior quarter trend was largely due to the lapping effect of a large Chinese bank that started including previously unreported domestic volumes in Q3 last year. Ex-China, growth rates remain strong in Asia as","well as Latin America. The Middle East and Russia was stable but Sub-Saharan Africa was a soft spot. In Europe, new regulations that went into effect in June no longer require issuers of co-badged cards to report domestic volumes we do not process. This will distort year-over-year comparisons throughout fiscal year 2017.","Excluding Europe, cross-border constant dollar growth rates stepped up to 10% in Q4. This was the first time we have reported double-digit cross-border volume growth since Q4 fiscal year 2014. The weakening dollar is driving the recovery in our large U.S. acquired business as well as outbound commerce from Canada. Cross-border growth in North America climbed to 9%, a rate of growth we have not seen since the end of 2013. Internationally, cross-border growth rate stepped up across all geographies, helped by stabilizing oil prices and recovering emerging markets. Cross-border growth rates in China have stabilized in the mid-single digits. The only region ticking down in growth was Europe, as the weak pound post-Brexit has hurt outbound commerce from the UK","Excluding Europe, transactions processed over VisaNet grew 11%. The small step up from the prior quarter was due to the NSPK effect in Russia. As you know, our reported transactions growth was hurt in the past five quarters as we transitioned processing to NSPK starting in the third quarter of fiscal year 2015. Transactions processed in Europe grew 15%, in line with the previous quarter. Net revenues grew 19% in Q4, 6% excluding the impact of Europe. Expenses grew 18%, 5% excluding Europe.","We finished the year with adjusted EPS of $2.84. If you exclude the impact of the Visa Europe acquisition, which is interest expense from the debt issued, the shares issued, as well as Europe's income and other one-time items, our EPS grew 10% in nominal dollars and 14% in constant dollars. We were able to deliver this growth despite a soft revenue picture caused by the strong dollar, the oil and commodity price collapse impacting many regions, as well as a slowdown in China. We were able to hold fiscal year 2016 expense growth to 1% ex-Europe while continuing to invest heavily in all our critical long-term initiatives such as Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, Visa Developer platform, our Innovation Centers, our marketing around the Rio Olympics and other programs.","We enter fiscal year 2017 with some tailwinds. Costco and USAA conversions are now well underway, as you saw from our Q4 payment volumes. Cross-border growth rates have recovered as the dollar stabilizes and we have easier year-over-year comparisons. Two significant drags from prior year's is the translation impact of the strong dollar and gas price declines. We begin to benefit from the Visa Europe acquisition with yield improvements, cost reductions, and EPS accretion.","Balancing these tailwinds are some headwinds: economic weakness in Europe and Brexit uncertainty hurting both domestic and cross-border volumes; a global economy that remains generally sluggish; a potential decline in Treasury revenues as volatility subsides from the extraordinary high levels we have experienced in the past two years; and finally, a step-up in client incentives as we bring on Costco and other major renewals, as well as folding in Europe. We'll review how all these factors drive our outlook for 2017 starting with payments volumes.","USAA and Costco will drive payments volume growth in the U.S. However, we expect international payments volume growth to slow down modestly due to weakness in Europe and China. Reported European payment volume numbers will be distorted by the change in co-badged volume reporting. If no co-badge volume is included, reported European payment volumes could be down 15% to 20% dragging the reported global payments growth down by as much 7 to 8 percentage points with a larger impact in the first three quarters.","As you saw in Q4, cross-border volumes are recovering helped by easier comparisons, a stabilizing dollar and oil prices as well as improving emerging market economies. In Europe, cross-border growth rates have been trending down through fiscal year 2016 and we anticipate that this will continue as the pound remains weak and economies across Europe struggle. Inbound commerce into the U.S. will likely grow after two consecutive years of decline. Outbound commerce is expected to recover in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America. In Asia, Chinese cross-border growth appear to have stabilized.","The recovery in cross-border growth maybe offset to some degree by a decline in currency volatilities and the revenue we derive from it. Currency volatilities have been extraordinarily high for the past couple of years, well above long-term averages. At some point there will be a reversion to the mean or even an overcorrection in the other direction like we saw in 2014. For purposes of our outlook, we're resuming what we did last year, a reversion to the mean in fiscal year 2017. But as they say, it will be what it will be. With the NSPK transition behind us in Russia, debit gains in Brazil, Costco and USAA volumes in the U.S., we expect process transactions growth to tick up in FY 2017 ex-Europe. European process transaction growth rates will slow down as we lap the rapid acceleration of contactless transactions in the UK in fiscal year 2016.","We finished FY 2016 with client incentives as a percent of gross revenues, approaching 19% in the second half. Our outlook anticipates a range of 20.5% to 21.5% in fiscal year 2017, a 1.5 points to 2.5 points increase. There are several factors driving this increase. About half of the year-over-year increase is driven by the inclusion of Visa Europe for the full year, and the impact of eliminating rebates and replacing them with performance-based client incentives. In our filings with Visa Europe numbers for the first three quarters of FY 2016 that you have seen, U.S. GAAP accounting requires that rebates are netted from gross revenues. When we eliminated rebates at the end of September, it has the effect of increasing Visa Europe's gross fiscal year 2017 revenues and in parallel, Visa Europe's fiscal year 2017 client incentives, as we replace these rebates with appropriate market competitive incentives.","The net effect of this change in the European pricing structure and the overall level of client incentives in Europe accounts for about half the increase from 19% in Q4 to the range we provided for fiscal year 2017. The other half of the year-over-year step-up in client incentives as a percent of gross revenues is driven by a full year of Costco incentives, and the impact of several large renewals completed in fiscal year 2016, particularly in Asia. When you put all this together, we expect constant dollar net revenue growth in the high teens in fiscal year 2017, moderated to the 16% to 18% range in nominal dollars by an estimated 1-point to 1.5-point exchange rate impact. This currency translation impact may be larger than you are anticipating, based on dollar spot rates of forward curves. Let me explain why this is the case.","It has to do with our longstanding practice of layering on monthly hedges, no different than what most global companies do. This approach to hedging is not seeking to make directional bets on currencies, but rather to dampen the effect of changes in the trend of the dollar. When the dollar strengthens, these hedges delay the cost, and when the dollar weakens, they delay the benefit, essentially mitigating volatility. In fiscal year 2016, the hedges helped in the first half, and then as the dollar started to weaken, they hurt in the second half. This will continue into fiscal year 2017. The hedges in place will be a drag in the first half. If the dollar stabilizes as currency forwards are suggesting, they will be neutral in the second half. The total exchange rate drag on net revenues could be 2 points, 2.5 points in the first quarter, comparable to Q4 FY 2016, moderating through the year to 0.5 point in Q4 FY 2017.","On the expense front, we will continue to invest as aggressively as we need to on all our key growth initiatives, including the global expansion of Visa Checkout, Visa Token Service, and Visa Innovation Centers. We will continue to build on our Visa Developer platform, our data and analytics capabilities, loyalty and offers, mVisa, and other key programs. In parallel, as we have done in fiscal year 2017, we will look to gain efficiencies in other parts of our business by enhancing productivity and adding capabilities in lower cost locations. Excluding Europe, we expect expense growth to return to the mid-single digit range in fiscal year 2017.","In terms of the expense base in Europe, after the consultation process is completed, we will implement our plan. While this will reduce costs in some areas, we will be investing in Europe to roll out Visa Checkout and our other digital services, as well as adding to our sales and marketing resources to bring all the benefits of Global Visa to our European clients as fast as we can. We will also incur approximately $80 million in Visa Europe integration costs in fiscal year 2017. These are costs to harmonize the two technology platforms. Our technology teams are in the process of aligning authorization clearance and settlement systems, upgrading network compute and storage infrastructure, implementing next generation information security systems, preparing to move to common end user and corporate platform.","As you may recall, we had indicated that the technology integration would not be completed until late 2019, early 2020. We had estimated total integration costs in the $450 million to $500 million range over this timeframe. While these are not recurring costs, we will incur these costs for the next three years until we complete the full integration of Visa Europe. We will call these costs out as we have in our outlook, however, we do not plan to adjust these costs from our GAAP numbers when we report each quarter. Of course, these integration costs will not be incurred once the technology integration is complete. Also, as we have indicated, additional cost savings will be realized when we combine the technology platform.","It is important to highlight one item that you need to adjust for as you consolidate Visa Europe into Visa, Inc. Prior to the acquisition, as you all know, there were intercompany charges that flowed between Visa Europe and Visa, Inc. These were expenses for Visa Europe and revenues for Visa, Inc.","The largest item was the Visa Europe license fee. The other major charge was for network processing services provided by Visa, Inc. Through the first three quarters of fiscal year 2016, these intercompany charges amounted to $191 million. Two-thirds were recognized as other revenues in the Visa, Inc. income statement, and the remainder in data processing revenues. At Visa Europe, one-third of the expense hit the network and processing line, and most of the rest was in G&A with a small amount in personnel.","Post the acquisition, these intercompany revenues and expenses completely offset one another and are eliminated in consolidation. Therefore, none of these revenues and expense amounts are included in the reported fourth quarter numbers or will be included going forward. If you do not adjust for these changes, your FY 2016 baseline for Visa Europe operating expenses would be overstated by $191 million, as would your fiscal year 2016 baseline for Visa, Inc. revenues.","In terms of costs related to China market entry, the timing remains uncertain. We had assumed we would be much further along at this point when we talked to you last year. It is our intent to move very fast to set up our processing infrastructure once we have greater clarity from the PBOC around timelines for their decision for granting licenses. At this point, it is difficult to know for sure what costs related to China market entry will be incurred in fiscal year 2017. We have made some assumptions in our outlook and will update you as we learn more.","Moving on to interest and taxes, interest expense will increase almost 40% in fiscal year 2017 from a full year of interest on the $16 billion in debt issued in December 2015 as well as the $2 billion in debt we plan to issue before the end of this calendar year, market conditions permitting. Our fiscal year 2017 tax rate will increase due to Visa Europe. As you know, under the current structure, Visa Europe is a U.S. taxpayer. The current tax structure affords us some cash tax benefits but has the effect of increasing our book or GAAP tax rate due to restrictions on the credits we can take on taxes we pay in the UK. As we had indicated previously, this structure increases our reported tax rate by 100 basis points to the low-30s range.","As you estimate our fiscal year 2017 EPS, it's important to remember that we issued 79 million preferred shares as part of the consideration for Visa Europe. These shares are now included in our fully diluted share count, which is up 54 million net of buybacks completed in the fourth quarter. We have ramped up our buyback program to offset the dilutive impact of the shares issued. In fiscal year 2017, our bought back almost $5 billion more roughly at the same level as fiscal year 2016. At this pace, by the end of 2017, we would have bought back almost $5 billion more than our normal course buyback or offset almost 80% of stock issued. We will maintain the stepped up pace of buybacks till we complete this program in early fiscal year 2018.","With a full year of interest expense as well as $2 billion more in debt, with a higher GAAP tax rate, and with additional shares outstanding, our EPS growth rate in fiscal year 2017 will be lower than net revenue growth. In nominal terms, our outlook anticipates mid-teens EPS growth from an adjusted fiscal year 2016 baseline of $2.84. This includes a 1.5 to 2 point drag from exchange rates, mostly due to the impact of hedging described earlier. As with revenues, the drag from exchange rates will be higher than the first half, comparable to fourth quarter 2016 levels in Q1, and moderating through the year.","Our EPS outlook assumes EPS accretion from Visa Europe will be in the 2% to 3% range in fiscal year 2017 as expected. The accretive impact of Visa Europe is greater in the second and third quarters when we had interest expense last year from debt issued for the transaction but no income from Visa Europe till the fourth quarter. Also benefits from our cost reduction actions start being realized in the second quarter. Visa Europe is tracking well relative to our expectations, and we remain confident that accretion will climb to the high-single digit range by 2020 once we have implemented all our plans to improve yield and lower costs.","In summary, we feel good about fiscal year 2017. The Visa Europe integration is proceeding well and delivering as expected. Payment volume momentum remains robust globally. Transactions growth remains healthy. Cross-border volumes are recovering as the dollar stabilizes and comparisons become easier. Gas prices and exchange rate drags are easing.","As always, there are risks to watch. The global economy remains sluggish, especially in Europe. The cross-border business in Europe is slowing. Currency volatility could moderate. Balancing these factors, our fiscal year 2017 outlook anticipates 16% to 18% net revenue growth and mid-teens EPS growth in nominal dollars. As always, we will update our views as the year unfolds and share them with you each quarter.","With that, I'll turn the call back to Jack.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, Vasant. Laura, at this time, we're ready to start taking questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is from Tien-Tsin Huang from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Tien-Tsin Huang - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks for all the details, and I have a lot to go through here. I wanted to ask on revenue growth contribution from Visa Europe assumed in fiscal 2017. What's being assumed there? And what's the Visa Europe yield assumption as well? Do you need yields to rise in order to hit guidance? Thank you and best wishes to you, Charlie.","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","Thanks, Tien-Tsin.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Tien-Tsin, going through your questions, if you look at next year, I think we tried to give you as much as we can in terms of what we see in terms of trends. So clearly from a growth rate standpoint, you have a sense of what growth in Europe has been this year. We are seeing, as you saw through the year, some slowdown in the cross-border growth rate. We're seeing some slowdown in the payment volume growth rate. But overall, it will be a decent year of growth in Europe, though not as high as we are seeing in other parts of the world or in the U.S. So that's Europe growth.","In terms of yields, yes, yields are assumed to improve. Some of that we anticipate will happen from some of the actions we are in the process of implementing, like what we told you. The elimination of rebates and the replacement with client incentives and some other actions we're doing. So you will see yields improve. But as we look ahead, Visa Europe will be an integral part of Visa, and you will start to see the impact of Visa Europe in the aggregate numbers we report and what happens to our yields from the new baseline you have in yields and so on. So hopefully that helps. We tried to give you as much detail as we can on what the current trend is, and it will help you figure out what Europe is contributing as you look ahead.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Our next question is from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","James Schneider - Goldman Sachs","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Best wishes to you, Charlie. I was wondering if you can maybe just frame, besides all the details, at the highest level, when you think about the guidance for 2017 that you offered, when you think about that versus last year, whether you think it's more or less conservative than last year in terms of your overall approach. And can you maybe talk about what's the biggest factor about Visa Europe outside of the consumer trends that could drive that either to the positive or negative side, whether it be client renewals or anything else?","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","I'll do the first, and I'll let Vasant do the second. I think you should expect that the answer from us to be that in both years, we try and be as accurate as we can. And obviously, there's a tremendous amount of assumptions that go into this. And I've said this time and time again, which is you all put all this weight on what we're telling you 2017 will be. And what we try and make clear is there's a series of things that we know and there's a series of things we don't know. And the series of things we don't know \u2013 but where we're making assumptions, we try and lay those out for you. And quite frankly, you've got to make your own determination whether you think those are aggressive or conservative. But I'll tell you, it's certainly not in any of our bones and hasn't been in any part of Visa's bones since it went public to be on the aggressive side.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Just to reiterate what we're expecting, and again, I think we tried to give you as factual a point of view as we can. Our revenue growth if you adjust for the exchange rate drag, which perhaps you may not have anticipated without thinking about the hedging implications, and you might have seen the hedging implications in our second half results. Our currency impact essentially stayed flat through the year mostly because hedging helped in the first half and hurt a bit in the second half. And all it does really is delay the impact of the moves in the dollar. But if you adjust for the hedging impact, what you're seeing in high teens revenue growth \u2013 net revenue growth. And what you're seeing is mid-teens plus 1.5 to 2 points EPS growth. It's not that different than perhaps what you might have expected of us going into the year.","Visa Europe is tracking as we expected. We feel very good about it. What could surprise one way or another, we laid out all the factors. Clearly, the cross-border trends are heartening. And hopefully, if the dollar stays on this track, which is either stable or further weakening, that would be good for us. I think currency forwards are now expecting more of a flattening of the dollar, which is what we've assumed.","In terms of the currency volatility front, that's a little bit of anybody's guess. We did tell you sort of what we're assuming. But overall, I mean, if there is going to be anything on the plus or minus side, we have assumed that the European trends have softened through the year, and we've assumed that those trends will continue into next year. Hopefully European economies will do better than that, and if that does, that'll be great.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW. Your line is now open.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thanks. Just maybe on the incentives, obviously, they're going up a decent amount. Is some of it because you've had better success than you thought in re-signing some of these banks? And maybe, Vasant, you can just talk about how we should consider the trajectory after 2017, given this backdrop? Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","I think we'll talk more about all that as we get into the latter part of 2017 when we talk about 2018. But trajectory-wise, I wouldn't assume significant changes. Visa Europe is now part of the numbers, and that explains, as we told you earlier, about half the delta. And there's also this impact we get when we pull back the rebates. It has the effect of raising gross revenues and incentives at the same time. So Visa Europe lands up at a place where their incentives as a percent of gross revenues are certainly driving the new level. Beyond that, yes, we have Costco coming in for a full year. That certainly adds to it. And we had some significant renewals, in particular, Asian geographies. So this \u2013 you should assume that this is a level that is about where we should see it stay, but we'll update you as we get through this year.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Friedman from Susquehanna. Your line is now open.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","This may be more of a housekeeping question, Vasant, but historically, looking at page 13 from the third quarter slides, you used to give constant dollar growth and then adjust for the foreign exchange. Now you're giving a nominal dollar growth and then calling out the foreign exchange. I'm just wondering what \u2013 philosophically is the adjustment, because that's kind of an important change in the messaging.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","I think you're reading too much into it. I think as a general rule, we've gone through all our releases and we try to lead with what is the GAAP number and follow with what's the adjusted number. So you've seen us do that almost everywhere, and you should not read too much into it really. And also, the currency impact certainly is moderating, but I wouldn't say that's the reason why it follows rather than leads. It has more to do with wanting to lead with GAAP numbers wherever we can.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Bryan C. Keane - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys. Just on the quarter, you guys had said that the results were better than expected. Just not exactly clear what drove the better-than-expected results; if you could maybe highlight some things that drove better than what you guys anticipated? And then on Visa Europe, I know it was 13 points to 14 points of contribution to revenue in the fourth quarter, at least that was the guidance. I'm just not sure or clear what that contribution will be for fiscal year 2017 in that same manner. Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","In the fourth quarter, I would say on the margin, revenue was a little better, but expenses were better and the tax rate was a little bit better. So in aggregate, it was a little better than we expected. As far as next year goes \u2013 and now Visa Europe is an integral part of our business. We tend not to \u2013 we do not separate out our regions. So you would \u2013 so we would report everything on an aggregated basis and not separate out Visa Europe. It becomes more and more integrated in, and \u2013 it's best to sort of look at it on an aggregate basis. But we've given you enough so that you will get a good sense of what Visa Europe contributed, and as you model next year, I think it will give you a good sense of what Visa Europe will contribute to next year.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tom McCrohan from CLSA. Your line is now open.","Thomas McCrohan - CLSA Americas LLC","Hi, thank you. Can you just give us the progress of the number of the Visa European banks that you still need to finalize in terms of moving into an incentive structure? Thanks.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","It's an active process. It's well underway. We're happy with the progress. There's a well-choreographed process, which talks to a large number of issuers. So I don't know if there's much more than that we would say at this point.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Craig Maurer from Autonomous. Your line is now open.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Hi, thanks. Wow, it sounds like China is trailing expectations in terms of when you can get up and running. Could you comment on Mexico and when you think Mexico could be accretive to numbers? Thanks.","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","Let me just start with China for a second. I've said this, I think, over and over and over again. And so this will be the last chance I'll get to say it, which is China is a very important opportunity for us. It's something that we spend a lot of time on and we take very seriously. But it's a long-term opportunity. And long-term is not measured in months or even single-digits numbers of years. So the work and our thought process that we have going on with China does not demand that we're allowed market entry at any specific date. We've said we're committed for the long-term. We don't expect it to be a meaningfully different contributor to the revenue growth or the profits of the company in the shorter period of time because there's a lot that's out of our control. And so as we sit here today, as we think about our forecasting over the next bunch of years, we don't rely on China when we think about the opportunities for us to continue to grow the company. At some point, we do believe that they will pan out but, again, that's a longer-term opportunity rather than a shorter-term opportunity.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","There's really not much to say about Mexico. I mean that is an ongoing discussion we're having. And over time, if there are new developments...","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","I'm not sure what the question is on Mexico.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","I presume about processing transactions.","Craig Jared Maurer - Autonomous Research US LP","Yeah.","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","Yeah. So that one's client-by-client, and we have some good discussions going on where it's up to us to talk about the benefits that clients get when we process transactions. And when there's something to talk about relative to movement in the marketplace, I'm sure Vasant, you'll do it.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jason Kupferberg from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Alan Kupferberg - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. So just on cross-border, it was great to see us get back to double-digit growth organic. And I know there's a bunch of moving parts for fiscal 2017 in that regard. But are you expecting double-digit growth to continue through 2017 as part of your guidance? And then just a quick housekeeping separate from that. Can you tell us what percent of your European volumes are from UK?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","What percent of our European volumes are from the UK? Yeah. If I remember right, I think it was \u2013 from a revenue standpoint, we've told you that revenues from the UK were a little above 10%. So that gives you a rough idea. In terms of our cross-border business, what we saw in the fourth quarter, as we mentioned, was a nice recovery in the U.S. acquired business. We also saw quite a bit of growth in the acquired business in the UK from the weakness of the pound. We saw improvement in the acquired business in places like Mexico mostly benefiting from the U.S. Those are some of the big growth spots. The good news, though, was from an issuing standpoint, we saw growth in a lot of places. We saw growth coming out of Brazil, out of Russia, out of many of the commodity and oil-based economies, Middle East and parts of Asia also improving and China beginning to stabilize. So our expectation going forward is not for a significant change from these trends. You should assume we're hoping that these trends stay roughly about the same.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Glenn Greene from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Glenn? If you're talking, you're on mute. Glenn?","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hey guys, can you hear me?","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","Yes, Glenn. There we go.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay, sorry about that. A couple of number clarifications, maybe for Vasant. The first one, could you give us what the constant currency volume growth in Europe was? And then of the \u2013 the question would be also of the percentage of European transactions that are processed, meaning included in the Visa process transactions. And then, if I heard right, I just want to clarify that you're expecting mid-teen decline in Europe volume because of the co-badging issue?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Let me talk a little bit about that. I believe the \u2013 I think we reported this. I think we had most people report their co-badge volumes in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter number ended up being relatively untainted by lack of reporting, and I think the payment volumes, if I remember right, were somewhere in the 6% range.","So as you can see, they are lower than what we see in other parts of the world, in terms of growth rates. As you look at next year, the issue on co-badge volumes is that there are a certain number of issuers that have co-badge cards with us who are no longer required to report their co-badge volumes and transactions we do not process. The biggest impact is in France, and there's some impact in some Scandinavian countries. If they don't all report, which is what we expect, we expect that they will all not report, then payment volumes will decline next year, we said as much as 15% to 20%. So remember, I mean, if it's plus 6% and minus 20%, that's a delta of almost 25% or 26%.","Plus, as you know in the first three quarters, Visa Europe payment volumes will show up as all incremental to our payment volume and will have this impact on it. So you will see a fair amount of distortion in payment volume reporting as a result of this. Now, the lack of payment volume reporting and its revenue impacts we've factored into our outlook. So that is all factored into what we told you our revenue picture is next year. But the payment volumes will look odd. Although we report by region, so at least you'll be able to see what it is by region and be able to look at how everybody else is doing, and Europe will just look odd.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, Laura.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Lisa Ellis from Bernstein. Your line is now open.","Lisa D. Ellis - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi, Charlie. As you're closing out your tenure with Visa, unfortunately for all of us, could you just do a brief kind of look back over some of the major pieces of Visa's strategy over your tenure? Particularly around the merchant side, just putting that in context of your announcement around the Visa Ad Measurement capabilities. And then also on the B2B side with the call-outs related to Visa Direct, and then the recent announcement with Chain around B2B Connect, and just how you see the progress in some of those major pieces of your strategy over the last couple of years?","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","Listen, first of all, I think \u2013 and I really do believe this, which is it's \u2013 and I said this when we did the call last week, which is, I mean you all know as well as I do that companies like this are not dependent on any one person, right? There are 13,000 other people here that are going to continue doing what they've done the day after I go, and with a leader like Al [Kelly], I would assume, will do it as well, if not better. And so as we think about what we've done over the past four years, or even what this company has done since it's gone public, it's based upon what an entire management team has done. I think that what I feel very good about when I think about the things that we've done, I think you brought up the work on \u2013 that we have really \u2013 I would describe as, we've really begun to do with merchants is an important part of the way we think about what we do. We are not trying to do work for merchants in lieu of any other client or any other partner, but just recognizing that everyone participates in the payments value chain should get access to the capabilities that we have.","And so someone asked me last week if I were them, how would they evaluate how we're doing at making progress with merchants, and my answer was, I would look to see that we're continuing quarter after quarter, year after year, to introduce solutions in the marketplace, which help merchants grow their business, and then try and derive some kind of understanding of what the adoption looks like for those products. And don't be confused by the couple of merchants that are always going to be unhappy, that are always going to be doing things in the marketplace. The merchant world is very fragmented across the world. We've got some very, very strong relationships, and we've got a bunch of relationships where those merchants are sitting there very eager to work with us on the solutions that we're developing.","And then I think just not because I don't want to take up the whole call with the question, I do think just when I think about the way we thought about innovation here and the way we thought about our work in digital commerce, I think the whole organization has just made tremendous progress. We don't talk about \u2013 let me say it differently. We don't use the word innovation around here anymore because it becomes part of the way people think about doing their business. We're rooted in supporting our client base and supporting the four-party model, but we are very focused on being as successful and having our clients be successful in the digital world. And whether it's the work of the Dev Center, the APIs that we've made available, all of the things that we've done that position us well in the world of digital commerce, including Visa Checkout, those are all part of those things.","So everything we do is about continuing to be strong in the physical world but recognizing that we needed to think very differently in the digital world. There's a tremendous amount more to do, so I don't want to \u2013 and I don't think about this as if we've done it and it's time for me to move on. I think we've done an awful lot. But I'm confident that those activities and the way people think is the way the organization thinks.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Thank you. Next question, Laura.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Darrin Peller from Barclays. Your line is now open.","Darrin Peller - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks, guys. Just a quick follow-up on incentives. I know you ran at about 18.9% in Q4, guidance around 21% at the midpoint. I guess I thought you already included \u2013 you were at a run rate of including Costco and USAA incentives already along with Visa Europe. The vast majority of it was already kind of the run rate in the past quarter.","And then quickly on expenses, you're saying mid-single digit growth. I know you just did \u2013 again, you did low single digit growth in the year. You seem to have been able to accomplish all your investment needs under that rate. I guess if you could, just explain why we need to reaccelerate. Thanks, guys.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","I think mid-single digits has been our historic. And by the way, that's the expense growth for let's call it core Visa ex-Europe, the expense base you've been used to looking at. And if you look at the history, we have typically run mid-single digits. We are continuing to invest in all the programs we want to invest in. What we did this year was to prioritize around all the other things. As you look at next year, the run rate returns to what has been more of a long-term trend. The level of investment remains as steady as it has been, and we'll continue to drive productivity. Some of the charge we took is a reflection of that. So that was in terms of the expense growth rate. So it really is a return back to what has been a very long-term trend, into level of investment we need to keep the business focused on all the right things. The other part of the question I may have forgotten, on the other one.","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","Incentives.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","On incentives, we didn't have the impact of Visa Europe in the fourth quarter to the extent that you have it next year because in the fourth quarter, the rebates were still in place. We eliminated the rebates only as of the end of September. And then also quarter-by-quarter impacts, Visa Europe brand are relatively higher level of incentives in the first half of the year, somewhat lower in the second half if you look to the filings we had done. So the full impact of Europe was really not as visible in the fourth quarter because the rebates to client incentive shift was not in place in the fourth quarter.","Costco, we had some of their incentives in this year, but clearly it's a full year of Costco, so you see the full impact. Plus, there's a whole bunch of renewals that I talked about that really start flowing into next year, mostly the ones we did in Asia. So it's all these all together.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Andrew Jeffrey from SunTrust. Your line is now open.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks. I appreciate taking the call, Charlie. It's been a pleasure. A big picture question, you've touched on it recently with your blockchain B2B announcement, but this is a big market. Your primary competitor has made a pretty aggressive move into B2B and hedged that maybe a little bit with the VocaLink acquisition. I wonder if you can just think about the way that market evolves in your mind, ACH versus cards and what the tradeoffs might be and what the opportunity is for Visa.","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","Sure. Listen, I think what's important is that there is this \u2013 and I'll describe it as really a government sponsored, whether it's official or not, push towards faster payments. And so when I think about ACH and we think about what's going on, I think that is the predominant driver because certainly the ACH system here and others around the world haven't been able to provide the same kind of level of service as you get from other products or other networks. And so when we think about what it means for us, we know the capabilities that we have. When we think about what we've done and the way we've positioned ourselves with Visa Direct and getting access on a push payments basis to 3 billion cards across the world, we feel really good about the position that we have with those capabilities.","It doesn't mean that that's all we're thinking about and all that we're doing, and you've seen us do some work, as you mentioned, in the blockchain space, thinking more about, where are payments inefficient. And for what we do in our traditional consumer-to-business world, that's not a problem that needs to get solved today in terms of what blockchain can do. But certainly in the commercial space, it's a very, very inefficient market, and there are opportunities to use different technologies to bring some efficiency there. So the things that we're doing, they are around doing things to improve something that exists and for the core business of what we do today between consumers and merchants \u2013 and it will be through consumers-to-consumers in terms of using our push payment capabilities, it's leveraging the core assets that we have that work really well that have access to these 3 billion cards across the world.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, Laura?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Chris Donat from Sandler O'Neill. Your line is now open.","Christopher Roy Donat - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP","Good afternoon, thanks for taking my question. Vasant, I just wanted to look one more time at the incentive as a percent of gross revenue. In the past few years, Visa has given us this range as basically with 100 basis points just like you've done today. I'm just trying to make sure that I understand. Does this reflect that there's confidence there? And what are the swing factors in that range between 20.5% and 21.5%? Is it mostly Europe, or do you have a lot of puts and takes in renewals?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","No. As always, you give a range because there are some things you know. The things you know are the deals that have already been done and what their impact might be based on the assumptions you're making on the revenue side, and as the revenues play out as you expect, then you get the incentives coming in as you expect. The variability comes from things that are potential renewals during the year or things you have to do along the way because something happens that you didn't expect. So those would be the things that take you to one end of the range or the other.","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","And also to keep in mind \u2013 our incentive deals aren't generally structured as a percentage of gross revenues. Every deal is structured differently. Sometimes they're tiers, sometimes things are based on volumes. They're based on lots of different things. So we make a bunch of assumptions as to what we think will play out by client in a year, and it doesn't always play out that way by client. So a range really is the right way to think about it. And I just think the continued 100 basis point range is because we know a bunch of it has been signed, and it's just a question of how those bonds play out. But we do, as Vasant said, will sign some new deals throughout the year that will impact those numbers, and we make assumptions on what that looks like.","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","And as we've said before, there's a lot of focus on incentives and trying to predict them from one quarter to another. And in the end, what really counts is net revenue. Net revenue is what we essentially keep and take to the bank, and it's net revenue growth that counts. And there's always going to be some noise in the trade-off between gross revenues and incentives, and there could be shifts from one quarter to another depending on when renewals happen. The number to focus on is net revenues, and we would keep saying that.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","Next question, Laura?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti from Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yes, Vasant. Now that you have closed on Visa Europe, I was just curious on your confidence level for the consolidation of the processing systems and if there's any kind of scenario where that could happen a little bit earlier and drive some earlier acceleration at the synergies?","Vasant M. Prabhu - Visa, Inc.","Yeah. So far we feel very good about everything \u2013 and Charlie might want to add some more things, but we feel very good about how the integration is proceeding. So really no surprises on that front and good progress and pretty much have achieved all the things we wanted to achieve at this stage of the game. The technology integration is also off to a good start. As we told you, that is a multiyear integration. It's too early to tell you that it will be finished sooner, but our goal is to get it done as fast as we can. The gating variable there is to minimize any impact on clients, so we will pace it to ensure that the \u2013 this is as easy for clients as we can make it. So we won't rush it if it has \u2013 if it's going to have a negative impact on clients. So that will be the biggest gating variable in the end. I don't know, Charlie, if you want to add...?","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","The one thing I would add is I think, I mean, I personally have enormous confidence in the work that the technology teams on both sides of the Atlantic are doing. We know how to do these integrations. And remember, what these integrations are is, I mean, this is really in many cases what we're doing is we're taking the systems that we have at VI. We're looking at what capabilities need to be built into our systems to accommodate Europe's clients, and building them out, just as we always do on an ongoing basis, into the VI systems and do it in a way where everything works as anticipated. So we \u2013 I mean, our team is extraordinarily professional. And I personally just \u2013 I think \u2013 I just have every level of confidence that they'll do that well.","And to the timing question, I think this is one where \u2013 someone asked the question about \u2013 before about on guidance aggressive or conservative. I think this is one \u2013 we've been very clear about this, which is we could do this quicker. It's not a question of us doing the work to build out those additional capabilities. That will be done relatively quickly. The real question is what's the appropriate pace to complete these conversions along with our clients. And what we've said is that we don't intend to rush that. This is the type of thing that we have to do in a way that fits in with things that work for clients, and I think that's just a smart way. I think you would want us to think about it that way. We'll get plenty of benefits in the next couple of years from Europe and there will be plenty more beyond that that we should do this the right way.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","With that, Laura, we have time for one last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question is from Chris Brendler from Stifel. Your line is now open.","Christopher Brendler - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hi, thanks. Thanks for squeezing me in, and best of luck, Charlie. We're sorry to see you go. I just wanted to ask a question on EMV. Now that we're a little over a year in, do you feel like it's been a little bit of a messy process in some ways, but do you feel like we've gotten to a point where EMV is gaining traction? And if you can add any color commentary on the rule changes relative to chargebacks and the $25 limit and how much that's improved the merchant experience with EMV, that would be helpful. Thank you.","Charles W. Scharf - Visa, Inc.","Listen, I don't have a lot more to say from what we've said on EMV. I meant to just give you the update on the numbers in terms of almost 65% of the credit cards and 45% of the debit cards, 1.6 million merchants, which is about 40%, are accepting them. I think it's a lot of work, for sure. It's progressing along a timeframe which is faster than we've seen in any other part of the world when they have moved from mag stripe to chip. We've said this I think last quarter or the quarter before. Today it's the largest chip card market in the world, even though we still have a long way to go. And you see the meaningful impacts on the reduction in fraud when chip-on-chip exists.","So there's no question that as difficult as it is that it's the right thing to do. And it will just take a period of time as these tails continue to complete the conversions. And while we continue to complete the EMV rollouts in the U.S., I can assure you that we are working really diligently, as are \u2013 well, let's say we're doing this in partnership with everyone including acquirers, issuers, merchants, everyone in the ecosystem just to think through what's next, which is certainly looking at the online world but also continuing to look at encryption and new ways of authentication in the physical world.","Jack Carsky - Visa, Inc.","And with that, we want to thank you all for joining us today.

[Operator instructions.] I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Jack Carsky, head of global investor relations. Mr. Carsky, you may begin.","Jack Carsky ","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to Visa Inc.\u2019s fiscal first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. With us today are Charlie Scharf, Visa\u2019s chief executive officer, and Byron Pollitt, Visa\u2019s chief financial officer.","This call is currently being webcast over the internet. It can be accessed on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.investor.visa.com. A replay of the webcast will also be archived on our site for 30 days. A PowerPoint deck containing financial and statistical highlights of today\u2019s commentary was posted to our website prior to this call.","Let me also remind you that this presentation may include forward-looking statements. These statements aren\u2019t guarantees of future performance and our actual results could materially differ as a result of variety of factors. Additional information concerning these factors is available in our most reports on Forms 10-K and Q, which you can find on the SEC's website and the investor relations section of Visa\u2019s website.","For historical non-GAAP or pro forma related financial information disclosed in this call, the related GAAP measures and other information required by Regulation G of the SEC are available in the Financial and Statistical Summary accompanying today\u2019s press release. This release can also be accessed through the IR section of our website.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Byron.","Byron Pollitt","Thank you, Jack. We will begin my call with the usual callouts and observations. First, let me start with payment volume and cross-border trends. The December quarter, on a constant dollar basis, grew payment volume at 11%, down 2 percentage points from the September quarter.","This softening was led by a 2 percentage point drop in the U.S. from 10% to 8%, with the holiday spend consistent with a continuing U.S. economic recovery, but at a growth rate we would describe as tepid.","U.S. results for the first 21 days of January were consistent with the December quarter. International payment volume growth rates in the December quarter remained healthy, in the mid-teens.","On the cross-border front, growth picked up 1 percentage point from the September quarter, with both U.S. and international on the uptick. That said, January appears to be giving back some of the heightened cross-border activity we saw in the month of December.","Second callout: let me begin by saying that we are affirming all our guidance metrics outlined on our October call. With that as perspective, I would like to elaborate on our net revenue growth guidance. ","Our guidance calls for low double-digits on a constant dollar basis offset by about 2 percentage points of negative FX. We define low double-digits as 10% to 13%. This means on an as-reported or nominal basis, growth is expected to be in the 8% to 11% range after FX impacts. ","On the FX front, after adjusting for hedges, we expect about 2 percentage points of negative impact in all four fiscal quarters. Given Visa\u2019s relevant basket of currencies, the forward rates indicate continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar through the balance of the fiscal year.","Drilling down a bit further, a stronger U.S. dollar versus the currencies for Japan, Brazil, Australia, and Canada, and more recently Argentina and Venezuela, have driven our headwind. In contrast, while the euro has strengthened versus the U.S. dollar, the absence of Europe from Visa, Inc.\u2019s geographic portfolio has muted this potential benefit.","Staying with revenue but switching gears, the quarterly growth rates for the balance of the year are expected to vary, with softer growth rates in Q2 and Q3, followed by an uptick in Q4. This cadence is driven by the following: the lapping of particularly strong revenue growth rates in Q2 and Q3 of the prior year, which benefited from low levels of client incentives and certain nonrecurring pricing actions, all of which were called out in last year\u2019s earnings calls. In contrast, Q4 of last year had a disproportionate share of the fiscal year\u2019s client incentives, which is a pattern that, at this point in the year, we do not expect to repeat. ","The third callout relates to the quarterly cadence for marketing spend. With the Winter Olympics rapidly approaching and World Cup soon to follow, we expect a significant uptick in marketing spend in Q2 and Q3 versus our spend in Q1, followed by a downshift in Q4. This, of course, will have an impact on quarterly operating margins. ","Fourth callout is the return of litigation escrow funds from those merchants opting out of the recently approved class action settlement, the dynamics of which we covered at our investor day in June and reiterated last quarter. On January 27, $1.1 billion was returned to us and was deposited back into our litigation escrow account. The receipt of the payment increases our current taxable income by $1.1 billion and income tax payables by $387 million.","While it has no direct effect on our income statement, it negatively impacts our free cash flow over the last three quarters of fiscal 2014. This event was fully contemplated and is reflected in our full year guidance of about $5 billion in free cash flow. To be clear, the return of the actual escrow funds is not included in our free cash flow, but the impact of higher cash taxes is included.","Last callout: as always, we remain committed to returning excess cash to our shareholders. To this end, we repurchased a total of 5.5 million shares during the quarter, at an average price per share of $199 and change. This leaves an outstanding open to buy of 4.2 billion.","Now let\u2019s turn to the numbers. I will cover our global payment volume and processed transaction trends for the fiscal first quarter, followed by our results through January 21. I\u2019ll then cover the financial highlights of our first fiscal quarter.","Global payment volume growth for the December quarter in constant dollars was 11%, modestly below the September quarter\u2019s 13%. The U.S. grew 8%, and international grew 15%. More recently, in the U.S., through January 21, payment volume continued at 8%.","Drilling down further, U.S. credit was 10% in both Q1 and through January 21, compared to 11% in Q4. Similarly, U.S. debit grew at 7% in both Q1 and through January 21, compared to 10% in Q4.","Global cross-border volume delivered a solid 12% constant dollar growth rate in the December quarter, up modestly from the 11% rate in the September quarter. The U.S. grew 11% and international 13% in constant dollars.","Through January 21, cross-border volume on a constant dollar basis grew 10% with a U.S. growth rate of 9% and international 11%. Transactions processed over Visa\u2019s network totaled $16 billion in the first fiscal quarter, a 13% increase over the prior year period. The U.S. grew 9% while international delivered 26% growth. Through January 21, processed transaction growth was 11%. ","Now turning to the income statement, net operating revenue in the quarter was $3.2 billion, an 11% increase year over year driven primarily by solid growth globally in both domestic and international transactions and as mentioned earlier, negatively impacted by a 2% FX headwind.","Moving to the individual revenue line items, service revenue was $1.4 billion, up 9% over the past year, and was driven by solid global payment volume growth. Data processing revenue, $1.3 billion, up 13% over the prior year quarter, based on solid growth rates in Visa processed transactions, both in the U.S. and internationally.","International transaction revenue was up 11% to $891 million, reflecting an ongoing broad-based strength in cross-border volume. Total operating expenses for the quarter were $1.1 billion, up 3% from the prior year.","Given earlier discussion on the cadence of marketing spend, we expect expense growth in Q2 and Q3 to be somewhat higher versus Q1. Operating margin was 66% for the first quarter, ahead of our yearly guidance of low 60s, but consistent with our expectations. We expect Q1 to be our lowest quarter for operating expense in fiscal 2014.","Our effective tax rate for Q1 was 32.4%. Capital expenditures were $120 million in the quarter. At the end of the quarter, we had 634 million shares of class A common stock outstanding on an as-converted basis, and the weighted average number of fully diluted shares outstanding for the quarter totaled 639 million.","Finally, as noted earlier, our full year guidance metrics for revenue growth, client incentives, operating margin, EPS growth, and free cash flow remain unchanged. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Charlie.","Charlie Scharf","Thank you very much, Byron, and good morning to everyone. First, let me just start by saying that we feel very good about the strong financial performance during the quarter, as Byron had mentioned: solid revenue growth, solid net income growth, and solid earnings per share growth. ","Global payment volume, as you can see from the numbers, is relatively strong. Holiday spend in the U.S. was better than reported as we were going through the holiday season, and was certainly impacted by the shorter calendar. It was extremely uneven as we were going through it, and the continued movement from face-to-face to digital purchases was extremely meaningful.","Let me just give you some updates on the legal and regulatory front. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve read, on December 13, U.S. District Judge Gleeson granted final approval of the merchant litigation cases. As part of the settlement, Visa and the other defendants received a comprehensive release of liability to claims in the lawsuit, as well as protection against further litigation regarding interchange and other U.S. rules. As expected, a number of objectors to the settlement have appealed. ","We at Visa are very focused on concluding these disagreements and on building our efforts to enter into a better relationship with the entire merchant community, identifying new ways to enable them to differentiate themselves and their customer experiences, and competing more effectively. ","Also, about two weeks ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC circuit heard oral arguments and the Fed\u2019s appeal of Judge Leon\u2019s decision in the challenge to the Durbin regulations. While it\u2019s hard to make any courtroom predictions, as we all know, we\u2019re pleased with the hearing. We continue to believe that the government has a strong case on appeal.","Let me move on and just talk for a second about some topics of interest and start with the recent industry data breaches. First of all, we understand that these events are terrible for everyone affected. Everyone is the merchant, the issuer, the acquirer, the networks, but most importantly the consumer.","And while the consumers are generally protected by the network rules of zero liability, meaning they\u2019re not responsible for any fraud due to the breach, we all have to realize that these compromises are disturbing to them, they\u2019re inconvenient, and they raise broader data security concerns that the entire industry must solve. ","Unfortunately, many merchants, issuers, and both of their lobbyists are attempting to assign blame in the press and not reacting in a particularly constructive manner, and it\u2019s in all of our best interests that this change quickly. Within the payments ecosystem, the impact on the merchants, the acquirer, the issuer, and the network are all equally negative. ","We all share the same customer, who\u2019s going through this difficult experience, and our sales and long term relationships with that customer will suffer if we don\u2019t work together to get to a better place. The appropriate way to respond to this issue for all parties to jointly work together toward better data security standards and better payment security standards. Maintaining trust in the electronic payment systems is our highest priority, and we\u2019re actively exploring new ways to enhance the safety and security of the payment system. ","To that end, we do believe it\u2019s critical that we make progress toward the implementation of EMV Chip in the U.S. We can\u2019t do this on our own. We need merchants, acquirers, and issuers to be supportive. We know it\u2019s expensive. It means new cards, new terminals, new software development, but as we can all see, it is necessary."," It\u2019s our hope that all issuers and merchants will migrate to EMV, but we also understand that it\u2019s complex. There are an awful lot of terminals out there and an awful lot of cards that have to be updated, and this has to be done in a way that does not disturb commerce.","In 2011, we had announced a plan to migrate the U.S. to EMV technology through a liability shift beginning in October 2015 and we have reaffirmed these dates. EMV, to be clear, would potentially eliminate the ability to reproduce the card and thereby reduce if not eliminate counterfeit fraud at the point of sale, but it\u2019s also important to note that it\u2019s equally imperative that the industry move towards tokenization, which should be equally effective at reducing or eliminating card not present fraud.","As we work towards a better solution, we\u2019re also redoubling our efforts to make sure that consumers understand that they\u2019re protected. We\u2019ve invested in national advertising to reassure customers of the zero liability fraud protection. These important protections shield our consumers in the U.S. from bearing any fraud loss after data compromise, as I said before.","We\u2019re also focused on making sure that there\u2019s clarity of fact with the media and in Washington. I\u2019m personally concerned about the amount of misinformation you read in the public domain, from confusion around who incurs the cost of fraud losses, to the misrepresented lack of payment system security. ","This is misleading, inaccurate, and not helpful, and can have unintended public policy consequences. We\u2019re actively engaged with policymakers in Washington, DC, along with our partners, to ensure that they actually hear the facts and understand the multiple layers of infrastructure that protect the payment system. ","Let me just switch topics for a second and just talk for a second about V.me, which we\u2019ve done on several calls. On the last quarterly call, I spoke about our efforts to simplify what we\u2019re building. Since launching it, we\u2019ve learned valuable lessons, as we\u2019ve talked about, to accelerate its success in the marketplace and better meet the needs of what our issuers and merchants actually want in the marketplace. ","We\u2019ve been working hard to evolve the product in response to what we\u2019ve heard from them, which is to simplify the merchant integration and focus on the simplicity of consumer card payments for online and mobile transactions. We\u2019re pleased that the work is now coming to market, with the first phase of our redesigned platform released last week, providing merchants with faster integration and easier time to market. ","I can share now that Jos A. Bank, Ticketmaster, Auto Zone, and Petco will be some of the first merchants to go live withV.me through this new, simplified integration. These new merchants join the strong group of existing merchants and financial institutions already offering V.me to their consumers, which represent over $13 billion in spend and approximately $300 million in addressable cards.","And we\u2019ve talked about that our success here at Visa does depend on the strength of our relationships with all parties in the payment system. We value all of those relationships, and we continue to work hard to solidify those relationships. ","As we\u2019ve talked about, we reorganized the company last year to strengthen our outreach to all of those constituents. To that end, we have made good progress and our track record of winning or renewing issuer and cobrand contracts is excellent. ","Let me just talk for a second about our cobrand business, because we\u2019ve gotten a series of questions from that as we\u2019ve met with you all. Let me just talk about, because the U.S. is far and away the majority of where the cobrand market is, and just talk about some of the effects for us in our fiscal 2013 year, looking backwards. ","Just remember, we have the leading cobrand market share. Most cobrands do not go to RFP, and when we look on a volume-weighted basis at our renewals, we renewed about 95% of our current cobrand deals that were actually up for renewal. We also won about 60% of the new cobrand deals on a volume-weighted basis. As we said at investor day, seven of the top U.S. cobrands are a majority of Visa.","So when you look at those numbers, we\u2019re very pleased with the business that we\u2019ve had and the rate of success we continue to have in the marketplace, and our cobrand pipeline is very healthy in fiscal 2014 and beyond, as we look ahead.","Let me just change gears for a second and just share with you some facts about our new platform: Everywhere You Want to Be, which is a new integrated campaign that communicates our vision and how our brand is positioned for the future. Those of you who have been covering us for a while may remember we once used the tagline Visa, it\u2019s Everywhere You Want to Be, to reflect the growing presence of Visa in merchant locations across the United States. ","Today, the new global campaign allows us to expand what \u201ceverywhere\u201d means and build upon the historical equities of the brand. We\u2019re bringing this new Visa brand and our mark to light gradually, starting with Olympic-themed advertising in the U.S. and a rollout to more markets and audiences around the world, starting in March.","So I\u2019m going to conclude just by reaffirming our view here of how excited we are about the future and the opportunity. We\u2019ve talked about the secular opportunity to penetrate cash and check and how healthy that opportunity is across the entire globe. We continue to work on innovation, being flexible and adaptive in the world we live in, both for our existing customers and continuing to open up the network on the edges to embrace the change that\u2019s going on around us.","And with that, I\u2019m going to open up the floor for questions to Byron and myself. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator instructions.] Our first question comes from Tim Willi from Wells Fargo. ","Tim Willi - Wells Fargo","Wanted to get your thoughts, if you could, around Bitcoin. Obviously, that\u2019s sort of the new rage. We get a lot of questions from investors. I\u2019m sure you do as well. But can you just talk about how you think about it, whether it is something that potentially could be a broad consumer application, or if it\u2019s more of a niche around cross-border business? Or just how how you might think about that, and how Visa might interact or support that, or not at all.","Charlie Scharf ","I guess I would start with, it\u2019s early days in terms of what Bitcoin is, and what it will be. We\u2019re certainly paying attention to it. It\u2019s very early to understand exactly what all of the implications are for it. ","We will say, when we look at our network and the people that we compete with in terms of what people think of as a traditional network, the established network rules we have, the understanding of how things operate, understanding who the participants are, the fact that business that we do has financial institutions on either side of the transaction, you know, the success of our payment system and our primary competitors is that for a reason. ","And there\u2019s certainly some interesting things about Bitcoin and other things like it, but there\u2019s also a great deal of complexity. People talk about things like frictionless and things like that, and when you actually dig through it, it\u2019s really not the case. It\u2019s far more complex than that. And we feel very comfortable with the business that we have here. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Bob Napoli of William Blair. ","Bob Napoli - William Blair","Question on security. And I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t have all the answers on this, but if EMV had been in place, would it have prevented some of the recent breaches? And just in line with the trend in security, it seems like there are these dates out there that tend to get pushed back. Do you think that the breach at Target and others, do you sense it\u2019s going to drive the adoption of EMV and other security faster than it otherwise would have? Are you seeing action taking place that wasn\u2019t happening 30 days ago?","Charlie Scharf ","Well, the second part of your question, I think the answer is yes. You know, people don\u2019t live in a vacuum, and when you see the kinds of breaches that have occurred recently, it gets everyone focused on making sure that we\u2019re doing all that we can to minimize any potential fraud in the future. ","So the dates that we had set out are the dates that we are going to stick with. Again, it requires people do a lot of work, which we understand, but we think it\u2019s good for the payment system, for the ultimate end user, which means it will ultimately be good for all of us, in the process.","On your first piece, remember, first of all, in terms of what actually has happened with the breaches that we\u2019ve read about, not all the facts are out yet. So it\u2019s a little premature for all of us to talk about what would have solved it. ","I think it\u2019s fair to say that as best we can tell, some of the breaches that you\u2019ve read about don\u2019t relate to the payment systems at all. They relate to breaches within companies\u2019 server environments, or some personal information, so EMV would obviously have nothing to do with that. ","To the extent that there were breaches occurring on the point of sale device, it\u2019s probable that the account number possibly would have been able to be compromised, but the ability to reuse that account number to create a new card, to use that card at a physical point of sale on a fraudulent basis, would not be possible. It would still be possible to use that account number potentially at card not present, which is why it\u2019s important that the industry also continue to push forward with tokenization.","Operator","Tom McCrohan from Janney Capital Markets, you may ask your question.","Tom McCrohan - Janney Capital Markets","Is V.me being positioned as a mobile wallet long term? Or is it more kind of a tender type for ecommerce transactions, something more like a Paypal?","Charlie Scharf ","I think of V.me very simply as a way for our customers to have an easy way to make payments online with their general purpose credit card, through user name and password. So people like to ask is it a wallet? Is it this? Is it that? It\u2019s really not that complicated. It\u2019s when you are buying on your computer, your tablet, or on your mobile device, right now it\u2019s not easy to get from the beginning of the checkout process to the end of the checkout process using our products. ","And V.me is just an easy way to check out using user name and password and not having to enter your account number, the expiration date, shipping address, and all that other kind of stuff. And whether it\u2019s something called V.me or it\u2019s with another solution, we\u2019re indifferent. We just want our cards to be able to help enable commerce in the digital world online.  ","Operator","Our next question is from Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.","Tien-tsin Huang - JP Morgan ","I had a quick follow up on the breach, then I had a cross-border question. Just on the breach, any risk of indirect impact from consumer [confidence] changing maybe in terms of usage of card, maybe mix shift to credit, or just reissuance risk in general. And then on cross-border, I know there\u2019s a lot of discussion in the market around emerging markets, FX volatility. Can that have any impact on cross-border activity or profitability? What should we be considering there? And then lastly, cross border, on the World Cup front and with the Olympics, is that enough to show up in cross-border volumes?","Charlie Scharf ","Why don\u2019t I start with the first? Consumer confidence and using the cards, which we pay very close attention to, continues to still look very, very good. We\u2019ve actually done our own surveys, starting at the time of the breach. One of the reasons why we ran the advertising that we ran to make sure that consumers understand that, while it\u2019s unpleasant and not something that we want them to go through, they\u2019re actually protected. And in terms of what we\u2019ve seen in our actual payment results and these surveys, things continue to look pretty good for us.","Byron Pollitt ","On the cross-border front, logic would say that depending on how currencies move, it should have an impact on cross-border. The way it tends to materialize, and the way we typically think about it, is by corridor. ","And yet what we saw this past quarter, despite a broad strengthening of the U.S. dollar, there was actually strong traffic to the United States and strong cross-border spend from countries where the currencies were somewhat weaker relative to the U.S. dollar. ","And that\u2019s counterintuitive to what you would normally think. As a result, our view more broadly on cross-border is that it\u2019s economically driven, and that how economic growth globally behaves is more likely to have an impact on our overall cross-border volumes. ","So if I were to single out an area, emerging markets, there\u2019s been a lot of focus on declining values and growth rates in emerging markets. Those areas still have been vibrant sources of growth for us, but we have a close watch on that in the year to come. ","With regard to World Cup, Brazil has been one of those countries where the currency has weakened, which bodes well for incoming traffic to the World Cup this summer in Brazil. The outbound spend from Brazil is one that will be under pressure, for two reasons. One, the weakness of the currency. That\u2019s often overpowered by an unflagging desire for Brazilians to travel. The government\u2019s making it more difficult, however, by putting on some pretty serious taxes, both on the use of credit and debit cards when they\u2019re used in cross-border transactions. ","So I\u2019d say from a World Cup standpoint, hopefully I would expect most of the Brazilians to stay home for the festivities and that outbound travel is probably never much in the cards. Inbound travel, if anything, should be aided by the weakness in the currency in Brazil and possibly Argentina will benefit as well, as their currency has taken a nosedive of late. ","Charlie Scharf ","Hard to believe we\u2019ll see anything Sochi.","Byron Pollitt ","Yes.","Operator","The next question will be from Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank. ","Bryan Keane - Deutsche Bank","Just two quick questions. One, I guess, just what\u2019s behind the slowdown in U.S. debit volumes, and any difference between PIN and signature? And secondly, I noticed you guys hide EMV chip, just your latest thoughts on the EMV chip versus the EMV chip and PIN, and will you promote one versus the other?","Byron Pollitt ","On the debit side, I\u2019d say hard to read that. There is pretty tepid growth in personal disposable income, which is the primary indicator we look at, now that we\u2019ve pretty much lapped the more immediate Durbin effects. Remember, debit is disproportionately nondiscretionary. So one of the important drivers of debit spend is the growth in jobs, which adds to the overall growth in nondiscretionary and debit spend. And we\u2019re just not seeing much in the way of growth rates there. What we\u2019re seeing is declining growth rates there for the U.S. in that regard.","If we were to take a look at Visa signature versus Interlink, I would say the growth rates on the PIN side have been running higher than on the signature side. And as you noticed, we downshifted a bit from where we were in the prior quarter as we began to move further away from the immediate effects of Durbin and begin to hit a more normalized pattern.","Charlie Scharf ","And just on the issue of signature versus PIN, as we move toward EMV, just remember, this is a country where people are used to signing with their credit card. Most cards don\u2019t even have a PIN attached to them. And I make reference to this in my remarks. We think it\u2019s very important that we move towards EMV, but it\u2019s equally important that we don\u2019t disturb the growth in commerce that does exist in this country. And to the extent that we can do things to make that transition as smooth as possible, that\u2019s extremely important. So we think there is a future for a meaningful period of time for signature.","Operator","The next question comes from Darrin Peller of Barclays.","Darrin Peller - Barclays ","We noticed that the service fees were up sequentially. Did anything in pricing or perhaps some lag effects from the [unintelligible] drive that? And then is there anything unsustainable around the amount you\u2019re now generating in service fees per dollar of payment volume? And then just quickly, on the topic of pricing, we clearly saw a pretty significant cross-border price change at Mastercard over the last couple of quarters. While I know you guys want to be careful and surgical on pricing changes, especially [unintelligible], might there be some similar opportunities soon from Visa? ","Byron Pollitt ","On the service fee side, I would say there\u2019s no real callout. Remember, a lot of our service fee is subject to FX impacts. So if we look at the constant dollar growth in service fees, we\u2019re at 13, the FX impact bringing that down to about 10 nominally. And service fee growth was around 9. So I\u2019d say that\u2019s pretty close. So I\u2019d say there\u2019s no real callout on the yields. It\u2019s well within a zipcode of what we have done within the past three or four quarters. So no callouts. ","Charlie Scharf ","And on the pricing question, I answer it very consistently with what we\u2019ve been saying. We are not opposed to increase in price, we\u2019re not opposed to decrease in price, we\u2019re not opposed to keeping price the same, as long as there\u2019s a reason for all of those things. So I think we have been disciplined, we\u2019ve been thoughtful, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do. And I guess the last thing I would say is we are more than willing to sacrifice our short term performance versus other people if it\u2019s the right long term thing to do for our company and for our industry. And so we\u2019re very comfortable with what we\u2019ve done and what we haven\u2019t done in pricing.","Operator","Jason Kupferberg of Jefferies, your line is open.","Jason Kupferberg - Jefferies ","If I heard correctly, I think processed transaction growth slowed a little bit in the first three weeks of January, 11% versus the 13% last quarter. So wanted to get a little bit more color there in terms of kind of U.S. versus international trends. And then just quickly switching gears, any thoughts in terms of the implications of the data breaches on MCX\u2019s potential strategy? I know you guys get a lot of questions around that, but to the extent they were looking at private label or decoupled debit product as a primary funding source in their wallet now, with the potential for consumers to be more wary about giving their bank account data to a retailer. Would just appreciate any thoughts you have around that.","Byron Pollitt ","Let me start with the transaction growth. And let me break it down U.S. versus international, give it to you for the first quarter, and then for January, so that you have the detail. So as I said on the call, processed transaction growth for the first quarter was 13%, U.S. was 9%, and international was 26%. January, 21 days, processed transaction growth was 11. 7 for the U.S., 24 for international. So a downtick in both. ","Charlie Scharf ","And I guess just to add a touch of color on that, because we obviously look at these numbers daily, weekly. We look at all the trends. And the one thing that we talk about over the past several months, and it really goes back to the beginning of last quarter, is there\u2019s a lot of volatility embedded in the numbers. Week in, week out, it\u2019s very hard to pick up trends. And so whether they\u2019re positive or negative over a several week period of time, we\u2019ve been unable to discern anything more meaningful than this continued tepid recovery that Byron described.","And then on the second question, I guess I would say what we continue to say. And I\u2019ve talked about this fairly consistently. As we think about our competitive position, understanding that we\u2019re continuing to evolve and change and make sure that we open our network up to those who can direct transactions to us and continue to build value on our network. ","Having said all that, safety, security, and soundness is the price of entry in payments. There\u2019s no question about that. And people can build whatever they want, and the moment that consumers start to get nervous about using their own personal information or payment credentials is the moment that people will start to see the effect of that. ","And so what we and our primary competitors have are these established payment networks, known rules, people understand how they\u2019re protected, which is why we think EMV is important, because it takes mag stripe to a new standard, and we\u2019re pushing beyond EMV towards the next thing. And so to the extent that other payment methods are not as secure, that is a competitive disadvantage. And that\u2019s how we think about it. ","Operator","Sanjay Sakhrani from KBW, please ask your question.","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW ","Just had a question on the FX hedging practices going forward. How should we think about the relevance of them as currencies move going forward, especially if the U.S. dollar were to strengthen more?","Byron Pollitt ","According to the [forwards], the U.S. dollar is strengthening more against the currencies that are most relevant in our portfolio. So the forwards aren\u2019t as steep as what we were looking at a year ago, but nonetheless, to the extent there has been a headwind, I would say looking forward, the headwind continues. It\u2019s just not as steep as it was when we looked out six, nine months ago.","We begin hedging a year ahead of time. So we hedge 12 months out. We do rolling hedges. So we begin 12 months out, and then our hedges are largely in place, I would say, five or six months before the period we actually report. We do economic hedges, so we don\u2019t hedge everything. For a particular currency, we take revenue, subtract the natural hedge of the expenses we incur in that currency, and then we hedge not 100%, but a meaningful portion of the remainder, and we do that for about 15 currencies. ","The intent is not to speculate, but to simply dampen the impact of currencies. And the way we approach it, it\u2019s not possible to put complete hedges in place. The intent is to put enough in to dampen it within certain predetermined exposures that we calculate. It\u2019s a pretty straightforward value at risk analysis.","So when there are large sustained movements, those are going to be reflected in our numbers. They just won\u2019t have the amplitude that you would have if we didn\u2019t hedge. We have pretty good visibility to this, which is why we can give you a three to four quarter look ahead, which is our practice from a guidance standpoint.","Operator","Craig Maurer with CLSA, your line is open. ","Craig Maurer - CLSA","First is for Byron. If you could discuss the cadence in marketing spend. Will the ramp look similar to what we saw during the last Olympic Games? Though I do know you have two events coming up. And secondly, does [host card] emulation present a good tool for your tokenization project in the card not present world? And would you move quickly toward certification there?","Charlie Scharf ","Let me just do number two first, because the answer is yes.","Byron Pollitt ","And on the second one, I don\u2019t have a comparison, but you should expect a significant increase in marketing spend in Q2 and Q3, and then a meaningful downshift in Q4. We\u2019ve had this combination before, and even though the finals of the World Cup are typically in July, which is Q4, there is a substantial amount of marketing that occurs prior to the finals in that April, May, June timeframe. So that quarter has a substantial component of the World Cup, and this quarter is the one that has virtually all of the Winter Olympics spend. One other callout, the spend for Winter Olympics is significant in terms of the quarterly cadence, but it is not at the level of spend that you would see for a Summer Olympics. ","Charlie Scharf ","Let me just reiterate what Byron said in his opening remarks, just to make sure that we were as clear as we can be. As we look to our fiscal second and third quarters, in the second and third quarters, because of what Byron referred to, our revenue growth numbers will not be as robust as we\u2019ve seen this quarter and in the fourth quarter. ","We said that we expect the expense growth to be higher in the second and third quarters because of the marketing numbers that Byron talked about. And that obviously then flows through to weaker margins in the second and third quarters, recovering in the fourth quarter for things that we know are coming, which is why we reaffirmed full year guidance. But there will be these variable and lumpy trends as we see the year play itself out. ","Operator","Ken Bruce, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, you may ask your question. ","Ken Bruce - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","My question is relatively simple. It may not be quite as simple of an answer, but I\u2019m hoping to get a little bit of perspective around the processed transactions. Just in terms of the percentage that has basically been migrating slowly higher, I was hoping you might be able to dimensionalize what is driving that share increase in terms of processed transactions, what are the contributors to that, and maybe what you think is a reasonable high end for processed transactions.","And then separately, if you would provide any color around the merchant relationships that you mentioned in your opening remarks, in terms of improving those relationships and what that might entail.","Byron Pollitt ","I think that\u2019s a pretty straightforward, simple question, on the processed transactions part, for sure. Two dimensions here. First of all, when you look at the relative growth rates between U.S. and international, the international is growing at a multiple of the U.S. growth rate. When you break down international, if you took a snapshot of our portfolio today, international for us is still largely a credit business. That\u2019s what got established first.","When you look at what\u2019s driving the transaction growth, it is very clearly debit and that is the huge opportunity that will drive international transaction growth for years to come. For us, debit is still in its infancy internationally relative to the United States.","Another dimension: in the United States, we process nearly 100% of our transactions. Outside of the United States, we can process anywhere from 90% to 0%. And so the opportunity for us to Visa process transactions is still a wide open field. And that, by the way, is particularly true in debit. So you will hear us talk a lot more about that in the quarters to come, because it\u2019s linked so directly to our growth opportunity.","Charlie Scharf ","And on the merchant question, we don\u2019t have anything that we want to talk publicly about now with any individual merchant, but as I said in the opening remarks, our goal is to provide the kinds of value-added services for merchants that we have done such a good job of providing to the issuing community for a long period of time. And we\u2019re in the process of having discussions, and when we have specifics to talk about, we\u2019ll talk about them.","Operator","[Operator instructions.] And the next one will come from Smitti Srethapramote, Morgan Stanley. ","Smittipon Srethapramote - Morgan Stanley","Can you please give us an update on your government relations efforts in emerging markets to increase the electronification of payments?","Charlie Scharf ","First of all, government relations for us, especially when you get outside of the developed world, is not a traditional government relations function. It\u2019s not a staff function that sits to the side and just goes around and has lobbying types of conversations. In the emerging markets, government relations is a business for us, because the government is our partner in helping electronify the payment systems in these particular markets.","Very often, when the government leads with trying to move their transactions to the electronic payment systems, that then can help drive the market. That\u2019s what we see in places like Rwanda and other places, which are really emerging.","And so when you look across the world, we think of the government as a client and a partner to helping build a business which is good for them. And the reason why it\u2019s good for them is it\u2019s ultimately good for all of their participants, whether it\u2019s the merchants or the individuals, and obviously we and our competitors will benefit from that, as cash exits society.","Byron Pollitt ","If I were to reflect back to when we went public in 2008, and if you were to have asked that question, I don\u2019t think anyone would have thought to ask that question. But today, governments of emerging markets have gotten a lot more interested and pay a lot more attention to electronic forms of payment. They\u2019re interested in it from a very self-serving standpoint in that you can\u2019t tax what you can\u2019t see, but they\u2019re also very focused on this is a way of providing, in Charlie\u2019s words, a safer, more secure and sound financial system for their citizens. ","And so there\u2019s a natural tendency to want to regulate, and our involvement now is very, very early contact with a broad range of emerging market governments, because they can be very well intentioned but also unenlightened in regard to how to think about regulation, and what the impacts are. ","And so we have got government relations people stationed all over the world, particularly in emerging markets, and their role is largely educational, so that governments that have a legitimate interest in regulating this part of their monetary system can do so understanding how best to provide safety, security, and soundness and to allow the market to operate so that they get the kind of penetration of electronic payments, which will grow and be healthy. ","And we\u2019ve been exceptionally pleased with the reception of most governments to talking with us and partnering with us to develop their electronic payment systems in a way that\u2019s healthy and I think will provide a good foundation for growth to come. ","Operator","Glenn Greene of Oppenheimer, you may ask your question.","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer ","As you renewed your Chase deal, I think the implication, or you suggested that you\u2019d pick up some incremental volume. I was curious if you\u2019ve started to see that, and should we be thinking about that as sort of being reflected in the run rate or something that we could expect going forward throughout calendar \u201914 as sort of incremental volume? And then just a quick number question, in terms of where are you in terms of V.me merchants signed.","Byron Pollitt ","On Chase, we do expect to see incremental volume during the course of the year. We expect some to begin this quarter, not material, and we expect it to build through the course of fiscal year \u201914. In our guidance, that incremental is contemplated, but it will be more second half weighted, clearly, than first half.","Charlie Scharf ","And on V.me merchants, I don\u2019t have the updated number here, to be honest with you. ","Glenn Greene - Oppenheimer ","Do we sort of get a step function increase at some point during this year, or is it sort of gradual, test mode, kind of figuring it out?","Charlie Scharf ","We\u2019ll be in a position to answer that question in another month or two, because we\u2019ve just rolled out the new platform that I described. And we\u2019ll start to see the effect of it, and have a better understanding of what it means for the ramp up.","Operator","Next we have Chris Brendler of Stifel.","Chris Brendler - Stifel Nicolaus ","I have two questions that I probably won\u2019t get a lot of detail on, so hopefully it won\u2019t take too long. One is Visa Europe, anything you can say additionally about Visa Europe and what potentially that would look like if it could come back to you? Any progress there? Any updates? ","And then similarly, on the Judge Leon case and the appeal, obviously you can\u2019t give us too much there, but I was wondering if there was any way you could, on a timeline, it sounded like from that hearing that the timeline could be shorter than I think the original estimates that were somewhere around a year. Is it possible we could hear something from the three judge appeal panel in the next couple of months? ","Charlie Scharf ","Nothing different to talk about on Visa Europe. Otherwise, I would have mentioned it in my opening remarks. And on timing, we don\u2019t know, on the appeal.","Jack Carsky ","And in terms of the last question, we\u2019ve got the numbers. We have over 300 signed, and 80 are currently live, on the V.me.","Operator","Next we have a question from Glenn Fodor of Autonomous.","Glenn Fodor - Autonomous Research ","Byron, just wanted to peel back your comments on emerging markets a little bit more. Can you give us a rough sense of what percent of your volumes come from emerging markets? And then within that volume category, can you give us a range of what type of multiple to your overall volume growth that this is growing? Is it three times as fast, or four times?","Byron Pollitt ","I don\u2019t actually have those statistics at my command. The emerging markets, these growth rates are midteens and better. ","Charlie Scharf ","And depending on the market, it could be substantially better than that.","Byron Pollitt ","Yes, and could be substantially better. And these growth rates, we have a portfolio. So even though some of these have had currency issues in terms of weakening currencies, these growth rates have held pretty well even where there has been weaker currencies. Government intervention, where they\u2019re trying to limit the outbound, can have an effect. You\u2019re seeing that in Brazil today. Likely to see it in Argentina, Venezuela, countries where there have been more severe locations. But the durability of the growing cross-border in emerging markets has been quite resilient.","Operator","Your last question will come from Andrew Jeffrey of SunTrust.","Andrew Jeffrey - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey ","Quick question on the cybersource transaction growth, which decelerated in the first fiscal quarter. Any commentary just broadly around that, and implications or read throughs to overall ecommerce volume?","Byron Pollitt ","Let me separate the two. On ecommerce volume, this was a fantastic holiday spend season for ecommerce. And the trend in growth and ecom is very, very healthy. And so the downshift a bit in the growth in cybersource has nothing to do with the underlying growth in ecommerce.","What I would say the cybersource established an early significant position as a gateway in what has become a much more competitive space. And I think what we\u2019re going to find in the next few quarters is that we\u2019re going to need to up our game and that this space is just going to be more competitively intense than it has been in the past couple of years. And that is a direct testament to how attractive the growth prospects are for ecom, which is the one channel that is particularly suited for electronic payments.","Jack Carsky ","And with that, we want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And as always, if you have any follow up questions, please feel free to give either Victoria or myself a call. Thanks. "]}}
